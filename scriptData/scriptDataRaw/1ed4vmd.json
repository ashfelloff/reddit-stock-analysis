But I need to make sure I'm getting a steady and safe stream of baseline income from my investments to take care of fixed expenses.\n\nWhat do you think of the strategy of selecting say, 10 of the top dividend stocks that are safe (good companies) and have a good track record on keeping or raising their dividends. For example, Verizon, Enterprise Products Partners, KMI, and others that pay upward of 6% or higher on dividends. I wouldn't distribute the 300k evenly across the 10 (or so) dividend stocks, but I would diversify to a great extent to protect myself from a company going under. That way, I'm getting high dividend returns even if the market takes a downturn (and hoping companies don't lower their dividends if that happens).\n\nI know it's not a 100% safe strategy, but what do you think? Bonds at 4-5% is a bit too low if I can make 6-7% or higher on dividend stocks and get some protection against a potential market downturn.\n\nI'd appreciate anyone's thoughts, thanks!\n\n**UPDATE:** Thank you for all of your thoughts! I think what I may end up doing is an ETF like VOO or VTI, and as it makes money, secure my profits so that when the market takes a downturn I've built up some profit to keep the steady stream of income coming in. So, every time VOO makes me say 5k, I pull that out and put it in a money market account. \"Skim off the top\" to keep from market downturns forcing me to potentially dig into the principal. Anyone like that idea? Stock market returns are just too high to not put the 300k there. So long as I build up a security blanket against downturns, putting the 300k in the S&P seems the best choice and taking profits regularly. And if ever I don't need the money and my side job is enough, I'll just leave the 300k in there. VOO has some risk, but is safe long term, just have to weather the valleys as they come.  \n\nD.",

      "body": "I made this post a couple of years ago and I think it pertains to your question.\nThe importance of dividend increases\n\nLet’s say you invest $10,000 in a stock that pays a 6% yield but does not grow the dividend.\n\nIf the stock appreciates at a pace  with the historical average of the S&P 500, and if you reinvest the dividend for 10 years, you’ll have $32,303 after 10 years, $52,878 after 15 years and $83,372 after 20 years.\n\nFurthermore, after 10 years, you’ll collect $904. After 15 years, $1,026. And you’ll receive $1,120 after 20 years.\n\nNow, what happens if we start off with a lower 4% dividend yield, but that dividend grows 8% per year?\n\nAfter 10 years, the nest egg will be slightly lower at $31,241. You’ll have more at 15 and 20 years than you did with the flat 6% yielder. Your totals will be $55,432 and $98,615, respectively.\n\nPerhaps more importantly for the investor who starts collecting the income at 10 years, the dividend raiser generates $1,158 - substantially more than the $904 in the earlier example.\n\nAfter 15 years, the income rises to $2,081. If you let the money compound for 20 years and then begin receiving the dividend checks, you’ll take home $3,750 - more than three times the amount with the higher starting, but static, yield.\n\nHow about if you need the income today and don’t have time to reinvest the dividend and let it compound?\n\nA $10,000 investment in a stock that yields 6% and doesn’t grow its dividend will generate $600 in income every year.\n\nThe 4% yield that grows by 8% every year starts off paying you $400 per year.\n\nBy year seven, you’ll be making $634 - more than the 6%-yielding stock.\n\nAt year 10, you’ll collect $799 - 33% more than the $600 paid by the 6%-yielding stock.\n\nAfter 15 years, you’ll be collecting just about double the amount of the other stock with $1,174, and five years after that, your income will be $1,726 - nearly three times the amount of the 6% stock.\n\nThis is a perfect illustration of why I strongly recommend dividend raisers for long-term investors. This is also how we get yields to double digits in ten years.",
