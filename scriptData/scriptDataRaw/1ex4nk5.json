      "body": "NVMI is headquartered in Rehovat, Israel, which was built on the depopulated ruins of the ancient village of Zernuqa. It's like buying a company built on a Native American burial ground. Your calls will be cursed.\n\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarnuqa\n\n\n>Zarnuqa was depopulated on 27–28 May by the Givati Brigade during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. One account in Al HaMishmar described how a soldier fired with a Sten gun at three people (one old man, old woman and a child) and how the villagers were taken out from the houses and had to stay in the sun, in hunger and thirst, until they surrendered the weapons they claimed they did not have. They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors. The Zarnuqa villagers saw their village being ransacked by Jewish soldiers and nearby settlers.

They were then expelled towards Yibna. In total, six died and 22 were taken prisoners. The day after, the inhabitants returned and recounted that the Yibna villagers saw them as traitors.
