Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.\n\nI can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.\n\nI buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.\n\nI started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.\n\nAnyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.\n\nLast Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.\n\nThe next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.\n\nAs it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!\n\nI contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.\n\nMost buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.\n\nSellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.\n\nFor 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.\n\nI have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?\n\nAnd accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.\n\nI can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.\n\nDon't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.\n\nThe moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.\n\nEtsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",
