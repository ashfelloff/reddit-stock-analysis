I'll just look at the call chain and figure out how many months out I need to go to get something worth my time and sell a 125. If I'm looking to get off something just to sell it rather than use a limit order I will sell a weekly atm call. I get a little premium and if they take the shares, that's fine, if it expires I'll just sell another one. Using options in this fashion is a great way to collect extra money. So, whatever you want to sell those shares for, look how far out you have to go to get some reasonable money for it and write them. There's nothing wrong with selling three, six, 12 months out if you bake in and expected return because if you get it, cool let them have it, if you don't you keep the premium",

I&#39;ll just look at the call chain and figure out how many months out I need to go to get something worth my time and sell a 125. If I&#39;m looking to get off something just to sell it rather than use a limit order I will sell a weekly atm call. I get a little premium and if they take the shares, that&#39;s fine, if it expires I&#39;ll just sell another one. Using options in this fashion is a great way to collect extra money. So, whatever you want to sell those shares for, look how far out you have to go to get some reasonable money for it and write them. There&#39;s nothing wrong with selling three, six, 12 months out if you bake in and expected return because if you get it, cool let them have it, if you don&#39;t you keep the premium</p>\n</div>",
