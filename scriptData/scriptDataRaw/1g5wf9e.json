I am worried that mainly owning American stocks and ETFs puts me at a massive risk in case of a downturn. Especially considering the P/E ratios of American stocks are much higher than those of their European counterparts at the moment.\n\nWould you consider buying some European (mainly Dutch, Danish and so) stocks in order to reduce your exposure to a potential heavy drop in American stocks? Or do you think in such scenario European stocks would drop just as much? In that case, the (expected) lower gains of European markets up to that point would mean owning them was not worth it.\n\nThank you very much in advance!",
