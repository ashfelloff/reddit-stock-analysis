But IMO, I think there eventually needs to be some kind of a discussion among law makers about social media influencers, and how they can move certain stocks with malicious intent if they want to (particularly micro & small cap stocks).\n\nIf certain people really wanted to make a quick buck in a pump and dump they've already shown that *if they wanted to*, all they need to do is make a few tweets about a stock that they don't even believe in, and then cash out with a sweet 50%+ gain in a single day. (Note: I'm not saying anyone has done this with the recent meme rallies, I'm saying that some people 100% could do this if they wanted to)\n\nI'm not talking about just one person with the recent meme stock rally. A certain controversial stock picking youtuber who's often mocked for his many bad picks also has (at or least had at one point) the power to move small & micro cap stocks a good bit to.
