The stock has more than doubled its value this year, bringing Cava’s market cap up to about $11.6 billion, as of Thursday’s close.\n\nHere’s what the company reported for the quarter ended July 14 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 17 cents vs. 13 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $233 million vs. $220 million expected\n\nThe Mediterranean restaurant chain reported fiscal second-quarter net income of $19.7 million, or 17 cents per share, up from $6.5 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nNet sales climbed 35% to $233 million. The company’s same-store sales rose 14.4%, topping StreetAccount estimates of 7.9%.\n\nWhile many other restaurant companies have reported declines in visits as consumers pull back their spending, Cava said its traffic grew 9.5% in the quarter. Cava CEO and co-founder Brett Schulman credited the chain’s new grilled steak option as one reason why customers kept coming to its restaurants during the quarter.\n\nCava opened 18 net new locations during the quarter, bringing its total footprint up to 341 restaurants.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, Cava now expects same-store sales growth of 8.5% to 9.5%, up from its prior range of 4.5% to 6.5%. The company is also projecting that it will open 54 to 57 new locations this year, up from its previous forecast of 50 to 54 restaurants.\n\nCava also expects to report adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $109 million to $114 million. Previously, it was projecting adjusted EBITDA of $100 million to $105 million for the fiscal year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/cava-group-cava-earnings-q2-2024.html",
