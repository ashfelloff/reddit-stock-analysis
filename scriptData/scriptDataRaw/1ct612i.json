  "selftext": "Why Cannabis Has The Best \"Meme Stock\"\n\nHello fellow regards, its 1:50 AM im high, and im ready to give my first brief DD ever into the cannabis sector. I've been studying the cannabis sector since November, and i would like to give a brief DD on my thoughts. I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL, JUST A DUDE WHOS TIRED AND REALLY LIKES WEED. This saying I might be wrong on some points and this is only my opinion at 2AM. I might try to do another post after more research with everyone's help. if you have any opinions or find any information please leave a comment and lets get high together.\n\n2019-2021: We already know the sector has tanked since 2021 and Canada's announcement into the industry. As some like INCR might have lost momentum from terrorist attacks in Isreal, others like SNDL had a \"meme\" approach into the U.S Cannabis Debt (SunSteam I believe its called). The important thing is companies overproduced, lost their competitive advantages, and had horrible timing. Whatever the various reasons are, almost the entire sector has taken a hit. Now when you bring up investing to the company, everyone will say \"its to risky and has no moat\" and yes this is true...or is it?\n\n2023-2024: As vaporizers have had a dominating approach into the market, cannabis \"carts\" are exposing the younger generations to an easier, \"odorless\", and convenient way to expose themselves to THC. Think as them as a gateway into the industry, and just like a Juul it exposes new audiences into the market and could create long term relationships. Not only has cannabis found new ways to be innovative, but the industry has seen an unreal amount of new consumers the past decade. And this will only keep growing as we keep removing world wide restrictions overtime like Germany.\n\nPast 6 Months: A new wave of young investors are ready to begin their journeys, now that trading is easier then ever. More then likely they're going to consider cheap stocks as they get high \\*cough cannabis\\*. Now im being bias, but coming from this generation shit feels high and im broke. Why would I invest $10 into META right now compared to SNDL? Theirs no doubt the sector has been seeing some of its most profit in years, And as the FDA rescheduling comes into play more then likely by this summer, its only a matter of time until the sector moons.\n\nThe Future: Im not a physic but I do have some judgements and opinions about the future of the cannabis sector. Firstly, long or short term many etfs like MSOS or YOLO look incredibly great right now. It'd be safer to play ETF's in the sector for long term investments. This is because of the incredibly small amount of tradable stocks in the sector. Few if any cannabis stocks are American companies, with the majority being Canadian or in the EU. With the amount of competition in the sector, there is a possibility we could see more American cannabis stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange. Competition is already a killing factor within the industry, a flood of American ipo's could cause more viability in the market, and potential damage or benefit certain stocks.\n\nFinal Thoughts: With all this said, I completely understand the fear and hesitance people get when considering investing into the sector. There are many many risky factors, past issues, and future threats. But do NOT let that discourage you from investing just $5 long term. The sector is comparably undervalued compared to how overvalued CGC and Aurora was in 2021. For short term people are anticipating for the FDA reschedule, this would seriously open many doors and more profitable opportunities for the sector. Now the competition needs to be controlled for federal distribution and other meanings. The sector will only gain more popularity overtime=more profit.\n\nBest ETF's: MSOS, CNBS, YOLO, TOKE\n\nSafest As of Rn: GTLS, MSOS, SNDL,\n\nMy Favorite: SNDL. MSOS, CGC, CRON, TLRY\n\nEyeball: ACB, INCR (reddit wont let me post the others to prevent \"pump and dumps\" but look into hair testing, Colorado, and more stocks east)\n\nCannabis Is The Best Meme Sector, That Will Make Our Fellow Stoner Regards Even Higher :)\n\nSmall Sources: [https://flowhub.imgix.net/Resources/marijuana-usage-among-u.s.-adults-1969-2023.png](https://flowhub.imgix.net/Resources/marijuana-usage-among-u.s.-adults-1969-2023.png)\n\n[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunstream-usa-poised-to-acquire-cannabis-assets-302134053.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sunstream-usa-poised-to-acquire-cannabis-assets-302134053.html)\n\nHope I did this right!",
