(A teaser gives you the actual line plus 6 points in your favor) (In some cases I also use alternate lines or alternate stats like if a rcvr is set for 38 yards maybe I will buy over 25.5 yards and parlay that with a money line college football favorite anything to get close to somewhere between even money to -120ish.)\n\nSo for example this past week, I bet on:\n\nRams +3.5\nChargers +4\nWashington -5\nChiefs +3.5\nEagles +2.5\nSeattle and ATL over 41.5\nLions +8\nJaguars +0.5\nBroncos/saints over 32.5\n(I had detr/min over total but I forgot the number)\nUGA +9.5\nNotre dame -7.5\nBYU - 2\nOregon total under 66\n\nAlot of those I would have lost with the normal line. But because I teased it I got a lot of wins that could have been losers with a single -110 side or total \n\n(And I bet a few others - those are the ones I remember off top of my head and a quick look at my paper). I made like 50+ different two team teaser's in a round robin style mix of all these different bets. Takes me a few hours to mix around all the bets.....but I don't really do it straight for two hours cause i don't really have an excel doc to mix them properly - I just do it based on which games are starting soon. Put in a couple bets. Watch a game for a bit do a couple more. Watch a bit do a few more. Etc. it's part of my afternoon routine both Saturday and Sunday. And I put in a few bets through out the week whenever I hear news that says my opinion on a game I will buy 4-5 teasers on that particular game. I write them all down and keep track on paper so I don't end up with too many copies of the same bet and risk too much on variance.\n\nMost folks say - it's dumb to play a teaser cause you need two things to happen - but when I run 50+ of them - I have like 3-4 versions of each bet so every one that misses I lose 3-4 bets. Everyone that wins I win 3-4 bets. \n\nBut no one realizes how often the book makers are right on. You could literally bet every game. Bet both sides of every NFL game. Just the spread +6 (or some totals if you feel it's perfect)\n\nLast night if you bet a teaser on bucks and ravens - you had buccs +10.5 and ravens +1.5 results - ravens won by 10. You win both bets. \n\nIf you had a teaser on chargers/Cardinals you had chargers + 4 or Cardinals +8 results - Cardinals won by 2. You win both bets. \n\nCause the odds makers get it pretty close almost Everytime.(But not Everytime of course)\n\nAnd if you have +6 points in your advantage you would probably come out ahead every week. Add in there a little bit of sports knowledge and intuition to avoid a few losers and you can be profitable.\n\nSometimes if a teaser would result in landing on a key number I will buy +6.5 or +7 instead of +6. (Like if real line is -3... +6 would give you +3. I need plus 3.5 for it to be a profitable play cause so many games are won by exactly 3 points) \n\nI had two weekends last year where I lost money. The other 16-17 weeks I was plus money. \n\nThis year I am plus money on 6 of 7 weeks and the week I lost was because I bet too much on the Padres (baseball) as a gut feeling. Wasn't related to football at all. If I stick to my teasers game I do pretty well.\n\nI don't need subscribers. In fact I don't really enjoy sharing my complicated ass system because if the books saw thousands of people doing my system they might shut it down somehow or make teasers -150 instead of -120 or minus -130.",

(I bet almost all the NFL games and a handful of NCAA football on teasers where you get extra points) and I go like \n\n26 wins 3 losses \n\n19 wins 2 losses\n\n20 wins 4 losses.\n\n The last few weeks have been amazing - I been doing that process for years and I make a little money every football season haven't had a losing season since I learned this system in 2019.\n\nI have no clue what the stock market will do. I just buy the sp500 and total market index (and a little QQQ) and pray it goes up over time. The last few years have been amazing - this system is also working for me.
