              "body": "The research I've done points to Kohler being the preferred brand of installers that have done multiple brands, but you have to maintain them with a $500/yr service contract.  In 10 years you'll have paid another $5000 for the generator.  Those generators seem to last 20 years+ if they're maintained, however.  \n\nI like the Champion standby units because they have these big gull-wing doors so everything should be easy to service.  The downside is there are no dealers in my area so I'm 100% on my own when it comes to servicing and maintaining it.  However, allegedly their phone support is pretty good, and I'm comfortable doing the service and any troubleshooting that may need to be done.  A minor concern would be that a discerning future home buyer may not see the generator as a value add since there's no dealer to call to service it.\n\nOther Champion notables:\n\n- warranty is 10 years vs 5 with both Generac and Kohler.  \n- 24V starter will start the engine down to at least -22F without an additional heater \n- A bit quieter than the other manufacturers\n- I've seen several reviews from folks claiming their electricians said the Champion was by far the easiest to install generator they've done and it was their first time doing one.\n\n\nThe last option is Cummins.  Unfortunately they don't use Cummins engines in the residential air cooled units, they use Briggs and Stratton, but they are allegedly very well made and a solid generator.  My issue with them is the complexity of service. It's not a problem if you intend to use a service contract and have a good dealer, but if you want to service it yourself, they're allegedly annoying to work on, eg there's like 17 screws just to get the covers off.",

In 10 years you&#39;ll have paid another $5000 for the generator.  Those generators seem to last 20 years+ if they&#39;re maintained, however.  </p>\n\n<p>I like the Champion standby units because they have these big gull-wing doors so everything should be easy to service.  The downside is there are no dealers in my area so I&#39;m 100% on my own when it comes to servicing and maintaining it.  However, allegedly their phone support is pretty good, and I&#39;m comfortable doing the service and any troubleshooting that may need to be done.  A minor concern would be that a discerning future home buyer may not see the generator as a value add since there&#39;s no dealer to call to service it.</p>\n\n<p>Other Champion notables:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>warranty is 10 years vs 5 with both Generac and Kohler.<br/></li>\n<li>24V starter will start the engine down to at least -22F without an additional heater </li>\n<li>A bit quieter than the other manufacturers</li>\n<li>I&#39;ve seen several reviews from folks claiming their electricians said the Champion was by far the easiest to install generator they&#39;ve done and it was their first time doing one.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The last option is Cummins.  Unfortunately they don&#39;t use Cummins engines in the residential air cooled units, they use Briggs and Stratton, but they are allegedly very well made and a solid generator.  My issue with them is the complexity of service. It&#39;s not a problem if you intend to use a service contract and have a good dealer, but if you want to service it yourself, they&#39;re allegedly annoying to work on, eg there&#39;s like 17 screws just to get the covers off.</p>\n</div>",
