  "selftext": "Alphabet will excel in the AI and automation sectors, but the resulting industry shift will be a net loss for the M7 company as AI eats into its search revenue.\n\nWith the \"Attention is all you need\" paper Alphabet has already etched itself into AI history. Its cloud computing arm is keeping up with AWS and Azure. Waymo threatens to eat Tesla's lunch. Its TPU may very well knock Nvidia off its perch.\n\nBut even if all that happens, it won't make up for the losses to its search business when AI chatbots take over many of the functions of search. Despite all the efforts into diversification, more than half of Alphabet's revenue still comes from search. So if people turn to Chat-GPT instead of Google as the primary web surfing tool, Alphabet will take a big hit to its most important segment. If GPT can give me the results I want, plus summaries and links and review aggregates, all on voice command, why would I ever need to go on Google and get exposed to its sponsored results? The OAI partnership with Apple may signal the beginning of this shift.\n\nMuch of Alphabet's valuation comes from its ridiculous dominance in search. All of its other ventures face stiff competition from other M7 companies and OAI, and I have a hard time believing Alphabet will crush them the way it crushed Yahoo.\n\nUltimately, Alphabet stands to lose heavily early in the AI revolution. The company will survive, but without a massive moat in a crucial industry, it may go the way of Netflix and lose its elite status among the likes of META, MSFT, and NVDA.",

Google (and everyone else in the space) simply can&#39;t get away with going about enshitification of their AI products to serve sponsored links/ads without risking their market share being stolen by competitors who don&#39;t compromise the quality of their product to serve ads. Google Search would have never taken off into it&#39;s dominant position it has today if it tried serving nearly an entire first page of just sponsored links back in the early days like it does now.</p>\n\n<p>No matter who wins that market we&#39;re still going to be in the early stages for probably at least 5 years where people are willing to burn tons of money to 1) grab more market share, and 2) make a better product so that they can grab more market share.</p>\n\n<p>And lets not pretend that Google is exactly in the lead at the moment in this segment. ChatGPT is the closest thing a verb for using AI in place of searches. And Co-Pilot is literally built into Edge &amp; Windows 11 now.</p>\n</div>",

It's probably going to be a handful of smaller companies that really make useful software, there are going to be a couple of leaders.

You made some money on that, at least if you sold it by 1999. Microsoft was obvious by the mid-90s, the funny thing about that one is you made some money going into 1999 but if you had held almost anyone would have been shaken out by 2009. Like you look at that chart, think of all those emotions. But here we are today, you made a killing. So whatever is going to work in AI, Google, who knows who. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to really logically be able to map that out where you&#39;re going to get the best returns. It&#39;s probably going to be a handful of smaller companies that really make useful software, there are going to be a couple of leaders. If you look at what&#39;s really working right now it&#39;s infrastructure. ASML, KLAC, those two are necessary, TSM, production, probably something there. But the software side and the small business side. Who knows? </p>\n\n<p>But it&#39;s a question that is staying in the front of my mind over the next few years. There are going to be some bangers</p>\n</div>",
