      "body": "Hi everyone,\n\nA major event happened Friday with important instant (in upcoming high season in the uranium sector) impact on the uranium market:\n\nOn Friday Kazatomprom announced \\~17% cut in the previously hoped uranium production 2025 from Kazakhstan + hinting on additional cuts for 2026 and beyond, because they announced they would ask the government to reduce existing subsoil use agreements of a couple existing uranium mines, meaning reducing the annual production range of those mines.\n\n**Problem is that:**\n\na) Kazakhstan is the Saudi-Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge.\n\nb) The production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\n**All the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium)**. Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\n\nc) The biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nImportant to know here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\nConclusion:\n\nKazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nBefore the announcement of Kazakhstan on Friday, the global uranium supply problem already looked like this:\n\nHere on page 10 you get an idea of the global uranium supply problem: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here you are not subjected to mining related risks.\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore\n\nUranium sector ETF's:\n\n* Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector\n* Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector\n\nWe are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Next week we will gradually enter the high season again\n\nIn the low season in the uranium sector the activity in the uranium spotmarket is reduced to a minimum which reduces the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket and the uranium spotprice goes back to the LT uranium price.\n\nIn the high season with an uranium sector being a sellers market (a market where the sellers have the negotiation power) the activity in the uranium spotmarket increases significantly which significantly increases the upward pressure in the uranium spotmarket.\n\nNote: I post this now (at the very end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector.\n\n**This isn't financial advice.
