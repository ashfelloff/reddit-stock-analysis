Some volatility around whether they can continue selling GLP-1, but they haven’t actually had a Q report with the sales added and still had 70%+ growth so keeping GLP is just a cherry on top tho most people probably don’t realize that and it will likely dip if they lose access to GLPs. \n\n\n\n\nRMAX: I’m really thinking more a 5x, but if they kick in the dividend again and I keep the low cost basis then the dividend returns will be huge. \n\n\n\n\nRDW: still researching, but strong analayst expectations and micro cap space stock. I like what I see so far and might have some potential with contracts.",
