Some like JPM, GS, BAC, and DAL have proven they are not \"too big to succeed\" while others like C, WFC, BA, INTC, big3autos, and some Airlines are.\n\n>How many of you actually know what a real bear market looks like? \n\nThere's no non-real bear market. 2022 was a real bear market and so was 2020.\n\nThe \"REAL\" you are trying to get at isn't the \"market\" but **REAL LIFE** real. That's what defines the GFC. Folks lost their jobs, folks lost their homes, every company fell, 100year+ companies in the S&P500 when to 0, and there were no fucking jobs so you had no fucking pay. Crime goes up be it \"urban demographic\" robbing jewelry store, house wives pulling credit card fraud to make end meet, or just petty shoplifting theft. It's not that your neighbor is unemployed but YOU are unemployed. \n\nThere ain't no fucking pay rises but pay cuts IF YOU ARE LUCKY. Many will see unemployment, pay declines, pension cuts, and/or see their stocks drop if not got to 0. If you run a business then you struggle to make sales, fire folks to make ends meet, pickup and stack more of the work upon yourself to make bills, and most likely still see the business you put your time/money/life into die. \n\nMeanwhile you watch Reganomics BS with government bailing out megacorps while letting people lose their fucking homes, savings, assets, cars, and shirts. Foreclosures/evictions, folks hitting the street, instability as main street revolts against wall street (remember [folks actually did it in person and not for the money back in the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street)), and you see the general rot around you. \n\nThere wasn't no fucking \"lel let's print money for everyone\" with PPP, EIDL, grants, eviction protection, foreclosure protection, free lunches, food banks, free phones/internets/ipads/laptops/etcetc, free utilities, rent paid for you, extended + boosted unemployment, stimmy check upon stimmy check, and infinite 0% rates where everyone and their cat could borrow.\n\nForget about getting paid or rises let alone this whole \"LOL I QUIT AND I'LL HAVE ANOTHER JOB WITH +20% WAGE INCREASE IN BY 1PM AFTERNOON!\" shit that happened in 2020-2024. Shit wasn't so bad that top 100 Uni grads where doing unpaid internships they were ***PAYING FOR THE \"\"\"PRIVILAGE\"\"\" TO WORK UNPAID INTERNSHIPS FOR THE \"\"\"EXPERIENCE\"\"\" IN HOPES OF LANDING AN UNPAID INTERNSHIPT THAT WOULD LEAD TO A JOB***. [The ones that \"made it\" would be hated by everyone along with their own mom for being a filthy fucking banker, work 80hrs a week, and then fucking die making like 50K or some shit](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/22/moritz-erhardt-merrill-lynch-intern-dead-inquest) This was in 2013 btw. Already WAY better than in 2008-2012 imo.\n\n\n\nOh and like 10-15 years later you have to listen to fucking zoomies with [their 50K jobs without a high school degree](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/fast-food-chain-offers-teen-managers-living-wage-to-offset-worker-shortage) acting like you lucked the fuck out because you \"could have bought the dip\" without realizing you wouldn't even have a fucking job let alone getting paid, go through years of stagnant wages, and get hit with a \"once-in-a-century\" pandemic followed by a \"once-in-a-century\" coup before a \"once-in-a-century\" war in Europe with as side of \"once-in-a-century\" unseen inflation plus a \"once-in-a-century\" year where 60/40 both gets BTFO  where a \"once-in-a-century\" housing shortage also hits before a \"once-in-a-century\" rapid rate hike locks you out of housing market but somehow doesn't decrease home price all during your marriage seeking and family formation years.",

Some like JPM, GS, BAC, and DAL have proven they are not &quot;too big to succeed&quot; while others like C, WFC, BA, INTC, big3autos, and some Airlines are.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>How many of you actually know what a real bear market looks like? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There&#39;s no non-real bear market. 2022 was a real bear market and so was 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The &quot;REAL&quot; you are trying to get at isn&#39;t the &quot;market&quot; but <strong>REAL LIFE</strong> real. That&#39;s what defines the GFC. Folks lost their jobs, folks lost their homes, every company fell, 100year+ companies in the S&amp;P500 when to 0, and there were no fucking jobs so you had no fucking pay. Crime goes up be it &quot;urban demographic&quot; robbing jewelry store, house wives pulling credit card fraud to make end meet, or just petty shoplifting theft. It&#39;s not that your neighbor is unemployed but YOU are unemployed. </p>\n\n<p>There ain&#39;t no fucking pay rises but pay cuts IF YOU ARE LUCKY. Many will see unemployment, pay declines, pension cuts, and/or see their stocks drop if not got to 0. If you run a business then you struggle to make sales, fire folks to make ends meet, pickup and stack more of the work upon yourself to make bills, and most likely still see the business you put your time/money/life into die. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile you watch Reganomics BS with government bailing out megacorps while letting people lose their fucking homes, savings, assets, cars, and shirts. Foreclosures/evictions, folks hitting the street, instability as main street revolts against wall street (remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street\">folks actually did it in person and not for the money back in the day</a>), and you see the general rot around you. </p>\n\n<p>There wasn&#39;t no fucking &quot;lel let&#39;s print money for everyone&quot; with PPP, EIDL, grants, eviction protection, foreclosure protection, free lunches, food banks, free phones/internets/ipads/laptops/etcetc, free utilities, rent paid for you, extended + boosted unemployment, stimmy check upon stimmy check, and infinite 0% rates where everyone and their cat could borrow.</p>\n\n<p>Forget about getting paid or rises let alone this whole &quot;LOL I QUIT AND I&#39;LL HAVE ANOTHER JOB WITH +20% WAGE INCREASE IN BY 1PM AFTERNOON!&quot; shit that happened in 2020-2024. Shit wasn&#39;t so bad that top 100 Uni grads where doing unpaid internships they were <strong><em>PAYING FOR THE &quot;&quot;&quot;PRIVILAGE&quot;&quot;&quot; TO WORK UNPAID INTERNSHIPS FOR THE &quot;&quot;&quot;EXPERIENCE&quot;&quot;&quot; IN HOPES OF LANDING AN UNPAID INTERNSHIPT THAT WOULD LEAD TO A JOB</em></strong>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/22/moritz-erhardt-merrill-lynch-intern-dead-inquest\">The ones that &quot;made it&quot; would be hated by everyone along with their own mom for being a filthy fucking banker, work 80hrs a week, and then fucking die making like 50K or some shit</a> This was in 2013 btw.

And thats mostly because of the Fed Res printing money (that taxpayers don&#39;t have) to keep things alive.</p>\n</div>",

Well I sold along the way up didn't nail the top but holy shit I could not have asked for easier gains in a few hours.\n\nPredicting the future is hard, like me telling you what date it's going to happen.\n\nHowever it is not hard to time it *as it is happening*.  The key is to be ready for it, not to predict exactly what day it happens.\n\nThe numbers are impossible to know, but there is actually a magic number at which IF the market falls below - it is essentially a mathematical guarantee to fall lower.\n\nTo oversimplify it: my strategy is to keep an eye on the gamma levels each day for the major stocks and indexes, noting at which point the gamma goes negative.\n\nMany of us that day trade do this daily already.
