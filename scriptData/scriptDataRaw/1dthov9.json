This graph breaks down at a company level what their total production is vs. their marginal cost. It's a bit tricky, so let's explain further.\n\nSuppose we pick the 90th percentile of production, as in, move along the x-axis until you have reached 90% of the current global production. Now move upward to the height of the bar. This is your 90th percentile marginal cost of $240. For any of the producers to the left, it costs them $240 or less to produce the *next* ton of coal. Equivalently, for all producers to the right (the last 10% of production), it costs them more than $240 for the *next* ton of coal. \n\nUsing the 75th percentile and its height of $215, this implies 25% of producers (the ones to the right) must incur costs of at least $215 per ton on new production.\n\nSo what does this imply if the price of met coal falls to say $215? It means 25% of producers find it unprofitable to increase their production anymore. Over time, labor costs + material inflation are pushing up the cost curve. E.g., if that $215 becomes $230, this means the price of met coal only has to $230 for 25% of producers to see new tons as unprofitable.\n\nSome of these company specific numbers are suspect, in my opinion, e.g., AMR. There is some details on which benchmarks are used by different companies, as well as seasonal or temporary discounts between different benchmarks. (If it costs you $100 to produce your coal but you sell it at a discount of $50 to the premium benchmark due to quality differences, your marginal cost is computed as $150. That way your marginal cost is comparable to the premium producers.) Also, keep in mind this is marginal costs, not total costs.\n\nWhat you want to do is pick companies that are low cost in production (to the left), realize prices as close to the premium benchmark as possible (not shown in this picture), are able to increase production (HCC and BTU, not AMR). Teck, for example, appears to be one of the lowest cost operators of met coal. Though some of these producers to the left aren't necessarily good investments because they aren't pure play met coal producers and also own various other assets. Some aren't even investible, e.g., Russian producers.",
