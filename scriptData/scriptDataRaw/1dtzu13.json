Representatives for Skydance and National Amusements, which is controlled by Redstone, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nNational Amusements, the Redstone family’s holding company, has referred the deal to the Paramount special committee, which is tasked with reviewing bids for the company, the Journal reported citing people familiar with the matter. Other interested bids included a joint effort from private equity firm Apollo and Sony, as well as a recent entreaty from Barry Diller, chairman of media conglomerate IAC as well as a former Paramount executive.\n\nRedstone abruptly ended negotiations between Skydance and National Amusements last month, just as the two sides were near the finish line. The winding deal process had already led to the departure of CEO Bob Bakish earlier this year, leaving in place a three-headed office of the CEO to run the company.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/paramount-shares-pop-9percent-on-news-of-preliminary-skydance-media-deal.html",
