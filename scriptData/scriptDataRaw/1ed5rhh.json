Despite the claim of the “10x Discovery Service” to identify putative future “ten-baggers,” none of the stocks approached this return. At 18-22% inflation since January 2021, three of the five non-loss positions lost ground or were stagnant in inflation-adjusted returns (Live Oak Bankshare 0.29% return, CrowdStrike 20.93%, and Walker Dunlop at 21.93%). Only two had positive inflation-adjusted returns: Bitcoin (99.95%) and Kinsale Capital Group (122.1%).\n\nThe Fool’s 30 recommendations were overwhelmingly cash flow negative stocks with poor fundamentals. Nonetheless, their various services doubled down, for instance recommending Fiverr (FVRR) three times at over $200 within a four-month period. It sells for $22.72 today. While these recommendations did not discover any 10x returns, they did discover 1/10th returns. Lemonade (LMND) was another repeat recommendation across multiple Motley Fool services. It has fallen over 80% and continues to lose over $200 million annually with no clear path to profitability.\n\nThe Motley Fool’s comparisons of their claimed returns to the S&P 500 are misleading, as their recommendations here are overwhelmingly high-risk tech companies with poor fundamentals. Even the NASDAQ is not a good comparison as the latter is weighted towards larger, more stable and financially successful firms. Such comparisons also do not consider the that the \"risk premium\" of the Fool's highly speculative recommendations demands significantly higher returns to justify the risk. The proper peer group is (mostly speculative, mostly tech) cash-flow negative small-cap growth stocks.\n\nThe results do not support the Motley Fool's claims of outperformance for their 10x Discovery service. Different dates can be referenced for stock prices during my subscription period (mid 2020-mid-2021) with substantially similar results.\n\nMany of these recommendations are recycled among their various services. It is also my belief from these data and personal experience as an investor who bought virtually every recommendation across multiple premium services of the Motley Fool that their other services also widely underperformed the market during this period.\n\nDisclosures: I have small open positions on Zoom (ZM) and Bitcoin initiated earlier this year, but none related to my prior Motley Fool membership. I have no plans to initiate a position in any of the securities listed above in the next month.",

Note here they had 3 recs with over 1000% return above the market (one had 4200%). \n\n\n\nThey have their returns right there on the front page of the services so it’s not like they’re misleading anyone who cares enough to look. They definitely have some bad picks, but some of their bad picks are so obvious like on 3/16/23 they re rec’d RBLX, I don’t care how hyped the company is it isn’t worth $26B+. They’ve been recing Roblox for years even when it was in the $50B+ range. It’s just not possible the company is worth 5-10X unity or 2X take two, both of which have multiple good games compared to one mediocre game. \n\n\nBut then they have recs like TTD which is a great company with great financials and history. You can follow their recs back to 2017 and see it’s been a 10 bagger and each re rec has beat the market. Over the long term it is a great winner. The way to use Motley Fool is weed out the obvious shit companies and buy the good ones. They went downhill once they started pushing 2 recs a month, there just around that many GREAT companies. So they shot themselves in the foot and have to rec meh companies to get the 2 recs a month. \n\n\n\nAlso 90% of their “articles” are literally written by AI called “Jester AI”, those are straight dogshit. Some of their analysts are also meh. But finding a few analysts you like and reading their articles or watching their YouTube videos is very much worth the $100/yr for SA. There is no free ticket in the stock market, but the Fool can be used to cut the work down in half. Still need to put in work to actually do well.",

I generally ignore the fact that they never sell, and focus on the fact that they will reiterate the companies that are doing well. Private company investing is even more extreme. Unfortunately every decade or two you get a brand new group of investors getting in because of FOMO and getting burned.\n\nI was interested in the market in the 90's but I was young so I had no money. I didn't start investing until the early 2000s, reading as much as I can. It was a small enough amount that trading fees were a significant thing. But I bought a few stocks, and some did extraordinarily well. The problem is that right after the dot com crash, value investing and downside protection became pervasive. I thought I had to diversify. So whenever my stocks did well, I would sell them and buy other stocks. Usually those other stocks did not do as well. Buying Apple in 2002 allowed me to buy equal positions (relative to the original position size) in 10 other companies. But I would have been better off holding Apple. And it's not like I needed the money, or that I was risk averse. It was just the thing to do.\n\nWhen I learned to hold my winners, and even add to my winners (by winners I mean both the stock performance and company performance), my investing results really took off. I don't hold them to the point of being 90% invested in one stock but I start with a small 2-3% position and see what happens. Sometimes those end up crashing and burning eventually, but the original investment generally does well. And when the thesis no longer holds, I'll sell or start to trim until it's clear that things aren't turning around, or I find something I like better.\n\nI do not just buy because a service told me to. I certainly hope that this 10x service did not say \"buy equal positions in all of these and just HODL\". It's a starting point. DMTK basically had no revenue or earnings. TEAM was already a large company. NVTA had revenues but were spending almost twice as much as they brought in, even at fairly large scale. It was unclear whether they would ever turn the corner (obviously not). SHOP had been growing like crazy for 5 years since its IPO but still had a large TAM. FLGT and ZM were very clearly COVID beneficiaries. ZM in particular over that period drastically changed from a business perspective. It was clear that they had saturated their market and would rely on growing in other ways. It really depends whether you are talking about early 2020 or late 2020. Those Chamath SPACs basically went public saying whatever they wanted and it was always a bad idea. It's not surprising that SOFI is the only one surviving and it still can't shake that stink.\n\nIt used to be that a couple lead investors at Motley Fool were really monitoring their choices. Now it seems like they're just relying on a bunch of \"analysts\" for ideas. Even in retrospect, of the 20 or so companies on that list that I've at least sort of dug into, I can't say that I would argue with an assessment that \"these could 10x\". But blindly buying them and just hoping that 20% of them succeed is a bad move. At a minimum, it would have been easy to find some that were more likely than others to at least survive. It would be more interesting to see what a market cap weighted basket of these stocks did.",

The nature of a 10x list is that it is high risk, high reward. I suspect if you go back over the previous 10 years they have pretty good performance. I don&#39;t know if this 10x thing is just a one time list but that is generally in line with their general rule breaker type strategy. Pick 10 stocks, swing for the fences, and even if 7-8 of them fail you can still outpace the market with 2 of them doing really well. Many of their choices have done well more than 10x. And they don&#39;t generally sell even if the stock goes up a lot, so they actually get those gains. They basically let the losers go to zero. </p>\n\n<p>In this list I know Fool has been in on Shopify for a long time before 2020. </p>\n\n<p>In general though without David Gardner I think they&#39;ve lost focus. And they&#39;ve picked so many stocks that they have the problem most big funds have. Users won&#39;t pay unless they keep getting new ideas which means working down the list of good ideas to the less good ones. It used to be a couple stocks a month. Which is already probably too much.</p>\n</div>",
