  "selftext": "# Valuation\n\nTypical growth stock valuation methods work for continuously growing companies (e.g., selling 30% more burgers, cars, computer chips, or ads per year). However, these methods are inadequate for valuing companies where an event in the near future could trigger a massive change in growth potential.\n\nFor RocketLab, such a trigger is the Neutron development. If they succeed in developing a reusable medium launch vehicle for less than $60 million per flight, they could significantly increase their valuation.\n\nThe important question is: **How likely is it that they will succeed in developing Neutron in a timely manner?**\n\n# Probability of Neutron Success\n\nTo estimate the likelihood of Neutron‚Äôs development success, we can examine RocketLab‚Äôs past performance, leadership, and competitors. RocketLab is not a young startup without products in service. It is a company with a 7-year track record of launch services.\n\n**Electron Development Compared to Other Vehicles**\n\n**Electron Timeline**\n\n2013: Rocket Lab began development on Rutherford, with the first engine test-fired the same year.\n\n2014 July: The Electron launch program was announced.\n\n2016 December: Electron completed flight qualification.\n\n2017: The first rocket was launched on May 25, 2017, in a flight called ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Test.‚Äù The mission failed due to a tracking system configuration error by a safety officer (from an organization like NASA/FAA). (Source: *When the Heavens Went on Sale* - Ashlee Vance).\n\n2018 January: First successful Electron launch.\n\n2018 October: RocketLab scaled up, enabling the company to build an Electron rocket every week. The upscaling was massive‚Äîjust two years from a flight-certified rocket to a production capability of one rocket per week.\n\n**Falcon 1 Timeline**\n\n2002 October: First gas generator full-duration test-firing (Mojave).\n\n2003 March: First Merlin engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor, Texas).\n\n2003 July: First Merlin engine turbopump test (Mojave).\n\n2004 February: First Kestrel engine thrust chamber firing (McGregor).\n\n2004 July: First complete Merlin engine test-firing.\n\n2006 March: First Falcon 1 flight (failure).\n\n2008 September: First successful Falcon 1 flight.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIt took RocketLab 3.5 years from the Electron program announcement to the first successful launch (3 years if we count the first test flight, which only failed due to third-party error). It took SpaceX 6 years to develop Falcon 1 to its first successful flight.\n\n**Additional Points:**\n\n    SpaceX developed the Falcon 1 engine (Merlin) as a gas-generator engine with one engine per Falcon 1 vehicle. This made engine development more complex (larger engine) but more easily scalable to a medium launch vehicle (e.g., using 9 Merlin engines on a Falcon 9).\n    \n    RocketLab, on the other hand, opted for an electric pump-fed engine, which is simpler and probably why Electron reached the pad so quickly, but it‚Äôs not scalable to a medium launch vehicle.\n    \n    SpaceX could employ experienced aerospace professionals, as ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) wasn‚Äôt an issue for them. This included key personnel like Tom Mueller (Vice President of Propulsion, formerly with TWR), Chris Thompson (Vice President of Structures, formerly with Boeing), Tim Buzza (Vice President of Launch and Test, formerly with Boeing), and others.\n    \n    RocketLab, however, couldn‚Äôt hire US aerospace veterans due to ITAR restrictions and couldn‚Äôt access certain US aerospace supplies.\n\nDespite being in an outsider position‚Äînot based in the US, hindered by ITAR, with a founder without a university degree or the wealth of founders like Bezos or Branson‚ÄîRocketLab managed to develop a small launch vehicle in record time with only $100 million. They also scaled up faster than Falcon 9, with 50 launches and remarkable reliability (48 successes in 52 launches). Additionally, they achieved gross margin profitability with just $7.5 million per flight.\n\n**Bonus:** Electron is an extremely accurate vehicle, capable of deploying payloads within 8 meters of a targeted location, compared to the industry standard of 15 km. This opens up many possibilities, such as accessing waste in space or military applications, like inspecting opponent satellites.\n\n**What Can Be Transferred from Electron to Neutron?**\n\nIn addition to parts of the rocket, RocketLab can transfer knowledge of simulations, ground equipment, and production processes. The latter is more important than it may seem. Early rockets are custom-built by the engineers who designed every part, but by the time the 10th rocket is produced, a Manufacturing Execution System (MES) is needed to ensure every step is executed correctly by the assembly line workers. With 52 flights and 48 successes in 7 years, RocketLab has succeeded in this process.\n\nThe biggest potential risk was always the engine. RocketLab had only worked with electric pump-fed and pressure-fed engines (and solid/semisolid motors) before. Developing a staged-combustion engine is a different challenge. However, they successfully brought the Archimedes engine to 102% power in 2024, and during the Q2 earnings call, it was revealed that one additional engine was already coming off the production line, with five more in production. Therefore, engine production should not be a bottleneck, significantly reducing the risk.\n\n**Neutron Timeline**\n\n2021 March: Neutron introduced.\n\n2022 September: Investor Day and Neutron update, with a switch to staged combustion announced.\n\nQ2 2023\n\n    First full-scale thrust chamber completed.\n    \n    Injector testing underway.\n    \n    Pre-burner tests underway.\n\n2024 February (Q4 earnings call): Single-element pre-burner test campaign complete, successfully proving out the element design across the full throttle range, which has been incorporated into the full-scale pre-burner.\n\n2024 Q2: Archimedes tested at 102% power, with the next engine coming off the production line and five more engines in production.\n\n**My Prediction:**\n\n    ‚Ä¢\tFirst Neutron flight: 2025.\n    \n    ‚Ä¢\tFirst successful Neutron flight: 2025/2026.\n    \n    ‚Ä¢\tFirst successful Neutron landing: 2026/2027.\n    \n    ‚Ä¢\tFirst Neutron reuse: 1 year after the first Neutron landing.\n\n**Position:**  \n7000 shares  \n1st purchase in June 2021",

You are buying the whole rocket. If you can&#39;t fill the whole rocket it still costs the same. So some payloads already could be cheaper on Neutron than on F9 if they price it like they announced.<br/>\nAnd long term they made some smart decisions to potentially undercut F9.<br/>\nMinimal ground infrastructure.<br/>\nBetter aerodynamic form (like Starship), because not designed with road transport in mind.<br/>\nOx rich staged combustion instead of gas generator (also easier scale up to large vehicle like New Glenn)<br/>\nAttached fairings saves cost in marine assets.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s say how this plays out until 2030.</p>\n</div>",
