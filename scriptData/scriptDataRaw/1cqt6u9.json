My homeowner's insurance is over 100% more than it was in 2019, I've had to drop my replacement cost policy for a worse depreciated policy, and its still double! Pre-Pandemic we were grocery shopping at our local organic grocer, spending about $150/week, now we grocery shop at walmart and are spending $250/week, and buying more chicken and ground beef and less steak. I've only bought new clothes from Walmart the past 2 years, despite making more money than I've ever made in my entire life. I've never made so much money and felt so poor at the same time. An oil change on my truck is over $120 full price, I used to always get it done at the dealership now I use coupons and go to 5 minute oil change and get it done for \\~$75, same it used to cost full price at the dealership.... I just got a quote to fix my driveway the best quote to repave my small driveway is $16k, I can't afford that, so just repaving the first 11ft or so of my driveway is going to cost me $5K. Roofing and fence work is astronomical right now, both are services I'm going to need soon and absolutely dreading, I'm hearing horror stories about roofs costing 20k+ and fences costing 10k+, neighbor just got one length of fence redone, one side of his house cost him 12k. Me and wife get taco bell for dinner maybe once or twice a month, these days its over $20 bucks for both of us to get taco bell, other fast food is same or worse. I remember when I was in high school \\~2010, me and a friend got really stoned and went to taco bell like a couple bandits and ordered practically everything on the menu and it came out to roughly $20, and were laughing hysterically that we actually racked up $20 worth of food at taco bell, for two people to order $20 worth of food at taco bell was HYSTERICALLY laughable 15 years ago, right now its literally completely normal. Prices that people commonly have to pay for common goods and services are easily almost twice what they were pre-pandemic. You have to notice this, articles be damned, compare your monthly rent cost year over year the past 5 years, what kind of increase are you noticing? Does it look like a steady 2-10% increase each year? My guess is the SMALLEST YoY increase you've seen in your rent the last 5 years is 10%, which during normal times a 10% YoY increase in rent would be alarming. These price increases are not okay and most people will not be able to sustain this for much longer. Even the people I know who are top earners and financially well are complaining about costs, My friends who are young renters who make 6 figures who were looking to buy a house in \\~2019 are now coping and telling themselves they really don't want to own a house now. You can even look at all these ATH in the stock market as an indicator of inflation, simply the cost of owning a share of stock. S&P is 25% YoY lol THAT'S INFLATION! The S&P 500 companies aren't 25% more valuable intrinsically or more productive than they were 1 year ago, they are 25% more expensive because of all the cash in the market attempting to seek assets, same with every good and service.",
