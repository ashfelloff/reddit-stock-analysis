It had to be Elon that said to keep it as two seats so it looks futuristic and aesthetic. What if I want to travel with a small group of people? I’m not using the LAX shuttle van at that point, I’m immediately turning to a competitor. Haven’t really seen anyone comment on how out of touch and unnecessary that was. \n\nOne other concern I have is how Tesla primarily uses cameras. What if there are sirens and a fire truck, ambulance, or police car is blowing through an intersection. Other autonomous vehicles incorporate sound, I’m not too sure Tesla does. If not it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. \n\nBeyond this there’s the ridiculous price tag he put on it which it’ll probably be nowhere close to. \n\nWhat are other people’s thoughts on this, did anything with this Robotaxi actually look like a feasible product to you? It looks like an aesthetic toy, but not an actual product that can compete in the space. Based on my understanding of a typical car design cycle, redesigning this to add four instead of just 2 seats would take probably another 2-4 years at least. To me it seems like they really just showed they lost on their biggest bet in the near future. \n\n\nEdit: Alright read through the comments, and still think the 2 seat no steering wheel design is stupid. People are saying this is meant to also be a personal commuter car. So my choices are to buy a 30K Robotaxi (knowing Tesla’s history this WILL be priced higher) and then ALSO get a model 3 or model Y to drive around my family for ANOTHER 40K when I can just get ONE model 3 or any other self driving car, no Robotaxi and do everything I need? How is that budget friendly at all, and if there’s a nicer car with a steering wheel that self drives why would I buy something without the option of a steering wheel? \nStill a toy.\n \nAlso, if it’s for personal use, how does this know where to park at my office or how to get past a security gate to private property? If I live in a condo building with a garage how does it know how to get out of the parking garage and where my parking space is? It makes no sense as a personal car for a LOT of people.\n\nAnd even if the majority of taxi rides are 1-2 people, why not just use a model 3 that’s 10K more, already exists, and can service that additional 15-20% of your taxi market (given the Robotaxi is definitely not gonna cost 30K and over the life of the car the extra seats pay for themselves). You also save on all the costs that it took to make a stupid 2 seater when it came to expanding production lines/capacity, testing, and designing the pointless thing. \n\nMy opinion doesn’t change this thing shouldn’t exist, and it’s out of touch with what most people need. Total waste of time when they could’ve focused on actually competing with growing competition in the normal car space where they’re losing their competitive advantage. There’s a reason why Uber and the ex-Waymo CEO were not impressed.",

So for fun, let's assume all Elon's claims come true. 20-30k in 2026 with FSD without lidar (just for the sake of argument).\n\nNobody has clearance to run fully autonomous cars on the road. There are some companies who have some clearance to run some cars and they are reporting back good data. But that's all based on lidar systems, not just camera based. The roll out will have to take this in consideration and this is not a technological step but a governance one. This will take considerable time.\n\nBeyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out. Since there is no single station built anywhere.\n\nThen you have to think about the hygiene within the car, both in terms of actual hygiene, but also gravity and misuse by the public. This will need operational staff too. \n\nThis is where the waymo roll out is a lot more sensible, especially the partnership with a company like Uber who does have infrastructure and operational staff in most mayor cities or the capacity to scale.\n\nAnd even if you were to fix all of those issues you'd also be activating a lot of latent demand for mobility, there is a reason you need a license to run a taxi in NYC otherwise it would be even more gridlocked than it is today. Now add into that mix every subway rider who now wants to take a cybertaxi. Walking would be faster at that rate. And that is just existing ridership, latent demand is real and will affect cities. This future increases call for regulation.\n\nThe vision is clear and yes long term this will be how mobility will be operated. Along side many other options like autonomous busses, streetcars, trains and subways. Who knows if you are looking long term maybe even drones with more energy density from advanced solid state batteries. But for now they should focus on proving the concept and setting themselves up to scale, this course will only cause dissatisfaction with shareholders over unmet goals.",

This will take considerable time.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, these cars will need charging, which might be inductive sure but that still needs infrastructure which needs to be built out. Since there is no single station built anywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Then you have to think about the hygiene within the car, both in terms of actual hygiene, but also gravity and misuse by the public. This will need operational staff too. </p>\n\n<p>This is where the waymo roll out is a lot more sensible, especially the partnership with a company like Uber who does have infrastructure and operational staff in most mayor cities or the capacity to scale.</p>\n\n<p>And even if you were to fix all of those issues you&#39;d also be activating a lot of latent demand for mobility, there is a reason you need a license to run a taxi in NYC otherwise it would be even more gridlocked than it is today. Now add into that mix every subway rider who now wants to take a cybertaxi. Walking would be faster at that rate. And that is just existing ridership, latent demand is real and will affect cities. This future increases call for regulation.</p>\n\n<p>The vision is clear and yes long term this will be how mobility will be operated. Along side many other options like autonomous busses, streetcars, trains and subways. Who knows if you are looking long term maybe even drones with more energy density from advanced solid state batteries. But for now they should focus on proving the concept and setting themselves up to scale, this course will only cause dissatisfaction with shareholders over unmet goals.</p>\n</div>",

If the price is low enough....just order 2. If you need 3 switch to the van. This is clearly more efficient then support 3-4 people with every vehicle they put out when most rides are 2 people or less.
