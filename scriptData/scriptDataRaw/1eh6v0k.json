However, after looking deeper into the stock I am convinced this company is going to zero and will be full-porting into the longest dated put options I can buy for the lowest strike price available.** \n\nAs of writing -- Carvana is up 18% today after beating every estimate Wall Street had for this glorified used-car dealership. It currently trades at 60x P/E and has pumped back to deep-covid numbers around hype that the business has finally turned around and tendy-town awaits. \n\nTheir [investor letter](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q2-2024.pdf) echoes the sentiment. The profit turn-around looks like what my portfolio would look like if I took two extra shifts and Wendys before convincing my brother to do the same. \n\n[up bigly](https://preview.redd.it/csr3g6x53zfd1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=9053a925cfdd932115cd3b0dd179f382ba05eb69)\n\nAlongside this legendary turnaround have come slews of articles bashing the stock and the fraudster family behind it. I think the bearish thesis is simpler than that – [Carvana is essentially the new WeWork](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a60257928/carvana-recovery-progresss/) – Marrying “massive back-­office tech with all the old-school logistics and expensive inventory complications of selling used cars on a grand scale” ensuring no real innovation while also sleep-walking into similar macro headwinds that obliterated WeWork. \n\nThere are a couple of reasons why this shit-stock is a ticking timebomb. \n\n1 – Their books are cooked.\n\nOk I know I said I wasn't gonna talk about the fraud but it's pretty bad.\n\nExplained in the daily thread by u/c0de76 they add up the profit from ALL of their types of car sales and report it as their profit per sale, overreporting by about 5-6x\n\nEven after their net income margin is still down .2% QoQ – which is getting gobbled up by a post-restructuring interesting interest maintenance fee that is still ridiculous – [155m$ in interest expenses](https://investors.carvana.com/news-releases/2024/07-31-2024-211018276#:~:text=In%20Q2%202024%2C%20Carvana%20sold,Adjusted%20EBITDA%20of%20%24355%20million) (half of their income this quarter).\n\n2 – Their strategy is built around the linear continuation of horribly unsustainable macro conditions.\n\nA – Inventory \n\nTheir investor letter claims: “we expect to grow retail units sequentially in Q3” motivating increasing spend on new inventory (to “scale”) which is [beginning](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVNA/carvana/inventory) to rebound. \n\nProblematically, this means Carvana is operating like the average WSB user – they are buying high into a used car market with numerous headwinds. \n\nNew cars are flooding the market as automakers overreacted to a demand explosion after covid causing a [race-to-the-bottom of incentives and financing](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/us-auto-sales-are-expected-to-slow-during-the-second-half-of-2024.html) (this is the same trend that killed almost every automaker’s earnings this quarter).\n\nUsed cars are following – with many consumers finding that NEW CARS are [cheaper ](https://money.com/used-car-prices-driving-down-inflation/)than used cars.\n\nAnd, as the fed cuts rates, Carvana will also get squeezed as they will be able to charge far less for the auto-loans that make up a high percentage of their profit (their inventory is also priced assuming they will continue to charge ridiculous rates).\n\nB – Consumer Stability   \nIt's bad, [demand is cooling](https://www.bernstein.com/our-insights/insights/2024/articles/the-us-consumer-conservatism-not-collapse.html) as savings are cooked and consumers become wary.\n\nCarvana will (almost) literally lend to anyone. The requirements on their website are laughable – [anyone who is 18 and makes $5,100 PER YEAR qualifies ](https://www.carvana.com/help/payment-and-financing/can-i-finance-with-carvana-if-i-have-bad-credit)for a carvana auto loan. This is after they cracked down on their loaning in March. For reference, [The industry standard is 1.5-2.5K PER MONTH, or 5x the annual income on average](https://www.autocreditexpress.com/blog/what-is-the-minimum-income-to-buy-a-car/#:~:text=Minimum%20Income%20for%20a%20Car%20Loan&text=In%20our%20experience%2C%20the%20minimum,programs%20with%20lower%20income%20requirements). \n\nThis comes at a time where [auto delinquencies are high – and only increasing](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight#:~:text=The%20largest%20increase%20in%20delinquencies,for%20auto%20loans%20was%207.2%25) (notably higher for those without a mortgage, ie lower income, more likely to buy carvana car).\n\nSimilarly, [Repos are spiking ](https://qz.com/car-repossessions-inflation-interest-rates-1851597051)as post-covid aid is drying up and the job market slows.\n\n3 – Random Other Shady Shit.\n\nCarvana is facing a class-action lawsuit for failing to provide certification for sold vehicles in PA.\n\nGlorious leader GARCIA ERNEST C. II has been dumping shares almost daily.\n\nThey are diluting shares through increasing stock-compensation to employees.\n\nThere are numerous reports of stolen cars being sold drawing questions about their inspections.\n\nTLDR – Carvana is getting fucked on both ends – old buyers cant pay up, new ones dont wanna pay cuz they can get a new car for cheaper, the trend is accelerating now and thus isn’t accounted for by this month’s earnings and is a ticking timebomb for their $10B debt load, which they have to pay $150m+ just to service every quarter. Meanwhile, the owner is dumping millions of dollars of shares on the open market daily.\n\nI think it could take a while, but eventually every fraud collapses and I think car prices and demand falling is the perfect catalyst for that. At the very least, this company is grossly overvalued ATM.\n\nNFA I have no financial or accounting certifications and obviously everything in this post is speculation. ",
