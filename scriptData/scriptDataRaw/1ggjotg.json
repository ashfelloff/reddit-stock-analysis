I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.\n\nI believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.\n\nGoogle's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.\n\n* It has a near monopoly in Search\n* Market leadership in media with YouTube.\n* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.\n* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.\n\n**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**\n\nLet's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.\n\nQ3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**\n\nRevenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.\n\nGoogle Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.\n\n**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.\n\nCloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.\n\nBased on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!\n\nI believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.\n\nBesides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.\n\nThe antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.\n\n**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",

Apple did about 110 billion dollars in operating cash flow. About 10.8 billion went to stock based comp and another 10.9 billion went to Capex. That leaves about 90 billion that Apple is going to give back shareholders. Microsoft was in the same situation as Apple a couple of years ago but last year they basically doubled their Capex. Microsoft has also dialed back the buybacks this year as well and to be fair it makes sense considering their stock is extremely overpriced. </p>\n\n<p>If Google could cut back on the stock based comp and Capex and put more money towards their buybacks as well as continue to grow earnings and their cloud business at the current pace this stock could easily double from here.</p>\n</div>",
