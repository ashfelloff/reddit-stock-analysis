Evidence.com has since become a must-have for law enforcement agencies, District Attorney Offices, and even public defender offices and private defense attorneys are buying subscriptions to easily receive and review body camera evidence.\n\nThe company is a cash cow.

Seems cool though and I think drones are becoming popular again as Ukraine showed how much of a game changer they are. I also think Axons management proved they have an idea for the future and use acquisitions as stepping stones to that future and integrate everything really well.

I think this is a pretty big deal as it’s a great way for them to diversify. </p>\n\n<p>They also have taser, didn’t see that mentioned, which was their core business. Taser isn’t as much of a cash cow as body cam/cloud software is but still a growing segment. I think it will become more important with their newer models that have better stopping power which makes it safer for officers to use. </p>\n\n<p>Recently they acquired a drone company, I remember they had an interesting way to integrate it to the company but honestly forgot the details. Seems cool though and I think drones are becoming popular again as Ukraine showed how much of a game changer they are. I also think Axons management proved they have an idea for the future and use acquisitions as stepping stones to that future and integrate everything really well. I haven’t listened to the latest ER but I am interested to see how the drones do. </p>\n\n<p>Will end with: I will buy more, I bought some a month ago and a few shares every 6 months for the last 3 years.</p>\n</div>",
