Ultimately I no longer hold Micron.\n\nWhat I learned is it is extremely hard to predict the supply/demand cycles for memory. Because memory is a commodity, the memory business is actually tough for three reasons:\n1. Prices for DRAM and NAND are deflationary in nature. Good for consumers; tough business for MU/Samsung/Hynix when they need to spend through Capex cycles while facing deflationary cycles. Micron has yet to reach peak gross margin like it did back in the 2018 cycle\n2. The cost basis (pay to play) for DRAM is now going require EUV. See point 1 on gross margins\n3. Semi cap (maybe not now because multiples are so high) are just higher quality companies in terms of gross margin, FCF, & product differentiation of not having to deal with commodity pricing. I hold the portfolio of LAM, KLA, ASML. Never selling. \n\nThe X factor maybe High Bandwidth Memory. I have since left the semi industry, but if you are long Micron you really have to believe HBM is going to be such a differentiated product that it can generate 60% gross margins and sustain those gross margin through the “winter cycles”\n\nKudos to Micron management though. Having seen them weather 2016, 2020 downturns, they are in much better financial shape in FCF and balance sheet than before.\n\nUltimately, it’s the commodity pricing reason and not having any ability to control cycles is the reason I’m no longer a share holder. Hope this perspective helps. You should always see both sides and hope these disclosures help you even if you choose to hold",
