Neural nets are what, 70 years old now? Regression is indeed a pretty core ML task. The main thing that's changed in the last 15 years or so is that we perform automatic feature learning as opposed to hand engineering them. And what's enabled that is the co-unlocking of more data and more compute. Which is why our ancestors 200 years ago may just as well be doing AI but with vanishingly smaller budgets.",

I&#39;m also not sure why the implication that we&#39;ve been doing AI for centuries should be absurd. Neural nets are what, 70 years old now? Regression is indeed a pretty core ML task. The main thing that&#39;s changed in the last 15 years or so is that we perform automatic feature learning as opposed to hand engineering them. And what&#39;s enabled that is the co-unlocking of more data and more compute. Which is why our ancestors 200 years ago may just as well be doing AI but with vanishingly smaller budgets.</p>\n</div>",

This can lead to much more capable personal devices.\n- truly generative AI is now a thing. Videos, audio, computer code, art, and somewhat conversation. Before transformers we were mostly just in the world of predictive AI. This can enable rapid content creation.\n- Advances in high power GPU processing like Nvidia Blackwell will dramatically reduce training time (to allow faster iteration) but also enable massively powerful cloud based AI. \n- embedding has greatly improved in the last couple years and helped alleviate some of the problems with NNs overfitting to data (though this is still a challenge).\n\nFrom my experience most companies are still in the tinkering phase with AI. Most of them have about enough expertise to start trying things out but not enough to actually advance the art. Put the tools in the hands of billions and great things will happen eventually.",

This can lead to much more capable personal devices.\n- truly generative AI is now a thing. Videos, audio, computer code, art, and somewhat conversation. Before transformers we were mostly just in the world of predictive AI. This can enable rapid content creation.\n- Advances in high power GPU processing like Nvidia Blackwell will dramatically reduce training time (to allow faster iteration) but also enable massively powerful cloud based AI. \n- embedding has greatly improved in the last couple years and helped alleviate some of the problems with NNs overfitting to data (though this is still a challenge).</p>\n\n<p>From my experience most companies are still in the tinkering phase with AI. Most of them have about enough expertise to start trying things out but not enough to actually advance the art. Put the tools in the hands of billions and great things will happen eventually.</p>\n</div>",
