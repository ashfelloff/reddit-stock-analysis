(It's possible that all extant players have already done this but that was very much not the case years ago.) Implementation also affects revenue.

Use this with your dissertation from point 2 to actually model revenue opportunity.\n* Securitization reports. I wouldn't touch a BNPL symbol until it's achieved asset securitization because 1) it's a signal of trust/sophistication in capital markets, 2) it's the lowest-cost funding mechanism for a lender who doesn't have deposits to play with, and 3) it offers transparency on the provider's underwriting performance. Cost of capital is one of the biggest burdens and you can get valuable leading insight about future earnings by understanding and tracking performance of the securities they generate (admittedly tricky and a lot of work!).\n* Consumer characteristics. IMO providers need to capture and lock-in a demographic that traditional lenders have lost or ignored. This is feasible given how poorly people were treated in the decade after the financial crisis, but the BNPL providers need to ensure that the old dogs don't learn any of their tricks.\n\nThose are the micro factors that come to mind. On the macro side I would be very sensitive to general economic trends. None of these providers are battle tested in a recession, and I wouldn't want to be one of the shareholders who gets to find out if they're ready. Fed rates are also highly significant because the risk-free rate defines a floor that their assets must exceed to achieve favorable cost on future capital, and any upward adjustment to loan interest rate generally results in a reduction in take rate by consumers. (The exception to the latter is when your customers are financially disenfranchised, in which case they'll take anything but your risk profile is terrifying.)",

Generally you go to capital markets and convince them that you can make performant debt assets.\n* A lending license. Enter partner banks who can originate for you.\n* An underwriting process (including credit models) that enables items 1 and 2.\n* A tech stack supporting real-time loan applications.\n* Merchant partners willing to integrate you into their checkout flows, and possibly subsidize the consumer loans that you'll make.\n\nThat's a lot of facets! You can try to sell yourself on any one of them depending on who is interested. A big bank might want your brand (they are losing share of younger generations) or your integrations expertise (they know they can't and will never be able to do this well). A tech company might want your underwriting expertise (risky and difficult to make from scratch) or capital markets relationships. An older payments company might want presence in a new payment type that threatens their margin (merchants hate them for skimming points off of their sales and BNPL leverages that animosity into partnerships).\n\nSo there are many conceivable exit paths, but I doubt that any would materialize in the current market. Potential acquirers see the product complexity and don't want to take on its operational baggage unless it's crushing competition, at least in the aspects they care about. History is another barrier; negative outcomes are tangible after Goldman/Greensky and Block/Afterpay.\n\nIMO Affirm and its peers need to prove that they either thrive as independent businesses or destroy incumbents in some of the many things they do. There's simply too much risk to justify investment in middling performance.\n\nIf you're bullish, my recommendation is to take a long view and evaluate them on expansion of financial services and consumer lock-in (basically, the neobank value prop).
