The neat aspect of satellite investing is your gambling money pool gets bigger over time so you have more fun.

I’m assuming you’re doing this down cap otherwise the latter point is highly highly unlikely. If you’re not an expert I’d say you’re better off diversifying. If you want just a few names with no real knowledge then that’s called gambling and can also work but risk is different. Is this a long only deal? There’s a lot to consider here but based on how you asked the question I’d be wary of putting all your money into 2 companies. It could payout sure but then without that research how do you know if you continue to reinvest or redeploy and into what etc etc etc. good luck!",

I’m assuming you’re doing this down cap otherwise the latter point is highly highly unlikely. If you’re not an expert I’d say you’re better off diversifying. If you want just a few names with no real knowledge then that’s called gambling and can also work but risk is different. Is this a long only deal? There’s a lot to consider here but based on how you asked the question I’d be wary of putting all your money into 2 companies. It could payout sure but then without that research how do you know if you continue to reinvest or redeploy and into what etc etc etc. good luck!</p>\n</div>",
