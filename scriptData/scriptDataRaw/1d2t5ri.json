But I'm married with a child and can't be gambling foolishly like this. \n\nThe problem is I have this itch to trade, to speculate.

Mind divides. It says \"this\" is good and \"that\" is bad. This division not only creates a division in the world; this division creates a division in the divider also. If you divide, you are also divided in that division, and you cannot transcend your inner division unless you forget outer divisions. Whatsoever you do to the world, you have done to yourself also.\n\nIf you say that someone is angry and anger is bad (good-bad division), what will you do when you will feel angry?\n\nYou will say that this anger in me is bad. Then you have started to divide yourself into two persons – a bad person and a good person. Of course, you are bound to be identified with the saint within, so the evil within you is to be condemned. You are divided in two. Now there will be a constant fight, a conflict. Now you cannot be an individual; you will be a crowd, a house divided against itself. Now there will be no peace, no silence. You will feel only tensions and anguish. This is what you are feeling, but you don’t know why.\n\nA divided person cannot be at peace. How can he be? Where to put your devil? You have to destroy it, and it is you; you cannot destroy it. You are not two. The reality is one, but because of your divisive attitude you have divided the outer reality. Now the inner is also divided accordingly – so everyone is fighting with himself. It is as if you are fighting against one hand – fighting the right hand with the left hand – and the energy is one. In my right hand and left hand, I am I am flowing in both. But I can oppose one against the other, my right hand against my left hand, and I can create a conflict, a bogus fight. Sometimes I can deceive myself that the right hand has won, and now the left is down. But this is a deception, because I know that it is me in both and any moment, I can put the left up and the right down. I am in both; both the hands are mine.\n\nSo howsoever much you think you have put your saint above and crushed the devil down, know that at any moment you can change the positions, and the saint will be down, and the devil will be up. That creates fear, insecurity, because you know that nothing is certain. You know you are so loving this moment and you have crushed your hatred down, but you are afraid because at any moment the hatred can come up and the love will be just crushed down. And it can happen at any moment because you are within both.\n\nAn undivided man will say a person is saint or evil with the same attitude as saying day is light and night is dark...\n\n-Osho",

You need to have zero emotional tie to the money and the game if you want to be successful IMO.

(Not a financial advisor, yada yada)\n\n1) Never gamble with money that isn't yours. Loans aren't yours. Your mortgage isn't yours. Your kids college fund isn't yours. Margin accounts are not your money. \n\n2) The stock market is definitely gambling. Never gamble with money that isn't yours.\n\n3) Never gamble with more money than you can afford to lose. I don't know your budget, but for me, that's about $200 in any given trade. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n4) If you zero out your account, stop trading until you have enough discretionary funds to start again. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n5) Always have a plan, always stick to the plan, don't get emotional. I lose money because my plan is this: 1) at any% loss, hodl until profit; 2) at 50% profit, take profits unless i 'feel' like I'm gonna get more profits; 3) at 100%+ profit, sell, but text my friends who are not financial advisors asking if I should sell or not, and wait for the reply. If it never comes, never sell. \n     5a) Always have a better plan than me. Always stick to the the plan. Don't chase. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n6) Take profits and put them somewhere \"safe\" like an index fund or a high yield savings account or a cut out section of the mattress your kids were conceived on. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n7) If you have a gambling problem, get help. Go to meetings, therapy, finance classes, whatever you need to do. Be honest with yourself. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n8) If you win, don't look back to see what you could have won if you'd stayed at the table. It'll make you feel like you left money on the table, and that isn't true. You won. Take your profits and your pride. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n9) Don't be a victim of FOMO. I am not an experienced trader. Only been at it casually for 4 years or so. But in that time I have seen (and missed) at least one \"once in a lifetime\" trade every year. I know it won't always be that frequent but there will always be another \"once in a lifetime\" trade. If you miss one, wait for the next one, don't jump in late just to be part of the party. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n10) Never. Gamble. With. Money. That. Isn't. Yours. \n\nMy biggest loss to date is $6000 all at once. That was a lot for me. I stopped trading for about 18 months after that, and when I started again it was just \"safe\" stocks and funds. \n\nYou have to know when it's time to walk away and you absolutely have to be honest with yourself about it.\n\nIf you're the type of person who has to leave their wallet at home and bring only cash and ID to a brick and mortar casino, stay the fuck out of the stock market. \n\nNever gamble with money that isn't yours.",
