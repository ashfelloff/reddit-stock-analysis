CB and TLT correlation is 0.03 since end of 2020.\n\nAltria (MO).  Tobacco company with very high revenue and low debt.  MO and TLT correlation is -0.10 since end of 2020.\n\nWhite Mountains Insurance (WTM).  Another insurance provider with large reserves that are invested for income.  Investment income was $194 million in most recent year vs. $82.5 million in 2021.  WTM and TLT correlation is 0.0 since end of 2020.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback on the 3 stocks that I listed.
