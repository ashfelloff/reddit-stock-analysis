Weird little OTC-traded Berkshire-esque entity run by the managers of Horizon Kinetics.\n\nKNSL I thought was a good deal in the $370's and now has taken off after earnings. \n\nREMYY is a good deal here imo although be careful as some brokerages charge a lot extra to trade ADRs (symbol ends in Y.) Liquor is having a terrible time lately but there's a point where anyone looking for value can step in especially to something more premium. \n\nReally look for things that are a good deal and a good company - there's a lot of things that are either at 52 week lows or near them.

Not much. MPC is still an example of something that I think is reasonable, well-managed, has a strong moat and is returning a lot of cash to shareholders.</p>\n\n<p>I think the Ulta pessimism is excessive. It&#39;s not going to provide some sort of home run returns, but I think buying it here over the next year or three will work out well unless there&#39;s some sort of 2008 sequel (which I don&#39;t see.)</p>\n\n<p>I think FRMO is something where the crypto exposure is underappreciated but it could easily continue to be underappreciated for a long time to come.  Weird little OTC-traded Berkshire-esque entity run by the managers of Horizon Kinetics.</p>\n\n<p>KNSL I thought was a good deal in the $370&#39;s and now has taken off after earnings. </p>\n\n<p>REMYY is a good deal here imo although be careful as some brokerages charge a lot extra to trade ADRs (symbol ends in Y.) Liquor is having a terrible time lately but there&#39;s a point where anyone looking for value can step in especially to something more premium. </p>\n\n<p>Really look for things that are a good deal and a good company - there&#39;s a lot of things that are either at 52 week lows or near them. IMO, a very small % of that is actually worthwhile.</p>\n</div>",

It might go down still, but it is relatively low to its top.\n\nRaspberry Pi is (if not yet) a semiconductor company going for only £4 a share. It is expected for it to rise, having clean financials, positive future product prospects and are part of the home automation market.\n\nI agree with Ford as well, them going more hybrid car focused should increase their revenue and profits, while also joining F1 in two years. Fingers crossed for a Le Mans Hupercar as well.\n\nAMD is diving right now but I’d reckon they will bounce back.\n\nA wildcard option: Crowdstrike. I suspect people overestimate how terrible the consequences will be but it might be possible the stock is overrated in the first place. It would be great to use monthly fractional shares for this one as the absolute loss will be less if it doesn’t pan out, and when you buy the full stock when the price settles down, it won’t affect the average too much.",

It might go down still, but it is relatively low to its top.</p>\n\n<p>Raspberry Pi is (if not yet) a semiconductor company going for only £4 a share. It is expected for it to rise, having clean financials, positive future product prospects and are part of the home automation market.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with Ford as well, them going more hybrid car focused should increase their revenue and profits, while also joining F1 in two years. Fingers crossed for a Le Mans Hupercar as well.</p>\n\n<p>AMD is diving right now but I’d reckon they will bounce back.</p>\n\n<p>A wildcard option: Crowdstrike. I suspect people overestimate how terrible the consequences will be but it might be possible the stock is overrated in the first place. It would be great to use monthly fractional shares for this one as the absolute loss will be less if it doesn’t pan out, and when you buy the full stock when the price settles down, it won’t affect the average too much.</p>\n</div>",
