There's a massive open interest in calls, particularly at the $10 and $11 strike prices. \n\nRight now, MSOS is hovering around $9.62, but if it can push past $10, it could trigger a significant amount of buying pressure. There are 12,132 open interest contracts at the $10 strike and a whopping 15,658 contracts at the $11 strike. \n\nPlus - there is large OI on puts at $10. If $10 MSOS is cleared - market makers will remove their hedge and cause further significant buy pressure. \n\nWith the DEA set to officially publish its proposed rule and move cannabis to schedule 3 - the tax savings significantly re-rates the sector from a cashflow perspective. \n\nThe last pop on the AP news reporting sched 3, had short sellers scrambling to prevent the rally - and I suspect they are significantly over-leveraged at the moment. \n\nA modicum of buying could see an easy 10-20% pop on MSOS. \n\n ",
