By examining the principles of fractals, chaos theory, and human psychology, this study aims to highlight the pervasive nature of self-similar patterns across different contexts. Understanding these connections not only enhances our appreciation of natural and financial systems but also offers insights into the underlying mechanisms that drive complex patterns in diverse environments.\n\n# Introduction\n\nPatterns are a fundamental aspect of both natural and human-made systems. In financial markets, technical analysts use chart patterns to predict future price movements. Interestingly, similar patterns can often be seen in nature and everyday objects, suggesting a deeper connection. This thesis investigates the hypothesis that stock market patterns can be observed in the physical world around us, using a torn piece of cardboard as a primary example.\n\n# Literature Review\n\n1. **Fractals in Nature and Markets**\n   * Fractals are structures that exhibit self-similarity, meaning their patterns repeat at different scales. They are ubiquitous in nature, appearing in forms such as coastlines, mountain ranges, snowflakes, and plant structures (Mandelbrot, 1982).\n   * In financial markets, fractals are evident in price movements on different time scales, where short-term fluctuations mirror long-term trends (Peters, 1994).\n2. **Chaos Theory and Market Dynamics**\n   * Chaos theory explains how complex systems can exhibit both random and deterministic behavior. This theory has been applied to various fields, including meteorology, biology, and economics (Gleick, 1987).\n   * In the context of financial markets, chaos theory suggests that small changes in market conditions can lead to significant and seemingly unpredictable price movements, yet these movements often follow underlying patterns (Mandelbrot & Hudson, 2004).\n3. **Psychological Patterns**\n   * Human psychology plays a critical role in both market behavior and everyday actions. Behavioral finance studies how psychological factors influence investors' decisions, leading to predictable patterns in market movements (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).\n   * Similar psychological principles can influence mundane actions, such as tearing a piece of cardboard, resulting in patterns that mirror market trends.\n\n# Methodology\n\nTo explore the hypothesis, this study uses a qualitative analysis of a torn piece of cardboard and compares its pattern to typical stock market charts. The analysis focuses on identifying common patterns such as downtrends, uptrends, breaks, and retests.\n\n# Results\n\n1. **Visual Comparison**\n   * A torn edge of cardboard exhibits jagged, irregular lines that often slope downward initially, then shift upward. This resembles a market downtrend followed by an uptrend, with small corrections and retests.\n   * In stock market charts, a downtrend (series of lower highs and lower lows) can be followed by a reversal into an uptrend (series of higher highs and higher lows).\n2. **Breaks and Retests**\n   * The cardboard tear shows points where the tear line changes direction or has small breaks, similar to market corrections or consolidations.\n   * On the stock chart, these breaks and retests represent areas where the price tests previous support or resistance levels before continuing in the trend direction.\n\n# Discussion\n\nThe similarities between the torn cardboard edge and stock market charts can be explained by the principles of fractals and chaos theory. Both systems exhibit self-similarity and follow underlying deterministic rules that create complex, yet patterned outcomes. Additionally, human psychology influences both market behaviors and everyday actions, leading to the formation of similar patterns in different contexts.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThis study demonstrates that patterns typically seen in stock market charts can also be observed in everyday objects like a torn piece of cardboard. The presence of fractal and self-similar patterns across different domains highlights the interconnectedness of natural and financial systems. Understanding these connections offers valuable insights into the mechanisms driving complex patterns, enhancing our ability to predict and interpret both market behaviors and natural phenomena.\n\n# References\n\n* Gleick, J.
