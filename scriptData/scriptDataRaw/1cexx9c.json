And to my credit half of my port is still with me.](https://preview.redd.it/zirqo70i65xc1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff105181485e21bf24ceecb25b2c8a3a4853f134)\n\nYou might wonder how I ended up in this erm, position. \n\n*record scratch*\n\nFor the sake of amusement and educational value, I certainly hope some of you might learn from my mistakes instead of stepping on the same rake.\n\nIt all began a few weeks ago.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5dbpqb1u65xc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14416697d69805e00b82eb53b072617b20a466dd\n\nI got greedy. And greedy people make mistakes.\n\nWhen Trump's Truth Social became a public company with the shittiest fundamentals known to mankind, no business plan and staggering losses, it was a no-brainer to short it. I learned options just so I could!\n\nAnd the money was good. My first short had an expiration date of Jan 2025 and the strike price was $25. But because of all the greeks and short interest I sold it at a profit when DJT traded over $30! Wild. It retained its value so well because of long expiration date (theta).\n\nThen I did some other trades, most of them reasonably successful and briefly my account went above $200k. That gave me a sense of false confidence. Easy money! Why, I could just make a thousand dollars a day shorting this thing and calling that thing. I just need a bit more practice. Right?\n\nWhat I realized is that some options turn a profit in seconds and others can take days and weeks. And 1% for a minute of your time is better returns than 15% after two weeks of incubation.\n\nThen I noticed that of all the trades I made the one that persistently delivered was DJT. It just kept sliding down on a schedule. It had places to be, somewhere between $0 and $2, as it seemed at the time.\n\nSo I yolod over 40k on a bet I thought would take a day or two at most. And to make it more profitable I reduced the expiration date to only a couple of weeks, so I could get more contracts for the price.\n\nAnd then DJT shot up, changing trajectory that has been very predictable up to that point.\n\nWhy? Because it trades on sentiment, not fundamentals. Because market conditions. Because boohoo some evil hedgefund managers buy up shares so they can sell shorts and the low trade volume makes it easy to manipulate the stock price? BULLSHIT. These are self-delusions and lies. I don't know why, and never will, because I'm a retail trader and not an institution. \n\nTHE EASIEST LIE IS THE ONE YOU TELL YOURSELF.\n\nI can do my own research, sure, but I don't have the time to make it a full time job. Because of this, I will not have all the information that professionals have at their disposal. I hardly know what questions to ask.\n\nA couple days later, looking at DJT (it should bounce down any day now!) I bought another put, this time aiming for $29 (it was trading around $30). I think they call it 'revenge trading' or 'emotional trading'. Don't do that.\n\nDon't double down on a bad bet. Our brains use a lot of cheat codes to make snap decisions in stressful situations. We get adrenaline, our hearts start racing, our palms start sweating and our brains shut down higher brain functions to improve reaction time, known as 'fight or flight' response. It's great for hunting tigers and wolves. It's a really bad idea to do this when math is involved. And our tech is evolving faster than our bodies.\n\nIf you think you might be getting upset and not thinking things through, it's time to stop for the day and come back to it in the morning.\n\nWhat else? Don't bet more than 10% of your port on any one company or event. Diversify. \n\nIf you keep betting an increasing amount of money, no matter how certain the odds are, eventually the revolver drum will find the one bullet that will take you out in the Russian roulette you build out of your option contract. You're building a mouse trap to catch yourself, so uh, pad the walls a little. Make it a bit comfy.\n\nAs for me, I think my best option (teehee) is to fold and liquidate those bets on Monday on the best terms I can find, so I stop chasing the sunk cost fallacy and invest in something that can be more predictable in turning a profit. But I'm open to suggestions! I can't say that it's not tempting to let my puts ride all the way to $0. Part of me keeps wondering if it sinks down to 28 this week for no reason at all. But I also recognize this as a stage of grief known as 'bargaining'. \n\nI also believe DJT is still a penny stock that will go to $2 in September when Trump cashes out his cut and the price goes down, but my contracts don't have that long. Until September, it will fluctuate wildly, 1-15% a day in either direction as foreign interests and local patriots press buttons to make the money machine go brrr for fun and profit.\n\nCould I straddle it and make some money back? Sure, but there are safer ways to make money right now and I'm going to focus on things with higher probabilities of success. \n\nThis was the most expensive lesson of my life and if you read this far, you got it for free. You're welcome.\n\nSo stop munching on those crayons and think about contingency plans instead of throwing all your money on the next \"sure thing\". Options give you higher profits but there is a cost. And that cost is, you can lose everything. When a share price goes down, shares usually don't drop 30% in a day. \n\nSo if you don't want your epitaph to be \"expired worthless\", think a little harder and double check the dates before you piss your money and metaphors against the wind.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Your port is the pencil.
