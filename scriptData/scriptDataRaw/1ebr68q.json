  "selftext": "Forenote: Im a technical person, A developer, this will be a technical DD to show how intel is failing to do their basic business model of manufacturing CPUs.\n\nOver the past month or so Intels customers have been becoming increasing irrate about CPUs just flat out dying after various finger pointing from Intel being debunked.\n\nI first caught wind of intels failures when a friends system started to become unstable, he would crash in games and sometimes doing mundane tasks. It all came to a clicking point when his systems files started becoming corrupted and he needed to attempt reinstalling windows. The attempts failed, windows couldnt even install without corrupted files, sometimes it would install and look fine, but running a verification shows that various system files were still corrupted but not important enough for the system to boot successfully. He would still get various crashes doing mundane things and gaming. It was basically a working brick at this point.\n\nSo i got my research hat on, and discovered various reddit users on r/pcmasterrace  were also reporting instability with their PCs. Not alot tho, this has been the wierd thing, Intel has such a large CPU failure rate, but not alot of reports which caught everyone by suprise. It started to make sense, the causes of the crashes were different for everything. Users were reporting issues with Nvidia, Issues with RAM, and issues with corrupted data. Obviously to any layman, these issues dont instantly point to an issue with the CPU. With GPU errors, Nvidia initially got heat, but Nvidia quickly debunked the issue reporting the GPUs that were returned were fully functional and had no issues.\n\nSo I pulled out my handy dandy debug tools since my friend managed to get windows installed and it kinda runs. The first tests I ran were memory block verification. This validates that the memory is able to hold data immutably, after 4 hours the tests finished all green, the memory was stable and wasnt corrupting data. (its worth noting that the memory test software I used was very CPU lite so the CPU has little chance to corrupt the data its self, this is a stark difference to the Drive tests I ran.).\n\nSince my friend was getting corrupted files almost everytime he install anything, I ran the disk debug tools, these pull the S.M.A.R.T data from the drive and run various read and write tests. The S.M.A.R.T data came back green, the drive was reporting it had no errors or irregularies and was functioning fine, So i moved to the read and write tests, all red, the drive had a 90% file currption rate, I pulled the S.M.A.R.T data again, All green, the drive was still reporting it was functioning correctly.\n\nAt this point, anyone would deduce they had a bad drive that was misbehaving, leading to the decreased number of CPU failure reports. After all, How can you say the CPU is bad when you have corrupt files? Many people forget how much the CPU is responsable for. When you read files or write files, its the CPU that tells the Drive what to store and where and what to read and where it is on the disk to read it from. and as i said, the software I used to test the drives is CPU intensive, it uses the the CPU to generate random data to store on the drive and hashes that data to verify it. So a bad CPU = Currupted data on the drive.\n\nLuckly my friend has 4 drives, So I told him to take out the \"bad\" drive and put in another one, I ran all my tests again and same result, the drive was reporting it was functional, but all the data was corrupted. The result was the same with all the drives tested. Now, this is a luxary many people dont have. Many people would get corrupted data on their drive and think the drive is dying and get a new one. However with 4 tests samples all failing the same way when days ago they were all fine is a very low chance.\n\nNow for the kicker, Intel has a tool to verify that the Intel CPU you have is a genuine Intel CPU, I guess intel has a problem of china making fake intel CPUs??? Ive never seen any but what the hell, its a useful tools since its does some basic CPU level checks. So i ran the verifier tool and its first test for a genuine CPU comes back green, Cool, it is a real Intel CPU. Memory test comes back green (We alreadt tested this soo good), next was the Graphics tests. Failed, the CPU was attempting to send data to the GPU and it corrupted the GPU memory.\n\nSo now we have 2 symptoms.\n\n* Disk data corruption\n* GPU memory corruption\n\nMy friend has Nvidia GPU and Nvidia previously debunked any issues with their GPUs. But we have a common cause, Intel CPUs are corrupting data when sending it to another device in the system (except RAM), Data sent to a disk gets corrupted and data sent to the GPU gets corrupted, which would explain the game crashes. Various other tests passed from boost speed changing, Wifi tests and math operations.\n\nAfter I finished all the tests and determed the issue is with the CPU, my friend RMA'd the CPU. This is where more troubles start. Intel refused the RMA, citing user damage, According to intel all the issues my friend was having was his fault and he caused the damage, After it was refused, I filed the RMA for him, to the same response, but because im a stickler I pushed for more info, Intel was refusing the RMA because of overclocking done by the motherboard. This is a previous blame game intel played, they were blaming Motherboards for putting in stock overclocks on CPUs causing them to fail, but this wasnt the case with my friend, his motherboard wasnt even stock overclocked, but intel refused it anyway.\n\nAfter this point is when the waterfall started coming down, a advanced tech-youtuber posted an exposé about intels CPU failures. See: [Intel has a HUGE problem - Level1Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzHcrbT5D_Y) the curtains were starting to fall, Apparently Game developers and datacenters (Intels BIGGEST customers) were getting large amounts of CPU failures specificly with intel CPUs. Now datacenters are normally quiet about this type of thing, opting to sort their issues directly with intel, but intel is turning away datacenters RMA's of thousands of CPUs, these datacenters has since publicly reported they are dropping intel systems from their products and only supporting AMD systems from now on. Intel has lost their largest customer base, because of their defective products and refusing to take responsability for the product inherit flaw.\n\nIntel is hoping this goes unnoticed, since reports are still low of CPUs failing because the errors are random and different each time and users dont know their CPU is defective, there isnt a big in your face \"The Intel CPU in this system has errored\" its always an error with something else, which is caused by the CPU. So intel is betting on customers blaming other manufactures like they did with Nvidia when this all started.\n\nTimeline of events:\n\n* **\\[Dec 2022\\]** The first instances of \"Out of Video Memory\" issues on 13th Gen Core i9 CPUs were reported back in 2022.

This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it's overvolted. \n\nMeteor Lake isn't affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially.\n\n\n\nSource 2: \n\nI never worked directly on Raptor Lake \\[Intel Design Engineer\\], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. \n\nI can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process...\n\n\n\nSource 3: \n\nI \\[Intel Foundry Services\\] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it's also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March & June of 2023. \n\nIt was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away.\n\nTo be clear, I don't know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it's an issue that wasn't ",

This is an inherent flaw that would be in Bartlett too it&#39;s overvolted. </p>\n\n<p>Meteor Lake isn&#39;t affected, and Emerald Rapids is unlikely be effected materially.</p>\n\n<p>Source 2: </p>\n\n<p>I never worked directly on Raptor Lake [Intel Design Engineer], but I did have exposure to Alder Lake, and I can confirm that they were very concerned about the ring bus getting damaged if the voltage was pushed too high. </p>\n\n<p>I can also confirm that Raptor Lake was rushed through the design and validation process...</p>\n\n<p>Source 3: </p>\n\n<p>I [Intel Foundry Services] can tell you that Raptor Lake was rushed through our Fab in Arizona in record time, but it&#39;s also produced in other fabs. However, this location (Arizona) is notable because I can confirm that there was an Oxidation issue caused by some failure in our HVAC system between March &amp; June of 2023. </p>\n\n<p>It was so bad that Keyvan Esfarjani had to fly in to make decision about which wafers (which cost as much as a Model X each) needed to be thrown away.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, I don&#39;t know what decision was made, but I do know that this event DID happen. And by the way, it affected Sapphire Rapids yields as well...although I doubt it&#39;s an issue that wasn&#39;t </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Their bottom line will suffer no matter what they do. The problem I see with puts is that INTC didn't pump at all on AI, and they will be supported by US administration, no matter who wins the election. On top of that AMD just delayed Ryzen 9000 launch due to \"insufficient quality\", catching this a week before the release doesn't instill confidence in their quality assurance process, and Intel isn't above smearing competition. They will spin it as positive (see, others also have problems, our market share isn't shrinking anytime soon) and the stock will hover around current price for months.",

Their bottom line will suffer no matter what they do. The problem I see with puts is that INTC didn&#39;t pump at all on AI, and they will be supported by US administration, no matter who wins the election. On top of that AMD just delayed Ryzen 9000 launch due to &quot;insufficient quality&quot;, catching this a week before the release doesn&#39;t instill confidence in their quality assurance process, and Intel isn&#39;t above smearing competition. They will spin it as positive (see, others also have problems, our market share isn&#39;t shrinking anytime soon) and the stock will hover around current price for months.</p>\n</div>",
