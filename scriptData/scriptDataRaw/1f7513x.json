  "selftext": "Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.\n\nThe company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.\n\nIts sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.\n\nIn contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.\n\nLi Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.\n\nAito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).\n\nLower-priced cars hitting the market\n\nNio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.\n\nThe company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.\n\nXpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.\n\nThe company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.\n\nGeely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.\n\nUndercutting Tesla and going global\n\nZeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.\n\nBYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.\n\nIf BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.\n\nXiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.\n\nThat indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.\n\nThe smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/02/byd-sales-hit-a-record-in-august-despite-broader-china-ev-slowdown.html",

Further you cant use Tesla as an example because they are the market mover. \n\nNone of these newer companies would be making eVs if not Tesla and the state of CA and US government. China companies are copies and are losing money (except Byd) despite already having scale. How pathetic is that? And yet they are still being financed. Why? The answer is China is trying to corner the market and sink competition. They  are not doing it to be competitive. If they wanted competition they would allow companies to fail so that the better ones will succeed just like we do here.",

Further you cant use Tesla as an example because they are the market mover. </p>\n\n<p>None of these newer companies would be making eVs if not Tesla and the state of CA and US government. China companies are copies and are losing money (except Byd) despite already having scale. How pathetic is that? And yet they are still being financed. Why? The answer is China is trying to corner the market and sink competition. They  are not doing it to be competitive. If they wanted competition they would allow companies to fail so that the better ones will succeed just like we do here.</p>\n</div>",

That's how they reduced costs and ensured quality.\n\nChinese automakers are in a cutthroat competition with each other in their domestic market. That's how they figured out how to be competitive at such prices and iterate so quickly. They're on their 7th or 8th gen of hybrids. \n\nThere's this weird \"Schrodinger's Chinese economy\" view in the West that's gained popularity. In which they're both projected to collapse at any time, and yet the Chinese government also has endless amounts of money to fund all their major corporations, which are claimed to not be profitable by Western observers. It's pure cope.\n\nThe thought that the people who have been the world's factory for decades might be more efficient at manufacturing than anyone else never seems to be an option on the table for some reason.\n\nAs for not being able to compete on price, read about how non-Chinese automakers have slashed their prices and extended warranties to compete with Chinese EVs in Australia. They're all imported. None of them are made there.\n\nThey can sell them for those prices in the US as well, they just don't want to, and they don't have to because they can lobby government to avoid competition instead.",

That&#39;s how they figured out how to be competitive at such prices and iterate so quickly. They&#39;re on their 7th or 8th gen of hybrids. </p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s this weird &quot;Schrodinger&#39;s Chinese economy&quot; view in the West that&#39;s gained popularity. In which they&#39;re both projected to collapse at any time, and yet the Chinese government also has endless amounts of money to fund all their major corporations, which are claimed to not be profitable by Western observers. It&#39;s pure cope.</p>\n\n<p>The thought that the people who have been the world&#39;s factory for decades might be more efficient at manufacturing than anyone else never seems to be an option on the table for some reason.</p>\n\n<p>As for not being able to compete on price, read about how non-Chinese automakers have slashed their prices and extended warranties to compete with Chinese EVs in Australia. They&#39;re all imported. None of them are made there.</p>\n\n<p>They can sell them for those prices in the US as well, they just don&#39;t want to, and they don&#39;t have to because they can lobby government to avoid competition instead.</p>\n</div>",
