They’re both injectables though and thinking towards the long-term personally I don’t think injectables for obesity treatment are the future. \n\nFor the long-term imo, the one who wins in the obesity space is whoever nails the oral treatment strategy, including having favorable \ncost and production capacity. That means amycretin vs orforglipron. \n\nI think people will prefer oral vs injectable at a slight cost to effectiveness. In that sense I lean towards focusing on that race for oral treatment over injectable treatments.",

So to me, this just feels like FOMO and people wanting to take profits. Again, I do not have a finance background. But to your point, I don&#39;t think the company stock price will dramatically decrease, this miracle drug will continue to be in demand. What I obviously can&#39;t predict is how much higher the stock will go.</p>\n</div>",
