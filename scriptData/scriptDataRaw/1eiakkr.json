There's a good history of Nvidia shipping products knowing fully well they had issues, then try to address it in firmware to cover it up, then fighting it out in following lawsuits. On top of my mind, other disputes include conflict with Samsung and Qualcomm where Nvidia tried to block Samsung tablets from shipping, failing GPUs sent to partners (and not disclosing it despite being aware) that caused severe problems for Apple, Dell and HP, there's probably more I can't recall. That doesn't even begin to touch questionable marketing, misleading prices that screw over both consumers and board partners, paper launches, extremely closed sourced platforms, and overall a very pushy, controlling and highly aggressive competition strategy that is perfectly fine hurting other businesses as long as they can get away with it. Or if they can't, get into a lawsuit and intentionally flex their war chests so smaller companies die after a decade of court battles, even if everyone knows Nvidia is in the wrong. Their products are good and they pivot to chase trends well. They definitely take advantage of it in any way they can, from gaming to VR to crypto (fun lawsuits about them lying about their earnings here), to pro viz to data centers, to automotive to machine learning, to mobile to streaming services. Each of these had varying degrees of success, some you can say are complete disasters, but what matters is they aggressively take on these new markets, and I do mean aggressively. Once they establish themselves, they charge higher and higher prices while offering less and less, and adopts strategies that strong arm partners and lock out competitors, which really leaves a sour taste in people's mouths, vs wonderful partners you stick with through thick and thin because you both believe each side's doing important work and the world will benefit from. Signing a deal with Nvidia always feels like shaking hands with the devil with how cut throat they are. If anyone gets a bad deal because life is uncertain, Nvidia will make sure it's on you and they make sure the money goes to them. There's also the typical questionable marketing strategies over the years and conflicts/threats towards independent media you'd expect from big corporations.\n\nOverall many enthusiast consumer sentiment from the gaming side is that Nvidia is that of a very anti-consumer and anti-competition one. My personal experience with pro viz is it's alright, just business as usual as the premium is just a business expense. There's not been much alternatives to Nvidia with high end workstations or render farms as cuda superiority heavily locked out many 3d programs from using AMD hardware well on the Windows side, but Apple moved away from Nvidia and embraced OpenCL with AMD, giving creatives that option if they need lower power, think video editing and such. Things have finally changed in recent years (thank you Blender and countless other solutions + optimizations). Can't speak for other sides of Nvidia's business. \n\nRegarding anti-trust, there's also that attempt for Nvidia to acquire Arm from SoftBank a few years back, but that collapsed under regularity pressure (thank god, I cannot imagine a megacorp like Nvidia pretty much controlling the majority of mobile chips' underlying licensing in one go and basically take over the mobile market on the planet). I'm sure there's plenty others but can't remember.\n\nAnother funny thing with Nvidia is their insistence of \"my way or the highway.\" When they bump into another equally stubborn company like Apple, all that happens is a decade of both sides refusing to admit defeat and constantly cutting off the other side by poaching industry players, while always putting the blame on the other side. I actually never followed up on that lawsuit where Nvidia's GPUs were literally falling off of the motherboards they were soldered on in MacBooks, and Apple had to cover costs at their own expense because Nvidia refused to pay them (while paying the other partners that sued). All I know is, years ago I looked it up and both sides were still dragging it out. Dunno if it's been resolved or if they are still at it. They certainly have the cash to go for another decade.\n\nTheir relationship sure hasn't gotten better either, with each side isolating the other at every chance they get. Don't see a partnership between them anytime soon. Both companies are just like that, aggressive, controlling, refusing to take the short end of the stick and refusing to admit they are anything but perfect. The news of Apple announcing they are not using Nvidia chips might have surprised others, but if you know anything about their history, it's the most obvious thing ever. If Nvidia and Apple work together one day, either we've almost achieved world peace, or we're at the brink of nuclear holocaust.",

Theoretically, they'd be the best at innovating because of the money they could throw at R&D, but that doesn't happen, of course.\n\nOne really bad aspect of a monopoly that people don't think of is that all of the economy's eggs are in one basket. For example, there's very few meat packers left - that industry has consolidated a lot. Due to the size of the companies, contamination means lots of people that can get sick.

A monopoly has higher economies of scale, and the money for large capital expenditures. Theoretically, they&#39;d be the best at innovating because of the money they could throw at R&amp;D, but that doesn&#39;t happen, of course.</p>\n\n<p>One really bad aspect of a monopoly that people don&#39;t think of is that all of the economy&#39;s eggs are in one basket. For example, there&#39;s very few meat packers left - that industry has consolidated a lot. Due to the size of the companies, contamination means lots of people that can get sick. And if war breaks out, the lack of production being spread out over many locations means it&#39;s easy to cripple a country</p>\n</div>",
