  "selftext": "After a Sunday afternoon post with high meme-content got low engagement… Posting this update as markets open, with less pithiness. *Note: With the recent assassination attempt, expect higher risk. Update otherwise remains how I wrote it initially Saturday afternoon, but I’m pretty nervous about the market’s risk tolerance.*\n \n**SUMMARY/INTRO: 1 Week and Winning**\nCatalysts came in faster than I expected, but supported my thesis. JOBY provided the first 10-bagger on 5.5c weeklies (I missed that one). ACHR provided another 6-bagger (got that one).  Longer-dated plays from my Sunday 7/7 post were all up as of market close Friday.  Share price increases through 7/12, between +10-26%, have not exceeded either my speculative or “professional” analyst’s Price Targets. Risk of retrace has increased but not beyond tolerance for my expectation yet.\n \nI want to reiterate that my analysis is *not dependent on or anchored to the eVTOL sector’s genuine long-run viability.* eVTOL “Urban Air Mobility” may never be any more popular than current helicopters, and thus have a tiny fraction of the projected market size.  Analysis is based on expected price increases as hype and investment builds during the final push to operations between now and 2026. What happens after that as companies enter steady operations is not the most important factor *to my current evaluations.* That said, feel free to offer opinions about long-term viability as that does influence investor confidence over the analysis horizon.\n \n**Finally, short-dated speculative options are high risk.** I am literally treating them as a “gambling expense.” I continue to have high conviction in more 10x-plus opportunities from now to EOY 2026, as JOBY demonstrated, but it’s very easy to crater to zero. Speculate within your risk tolerance.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**TL;DR, what buy button to smash? Still ACHR 8/16 calls for now**\n \nSince this is being posted near market open, suggested strike changes based on pre-market and early Monday price behavior:\n \n* **ACHR sustains $5+ through 1pm:** 8/16 6c or go for weekly 6c to try and catch a parabolic rise on delta hedging and hype.\n \n* **ACHR below $5 Monday Morning:** Dip should slow at 4.7-4.8.   split between 7/19 and 8/16 5c if price stabilizes above 4.7.  Only buy 8/16 5c if it settles all the way back to 4.5 or lower.\n \n**Note:** ACHR’s status as the current best balance between risk and reward has *decreased,* as my evaluation is tied to expecting catalysts, and they just had one. However, ACHR is still hovering well below JOBY’s market cap and price per share, and analyst PTs. ACHR still has room to increase while still being within “expected” valuation, and should have at least 1 technical catalyst at or before next ER.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Upcoming Sector Catalysts**\n \n* **July 22nd** The Farnsworth International Airshow: with appearances by several private eVTOL companies (Beta, Wisk) and EVEX/Embraer, and a speech by Vertical Aerospace (public).  Sustainable/Future of Flight topics are highly visible, and may result in a sector-wide boost.\n \n* **July 26th – August: The Paris Olympics is scheduled to have demonstration eVTOL flights,** provided by Volocopter (sadly, private). If major media picks up and showcases the flights, this will be extremely high profile for the whole sector.  *This confirmation just came in this weekend after being in doubt. Front-run now before FOMO hits.*\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Company Notes and Options Plays**\nMajor startups gained and sustained gains across the board. Percent gains are from open 7/7 to AH close 7/12.  TXT also has an ER this Thursday.  90c probably is the play based on OI/Volume/IV.\n \n**Vertical Aerospace (+12.8%, close ~.895)** ER August, but no date confirmed, PT:  1.09 (total joke)\n \nPrice is increasing as V2 prototype becomes a reality. Vertical’s orderbook is strong. However, they’re stuck between getting above 1.00 to stay listed on NYSE and diluting because they need cash on hand. When they get V2 off the ground in a test flight (NLT EOM August), share price will trend towards $2.XX before dilution plans announced in September.\n \n**Play (Low Risk):** Shares, hold until test flight catalyst then sell. **High Risk:** 10/18 2.5c @ .05 *might* pay off if the price runs to 2.1 or better before dilution, but GTFO as soon as you start seeing any profit.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n**Joby – (+26.6%, close 6.61)** ER August, no date confirmed. PT: 7.00\n \nJOBY’s steep run-up makes me wary of jumping in, but, existing positions from last week can be rolled up. Their cash position is excellent, but they aren’t developmentally ahead of Archer, who has 1/3rd their valuation and is thus more attractive. Still, the hydrogen fuel flight was a big deal, and they showed continued gains at T+1 from the catalyst, so grabbing monthlies or October 7-8c seems viable. Sector-wide catalysts should boost JOBY due to their front-runner status amongst public startups.\n \n**Play: (Normal Risk)** 8/16 or 10/18 7c. 7/19 6p or 7/19 ATM Straddle could pay out.\n\n&nbsp;\n \n**Archer (ACHR) – (+12.0%. close 5.05)** ER: possibly 8/08, not confirmed. PT: 10\n \nArcher’s catalyst was more business oriented and milder than JOBY’s, and they’re coming from a lower starting price.  A technical catalyst, such as a test flight or FAA Type Certification schedule, will probably push them above 7.  Market capitalization compared to Joby *suggests* ACHR has room to double in share price to catch up to the currently-larger company, given ACHR’s larger planned manufacturing volume and revenue generation plans.\n \n**Play (Normal Risk):** described above. **High Risk** 7/19 6c @ .03-.05 might be a 10-bag.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n**EHang (EH) – (+9.8%, close 15.86)** ER: Mid August (15-19th), PT: 24.40\n \nEHang continues to suffer from “being a Chinese company” – they have strong beats on revenue for the last year, and have recently announced large cash revenue from delivery of an order.  They have eVTOLs flying in China.  With ACHR/JOBY moving to certification, EH is on the hook to keep claiming they are ahead. Additionally the “Third Plenum” is starting in China this week, which *may* emphasize electric vehicles, lithium/battery, and related technologies as a primary focus. The Price Target, company claims, and dominance of the Chinese market support hype growth, but a miss will be devastating.\n \n**Play (Higher Risk):** 8/16 14p/20c **strangle,** possibly wait to see if this hits their ER date, and plan to hold until expiry unless major movement occurs prior.\n \n&nbsp;\n\n**Lilium – (+15.5%, .993)** - Next ER not announced yet. Likely September.\n \nLilium is interesting. It’s a Regional carrier that will try to meet ranges and use airframes like the one just demonstrated by JOBY at over 500 miles.  However, it is quite a bit behind JOBY and cash position is uncertain.  However, they are pursuing *debt* funding, not equity, which may prevent dilution risk.\n \n**Play:** Shares, since they’re cheap, or, 8/16 1c (high risk) or 10/18 1.5c (lower-ish risk) hoping to catch good technical news, debt not dilutive funding, and sector catalysts putting them ITM.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: Forgot to include **EVEX** which is still actively diluting, but apparently at $4/share. Play remains either trying to get shares or ITM options which capture the move up to $4. Editedit (10AM): EVEX is already pushing $4 now and Embraer/EVEX will demo at FIA starting next week.  If they announce their funding round is complete this could run.  The option chain is still balls though, low OI and no Volume. Tentatively, 10/18 5c is a longer play, but 8/16 2.5c seems like the only other viable option still.\n \n&nbsp;\n \n**Gambling Positions/Report:** Although I missed buying JOBY weeklies despite seeing their flight test announcement on Instagram before market open, I caught ACHR 4.5c weeklies for solid returns. My relatively small gambling portfolio, which I catastrophically destroyed revenge trading on 6/28, has rebounded from a low of $1,800 to $7,400 this week. *Positions here exclude my IRA for brevity, which has longer dated calls and between 100 and 500 shares of each company.*\n \nACHR – 45 8/16 4.5c (+300%), 5 ACHR 10/18 5c (+145%), 50 ACHR 7/19 6c (.02 Cost basis to catch a second catalyst/continued strength from 7/15->7/19).\n \nEhang – 5x 8/16 18c (-13%, bid/ask spread loss, no actual price change)\n \nVertical – 276x 1/16/2025 5c (oops lul).  545 shares.\n \nEVEX/JOBY/LILM – no current positions in my gambling portfolio, IRA has shares and LEAPs.\n \n**Moves this week** - all actions after my PDT flag is removed (oops)\n \n**Definite:** I plan to add 25 LILM 1.5c for October and 25 LILM 8/16 1c.\n \n**Likely:** More EH 18c 8/16.\n \n**Conditional:** More ACHR calls, but waiting on Mon/Tue price action first, since I’m already covered for a weekly shock spike to 7.\n \n**Backup/Limit buy:** Vertical shares and 10/18 or Jan ’25 2.5c if I can grab them @.05 cost basis.",

ACHR only maintained Friday's gains (barely) by EOD after exhibiting its usual \"premarket pump into big open dump\" behavior, showing above 5.5 premarket... which has an unclear cause that some claim is shorts closing positions. Meanwhile JOBY ran 20+% and then 6% on both Fri and Mon.\n\n* Joby's \"technical\" catalyst is probably a lot more hype generating, that's a big jump for a new technology (hydrogen regional flight). Moreover, Joby's cash position is excellent. However, Joby's operational timeline, order book, and operational territory *seems* less clear than ACHR's.\n\n* At this point, it's pretty clear that JOBY does have legs to clear 10+ over time if they maintain positive news and keep cash position high, or declare they have the cash to see through to revenue generation.\n\n* Meanwhile, ACHR's \"business side\" and ambitiously large production line plans still makes me think they're undervalued, while recognizing that they may struggle if they show an obvious need to raise more equity and dilute.  Q2 earnings are going to be a BIG deal for ACHR I think.\n\n**Predictions EOW:** ACHR sits no higher than 6 and likely barely bleeds to 5.5 on current news, unless they reveal a big technical or financial catalyst (not another \"business\" catalyst).  JOBY settles at 7-7.5 absent any other catalyst.\n\n\n**Vertical**\n\nSurprising strength from them.  I think investors are clued into them being successful soon with a new test flight. We might see a continued climb into the test flight instead of investors waiting on it before jumping in.  Surprisingly high risk tolerance if that's the case, but the company's capitalization is quite small so even a few dedicated small investors could create a spike.  **Prediction EOW:** struggles to stay above 1 still, possibly with a big Green Day to 1.1 before retracing. Stays quiet this week, doubtful we get a test flight update until next week, considering they pushed back from flying at FIA next week to give themselves more time to prep.\n\n**Ehang** did the \"Chinese company\" thing and dumped with all the other Chinese stocks today on political news most likely. Third Plenum coming, so volatility is likely. Bleeds down unless they get tagged as important during the economic summit.\n\n**EVEX** Appreciated to their target equity sales value, somewhat unsurprisingly.  Embraer is at FIA next week; if they announce their equity round is complete and the price is solid at 4 still, I see a run to 4.5 by EOW and 5 EOM if FIA goes well for them.\n\n**LILM** No noise here, expect flat through the week.",
