No div with buyback being used to sterilise stock comp.</p>\n\n<p>If everything goes perfectly in next 5 years, they&#39;ll be at 25x current mkt cap.</p>\n\n<p>Prefer to buy at 25x (buying at a premium to normal entry to pay for the competitive position) and wait for the market to get excited over the next 5 years and sell when at 55x at double the NI. NI will be about 2.5bio, mkt cap at 55x will be ~135bio, and this would be a 300% total return. If multiples stay at 25x entry, return is 15% CAGR. If I buy tiday at 55x and multiples stay at the level, I get the 15%. But if they shrink to 25x, I flatline over 5 years.  Prefer to position for the upside.</p>\n\n<p>So what do I need to see to consider? A rout to say 30bio mkt cap, perhaps as part of a broader mkt collapse, rather than anything idiosyncratic. So I&#39;d wait for 145 then revisit.</p>\n</div>",
