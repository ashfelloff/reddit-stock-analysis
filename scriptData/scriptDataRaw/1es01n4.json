          "body": "except it's much more complicated than that? NVIDIA's moat is both CUDA and hardware but there are other indirect moats -- for example, ML frameworks integration with CUDA is strong (Pytorch, Tensorflow, JAX) and open source models such as ONNX and ONNXRuntime are sort of heavily influenced by Microsoft. It's not as simple as creating an \"ez software layer\" when Sagemaker and Vertex AI have been around for quite some time now. Besides, CUDA and cuDNN is not even in the software layer. First, they have to be able to create an incredibly efficient chip for both training and inference, second a CUDA-equivalent, third to steer ML frameworks to force it to adopt a new non-CUDA architecture, fourth is to force researchers and developers to develop new models catered to the new hardwares alongside all dependencies, etc. People who hasn't trained complex models or created them or deployed them are so uninformed about how tightly integrated NVIDIA is to everything.\n\nTech moats are a different kind of moat. Integrations are one strong thing in tech. And NVIDIA's moat is just incredibly complex. Companies that serve AI products will have to redesign their huge pipeline, re-do bunch of their codes, retrain some models, etc. when a new non-CUDA thing and non-NVIDIA hardware happens. This is incredibly expensive for sometimes such a little gain. \n\nEdit: added more",

NVIDIA&#39;s moat is both CUDA and hardware but there are other indirect moats -- for example, ML frameworks integration with CUDA is strong (Pytorch, Tensorflow, JAX) and open source models such as ONNX and ONNXRuntime are sort of heavily influenced by Microsoft. It&#39;s not as simple as creating an &quot;ez software layer&quot; when Sagemaker and Vertex AI have been around for quite some time now. Besides, CUDA and cuDNN is not even in the software layer. First, they have to be able to create an incredibly efficient chip for both training and inference, second a CUDA-equivalent, third to steer ML frameworks to force it to adopt a new non-CUDA architecture, fourth is to force researchers and developers to develop new models catered to the new hardwares alongside all dependencies, etc. People who hasn&#39;t trained complex models or created them or deployed them are so uninformed about how tightly integrated NVIDIA is to everything.</p>\n\n<p>Tech moats are a different kind of moat. Integrations are one strong thing in tech. And NVIDIA&#39;s moat is just incredibly complex. Companies that serve AI products will have to redesign their huge pipeline, re-do bunch of their codes, retrain some models, etc. when a new non-CUDA thing and non-NVIDIA hardware happens.
