  "selftext": "Walmart raised its forecast for the year on Thursday, as quarterly revenue grew nearly 5%, the company’s stores and website drew more visits and sales outside the grocery department improved. \n\nThe discounter beat Wall Street’s expectations for sales and profits.\n\nWalmart said it now expects sales to rise by 3.75% to 4.75% for the full year, and adjusted earnings to come in between $2.35 and $2.43 per share. It previously said it expected to be on the high end or slightly above its initial full-year guidance, which called for net sales growth of 3% to 4% and adjusted earnings per share of between $2.23 and $2.37.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said the company’s brighter outlook reflects strength in the first half of the year. \n\n“We see, among our members and customers, that they remain choiceful, discerning, value-seeking, focusing on things like essentials rather than discretionary items, but importantly, we don’t see any additional fraying of consumer health,” Rainey said.\n\nHe said every month of the quarter was “relatively consistent.”\n\nWalmart saw another promising indicator: Sales of general merchandise, such as lawn and garden supplies, were positive for the first time in 11 quarters. He said those sales were up only slightly, however. \n\nHere’s what the discounter reported for the fiscal second quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, according to a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 67 cents adjusted vs. 65 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $169.34 billion vs. $168.63 billion\n\nWalmart’s net income dropped to $4.5 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the three-month period that ended July 31, compared with $7.89 billion, or 97 cents per share, in the year-ago period.\n\nRevenue rose from $161.63 billion in the year-ago quarter. \n\nComparable sales for Walmart U.S. rose 4.2% in the second quarter, excluding fuel, compared with the year-ago period, which topped analysts’ expectations. The industry metric includes sales from stores and clubs open for at least a year.\n\nAt Sam’s Club, comparable sales rose 5.2%, excluding fuel, in line with analysts’ expectations.\n\nE-commerce sales jumped 21% globally and 22% in the U.S.\n\nWalmart provided the latest window into the health of American households and the outlook for the broader economy as investors and economists seek clarity.\n\nAs the nation’s largest retailer, Walmart is uniquely positioned to offer insights into where the consumer is spending and scrimping. The company’s reputation for value has boosted sales over the past two years, as inflation drove more higher-income shoppers to its stores and website.\n\nInflation has moderated and returned to historic levels, according to July data from the U.S. Department of Labor. The consumer price index, which measures prices of a broad mix of goods and services, rose 2.9% last month compared to a year earlier. That is the lowest level since March of 2021.\n\nYet prices are hovering much higher than pre-pandemic, frustrating and stretching consumers. A jobs report from the Labor Department early this month also raised concerns and prompted a sharp stock market selloff, as jobs growth slowed and the unemployment rate rose more than expected.\n\nSome companies’ earnings reports have added to worries about the economy. Home Depot on Tuesday beat quarterly expectations for earnings and revenue, but warned of slow sales in the back half of the year and consumer caution, even among its more middle- and upper-income customer base.\n\nShares of Walmart closed Wednesday at $68.66. So far this year, the company’s stock is up nearly 31%, outpacing the approximately 14% gains of the S&P 500.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/15/walmart-reports-its-earnings-before-the-bell-heres-what-to-expect.html",

          "body": "What Walmart has is 10 min drone delivery, 2 hour grocery delivery, in home delivery and convenience, next day delivery for non grocery. I used to shop so much at Amazon. Returns was pain in the butt. UPS lines were crazy long any time of the day. Walmart picks returns from my house and I don't have to box it. Amazon don't have grocery delivery near me nor fuel savings nor do they provide travel savings. I canceled my Amazon membership and got walmart plus instead and saved money on membership. My travel saving this year alone paid for next 10 years worth of walmart membership. I have started to see most of my neighbors started to switch to walmart plus. If we do need something from Amazon, we order it by adding other niknacks to make $35 min basket. \n\nOh yeah! Walmart is going to be eating their breakfast, lunch, dinner and thier ice cream.",
