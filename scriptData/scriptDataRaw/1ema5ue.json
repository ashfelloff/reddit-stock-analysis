My hypothesis is that these rocks will dramatically appreciate in value due to an increased market awareness, combined with geopolitical and socio-economic transference.   \n\n**Introduction:** In March 2020, when the entire world was preparing for a global pandemic, I decided it was a good idea to take a vacation to Cambodia. At the time, everyone around me was telling me, this was perhaps not a very good idea. A risky idea, an idea with more downsides than up. A poor investment. I rejected this advice, and convinced my girlfriend to come with me. Four days after we arrived, the world was locked down and all the hotels in the country were closed. Our new home for the foreseeable future was in an empty resort in the most remote corner of Cambodia. \n\nIt was here where I [~discovered Blue Zircon.~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_BOLj3xlWDkaT2rC6LCi1RqpgBHG4iu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A deep value asset:** With all the time in the world, nowhere to be and nothing to do, I spent every waking moment learning everything I could about this curious rock. I came to the conclusion that [~Blue Zircon was woefully undervalued and primed for exponential growth.~](https://youtu.be/kwprPvO-YD4?si=biaxx0hxBFFeIr9g)\n\nAt the time, you could visit the mines outside of town and buy a fist full of raw unfaceted blue zircon for around $0.30 per stone. This was to be my cost basis moving forward. \n\nWhat initially got my attention was: \n\n1. [~Blue Zircon is the oldest gemstone on Earth.~ ](https://www.science.org/content/article/oldest-piece-earth-discovered)\n2. [~Blue Zircon is rarer than diamond.~ ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Z0FkxZjwPKFcKSd_3wnflcyFUIom8Cj/view?usp=sharing)\n3.

Although zircons have a respectable hardness for jewelry stones (6 to 7.5), that falls well short of diamond's famous 10. Zircons are far more susceptible to scratching than diamonds. They also have a very brittle tenacity, lower than that of most gemstones. This means their facet edges tend to chip and wear easily.\n\n>...However, any zircons in jewelry should be worn carefully to prevent damage.

Although zircons have a respectable hardness for jewelry stones (6 to 7.5), that falls well short of diamond&#39;s famous 10. Zircons are far more susceptible to scratching than diamonds. They also have a very brittle tenacity, lower than that of most gemstones.

Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they don’t chip when abused. There’s also the fact that actual big money can just re-open mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they won’t, because they suck as precious stones and don’t have any industrial use.

Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near $150-$300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and ‘tokenizing’ blue zircon into a ‘real-world-asset’… but it’s already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants.
