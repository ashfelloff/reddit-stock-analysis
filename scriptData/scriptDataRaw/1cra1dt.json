It can \"see\" the world around you. Sam Altman (CEO of OpenAI) says it is the best interface he's ever used. He said, \"It feels like AI from the movies,\" and he's not wrong. It's magic. You can ask it to look around you and solve math equations, offer outfit suggestions, help you figure out who and what you're looking at, and more. The demos that they [showcased today during their livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/DQacCB9tDaw?si=WR9xjFTpltNX1Ptc) were magical.\n* It can help you navigate the world and physical spaces. This is something that Meta, Humane, and Rabbit have been trying to do with their multi-modal devices ([Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses](https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses), [Humane AI Pin](https://humane.com/), [Rabbit R1](https://www.rabbit.tech/)).\n* It has improved memory and remembers context and details about you, what you do, and what you ask it to do. It's like having a deeply personalized personal assistant. Think Jarvis in Iron Man.\n* It sounds NATURAL and, more importantly, reacts naturally. You can interrupt it mid-sentence, and it'll stop to listen to you, just like a real human. It's akin to the movie \"Her\". There's a reason they made the default voice sound like Scarlett Johansson.\n* They've announced an exclusive MacOS app that integrates seamlessly into your workflow and allows you to upload screenshots to offer feedback on coding or your writing; you can voice chat with it and also have it summarize notes/ meetings. Nothing for windows yet.\n* Siri is terrible as it currently stands. We have a ton of anecdotal evidence. Just look at r/iphone or any discussion around why [Siri has gotten worse over the years](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/169l5o6/siri_is_more_than_useless_at_this_point/). It's no secret that Amazon and Google have proven that their assistants are better in many ways, but they don't have the Apple ecosystem. This is the only reason Siri is remotely tolerable.\n* The [2024 Apple Worldwide Developers Conference](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/) is happening in a little under a month, from June 10th - June 14th. They will be announcing the new features and direction for iOS18. Tim Cook stated on their recent earnings call, \"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration.”\n* Apple scrapped its semi-autonomous electric vehicle project and re-focused on AI [about two months ago](https://www.investopedia.com/apple-scraps-ev-plans-highlighting-shifting-focus-on-ai-8601590).\n* Bloomberg released this article on Friday. [Apple Nears Deal With OpenAI to Put ChatGPT on iPhone](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-11/apple-closes-in-on-deal-with-openai-to-put-chatgpt-on-iphone?embedded-checkout=true). In it, they state that \"The two sides have been finalizing terms for a pact to use ChatGPT features in Apple’s iOS 18, the next iPhone operating system\".\n* Forbes posted this earlier today: [Apple’s New ChatGPT Deal—Here’s What It Means For iPhone Security. ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kateoflahertyuk/2024/05/13/apples-new-chatgpt-deal-heres-what-it-means-for-your-iphone/?sh=68e0793e583e)\n\nI think we're at a pivotal time in tech with AI large language models, which are finally getting to the point where they are refined and fast enough to be harnessed for general-use cases. With its seamless tech, Apple will ride this wave and finally make Siri the magical assistant that it was always supposed to be.\n\n\\*\\*My position is 600 shares bought at an average cost of $186.10, bought right at market close today. I'm planning on holding them long-term. Tomorrow, I'll purchase some long-dated calls. Roast me all you want. I wanted to make sure I had all of my analysis squared away before I bought in.\n\n  \nEdit: I added sources and also added the link about [Project Titan, the semi-autonomous electric vehicle project that Apple has scrapped](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/feb/29/apple-abandons-electric-car-project-for-ai-focus-r/).",
