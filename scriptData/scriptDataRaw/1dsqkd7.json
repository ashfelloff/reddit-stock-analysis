The service was introduced for Facebook and Instagram in Europe last year.\n\n“In the Commission’s preliminary view, this binary choice forces users to consent to the combination of their personal data and fails to provide them a less personalised but equivalent version of Meta’s social networks,” regulators said in a statement Monday.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Meta for comment. The company separately told Reuters in a statement that its ad-supported subscription model “follows the direction of the highest court in Europe and complies with the DMA.”\n\nMeta introduced the new model in response to a ruling from the European Court of Justice, the EU’s top court, last year that a company may offer an “alternative” version of its service that does not rely on data collection for ads. Meta has previously pointed to this ruling as a reason for introducing the subscription offer.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/01/meta-accused-of-failing-to-comply-with-eu-antitrust-rules.html",

Trying to prevent the monopolistic practices of Microsoft or Google is, in my opinion, positive as well.</p>\n\n<p>The 15% of the EU may not seem very impressive, but it&#39;s still significant. Keep in mind China is completely closed to many Western companies, and so is Russia to a large extent. Even with what you call &quot;mad legislation&quot; (which, again, is a matter of opinion), companies try their best to operate in a region that remains relatively very rich.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I know, Threads launched in Europe, but later than in other countries. Apple Intelligence may not, but in any case Apple&#39;s revenue doesn&#39;t depend on it -- it&#39;s an easy decision to make.</p>\n</div>",
