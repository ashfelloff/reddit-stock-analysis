  "selftext": "OK regards listen up!\nThis is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.\n\nNot surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.\n\nThat's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real \"Duck You\" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  \n\nPersistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.\n\nWall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.\n\nI have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.\n\nAt 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.\n\nAt 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.\n\nAt 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.\n\nToo many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!\n\nNow let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.\n\nIntel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing \"guides\". Literally everyone bushing this company.\n\nThere are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.\n\nIntel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka \"Intel Foundry\" and their chip design units aka \"Intel Products\".\n\nWhen you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.\n\nIntel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.\n\nAll those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.\n\n\"Intel lost billions\" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact \"Intel investing billions to make huge money after that\".\n\nHow much money you ask? \n\nI believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).\n\nIntel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. \n\nAs the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :\"never bet against America\".\n\nI'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.\n\nMost importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.\n\nThis is what Wall Street has always been doing.\nNow let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:\n\nTrading close to their book value as low risk factor.\n\nP/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.\n\nMassive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.\n\nThis is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.\n\nSo how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? \n\nBy buying the stock now!\n\nDon't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.\n\nSo what is the bottom line here you say? \n\nForward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! \n\nOn neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! \n\nThat is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.\n\n120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.\n\nHere are my long term positions: \n\nNO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.\nHodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.\n\nAverage price here of 32.2 \n\nThat is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.\n\nYour welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value.",
