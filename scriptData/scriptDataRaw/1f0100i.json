              "body": "That's not a problem at all. We all know that having your money in the market beats having your money out of the market way more often than not. With that established that means we know you are doing the right thing by having 95%+ in the market at all times no matter how you feel over any short period of time. I do the same thing as you. I work in film so my income comes in waves and then can also be dry for months. Sometimes the market goes down and I am actively pulling money out to pay rent, it's a short term risk that works out more often than not. Usually I have less than 1% of my portfolio in cash.\n\nSo with that strategy of being 95%+ in the market at all times established what we are now mostly trying to deal with is not letting the short term emotions of a dip/crash change our long term winning formula of keeping money in the market. We know also from science that the number of actions affects your emotions way more than the weight of them. So if you buy small amounts of shares of stocks as they dip this will have almost as much of an effect of alleviating your negative emotions than if you were making large purchases with more cash. So instead of dumping all your  money into 20 shares at a 10% dip. Buy 5 shares, see where it goes, If it goes down more buy 5 more shares, maybe another 5 shares. Maybe you don't even spend all of your cash because the market goes back up. That's ok because you are already 95%+ in the market.\n\nIf it's a bigger crash like in 2022. You will ultimately end up burning all of your dry powder and if it keeps going down maybe you start to pull a little bit of money out of your bank account just to buy 2 more shares. Maybe you call your brother that has horrible financial sense and tells him to buy META at $90 right now! Just to make you feel better because you have no money left to spend. It's all about keeping your short term emotions from self sabotaging you.\n\nAnother thing you can do, that doesn't require you to carry cash is to sell less volatile stocks to buy other more attractive stocks during a dip. In 2022 I trimmed some of my AAPL shares multiple times because it didn't really go down for a while even though the broader market was down 25+%. I used it to buy META shares that was down 40, 50, 60%+. META ended up being so attractive I sold off all of my All State, Waste Management, Williams-Sonoma and Marriott shares during their dips(Which are great companies that I would have been happy to hold long term) just to buy way more META shares and more CROX shares. All 4 of those stocks have done well since I sold them, but not even half the return that META has had over that time and not quite as good as CROX. Had CROX not gone down below $70 and instead of around $120, who knows I may have sold CROX to buy more Marriott. As META was going up I started trimming some of those shares to buy VZ, WSM(much lower than I had sold it for), and MO. I didn't end up pulling the trigger, but when the recent dip happened I was getting ready to start trimming some MO and VZ to buy more META, GOOGL, PYPL, etc. Whatever revealed itself as the most attractive. What those Dividend stocks allow me to do is collect a 7-10% dividend and then possibly trade a small dip in a stock for a big dip in another stock I like. (Or in this recent case MO actually went up while market went down) To me that is the best of both worlds of being fully leveraged into the market, but also being able to make advantageous trades during a big dip in the market.\n\nWith all of that said, it's all to help combat the feelings that try to sabotage the clear long term strategy of being fully leveraged into the market at all times. And I think you are doing a great job, don't worry that you don't have as much dry powder for a dip as you would want during a dip because you can't build a short term strategy that contradicts your long term strategy in investing.\n\nEdit: I would just like to add there is nothing wrong with having times where you are not in a rush to put your 5% cash to work because nothing seems attractive. There will be times where you feel so strongly that no investment is a guaranteed good investment at the moment and that can override your desire to be fully leveraged into the market. That's ok. The point is you don't want to build habits of constantly feeling like you need to have 20% in cash for a dip.",

So if you buy small amounts of shares of stocks as they dip this will have almost as much of an effect of alleviating your negative emotions than if you were making large purchases with more cash. So instead of dumping all your  money into 20 shares at a 10% dip. Buy 5 shares, see where it goes, If it goes down more buy 5 more shares, maybe another 5 shares. Maybe you don&#39;t even spend all of your cash because the market goes back up. That&#39;s ok because you are already 95%+ in the market.</p>\n\n<p>If it&#39;s a bigger crash like in 2022. You will ultimately end up burning all of your dry powder and if it keeps going down maybe you start to pull a little bit of money out of your bank account just to buy 2 more shares. Maybe you call your brother that has horrible financial sense and tells him to buy META at $90 right now! Just to make you feel better because you have no money left to spend. It&#39;s all about keeping your short term emotions from self sabotaging you.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing you can do, that doesn&#39;t require you to carry cash is to sell less volatile stocks to buy other more attractive stocks during a dip. In 2022 I trimmed some of my AAPL shares multiple times because it didn&#39;t really go down for a while even though the broader market was down 25+%. I used it to buy META shares that was down 40, 50, 60%+. META ended up being so attractive I sold off all of my All State, Waste Management, Williams-Sonoma and Marriott shares during their dips(Which are great companies that I would have been happy to hold long term) just to buy way more META shares and more CROX shares. All 4 of those stocks have done well since I sold them, but not even half the return that META has had over that time and not quite as good as CROX. Had CROX not gone down below $70 and instead of around $120, who knows I may have sold CROX to buy more Marriott. As META was going up I started trimming some of those shares to buy VZ, WSM(much lower than I had sold it for), and MO. I didn&#39;t end up pulling the trigger, but when the recent dip happened I was getting ready to start trimming some MO and VZ to buy more META, GOOGL, PYPL, etc. Whatever revealed itself as the most attractive. What those Dividend stocks allow me to do is collect a 7-10% dividend and then possibly trade a small dip in a stock for a big dip in another stock I like. (Or in this recent case MO actually went up while market went down) To me that is the best of both worlds of being fully leveraged into the market, but also being able to make advantageous trades during a big dip in the market.</p>\n\n<p>With all of that said, it&#39;s all to help combat the feelings that try to sabotage the clear long term strategy of being fully leveraged into the market at all times. And I think you are doing a great job, don&#39;t worry that you don&#39;t have as much dry powder for a dip as you would want during a dip because you can&#39;t build a short term strategy that contradicts your long term strategy in investing.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: I would just like to add there is nothing wrong with having times where you are not in a rush to put your 5% cash to work because nothing seems attractive. There will be times where you feel so strongly that no investment is a guaranteed good investment at the moment and that can override your desire to be fully leveraged into the market. That&#39;s ok. The point is you don&#39;t want to build habits of constantly feeling like you need to have 20% in cash for a dip.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "These are not traps brother. You shouldn't want to get rid of these feelings. I have been investing in stocks for 15 years and have been very successful and I experience all of these feelings and recognize them as part of the advantage to my success(I recognize there are many different, and sometimes contradictory ways to be successful at investing). Part of being successful in investing is balancing different emotions and avoiding bad habits. If you got rid of these so called \"traps\" the likelihood that you become reckless will increase. \n\nWhen I buy into a company, I start with a little. If it goes up, then it goes up, I let what I have ride. I am not FOMOing into more shares just to watch the stock go back down to a lower price. If the stock goes up so much then it's still a win, just a smaller win. Sometimes you do miss out when you start a position at say $80, watch it go to $120 and then 6 months later you are buying more shares when it dips to $100. Or it doesn't dip and you never buy more shares. But that's ok. More often than not it wins out in the long run. You reference Rocket Lab, I just looked the stock up this is the 3rd time the stock has Ran up to $7+, guess what the other 2 times the stock price was in the $4's not too soon after. So if you bought Rocket Labs at $7 then because you were afraid you missed the rocket, well you would have made a bad investments. If you waited till after they dipped to $5, then you would have made a better investment. If you wait for Rocket Lab to dip to $5 again and it doesn't go that low this time, well atleast you didnt make a bad investment and your goal is to not make bad investments. There are infinite number of good investments you will miss out on, get used to it. If you want to buy at $7, just buy a small position so if it goes down you can buy more. I recently did that with Applovin. Bought a small amount of shares around $84 only to pick up more shares in the low $70's a few weeks later. Now it's at $90 and it's around 1.5% of my portfolio(I only own 12 stocks). I would like to own more shares but no way I buy more shares after it went from $70 to $90. Do I think it's a good investment at $90? It doesn't matter, habits and discipline are more important. I will just have to be happy with my 61 shares. \n\nYou should see my META purchase history, 10 shares, 5 shares, 5 shares, 2 shares, 5 shares, 3 shares, 10 shares, 15 shares, 30 shares, 5 shares, 2 shares, 1 share, etc. This was 250 shares all the way down as the stock dropped from $375 down to $90. But when I first opened my position in META it was for about $330 after a drop and I thought it was a pretty solid investment at $330, my final average cost was about $160. I never bought more as it went up. I originally bought at $330, why wouldn't I buy when the stock went from $90 to $150? Because I don't want to develop FOMO habits. I did buy a few times like in April when it went down from $525 to $430. So that means I trimmed shares at $270 but a year later I'm happily buying some more at $440? Doesn't make sense does it? But it does if you are thinking about protecting your emotions and habits. Because almost every time a company you want to invest in has their stock price increase, you think it's going to shoot up more, only to be wrong more often than not. So it doesn't matter what you think or feel at the moment. Protect your emotions and habits at all costs.\n\nI get excited when the stock market goes down too. This is good because it helps counter the negative feeling that is created as your portfolio is losing value. Just like when you start a small position, if the stock goes up you made a good investment so you are happy but if the stock goes down you are happy because you can buy more at a cheaper price. That means your emotions will be balanced no matter what direction the stock goes. Protecting your emotions is very important. \n\nI tell myself my portfolio is worth less than it is. So currently it's $353,000. I'll just tell myself I have about $300,000. Every year I keep track of the lowest and highest values for my portfolio and I tell myself I am just focused on raising my lowest value each year, not growing my highest value. It's just mental games. \n\nA lot of people on here will not understand what I am saying. They think that when you buy stocks you are trying to find the best investments, but the reality is you are trying to avoid the bad investments. And these feelings you currently have will greatly increase your chances of avoiding the bad investments if you accept them for what they are. \n\nI would like to add that my education is in business and I am very good at understanding business models relative to the average investor and I only buy companies with attractive valuations so that helps a lot. What I did with buying META If you just blindly did that with Peloton or Unity or Beyond Meat or any other way over priced stocks you would be a very bad investor. If anyone reading this is a momentum investor, everything I just said may be of negative value to them. But I have a feeling everything I said will be of value to you because you have the same emotions that I do. It took me about 7 years of investing to finally realize I was much better than most investors. Now after 15 years I'm almost arrogant about it but that's because I know these emotions we were gifted with keep our investing habits in check.",

If I&#39;m close to risk tolerance, then that leaves room for smaller additions, but there&#39;s not much FOMO/&quot;missed out.&quot; </p>\n\n<p>&quot;The bigger the sum in my investment account, the more nervous I feel about &quot;recessions&quot; and &quot;corrections.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s entirely understandable but maybe don&#39;t look at it as nervous, but see it as more focused? The better you do, the more effort you put in to making sure it stays that way. Put even more consideration into the companies you invest in, be more patient for opportunities, etc. Put the lessons you&#39;ve learned in investing along the way so far into play even more.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m already feeling like I am an idiot 😆&quot;</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think any of what you talked about was idiotic at all. Very common, understandable stuff. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck.</p>\n</div>",
