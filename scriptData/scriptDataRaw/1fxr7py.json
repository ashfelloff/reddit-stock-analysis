Now we have:\n\n* Unemployment rate declining in September is 4.1% (4.3% in July and 4.2% in August)\n* Oil prices somewhat elevated in September and it is not clear where they will go from here, as they could decline if exporters increase production.\n* Larger war could cause more inflation pressure because of potential global logistic issues.\n\nThis makes me believe that it would be hard to motivate FED to decrease rates much. Would you expect rate to go below 3% in 2025? I not see why would it happen.\n\nIf the assumption above is true, then companies benefiting on higher rates will still have significant advantage. Among them are payment systems (PAYO, WISE.LSE). While PAYO have core team located in Israel, their computing power is outside. The WISE.LSE seems more secure as they distributed among safer areas.\n\nFrom other point retail construction heavily dependent on low rates. However the 2024 proven that those with strong balance sheet, low debt and good management have not suffered much of losses. There are few good companies in industry (like LEN or MHO) with PE less than 15. Taking into consideration the inflation would stay within 2-3% such PE seems good enough to consider them as investment, even though risk of FED rate could stay quite elevated is high.\n\nWould love to hear opinions on FED rates or some related interesting companies examples.",

Powell took the risk of starting the cutting cycle with 50 basis point, and probably tried really hard to convince multiple Fed officials to go along with the 50 bps cut (I think Barkin, Waller, Schmid, Logan, Musalem, Bostic) would've all preferred starting with 25 bps (and 75bps total in 2024). \n\n7 people wanted 75 bps total in 2024 and 2 wanted 50 bps cut total in 2024. So to start with 50 bps cut and only cut 25 bps in 1 out of 2 remaining meetings, just gives off an inconsistent/bizarre message instead of 25 bps in each of the 3 remaining meetings.\n\nEven if the economy is fine, doing so really risks the financial market taking it the wrong way and thinking the Fed is worried about recession. So if market thinks so and sell off, that would kill consumer sentiments, and would lead to an actual recession. So that's the big risk.\n\nThere's really no huge benefit to 50 bps cut other than if the Fed needs to cut 75bps in the next meeting to react to a recession, they are in a better position to do so. If they cut 25 basis point in Sept and gave a really dovish speech, even saying they'll cut 50 bps in Nov, the market would've priced in more Fed cuts, and the net effect on financial condition would've been pretty similar. So I wasn't sure why they did the 50 bps cut for minimal benefits and huge tail risk. It's even more bizarre they made that decision during the blackout no communication period, which further gives the impression they're panicking. As you can see below, we're at the same restrictiveness as where we were in summer 2022 when Fed fund rate was around 2%, and the loosening happened in May 2024, months ago.\n\n[https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/proxy-funds-rate/](https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/proxy-funds-rate/)\n\nOf course lower inflation gave the Fed reason to cut 50 bps. But doing so 1.5 months early makes little difference, and they took huge risk of the market misinterpreting the message. So I don't know why they did that, if they weren't actually concerned themselves. Maybe their local business contacts have been telling them negative things.",

So that&#39;s the big risk.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s really no huge benefit to 50 bps cut other than if the Fed needs to cut 75bps in the next meeting to react to a recession, they are in a better position to do so. If they cut 25 basis point in Sept and gave a really dovish speech, even saying they&#39;ll cut 50 bps in Nov, the market would&#39;ve priced in more Fed cuts, and the net effect on financial condition would&#39;ve been pretty similar. So I wasn&#39;t sure why they did the 50 bps cut for minimal benefits and huge tail risk. It&#39;s even more bizarre they made that decision during the blackout no communication period, which further gives the impression they&#39;re panicking. As you can see below, we&#39;re at the same restrictiveness as where we were in summer 2022 when Fed fund rate was around 2%, and the loosening happened in May 2024, months ago.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/proxy-funds-rate/\">https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/data-and-indicators/proxy-funds-rate/</a></p>\n\n<p>Of course lower inflation gave the Fed reason to cut 50 bps. But doing so 1.5 months early makes little difference, and they took huge risk of the market misinterpreting the message. So I don&#39;t know why they did that, if they weren&#39;t actually concerned themselves. Maybe their local business contacts have been telling them negative things.</p>\n</div>",
