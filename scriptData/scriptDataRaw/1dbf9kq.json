It&#39;s been a gross act of negligence that our government hasn&#39;t been investing in creating artificial reserve sites devoid of the SPR&#39;s current limitations. We knew about those limitations back in the 1970s.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>That said, we absolutely need to refill the SPR as the price drops, it is pretty much recognized by everyone as a national security issue. The emergency action due to the Ukraine war was necessary but we need to prepare for whatever comes next.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, a national emergency reserve is essential but the SPR is not supposed to exist in its current state. It was originally planned to last 25 years because of its geological limitations with 5 prolonged drain cycles to get all the oil out. It was never meant to be refilled. The more often you fill and drain it, the closer the caverns get to collapsing. Past a certain point, the cave floors will fracture and the SPR turns into a net negative.</p>\n</div>",

In short, the video is wrong on pretty much every account and is functioning as political propaganda. There are three other misconceptions to note with responses in this thread:\n\n* You cannot simply take oil in and out of the SPR. The SPR is not designed to withdraw oil - it relies on the unique properties of the lining of salt caves to keep oil sealed in under the high pressure the crude exerts on its rock layers. The geologists who helped advocate for the SPR's existence understood this with the assumption the caves would be a last resort and oil reserves would not be held there indefinitely. The damaging consequences of using it as a piggy bank [are well-known](https://www.aapg.org/publications/news/spheresofinfluence/details/articleid/36728/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-the-strategic-petroleum-reserve) i.e. draining it destroys the structural integrity of the caves, shrinks their overall volume and allows oil to leak through the rock layers over time.\n* The claim that the Bakken shale field has enough oil reserves to function as a strategic reserve [is false](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/16/fact-check-bakken-oil-reserve-cant-power-us-2-000-years/6391181001/). I assume this is referencing the 2000 Leigh Price paper where he estimated up to 500 billion barrels existed in the formation. The problem is only a fraction of this is retrievable with present-day technology, and cost-profit ratios in fracking are extremely sensitive to depth. In fact, retrieval from the Bakken fields has already declined 20% from its highs. Ditto for Eagle Ford and the Permian. The latter has compensated with higher initial retrieval capacity in its wells while experiencing steeper falloffs over the last three years.\n* There is no massive conspiracy by American oil companies to keep prices high. All it takes is eavesdropping on one quarterly earnings calls to find out the real answer: their biggest stakeholders are adamantly against investing anything more than minimal capex into the exploration, procurement, and building of new wells. Why? Because the latter assume that 2010s oil prices are the true market price, and our current elevated prices are an aberration caused by the pandemic + the Ukraine war. They remember when prices plunged to $30 during the shale revolution, driving most of the mid-tier companies into bankruptcy and costing the likes of Exxon billions of dollars due to growth expenditures that never paid off. The stakeholders want their FCF poured into share buybacks and dividend payouts, not dumped into a (perceived) black hole. And this was before government-pushed ESG initiatives convinced Big Oil they would be obsolete in a couple of decades. Never wondered why we haven't had a large refinery built in the U.S. in over three decades, or why Shell is selling off all their refineries around the world as we speak?",

Proponents of fossil fuel divestment argued that if enough entities pulled funding, the oil and gas industry would be starved of capital, making it less productive and less profitable, until the industry was ultimately replaced by renewables. Protests and other grassroots action – largely on college campuses – demanded financial institutions stop funding the fossil fuel industry. Eventually, a number of high-profile funds pledged to divest, with institutions like Harvard University pulling their endowments out of public oil and gas investments. By 2022, $22 trillion had been divested from fossil fuels across public and private markets, with over $40 trillion assets now committed to divestment, representing almost two thirds of the total global pension fund assets under management ($56 trillion).\n\nhttps://malk.com/oil-gas-divestment-considerations-for-pe/\n\nIt's even in wikipedia:\n\n> A study by the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford found that the stigmatisation of fossil fuel companies caused by divestment can \"materially increase the uncertainty surrounding the future cash flows of fossil-fuel companies.\"[37] That, in turn, \"can lead to a permanent compression in the trading multiples – e.g., the share price to earnings (P/E) ratio of a target company.\"[37]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment#Effects_of_divestment\n\nActivists not only avoid buying long positions in energy companies, but they also disrupt the market by aggressively shorting oil & gas stocks and oil & gas futures, creating crazy volatility and driving out responsible investors.

They believe that by stopping Israel's bombs and guns, they can stop Islamic violence, and they act by singling out a guilty party they project all the blame and aggression onto, and trying to cancel them.

So these movements are like mass aggression coming from privileged people who consider themselves to be more right about everything than everyone else, even when they don't understand a subject. \n\nCancel culture activism like ESG divestiture from energy and energy short sellers, create volatility in energy markets. It disrupts energy markets and creates a lot of buying opportunities. They do suppress energy prices and energy company shares for long stretches of time.
