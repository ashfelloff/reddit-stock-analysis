                      "body": "Basically when people see a disruption like internet they go crazy on the valuation of some companies. Some of them are pure gamblers. They don't invest really on a rational take of the company value but more on the idea that they think the value will continue to grow.\n\nNow the problem is that when a market get much bigger you have competition. Most of the network gear didn't end up being Cisco. Competitor took the main share. And also there always a big rush when you need to build up the infrastructure. Once it is there, you only need to replace stuff and the investments are much lower.\n\nFinally there the question of who made the most money out of it ? Who made money from the internet ? Was it really Cisco or AOL ? Or was it Google, Facebook, Apple ?\n\nYou could not invest on Google until 2004. Facebook didn't exist. Apple was a niche company at the time that could had been almost bankrupt.\n\nIf we go back to Nvidia, Nvidia chips are a cost center. Like the networking gear of Cisco. There no interest to buy any except if you hope to make money using them.\n\nThe big players, Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft are fighting to make AI free for the general public and include in their offering. The bet is not that most people of the general public will pay an extra 10-20$ a month for their chatbot. Companies like Meta, Microsoft with Bind and Google with Google search and Android. They will offer it for free and finance with advertisement.\n\nStill an AI query cost about 15X more than a google search query. A big part of it is the cost of Nvidia chips + the datacenter electricity consumption, A/C. That's a cost center.\n\nFor sure at least MS and OpenAI invest to get this kind of monthly plan, but from corporation. But people will not select their AI plan for the company with the most Nvidia chips, but for the company with the best AI or the one that is the most useful. \n\nAnd chances are the general public AI will be as good and free. Big corporations will pay the big money to protect their Intellectual property. Not to have necessarily a much better product.\n\nThe biggest cost still will be the general public that will have it for free. And to be sustainable, all the big players will want the cost to be as small as possible. That's why Meta has its own model that is being open source (so anybody can use it) and that's why for the same performance it tend to consume far less than openAI models.\n\nThat's why Apple invest to put more advanced AI chips in all its computers and smartphones so that the consumer pay the AI chips... And they are not made by Nvidia. That's also why Apple again also invest in its own data center with Apple home made chips and not using Nvidia because now they can only pay the cost to build the chip and not pay 10X more to finance Nvidia. And because they had been doing such chips in their iphones for the past 15 years, they should be decent at it.\n\nAnd Microsoft is doing the same pushing that new computers will have their own AI chips. Intel will provide CPU with AI chips. Samsung is doing it and all other smartphones players. None of that use Nvidia chips.\n\nEven OpenAI funder created a startup for optimized AI chips. And everybody with a stake in the chip business want a share of the business. They will all try it.\n\nIn computer science, one of the most active research topic is to make AI model smaller, lighter and if possible run on commodity hardware like a laptop. I tried it, I could run some more models on my PC... One of the current optimization being that each parameter would be stored in 4 bits instead of FP16 or FP32. Nvidia chips are great at FP16 and FP32 but are not designed for 4 bits.\n\nThe whole world of the tech is betting against Nvidia.\n\nAnd now we see that basically Europe want to prevent full AI integration in Apple phones. This kind of legal issue will reduce the demand and slow down the adoption. \n\nChina is yet another beast. Legally the USA has forbidden China to buy Nvidia chips. So China government invest massively in making their own chips. They consider it a priority for their homeland security and the sovereignty of their country. They wont even care if it is profitable.\n\nMaybe Nvidia will have the same problem Cisco had. Everybody started to buy at a competitor.",

They will offer it for free and finance with advertisement.</p>\n\n<p>Still an AI query cost about 15X more than a google search query. A big part of it is the cost of Nvidia chips + the datacenter electricity consumption, A/C. That&#39;s a cost center.</p>\n\n<p>For sure at least MS and OpenAI invest to get this kind of monthly plan, but from corporation. But people will not select their AI plan for the company with the most Nvidia chips, but for the company with the best AI or the one that is the most useful. </p>\n\n<p>And chances are the general public AI will be as good and free. Big corporations will pay the big money to protect their Intellectual property. Not to have necessarily a much better product.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest cost still will be the general public that will have it for free. And to be sustainable, all the big players will want the cost to be as small as possible. That&#39;s why Meta has its own model that is being open source (so anybody can use it) and that&#39;s why for the same performance it tend to consume far less than openAI models.</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s why Apple invest to put more advanced AI chips in all its computers and smartphones so that the consumer pay the AI chips... And they are not made by Nvidia. That&#39;s also why Apple again also invest in its own data center with Apple home made chips and not using Nvidia because now they can only pay the cost to build the chip and not pay 10X more to finance Nvidia. And because they had been doing such chips in their iphones for the past 15 years, they should be decent at it.</p>\n\n<p>And Microsoft is doing the same pushing that new computers will have their own AI chips. Intel will provide CPU with AI chips. Samsung is doing it and all other smartphones players. None of that use Nvidia chips.</p>\n\n<p>Even OpenAI funder created a startup for optimized AI chips. And everybody with a stake in the chip business want a share of the business. They will all try it.</p>\n\n<p>In computer science, one of the most active research topic is to make AI model smaller, lighter and if possible run on commodity hardware like a laptop. I tried it, I could run some more models on my PC... One of the current optimization being that each parameter would be stored in 4 bits instead of FP16 or FP32. Nvidia chips are great at FP16 and FP32 but are not designed for 4 bits.</p>\n\n<p>The whole world of the tech is betting against Nvidia.</p>\n\n<p>And now we see that basically Europe want to prevent full AI integration in Apple phones. This kind of legal issue will reduce the demand and slow down the adoption. </p>\n\n<p>China is yet another beast. Legally the USA has forbidden China to buy Nvidia chips. So China government invest massively in making their own chips. They consider it a priority for their homeland security and the sovereignty of their country. They wont even care if it is profitable.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe Nvidia will have the same problem Cisco had. Everybody started to buy at a competitor.</p>\n</div>",

AMD for example has never been able to match Nvidia&#39;s software, it will be similar around the industry for a while.

After that it’ll probably eventually reach AGI (artificial general intelligence (as smart as humans but way more knowledgeable)), where it can probably start to design upgrades to itself to increase its IQ better and faster than humans can. And once it’s at that point, how long until it reaches or gets close to a ASI (artificial super intelligence) level?</p>\n\n<p>No one knows how far away these breakthroughs are yet.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "I think it’s because the two camps you mentioned basically aren’t familiar with AI at all. I think the overly-optimistic camp got swayed by chatGPT because it is a lot like talking to another person, and that really hyped them up to think of the state of AI as if we’re approaching skynet right now with a bunch of intelligent marketers putting content out there reinforcing this idea, while the super pessimists are just looking at the insane growth thinking there’s no way this trend can last and just making their judgement based on that. \n\n I think the truth lies closer to the pessimistic view, but this is based on just technical value of AI itself. All chatGPT is is a statistical model to predict what word is most likely to come next, and the rest of generative AI just basically does the same with pixels, notes on a song, or whatever other set of data you want to pick and then predict what’s most likely next. \n\n It has its value but it’s massively overhyped because it’s not going to magically take over productivity and creativity like everyone thinks. 99% of the research going on in this subject is done due to the aforementioned optimists with money just throwing funding at it like crazy even though the research coming out is 99% garbage. AI isn’t going to generate real money until it can legitimately take over human roles in industries - and it’s doing a small amount of that right now but nowhere near enough to have the impact people say it will, and it’s never going to take over a computer scientist or engineer’s job effectively.",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>I think it’s because the two camps you mentioned basically aren’t familiar with AI at all. I think the overly-optimistic camp got swayed by chatGPT because it is a lot like talking to another person, and that really hyped them up to think of the state of AI as if we’re approaching skynet right now with a bunch of intelligent marketers putting content out there reinforcing this idea, while the super pessimists are just looking at the insane growth thinking there’s no way this trend can last and just making their judgement based on that. </p>\n\n<p> I think the truth lies closer to the pessimistic view, but this is based on just technical value of AI itself. All chatGPT is is a statistical model to predict what word is most likely to come next, and the rest of generative AI just basically does the same with pixels, notes on a song, or whatever other set of data you want to pick and then predict what’s most likely next. </p>\n\n<p> It has its value but it’s massively overhyped because it’s not going to magically take over productivity and creativity like everyone thinks. 99% of the research going on in this subject is done due to the aforementioned optimists with money just throwing funding at it like crazy even though the research coming out is 99% garbage. AI isn’t going to generate real money until it can legitimately take over human roles in industries - and it’s doing a small amount of that right now but nowhere near enough to have the impact people say it will, and it’s never going to take over a computer scientist or engineer’s job effectively.</p>\n</div>",

Then you need a 3:1 throughout cost on the spine side so that fight there is about 36. So in total 48 switches and that's not including licensing. In total just for switched and the base price is 40K that comes to 1.92 million dollars ). \n\nSee how they're rolling in money. That's probably one tiny data center for a small company just on data center equipment. Sorry for the long winded rant but working in IT makes Nvidia a buy still.

News suddenly said otherwise, breadth narrowed again and NVDA ran back up.\n\nSo what I expect is that NVDA will see a serious plunge when rates cut and the market decides the smaller stuff is worth investing in.

AI is going to increase that 8%?  What does it give us?   What value has AI provided for your life?\n\nAI has been around for decades.   It's solved some little problems, like speech recognition, that's nifty.     It's added a little value.  It is not the be all end all.   This is nothing new, it has just been noticed.    There is not a new thing here that is going to change everything.\n\nLet's say, optimistically, that AI can tackle and solve hard problems, like designing a better chip for AI to run on.    Is Nvidia using that AI? They are chip designers, not AI designers.    Is their AI better then their competitors?     Nvidia doesn't have much for physical capital.   It's all in it's intellectual property, the design of it's chips.      \n\nThe whole hubbub about AI is it is going to increase the amount of intellectual property, which could potentially make Nvidia's little sliver of it, their chip design, worth that much less.   A quick rise means there could mean they can be usurped quickly.\n\nNVDA the stock is relying on the next bigger sucker,  like TSLA before it, or tulips.   It's value is more as a stock than as a company.  As a company, it's better than it was 3 years ago, but not 5x better like the stock says.  Sure their revenue doubled last year, but that doesn't mean it's going to double again or for that matter continue.   \n\n4 years ago, Nvidia chips were good for mining crypto, which was a hot ticket for a while like AI, set to have some trillions in a market in 3 years.  The crypto market went up $2T or sextupled between May of 2020 and May of 2021, and in that time NVDA went up 50%.  That huge market that Nvidia chips were powering, didn't give Nvidia an equivalent gain.   Even if AI does get an $8T market, it doesn't mean Nvidia is along for the ride.\n\nBetween crypto and AI, where are we going to get the electricity?   What good does all that power do for us vs. the long term costs of the emissions?\n\nOn the other hand, I feel the same way about TSLA, they are not worth 10x GM, but so far, the stock market still says they are.   Might be NVDA is the next TSLA vs. GM/F like NVDA vs. AMD/INTC    Or AAPL vs. MSFT/GOOG.    The stock market makes its picks, not necessarily based on what value to society the company actually provides.  For that, nope, there's no sober analysis.
