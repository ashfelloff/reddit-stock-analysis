We drywalled in the entire basement, as one example.\n\nMy specialty is financial marketing and my wife is the CFO of a commercial real estate company. So while we didn't lose our incomes, it was touch and go back then. I developed growth strategies for banks of all sizes, from community banks up to the superregionals. During that period, I mostly helped those guys do damage control. Today? A couple of years ago, I was recruited in-house at a national bank. I'll likely coast that into retirement in two years. \n\nAnybody who is looking at today's situation and calling it a repeat of 2008 needs to go outside and touch grass. Back then, it was the Wild Wild West. Yeah, there are exceptions such as SVB, but those are really rare. And if you're looking for anecdotes, the ones I have revolve around underwriters giving people with low incomes a $300,000 mortgage, securitizing it with a bunch of other paper, and selling it upstream. Even then they knew they were just passing along massive risk to others.\n\nThe biggest idiots were the ones on the development side. I remember consulting for one developer who bought up 2000 acres of land around a reservoir. He was going to put up something like 4,500 homes around this lake. I rode shotgun with him while he looked over the land. And three separate times, a neighboring property owner flagged this guy down with their land survey and he wrote them an earnest money check on the spot. While sitting at the wheel of his pickup truck. \n\nIt wasn't more than a few hours before I became really uneasy. While I had an upfront payment and wasn't in the hole, I knew this guy was walking the tightrope and didn't even know it. I just couldn't see how he was going to put 4500 homes on a property 40 miles outside of town with no nearby shopping, hospitals, or other amenities.\n\nI finally convinced the guy to spend $30,000 an absorption study. And you know what they found? That maybe 50 homes would get bought. Fifty. As in a little over 1% of his spitballed projections. There would be no takers. \n\nEven worse? The dumbass had already started clearing land. And the worst thing of all? He didn't even bother to check with the lake's governing authority, the nearby metro's water works board. And because it was a watershed, they had long before imposed limitations on construction around the lake. This dumb mother fucker never bothered even to ask. \n\nThey wound up shutting this guy down within a matter of weeks. It was a total mess. At the onset, I kept asking if he had been in negotiations with the water authority and he kept saying, 'No it'll be fine.'\n\nThat's the kind of shenanigans that you saw during that period. Absolutely crazy.\n\nI don't buy bank stocks. Just not enough return on them unless it's bought out. And I don't see much of an acquisition binge down the road.",

He was pretty explicit about how the entire thing was a house of cards.\n\nIn late 2005, I was called into a meeting for the same mortgage company. I was asked to listen to a presentation on why illegal aliens were going to be the next mortgage market. And all the bankers were sitting around the conference room table, nodding at this guy's PowerPoint. I remember thinking, \"Holy shit, these guys are all about risk.\" I went home and told my wife that we were putting our house on the market. We sold the house near the top of the market and moved into a home that we could afford on one of our salaries.\n\nSix months later, I was driving to a meeting with a real estate developer in June 2006. It was going to be one of those huge 2000-unit subdivisions. On the way, I heard a news report that FHA was going to stop underwriting jumbo loans. I walked into the meeting and told the developer, \"Stop building. Stop building now.\" He looked at me as if I had lost my mind.\n\nAfter that, all I did was wait. People thought I was being a pessimist, but the signals were flashing red the entire time. So when things fell apart, we got out and preserved most of our assets.\n\nLiterally, anyone with a brain could see it coming. It's not a crisis that exactly snuck up on anyone. It was a slow-motion death spiral that bankers, developers, realtors, and the government could have prevented with a little discipline and foresight. But that was too much to ask.\n\nI don't think the same conditions exist today. Yeah, the Case Schiller index is completely out of whack, but I don't think the banking system is at risk the way it was in the 00s. If you look at % of household debts that go to pay debt, the Texas ratios of banks, and an entire host of other safeguards built into banks since then, the odds of a repeat in just that way are small. Not saying it couldn't happen--and not saying that home prices aren't going to fall--but I don't think it's going to be the systemic risk that we faced 15-16 years ago.",
