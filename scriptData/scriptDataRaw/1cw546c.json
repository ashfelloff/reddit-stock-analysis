Enter Cronos Group.\n\nAltria, $MO, the 80 billion dollar tobacco giant, purchased 45 percent of Cronos in 2019.\n\n\nhttps://investor.altria.com/press-releases/news-details/2019/Altria-Becomes-Largest-Shareholder-in-Cronos-Group-a-Leading-Global-Cannabinoid-Company/default.aspx\n\nThey purchased this portion of Cronos at a much higher valuation than it currently sits, buy they remain very invested in Cronos, looking to expand it into a strong US player. In their 2023 investor presentation, they mention on slide two that turning Cronos into a strong US contender is a high priority. What they've been waiting on is federal changes. Well, here we are now. \n\nLast year, there rumors that Cronos was looking to sell the company to Curaleaf. \n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/altria-backed-cannabis-producer-cronos-explores-sale-sources-2023-07-06/\n\nAlthough that didn't manifest, it is interesting for a number of reasons. \n\nA) Cronos is sitting on a ton of cash they got from the Altria deal. They have more cash on hand than anyone in the cannabis sector.  Over 800 million dollars. \n\nB) with that cash, Cronos has the ability to strengthen the balance sheet of any player that absorbs them. \n\nC) This part is HUGE: Altria's deal with Cronos gives Cronos exclusive rights to Altria's expansion in the cannabis sector. Altria cannot do anything cannabis related without going through Cronos. \n\nIf Curaleaf, or another big player, for example, wanted to do business with  Altria, they would have to acquire Cronos. \n\nSo I see a few different scenarios possibly playing out here. \n\n1. Altria aggressively builds up Cronos without adding to their current share position. They already own over 40 percent, so it benefits them greatly if Cromos expands in a strong way in the US. Cronos has a ton of cash to acquire MSOs and with Altria's guidance they will become a major player. I could even see a reverse merger where Pharmacann merges with Cronos to become one entity. Cronos purchased a 10 percent stake in Pharmacann a while back and Pharmacann has put off their IPO plans for a couple of years now. I would also look out for some sort of transaction including Gotham Green Partners considering they have the CEO of Gotham on their board. \n\n2. Altria decides to just buyout the rest of Cronos. This could be a cash deal or stock exchange. It would certainly be at a higher marketcap valuation than it currently sits. This would be great for anyone holding CRON shares and great for MO investors long term. \n\n3. A company like Curaleaf decides to acquire Cronos to obtain the ability to work with Altria. This would have to be a stock deal and would be dilutive to the larger company, but they do it to acquire the cash reserves to fix their balance sheet and to work with Altria. \n\n4. Scenario 3 happens and then in addition, $MO buys out the entire new entity. \n\nThere is going to be a lot of M&A in this sector in the company months and years. Big players have been waiting on rescheduling news to make their moves. The next few months the first few dominos wil probably fall. \n\nAll in all, Cronos somehow convinced a big tobacco company to give them an exclusive deal. This was a bad move on Altria's part. they either need to buy their way out of this or have another player buy their way out, or they need to help rapidly expand Cronos to turn it into a thriving business instead of a giant pile of cash company. No matter what, I believe there is an arbitrage here for people investing in the stock. \n\nThere is also a ton of incentive for Altria or Curaleaf to buy them out ASAP, as the cannabis sector is going to have richer premiums by the month now. \n\nI am long $cron and I'm not a financial advisor. \n",
