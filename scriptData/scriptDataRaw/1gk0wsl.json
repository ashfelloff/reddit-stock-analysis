IAM members had voted almost unanimously against Boeing’s first offer on the eve of the start of the strike, and then 64% voted against the second offer less than two weeks ago, extending the strike.\n\n“I’m proud of our members. It is a win,” said Jon Holden, president of the largest IAM local at Boeing and the union’s chief negotiator. “They achieved a lot, and we’re ready to move forward.”\n\nAsked what prompted a positive vote this time after two previous rejections, Holden told reporters: “Members are ready, ready to come back. I look forward to getting them back to work.”\n\nBoeing said it was pleased with the outcome.\n\n“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. “We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”\n\nThe 33,000 union members, who have been on strike since September 13, will start returning to work Wednesday.\n\nThe deal calls for an immediate raise of 13% and raises of 9% for each of the next two years, and then another 7% in the fourth and final year of the contract. Taken together, members will receive a pay raise that exceeds 43%.\n\nWorkers also get a ratification bonus of $12,000, part of which they can contribute to 401(k) retirement accounts. But the deal did not restore the traditional pension plan they lost in 2014 from their previous labor deal.\n\nWorkers’ continued anger at the loss of that pension plan was seen as a major factor in the rejection of Boeing’s (BA) previous two offers and had raised uncertainty about the outcome of Monday’s vote.\nPension problem\n\nHolden acknowledged the pension was likely a major issue for many of the 41% who voted against the deal.\n\n“Fifty-nine percent is a lot, but there are definitely those who were not happy with the agreement,” he said. “Many of the members were fighting to get the pensions back. It’s a righteous fight.”\n\nCompanies, both unionized and nonunion, have generally moved away from a traditional pension plan, known as defined benefit plans, in recent decades. Such plans generally pay retirees a set amount every month no matter how long they live, or how well pension fund assets perform.\nPicket signs outside the Boeing factory in Everett, Washington, on the first day of the strike against the aircraft maker.\n\nRelated article Boeing union members are angry they lost their pension plan. They’re not likely to get it back\n\nSuch plans place the risk with the companies. For that reason, defined benefit plans are only available to about 8% of US workers in the private sector today, according to data from the Employee Benefit Research Institute. That compares to 39% in 1980.\n\nBoeing employees have what’s known as a defined contribution plan, such as 401(k) plans, where the company’s obligations end after it contributes to the individual workers’ account. Boeing agreed to increase the contributions it was making to those accounts, but refused to go back to the defined benefit plan as the union and many members had demanded.\n\n“Our members deserve pensions just like every worker deserves a safe, fair retirement in the future,” Holden said Monday following the vote. “They weren’t wrong in feeling the way they did. I agree with them. We just couldn’t get the pension out of this company. We’ll continue working on that issue.”\nLeadership support\n\nUnion leadership had urged members to accept the latest offer, even though it was not significantly different from the one they rejected on October 23. The union had urged members “to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory,” and warned members that another rejection could “risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future.”\nFILE PHOTO: A Starbucks logo hangs outside a store in the Brooklyn borough of New York, U.S., May 29, 2018. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nRelated article Why Nike, Starbucks and Boeing have lost their magic\n\nThe strikers have lost more than $600 million in combined wages but the cost to Boeing has been significantly greater, according to estimates from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based research firm, which puts Boeing’s losses through the end of last week at $6.5 billion. Overall, the cost to the US economy has topped $11.5 billion.\n\nThose losses come on top of the nearly $40 billion in core operating losses that Boeing has reported since two fatal crashes led to a 20-month grounding of its best-selling jet, the 737 Max, in 2019 and 2020. The company has already warned that its losses would continue through at least the end of 2025 no matter how quickly the strike ended.\n\nBut despite the deep financial problems, Boeing had little choice but to settle the strike and get the workers back on the job. The strike has choked off its major source of revenue, since it gets most of the cash from the sale of commercial jets at the time it is delivered to airlines. Deliveries of all 737 Max planes as well as freighter models have been halted by the strike.\n\nThe wages that Boeing pays to its workers make up far less than 10% of its overall cost of producing a plane, with most of the cost going into raw materials and purchases from suppliers who produce everything from avionics to the fuselage of the planes themselves.\nBoeing’s economic impact\n\nDespite its problems, Boeing is still a major contributor to the US economy, as it is the largest American exporter.\n\nThe strike has caused problems and layoffs at many of Boeing’s 10,000 suppliers, which are spread across all 50 states. Boeing estimates its own annual contribution to the US economy at $79 billion, supporting 1.6 million jobs directly and indirectly. It has 150,000 US employees, including the strikers.\nWhat do you think?\nView Comments\n\nThe Labor Department’s latest monthly employment report showed that 44,000 jobs were impacted in October, counting not just the 33,000 strikers, but also workers at Boeing and its suppliers who aren’t on strike but have been temporarily laid off as the strike halts commercial aircraft manufacturing at the aviation giant entirely.\n\nThere have been short-term problems for airlines, too. While they’ve been able to continue to fly the Boeing planes already in their fleets, promised deliveries of new jets have come to a halt. And that delay comes on top of ongoing delays, due to questions about the quality and safety of Boeing jets.\n\nThose problems were worsened by a January incident in which a door plug blew out of an Alaska Airlines jet soon after takeoff, leaving a gaping hole in its fuselage. Investigators discovered Boeing had delivered the plane without the four bolts needed to keep the door plug in place.\n\nEnding the strike is important for Boeing’s Ortberg, who started in the job just five weeks before the strike began. He has said he wants to “reset” the company’s relationship with the union.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and context.",

(generally speaking. of course there is that 1 person that is an exception. as exceptions are just that, an exception)\n\nim all for you guys getting what you deserve. but at a certain point, its greed / not living in reality.\n\nif i ask my employer for a $50k bonus, is that crazy?",

Traditional\nplans (defined benefit plans) are protected by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\n(PBGC), a Federal Government corporation. If a plan is terminated because an employer has\nfinancial difficulty and cannot fund the plan, and the plan does not have enough money to pay\nthe promised benefits, the PBGC will assume responsibility for the plan. The PBGC pays\nbenefits after termination up to a certain maximum guaranteed amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the excerpt you linked is a general statement that its not &quot;at risk&quot; because of said PBGC insurance... along with the fact that employers TRY to be kept separate.</p>\n\n<p>but if it goes under, and they need funds, yes it can and will be reallocated.</p>\n\n<p>its very naive to think otherwise man... its the same concept as a FDIC insurance. ignore the fact that the government itself will probably not fail.</p>\n\n<p>but think about it if another entity says &quot;they cover your bank balance of up to $250k&quot;. if THAT entity goes under, it doesnt matter that they said they will insure your balance... </p>\n\n<p>another example is if you get your house roofing done. or a new car. new w/e. and the company itself or the manufacturer itself (depending on what you are trying to cover) goes under. it doesnt matter that you had insurance from them. or that they said they will cover it. the entity is no more.</p>\n</div>",
