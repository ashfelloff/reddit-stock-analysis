For one that the young generation has it worse, in particular in terms of finances, housing and college. Only recently a study came out which claims the opposite, stating that gen z is financially better off than previous generations. As for college he's making apples to oranges comparisons. He claims it's expensive thus inaccessible. In reality the share of people going to college has sixfolded (6!) in the post-war era, it's been on a steady rise without stop for decades, and in fact college has never been so accessible as it is today.\n\n\n\nThen there's lots of stuff about housing & college prices in general. What he fails to mention here is that the price doesn't matter, what matters is whether it can be afforded. That's a function not just of price but also of financing costs. \n\n\n\nFor example: a house that's 300k in a world of 18% interest rates like the 1980s when he was in his 20s, will cost you 1.6m over the course of the entire loan. Whereas a house that's 600k (or double) in a world of 6.5% rates that we've seen in the past year, will cost 'only' 1.3m over the course of the loan.\n\n\n\nIn other words, even after adjusting for inflation, the price of housing can have doubled and it can still be cheaper, because we live in a world of vastly cheaper debt than previous generations. But he completely leaves this out, even though it's a major function of housing & college affordability. And it's the reason that in fact, we go to college more than ever before, and live in bigger homes with fewer people than ever before.\n\n\n\nThere's a sentiment that young people have it way worse that is not substantiated in fact. He even shows this in his own presentation, that median wages have been increasing for decades which is a great result, but then says it hasn't increased as fast as the S&P500... again, apples to oranges, and glosses over the fact ultimately all shareholders are people, and the biggest shareholders are pension/retirement funds for ordinary folk. \n\n\n\nAnyway, if you look at most indicators, we're living in a better time than ever. We live longer, work fewer hours, live in bigger homes, travel more, face fewer crimes, fewer wars, we consume more etc. There's tons of books to read on this topic. Like Steven Pinker's work, or just go to [ourworldindata.org](http://ourworldindata.org) and look around. There's tons of reason to be optimistic. There's no deliberate theft of old from young, no big scheme to fuck over gen z, no big crime of previous generations against the youth. I'm young and I'd in no way shape or form would want to switch with my parents or grandparents' generation. \n\n\n\nSo I reject his gloomy pessimistic anti-old victim mentality that I should have as a young person. Although I appreciate that he obviously cares deeply about other (young) people, and that he's willing to be self-critical, I disagree with his major points.",
