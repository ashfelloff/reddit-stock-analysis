For context, if OKLO was at the same valuation, we'd be looking at **over $40/share**.\n\nFor Oklo, there is significant potential for an OpenAl partnership to materialize in the wake of all the demand that we've been seeing. Sam Altman recently visited DC to pitch lawmakers on the need for multiple 5GW data centers and pushed for the NRC to further streamline SMR approvals to meet those needs. If Oklo would be able to supply just a fraction OpenAl's future energy consumption, that would translate to a massive recurring revenue stream.\n\nOKLO is primed to win as a first mover in this space. They have the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, a strong leadership team with PhDs, first mover advantage within the NRC application process and have hired on former regulatory staff, reactor technology that was already proven through decades of testing between 1964-1994, unique expertise within uranium recycling, and probably most importantly, partnership commitments driven by a robust commercialization model that is scalable and profitable overtime.\n\nFor comparison, NuScale is in a much worse position with regard to timelines and their balance sheet. They only have a design certification for their 12x50MW plant, they still need their customers to get a combined construction and operating license to actually build and license the plant. Technically, NuScale has no licenses. In addition to that, the 12x50MW was found not to be economically viable, so they are now back to get a standard design approval for their 6x77MW plant. Even with their 12x50MW plant, they weren't going to get an actual license to build and operate until 2030/2031, and now it seems their 6x77MW will take until 2033, if they can get a customer to move that forward. In contrast, Oklo is tracking towards first deployment of Aurora in 2027.\n\nTLDR: $SMR is far behind $OKLO in licensing timelines (by as much as 6+ years) and it does not appear to be reflected in the market.",
