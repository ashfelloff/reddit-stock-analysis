The damage is done and we will have to adjust over the next 5-10 years. \n\nRate cuts will happen in September and moving forward towards the neutral rate. Should happen. Better happen or the feds will be too late in easing as they were too late in tightening.  \n\nI suspect .25% as .5% will beg the question of are we in trouble here? Where as .25% is just seen as the start of easing that has been anticipated for the better part of a year now. \n\n6 cuts won’t happen this year but I expect 200bps to be cut between now and mid 2026 or so.

If you have a cool idea as a business and want to test it out, you typically take out a loan because innovation is risky and expensive.  But if loan interest rates are high, you are less likely to take out a loan because of the risk. (If the idea fails, now you're stuck with a high interest rate loan to pay back and no new product to pay for the work).  So high interest rates are a governor on innovation. \n\nThe lower interest rates, the cheaper it is to innovate, which leads to newer cooler stuff, which leads to more advancement in the world, which leads to more profits, which leads to higher stocks, yadda yadda yadda.",

If you have a cool idea as a business and want to test it out, you typically take out a loan because innovation is risky and expensive.  But if loan interest rates are high, you are less likely to take out a loan because of the risk. (If the idea fails, now you&#39;re stuck with a high interest rate loan to pay back and no new product to pay for the work).  So high interest rates are a governor on innovation. </p>\n\n<p>The lower interest rates, the cheaper it is to innovate, which leads to newer cooler stuff, which leads to more advancement in the world, which leads to more profits, which leads to higher stocks, yadda yadda yadda.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "The Fed fiddles with interest rates, while US debt burns down the world...\n\n# U.S. debt just hit a record $35 trillion\n\nThis nation’s gross cumulative debt has hit $35 trillion — a number so large, the International Monetary Fund warns that this is unstainable. But it’s hard to even imagine what the number 35 trillion looks like. So, say you had 35 trillion actual dollar bills, and you put them end to end, starting from the Earth’s surface. How far up would those dollars reach? Like, maybe, the moon? As it turns out, the moon is not even that big of a jump. It only takes about 2.5 billion dollar bills to get from Earth to the moon. It’s no wonder the IMF is worried: U.S. debt has boldly gone where no human has gone before.\n\n“Yeah, $35 trillion is really a big number,” said Peter Blair Henry, an economist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. To get a sense of just how big the number is, Blair Henry says that you would need to take our dollar bill trail out into the solar system.\n\nCall it “Debt Trek.” Our $35 trillion debt is so huge, our trail of dollars would breeze past Mars, which is 140 million miles away (roughly 1.5 trillion dollar bills). The next planet out: Jupiter, the giant of the solar system. But not nearly giant enough. (It takes roughly 4.5 trillion bills to reach Jupiter.) Next up: Saturn. But at a measly 9 trillion bills away, on average, even Saturn can’t put a ring on U.S. debt.\n\nWe continue to the outer planets. We pass Uranus and arrive at Neptune. Neptune is just under 30 trillion dollar bills away. We’ve reached the last official planet in our solar system, and we still have about $6 trillion in debt to go. Keep in mind, a dollar bill is just over 6 inches long, and 35 trillion of them would reach Pluto. I ran the calculations over and over again because, truly, I was stunned at the absolute absurdity of the size of the US debt. \n\nBlair Henry said. “What really matters is: How big is the debt relative to the size of the economy?” And our debt, which has been piling up for decades, is $35 trillion. Right now, our debt-to-GDP ratio is around 120%. We owe a lot more than we’re actually making — that’s what worries Blair Henry.\n\n“As your debt ratio rises, your financing problems just start getting tighter and tighter,” he said. “And the danger is, at some point, your creditors look at your debt situation and say, ‘Oh my gosh! You are not going to be able to repay me.’” So those creditors will start demanding higher interest rates when they lend money. “Your borrowing costs go up dramatically, and that will ultimately lead to a financial crisis,” Blair Henry said.\n\nIn fact, that has already started to happen. For the U.S., borrowing costs were really low for a long time. The government could basically borrow money for free because people were confident the country would pay it back. The size of the debt didn’t seem to matter. But as that debt has ballooned, lenders have started demanding higher interest rates from the U.S. “We’ve hit a turning point,” said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.\n\nRogoff was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund for years. He calls the rising US debt a huge economic problem. “This is the biggest thing that’s happened in the global economy in the last 10 years,” he said. That’s because the U.S. has practically-Pluto debt, so even a small jump into more debt gets galactic real fast. “The interest payments that we have to make on U.S. debt have soared,” he added. “I think the interest payments alone is now the equivalent of our US military budget.”\n\nThis year, the interest bill is expected to approach $1 trillion. That’s $1 trillion we can’t spend, for instance, on roads, health care or growing the economy. Our debt isn’t just big, it is now draining our economic resources.   \n\n“People got this idea that it was just free — ‘Don’t worry about what your debt is!’” said Rogoff. “That’s the big change that’s happened in the world, is a bucket of cold water on this idea that debt doesn’t matter. A debt this large, if left unchecked would ultimately obliterate our economy.”",

                  "body": "You are mistaking correlation with causation. Every time the Fed has previously pivoted it has not *caused* stocks to crash. It’s the other way round - ie the economy has gone tits up which causes the market to crash and the fed pivot somewhere in between these two events to try and limit the damage. \n\nThe same may happen here - the rapid and prolonged fed hikes may cause a recession and bear market, but any fed pivot will be an attempt to avoid this. However if a soft landing is achieved then yes this time may be different as we have never played out these set of circumstances before.\n\nSo again - don’t confuse causality with correlation and don’t be so certain with your predictions. One way or another you will be humbled.\n\nEDIT - I also just realised your ‘100% crash post-fed pivot’ statistic is completely wrong just using recent memory. Look at the covid crash - March 2020 the fed pivoted and cut interest rates to zero which coincided with the bottom of that particular bear market and led to an almost 2 year long bull run. \n\nA second example is in late 2018 the fed announced planned rate hikes but in the summer of 2019 pivoted and cut rates three times  - stimulating another 2 year bull run (until the covid crash). \n\nHave you only been investing for the last year?",

In recent recessions the increasing affordability is accompanied by an increase in supply and decreasing prices due to rising unemployment or waiting for better rates.
