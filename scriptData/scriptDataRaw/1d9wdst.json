AI Announcements:** There’s a lot of buzz about Apple potentially unveiling significant AI advancements. How do you think this could influence AAPL’s stock? Are we expecting major updates to Siri, machine learning capabilities, or new AI-driven features?\n\n**2. Developer Tools:** Apple is known for empowering developers with new tools and APIs during WWDC. How important do you think these updates are for the stock price in the short term?\n\n**3. Financial Impact:** Given Apple’s strong financial position, do you think the market will respond positively to these announcements, pushing the stock higher? Could we realistically see AAPL hitting $200 or more in the near future?\n\nI’d love to hear your predictions and analysis. What are you expecting from WWDC? Do you think Apple’s focus on AI will be a game-changer for its stock price? Let’s discuss!\n\n  \n\\*\\*ChatGPT wrote this for me since Reddit says I make low quality posts.   \nTDLR: WWDC on Monday, will AAPL finally go above 200?",

I don't believe I am a stock guru and my decision making process was clouded by the amphetamine withdrawal I was going through when I made the play, combined with my predisposition to gamble dangerous amounts of money. In fact, a few years ago I went from 12k -> 40k with sports gambling and only kept the money because I got hooked to reddit instead!\n\nI had a similar (although much more rudimentary) thought as your point about gambler's ruin yesterday. If one is constantly going 'all-in', there is no room for failure. \n\nI'm interested to see how the announcements could impact service revenue too. Does it impact the Google search deal? I would love to know more about the OpenAI contract terms, maybe that will be leaked eventually. \n\nThe AI emoji stuff has a lot of potential to go viral, and same with Siri. Ha ha, I can already imagine the salty tech fans who will post a stupid emoji and say 'We waited months for Apple just to release THIS!?' - and maybe they will have a point. \n\nGood luck with AAPU! I am having so much trouble seeing where we are for AI hype and Apple - on one hand, the stock has really run up the past month and a half and it might be impossible to meet investor expectations, but on the other hand there has been little hype for on device AI stuff which could keep the money flowing into AAPL. It would be disappointing for AAPL to miss hitting an ATH while it's so close...we'll see!",

Yes, my position makes no sense, and not one that can be understood through any logic. I don&#39;t believe I am a stock guru and my decision making process was clouded by the amphetamine withdrawal I was going through when I made the play, combined with my predisposition to gamble dangerous amounts of money. In fact, a few years ago I went from 12k -&gt; 40k with sports gambling and only kept the money because I got hooked to reddit instead!</p>\n\n<p>I had a similar (although much more rudimentary) thought as your point about gambler&#39;s ruin yesterday. If one is constantly going &#39;all-in&#39;, there is no room for failure. </p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m interested to see how the announcements could impact service revenue too. Does it impact the Google search deal? I would love to know more about the OpenAI contract terms, maybe that will be leaked eventually. </p>\n\n<p>The AI emoji stuff has a lot of potential to go viral, and same with Siri. Ha ha, I can already imagine the salty tech fans who will post a stupid emoji and say &#39;We waited months for Apple just to release THIS!?&#39; - and maybe they will have a point. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck with AAPU! I am having so much trouble seeing where we are for AI hype and Apple - on one hand, the stock has really run up the past month and a half and it might be impossible to meet investor expectations, but on the other hand there has been little hype for on device AI stuff which could keep the money flowing into AAPL. It would be disappointing for AAPL to miss hitting an ATH while it&#39;s so close...we&#39;ll see!</p>\n</div>",

This is a link the [\"gambler's ruin paradox,\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin) which is unrelated to the Gambler's fallacy, but it is the most important thing to know about stocks, and especially options. Read it, learn it, love it. If you don't understand it, don't trade options. \n\nLet's say you are great at predicting the future, and every time a coin flips you have a 55% percent chance of calling it right (this is a huge edge). What is your optimal betting strategy for repeated coin flips? You might think that the best strategy is to maximize your winnings per flip, and invest 100% of your assets per flip. That strategy, borne out my math and simulations, will quickly bankrupt you. In fact, it's the worse strategy for long-term income growth. Even if you have a huge edge over the house, the best strategy for this all-or-nothing game is to only bet 10% of your assets per flip. With options, you are playing a similar game. You will actually grow income much faster, on average, if you only bet a small portion of your savings. Over the long term, you should only bet between 2-10% of your total assets on all-or-nothing bets. If you have an edge and can see the future, this will optimize the growth of your wealth. If you don't, this will slow the inevitable decline of your savings towards zero. So, good luck. But don't do that again, ever. Read the wikipedia page and understand how to calculate the payout ratio of your options, and estimate that any edge that you have over much more sophisticated investors is very small. \n\nI am long on AAPL and AAPU though, I jumped in AAPL pre-earnings, expecting a buyback. I bought AAPU 2x a couple of days ago, but I did that with fresh cash that is a small portion of my balance, and AAPU is a lot less risky than margins though you should never hold leveraged assets for anything but very short periods or guaranteed volatility is guaranteed to eat you alive, so I'll be selling AAPU whether it is up or down 20% during WWDC or in couple days after if they really hit it out of the park. A month ago [I was thinking about selling NVDA post earnings to move into apple pre-earnings](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1cmcwmk/apple_announces_new_ipad_air_tablets/l31xvbi/?context=3_) but I'm not doing that, because Apple has predictably rallied in that period while NVDA rallied even more. But I do think there is at least a 55% chance of a good outcome for Apple stock this WWDC. With this bet, I am planning on making it again until apple gets aggressive about integrating and monetizing AI, which they can and will do, eventually, as they control the high small edge device computing. I only don't know the timeline for certain. Tim Cook is an amazing CEO, shepherding Apple through huge gains post Jobs, but he is very conservative. Here are my expectation's for Monday's event which I will be watching with popcorn:\n\n* a bunch of gimmicky AI emojis\n\n* AI photo editing that lags google's Pixel by a few years\n(I expect the stock to start tanking during a series of early fluff announcements that they always love to overhype)\n\n* random new hardware upgrades\n\n* A long delayed Apple server chip produced by TSMC for very fast and energy efficient inference. This will drive Apple's entrance into the cloud. I think this announcement would create a bunch of buzz. \n\n* One last thing: Siri will no longer be dumber than a box of rocks.

This was before OpenAI and then google jumped in with similar initiatives and widely-viewed video demos. I would love this, but it creates all kinds of potential issues, so I'm not betting on full voice control of IOS and macs right now. I think they will give developers hooks so developers can use voice control within their app, which is an improvement, but not as cool as telling your phone what to do and having it do it, like the Rabbit R1 was supposed to do but didn't do.

The stock has been on a tear lately and this could continue to run as hype builds for the iPhone 16 announcement in September. I remember being so disappointed last September when their whole shtick for the 15 was 'ooh it's titanium' - like who gives a hoot about that. I think many are quick to write them off, but the 16 will surprise.
