He similarly added $300k early last year at a higher price. He's a director of Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks, and Chairman of Qualcomm.

So the conversations begin off kind of flaky and wishy washy such that even if they provide estimates - they pound it in that it’s only estimates - so you can do your own math and depending on usage and how you want to calculate it, it becomes very difficult to not end up with a very very large scary number.\n\nNow what’s funny is Capital One has a new tool they are selling which helps optimize dynamically very well to avoid some of those costs, but the saving are by dynamically resizing warehouses.  That’s really the game. And it’s hard to quantify that on a spreadsheet that the accounting staff can get. When the majority of contracts are pay X and get Y or X per hour it’s fine. It’s the credit burns that make it difficult since you have to get a conversion done in your head or displayed visually and make that consumable on top of everything else.",

So the conversations begin off kind of flaky and wishy washy such that even if they provide estimates - they pound it in that it’s only estimates - so you can do your own math and depending on usage and how you want to calculate it, it becomes very difficult to not end up with a very very large scary number.</p>\n\n<p>Now what’s funny is Capital One has a new tool they are selling which helps optimize dynamically very well to avoid some of those costs, but the saving are by dynamically resizing warehouses.  That’s really the game. And it’s hard to quantify that on a spreadsheet that the accounting staff can get. When the majority of contracts are pay X and get Y or X per hour it’s fine. It’s the credit burns that make it difficult since you have to get a conversion done in your head or displayed visually and make that consumable on top of everything else.</p>\n</div>",

All the compute/transformation happens within Snowflake, thus no real cost savings directly (assuming equally performant and solid code being ran through streams/tasks/whatever.\n\nPeople like to say Databricks is cheaper than Snowflake, and while that's true from a strictly dollars per credit perspective, it's really not the full picture.  In Databricks you also have to take into account cloud compute, networking, and all the personnel/training involved to upskill on cloud infrastructure and its best practices.  You also generally need to know how to write pyspark (although for a lot of data engineering you can just use dbt or delta live table)\n\nAlternatively, Snowflake is all inclusive and everything is SQL.  That means you can either leverage your existing DBAs or source someone much cheaper with a DBA skillset.\n\nToss in dbt, and everything is still SQL.\n\nI work with billion dollar companies on both platforms from both a DE/ML/Analytics space as a chief architect in consulting for context.",

All the compute/transformation happens within Snowflake, thus no real cost savings directly (assuming equally performant and solid code being ran through streams/tasks/whatever.</p>\n\n<p>People like to say Databricks is cheaper than Snowflake, and while that&#39;s true from a strictly dollars per credit perspective, it&#39;s really not the full picture.  In Databricks you also have to take into account cloud compute, networking, and all the personnel/training involved to upskill on cloud infrastructure and its best practices.  You also generally need to know how to write pyspark (although for a lot of data engineering you can just use dbt or delta live table)</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, Snowflake is all inclusive and everything is SQL.  That means you can either leverage your existing DBAs or source someone much cheaper with a DBA skillset.</p>\n\n<p>Toss in dbt, and everything is still SQL.</p>\n\n<p>I work with billion dollar companies on both platforms from both a DE/ML/Analytics space as a chief architect in consulting for context.</p>\n</div>",
