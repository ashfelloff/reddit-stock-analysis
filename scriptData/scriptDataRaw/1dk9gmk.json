I noticed that if you buy right around the time a stock announces a split they usually tick up a few percentage points. My thought process is buy a few now ride the upward momentum before the split happens. \n\nThis has given me almost an automatic cushion for the stock. Usually up 5-8$ a share after the split. I am not a supper risky investor but my portfolio is up 12% from enacting this strategy. \n\nHas anyone else here done this and what we're the actual long term results? Did you find more often than not in the long run that the gain was from the hype the of split or did stocks continue to grow years after the split happened? ",
