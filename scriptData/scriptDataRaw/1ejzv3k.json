This is a long post, so I've posted the TLDR below.**\n\nGiven the recent negative non-farm jobs report and unemployment prints, I think the market is missing a great opportunity in META stock after a great earnings report.\n\nContext: META pre-earnings was about $470 and post earnings is now $488. They beat earnings by 8%. META is down from its high of $540.\n\nPosition: I have sold some META puts at lower strike points, so yes I am biased and want the company to perform well, but will change my mind if there's a compelling argument otherwise.\n\n**First thoughts on the market:**\n\nThe sell-off is a correction that gives long term investors an opportunity to buy companies at a less inflated P/E ratio. I think recession concerns are overblown given the following:\n\n* Absolute levels of unemployment remain very low\n* Meeting inflation targets are important for encouraging discretionary spending for lower income populations so that buying power won't be continuously eroded and we can move past this tightening cycle\n* The Fed has the ability to reduce interest rates significantly if warranted\n* Reduction in mortgage rates will allow: (1) existing homeowners to reduce interest burden and increase discretionary spending and (2) stimulate big ticket purchases (e.g. cars, homes, etc.)\n* Reduced bond yields means equities become more attractive in comparison. In the short run, the carry trade has largely unwinded from its highs in July 2024 and further downside risk is less than before - [see chart here from ING](https://think.ing.com/articles/jpy-peeling-back-the-carry-trade-onion/).\n\n**META specific thoughts:**\n\n* **Earnings:**\n   * Just crushed earnings expectations, their advertising business continues to run strong with user base growth. They stated that they have seen early benefits from their CAPEX spend on AI (not sure if it reaches desired ROI yet however).\n* **Reasonable valuation in the short run:**\n   * Currently trading at \\~25 PE (TTM) and forward PE is \\~21 to 24 depending on EPS forecasts. [Source linked here](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/meta/forecast/). For context, Meta hit its lowest PE of 14 in December 2022 when people thought Meta wouldn't exist anymore due to ad spend concerns, apple privacy updates, and issues with facebook engagement.\n   * Compared to other tech companies investing in AI, Meta (along with Google) has one of the lowest P/Es with a comparable growth rate. Relative to its peers, its PEG ratio is lower as well. However, I think some of this difference is explained by its reliance on ad spend which is cyclical and less resilient in downturns.\n* **Long term bets:**\n   * Meta has invested in long term bets in AI and Virtual reality which have yet to pay off and are considered a cost burden.\n   * For example, in their recent earnings call, they've talked about using AI stand-in personas to help influencers and small businesses answer questions to followers. If they become the \"small business or personal\" AI, then they can deepen relationships with users and monetize in ways beyond ads through reoccuring services revenue. Reoccuring revenue and proving monetization of AI will give it a boost in EPS given investors value this type of revenue more.\n   * I believe Meta is trying to move away from reliance on ads and provide value to users in ways that cannot be pulled away as easily (similar to other SaaS companies)\n* **Spending Risks:**\n   * CAPEX is large which has a future drag on EPS, but I think they can scrap their VR initiatives if needed if cost efficiency is required.\n   * If AI doesn't work out, EPS growth will be harmed in the outer years (assuming near term growth is not expected to be fueled by AI).\n* **Economic Risks:**\n   * Short term dependence on ad spend which is cylical and impacted during recessions\n   * Chinese companies spending a lot on Meta for ads - this might go away\n   * I think given interest rates are coming down - hopefully any softness will be alleviated quickly.\n\n**TLDR:** Short term business is reasonably valued and forward valuations aren't priced for explosive AI monetization. This results in upside both from an EPS and P/E perspective if there is no prolonged economic downturn and especially if new AI products show early chutes of monetization. Would appreciate any thoughts/challenges to this from other investors.",

If you call that 3 years between then and now, that's a roughly 9% annualized return. But we can actually look at their actual buying price.  [From this source](https://x.com/borrowed_ideas/status/1819028343280599550), the average buy price in 2021 was $330, which comes out to ~13% annualized return.\n\nSo the buybacks during seemingly bubble territory turned out to be decent capital allocation in the end. The S&P 500 is only about ~20% higher than it's peak valuation, so those buybacks were market-beating.\n\n(Now consider the buybacks in 2022 at $173 average, before the 182% rally to today's share price...)",

But we can actually look at their actual buying price.  <a href=\"https://x.com/borrowed_ideas/status/1819028343280599550\">From this source</a>, the average buy price in 2021 was $330, which comes out to ~13% annualized return.</p>\n\n<p>So the buybacks during seemingly bubble territory turned out to be decent capital allocation in the end. The S&amp;P 500 is only about ~20% higher than it&#39;s peak valuation, so those buybacks were market-beating.</p>\n\n<p>(Now consider the buybacks in 2022 at $173 average, before the 182% rally to today&#39;s share price...)</p>\n</div>",

He’s on a roll with all that publicity and his image. \n\nAnd I think what I said was exactly right. 10 years away from those glasses being replaced as the interaction tool. Phones will slowly become the brains of the glasses. \n\nI’m very bullish on Facebook. I think the glasses will go through a hype cycle. Just like absolutely everything does. We are climbing up to the peak and will reach there in about 2-3 years. And the next 5 will be steady slow progress with not much fan fare. In about 8 years you’ll have bigger adoption and mass adoption in 10. \n\nMy point on reality labs was in regards to his Metaverse. Which he has started to let go of. I was maybe wrong that he can’t let go. I think he realizes it’s not the near term goal and in 20 years when a virtual reality tech is better , then he can hype that back up. He is now distracted with a better more tangible goal. So ya it took him too long but he’s got a shiny new toy now. \n\nMeta has a lot of money to play with until they hit gold. And inevitably whether it’s glasses or llama or something else they acquire. They’ll get there. \n\nI do worry a little about Facebook itself. It’s a corpse of a product and in 20-30 years I don’t think will exist as we know it. I can see it pivoting to some sort of login page. \n\nBasically Facebook could become the login screen to all the other services they provide. And remove the social aspect as the main feature. But the old Facebook of uploading pictures and walls is going to change. Facebook gets a facelift. The first quarter where users decline is when they’ll start working on it. But this is a problem where they have many years to fix. \n\nIf I was mark id be putting a team of 6 super smart people focused purely the future of Facebook and prepping for its complete reimagining. Because it’s going to die. And he should be ready to replace it. It’s still a huge huge chunk of their revenue. Can’t ignore that. In fact as amazing as glasses sound. It won’t beat the pure profit of Facebook with its amazing margins.",

In about 8 years you’ll have bigger adoption and mass adoption in 10. </p>\n\n<p>My point on reality labs was in regards to his Metaverse. Which he has started to let go of. I was maybe wrong that he can’t let go. I think he realizes it’s not the near term goal and in 20 years when a virtual reality tech is better , then he can hype that back up. He is now distracted with a better more tangible goal. So ya it took him too long but he’s got a shiny new toy now. </p>\n\n<p>Meta has a lot of money to play with until they hit gold. And inevitably whether it’s glasses or llama or something else they acquire. They’ll get there. </p>\n\n<p>I do worry a little about Facebook itself. It’s a corpse of a product and in 20-30 years I don’t think will exist as we know it. I can see it pivoting to some sort of login page. </p>\n\n<p>Basically Facebook could become the login screen to all the other services they provide. And remove the social aspect as the main feature. But the old Facebook of uploading pictures and walls is going to change. Facebook gets a facelift. The first quarter where users decline is when they’ll start working on it. But this is a problem where they have many years to fix. </p>\n\n<p>If I was mark id be putting a team of 6 super smart people focused purely the future of Facebook and prepping for its complete reimagining. Because it’s going to die. And he should be ready to replace it. It’s still a huge huge chunk of their revenue. Can’t ignore that. In fact as amazing as glasses sound. It won’t beat the pure profit of Facebook with its amazing margins.</p>\n</div>",
