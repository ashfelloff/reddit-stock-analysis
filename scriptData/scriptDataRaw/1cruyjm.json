Operating lanes mainly across America and even some in Mexico (hookers and blow anyone?), they just recently acquired a new lane center in Detroit in an all cash deal. \n\nWho doesnt fucking love bowling? Apparently Wall Street. $BOWL is shorted at around 72-77% of the entire float; which in of itself is only 20 million shares. With 14.3 million shares short, fees to borrow are understandably hovering at around 8-9%. And this was before the recent events in WSB’s favorite unmentionable stocks. \n\nSpeaking of recent events, it seems like the perfect time for $BOWL’s value to finally inflect and become the next member of the meme stock corps. Financials are healthy, with an EPS of .57 ¢ a share and EBITDA of 257 million last quarter. \n\nThey can even afford to pay a fucking dividend in this economy. \n\nUtilization is already at 99%. What this means, fellow regards, is that 99% of available shares are out on fucking loan. We have only seen stats like this in 2021, when the unmentionable stocks had similar short interests above 50%. As a reminder, $BOWL is shorted 72-77% of the float. There is already no shares to borrow. And this is with a daily average volume of a puny 1 million on the stock. \n\n With barely any volume, a market cap of only 1.5 billion, a 77% short interest with fees skyrocketing for shorts, a healthy balance sheet, and fucking BOWLING on the line, i think $BOWL is poised to become the next big long indeed. \n\nAs an aside, so many shares are shorted that institutional ownership of the stock is listed on yahoo finance as 113%. How is this possible? This is only possible for one of two reasons: \n\n1. The data was reported in error\n\n2. So many shares are short that synthetic shares are created thus wrongly implying institutions own more than the float itself. Imagine said scenario; \n\nLet's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.\n\nLinks to short interest:\n\nhttps://fintel.io/ss/us/bowl\n\nhttps://www.benzinga.com/quote/BOWL/short-interest\n\nhttps://www.nasdaq.com/articles/bowlero-stock-nyse:bowl:-watch-out.-short-squeeze-potential-is-high\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BOWL/key-statistics/\n\n\nTLDR: 77% short interest, puny volume, a low float stock, fucking bowling pins, whats not to love?\n\nPositions: 25 C 6/21 12.5 Strike. 15 C 6/21 15 Strike. 3 C 6/21 22.5 Strike.
