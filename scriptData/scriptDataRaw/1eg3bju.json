The company’s same-store sales fell 3% in the quarter, fueled by a 5% decline in transactions.\n\nTraffic to its U.S. stores fell again this quarter, dropping 6%. Domestic same-store sales fell 2%, boosted by an increase in average ticket. Last quarter, executives discussed plans to revive the lagging U.S. business that included leaning on discounts and new drinks to bring back customers who had abandoned the chain.\n\nOutside of North America, same-store sales slid 7%. In China, Starbucks’ second-largest market, same-store sales tumbled 14% as both average ticket and transactions shrank. Starbucks has faced stiffer competition in China from local coffee shops that undercut the coffee giant on price.\n\nStarbucks opened 526 net new stores in the fiscal quarter.\n\nThe company will discuss its outlook for fiscal 2024 on its upcoming conference call. Last quarter, Starbucks slashed its forecast, projecting revenue growth of a low single-digit percentage and earnings per share growth in a range of flat to a low single-digit percentage.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/starbucks-sbux-q3-2024-earnings.html",
