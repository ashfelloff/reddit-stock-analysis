I wrote a longer article but I feel like most people on here don't have the attention span for anything but bullets. \\*PLTR IS MY BIGGEST POSITION AND I'LL BE BUYING ON ANY DIPS BELOW $25\\*\n\n* Palantir leverages AI to process and analyze vast amounts of data within a company, process, or organization and then helps identify complex patterns and derive actionable insights.\n* If a company’s in-house data solution is data-Frankenstein, then Palantir is a data-Zeus, the god of all data solutions.\n* **Foundry**\n   * Think of Foundry as a super smart filing system that stores all sorts of information from different places. This tool can pull together bits of data from various sources, like spreadsheets, emails, and databases, so that everything is in one place. Then, it will use a really smart and well-trained robot to help your company make important observations and decisions based on the data.\n   * Puts data together: Foundry can take all sorts of information from different places and put it together so it’s easier to see everything at once.\n   * Keeps data safe: It makes sure that the data is secure and handled properly, following rules about privacy and safety.\n   * Helps make decisions: It uses AI to help people at a company make decisions by showing them patterns or trends in data that might not be obvious.\n   * Lets people work together: Foundry helps teams within a company work better together by sharing their findings and plans based on the data.\n   * Custom tools: Companies can create their own tools (code, low-code, and no-code tools) with Foundry to address specific needs they have, making their work easier and more efficient.\n   * Foundry uses AI to automatically combine data from different sources – this helps avoid the need for a lot of manual work to clean up and organize the data.\n   * Foundry makes it easy for you to use AI to make predictions or find patterns in data.\n   * AI in Foundry helps analyze words in documents or online posts to gather important information or see how people feel about something.\n   * AI helps create charts or point out important bits of data quickly, making it easier for people to understand what the data means.\n   * Foundry’s AI can help businesses plan better or test out ideas by simulating different scenarios. This is like trying out strategies in a computer game to see what might work best in real life.\n   * Foundry’s AI also helps keep the data secure by looking out for any unusual activity that might suggest a security problem.\n   * Ontology is a cataloging system for data – it organizes data into specific categories and relationships.\n   * Just like a well-organized library allows you to navigate through shelves of books effortlessly, a well-structured ontology allows computers to navigate through large datasets.\n   * What type of company should use Foundry? Any company that manages large volumes of data.\n   * Stellantis, Airbus, PGE&E, Tyson, Cleveland Clinic, British Petroleum, Exxon Mobil, and even Ferrari’s F-1 racing team have all partnered with Palantir Foundry.\n* **Gotham**\n   * Gotham’s main clients are military, defense, intelligence, counterterrorism, and law enforcement agencies.\n   * Gotham enhances military operations with an AI-powered kill chain that helps soldiers quickly identify and manage targets.\n   * Gotham can control sensors like drones and satellites either automatically with AI or manually with human input.\n   * Gotham transforms any location into a command center with mixed reality, allowing operators and commanders to work together virtually.\n* **Apollo**\n   * Put simply, Apollo helps a company manage, deploy, and scale Palantir software within their organization.\n   * Continuous software deployment is a lot more complex than it may seem.\n   * If SaaS was the hero to software deployment issues in the 2010’s, then Apollo is software deployment’s modern-say savior. This was all a long-winded way to say that Apollo helps companies easily manage continuous software deployment and integration so that they can focus their attention back to innovation and away from meaningless deployment and update issues.\n* **AIP**\n   * AIP is a no-code environment for creating, testing, and deploying AI functions using LLMs. You can build, test, and deploy features using a simple interface without needing to write complex code.\n   * AIP is absolutely game-changing for enterprises hoping to leverage AI into their operations.

Of course, I think all that would be predicated on the scalability of their products which I didn&#39;t realize was such an issue before reading your earlier point. I can&#39;t imagine that issue not being a major focus for the firm to improve upon.</p>\n\n<p>One other point that&#39;s interesting though is that I don&#39;t think any company could acquire and integrate them fluidly and it appears by extension that they may have a pretty reliable moat in terms of intellectual capital and product offering. Any long term opinion of them?</p>\n\n<p>Addressing your question, Meta of course is much more scalable but I don&#39;t know how direct of a comp they are for PLTR just in terms of market cap, product mix, and of course different customer and geographic base.</p>\n</div>",
