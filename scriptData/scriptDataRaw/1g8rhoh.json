And if you're trying to plan 5-10 years down the line for let's say a factory networking solution (which is mission critical and not just a way to watch MrBeast videos on your phone), you're gonna do it based on requirements and cost.\n\nAnd the thing with Networking is, that it is not as commoditized as you claim. You need people to implement, monitor, test that shit and make sure that manufacturer and service provider still exists. And Cisco absolutely benefits from network effects, vertically integrating implementation and other services and a proven track record. And that shit holds way much more sway for execs or CTOs than donuts and pretzels. Guaranteed.\n\nGranted, I am not an expert on the nitty gritty of networking, but its far more than offering the best donuts or the best price.

And if you&#39;re trying to plan 5-10 years down the line for let&#39;s say a factory networking solution (which is mission critical and not just a way to watch MrBeast videos on your phone), you&#39;re gonna do it based on requirements and cost.</p>\n\n<p>And the thing with Networking is, that it is not as commoditized as you claim. You need people to implement, monitor, test that shit and make sure that manufacturer and service provider still exists. And Cisco absolutely benefits from network effects, vertically integrating implementation and other services and a proven track record. And that shit holds way much more sway for execs or CTOs than donuts and pretzels. Guaranteed.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, I am not an expert on the nitty gritty of networking, but its far more than offering the best donuts or the best price. There are many factors to consider and Cisco&#39;s business is not &quot;just routers at scale&quot;</p>\n</div>",
