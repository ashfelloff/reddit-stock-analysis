Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here’s a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn’t pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it’s now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I’m sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I’m going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I’m watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I’m thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn’t the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn’t such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don’t feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I’m trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n",

Was up 1K on a call (around 80% profit) and didn’t sell because my DTE was 3 months out and hey “I was right” it was going my way, now I’m in the negative with expiration rapidly approaching. Same thing with another option I was up nearly 100%, but it was only $450 so I held thinking I could make more, now I’m negative and I deserve it for that absolute smooth brain move. This is just some of my learning lessons and what it’s taught me is consistent profit is going to take us further than “home runs”. Although we arnt going to get that dopamine rush of making 1k+ on a single trade, making a couple of hundred bucks on most of your trades is going to cumulate and you’ll end up way further. I think part of us trades because it’s exciting and fun, almost like the money dosent even matter sometimes, but at the end of the day we’re here to profit. Dosent mean you can’t take those risky plays and get that adrenaline rush every once in a while, just don’t go chasing it on most of your trades. \n\nBut then again, the blue crayon is still my favorite flavor, god speed.",

Was up 1K on a call (around 80% profit) and didn’t sell because my DTE was 3 months out and hey “I was right” it was going my way, now I’m in the negative with expiration rapidly approaching. Same thing with another option I was up nearly 100%, but it was only $450 so I held thinking I could make more, now I’m negative and I deserve it for that absolute smooth brain move. This is just some of my learning lessons and what it’s taught me is consistent profit is going to take us further than “home runs”. Although we arnt going to get that dopamine rush of making 1k+ on a single trade, making a couple of hundred bucks on most of your trades is going to cumulate and you’ll end up way further. I think part of us trades because it’s exciting and fun, almost like the money dosent even matter sometimes, but at the end of the day we’re here to profit. Dosent mean you can’t take those risky plays and get that adrenaline rush every once in a while, just don’t go chasing it on most of your trades. </p>\n\n<p>But then again, the blue crayon is still my favorite flavor, god speed.</p>\n</div>",
