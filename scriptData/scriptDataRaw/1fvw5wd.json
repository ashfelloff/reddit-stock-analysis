The company said the buy-back was not guaranteed in terms of timing, quantity or price.Meituan’s second-quarter revenue surged 21 per cent year on year, reaching 82 billion yuan (US$11.6 billion), bolstered by steady growth in its core local commerce operations focused on food and grocery delivery.

This includes US$1.2 billion in notes with a 4.5 per cent coupon due in 2028 and US$1.3 billion in notes with a 4.625 per cent coupon due in 2029.Meituan is seen as one of the Chinese tech stocks to benefit the most from a rebound in domestic consumer spending.A new exchange-traded fund nicknamed “China Dragon”, which tracks major Chinese tech stocks, landed on the US stock market on Thursday. The fund’s components include Meituan, along with other Chinese tech giants such as Tencent Holdings, PDD Holdings and Alibaba Group Holding, owner of the South China Morning Post.Separately, Alibaba said on Wednesday that it bought back 414 million ordinary shares in the quarter ending September 30 for US$4.1 billion.
