Once you have sold the losers, find index funds or income CEF's (I love income cef's) that appeal to your conservative nature.  Which ever makes you feel good/safe.

If they look like they'll only get worse, sell now.  If not, then maybe wait for a better price and then sell and move that money back into index funds.\n\nFYI, the first \"recommendation\" they made after I signed up was down 98.5% when they finally issued a sell notice on it a few weeks ago.  It's worth so little now, it's hardly worth bothering to sell what's left - even without having to pay commissions on the trade.",
