The stock value is reset to this after the funding round. ( reset for everyone including employees). \nThe company founders will warn their employees about this and ask them to pre-exercise before this happens. \nThe founders usually like to keep stock price low, to make it easier for employees to purchase. But stock price will rise after each uproubd funding.</p>\n\n<p>If you didn’t exercise, then you don’t own the stock. since you don’t own the stock, you have no rights to vote in a company sale.</p>\n\n<p>My knowledge maybe bit dated though.( or incorrect)</p>\n</div>",
