If you drive drunk and kill someone in an accident, you don't get off Scott free because they weren't wearing a seat belt.\n\nLike you're basically advocating nobody should be held responsible for any computer problem, since a perfectly designed system should have redundancies in place to mitigate any failures. Company negligently ships a hard drive that fails? Guess it's not their fault, should have used RAID. US-East goes down for 12 hours because Amazon let an intern directly push to prod? Should have regional replication and fail over.",
