Cheers to u/pennycheck at X for this delicious slice of ASPIe\n\n1. Proprietary Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment technologies for isotope enrichment.\n2. Contracts for Carbon-14, Molybdenum-100, and Silicon-28 production, with potential revenues of $12-30 million in 2024.\n3. Entering the High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) market, with estimated demand over 600 MT by 2035.\n4. Quantum Enrichment method for uranium expected to be more cost-effective and scalable than competitors' technologies.\n5. Signed MOUs with two US-based Small Modular Reactor (SMR) companies to supply HALEU.\n6. Received interest from potential customers totaling over $30 billion of HALEU demand at recent market prices.\n7. Technology allows for HALEU production in a single step, potentially more efficient than competitors.\n8. Expects to produce commercial quantities of HALEU by 2027, potentially satisfying all anticipated demand from advanced reactors in development.\n9. Market capitalization significantly lower than main competitors despite potentially superior technology.\n10. Strong management team with extensive experience in isotope enrichment and finance.\n11. 100% employee retention, helping maintain trade secrets and technological advantages.\n12. Exploring enrichment of depleted uranium tails, potentially leading to higher margins and lower HALEU prices.\n13. Building facilities in Iceland to capitalize on lower electricity costs, potentially improving profitability.\n14. Joint venture with PET Labs, allowing entry into the radioisotope market for nuclear medicine.\n15. Technology is modular and scalable, allowing for rapid capacity expansion.\n16. Significant insider ownership, with management continuing to buy shares.\n17. Targeting multiple markets beyond HALEU, including medical isotopes, silicon for quantum computing, and other industrial applications.\n18. Favorable market environment due to global push for nuclear energy, including pledge to triple nuclear capacity by 2050 at COP28.\n19. Technology could potentially address the HALEU supply bottleneck currently delaying some SMR projects.\n20. Potential ability to produce Weapons Grade Uranium (WGU) could lead to additional government contracts.\n21. Isotope production extends beyond HALEU, with applications for semiconductors and AI companies.\n22. Ytterbium plant commissioned 9 months ahead of schedule, demonstrating efficient execution.\n23. Early completion of Ytterbium plant proves Quantum Enrichment technology, applicable to uranium enrichment for HALEU production.\n24. Ability to recycle depleted uranium tails makes it attractive for governments wanting to avoid new uranium mining operations.\n25. Diverse isotope portfolio makes it relevant to multiple industries and companies.\n26. Major tech companies like Amazon and Google investing heavily in nuclear energy projects, likely increasing demand for HALEU fuel.\n27. Amazon signed agreements to support development of nuclear energy projects, including new SMRs.\n28. Google signed world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple SMRs.\n29. Tech giants' involvement could accelerate SMR development and adoption, creating larger market for ASPI's HALEU production.\n30. Tech companies cite need for reliable, carbon-free energy to power data centers and AI technologies.\n31. US Department of Energy estimates significant job growth in the nuclear industry.\n32. International Energy Agency's report supports long-term prospects for nuclear energy.\n33. Growing corporate interest in nuclear energy could lead to increased investment in the sector.\n34. Successfully enriched Ytterbium-176 using Quantum Enrichment technology.\n35. Commissioning phase of Ytterbium-176 facility completed in 6 weeks instead of expected 3-6 months.\n36. Expects to achieve 99.75% enrichment for Ytterbium-176 and offer it for commercial sale in 2025.\n37. Plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 Quantum Enrichment plants with production targeted for 2025.\n38. Potentially the only Western supplier of commercial quantities of Ytterbium-176 and similar isotopes.\n39. Quantum Enrichment process believed to be more efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly than other technologies.\n40. In discussions with potential customers for HALEU requirements valued at over $37 billion.\n41. MOUs with two US-based SMR companies include potential capital investments into HALEU facilities.\n42. Accelerating plans for Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 plants due to urgent demand from Western-based producers.\n43. Positioning to meet emerging demand for Lithium-6 in nuclear fusion power plants.\n44. Recruited Lt. Col. William Eden, MBE to lead nuclear strategy in the United Kingdom.\n45. Bill Gates took the first slice of the pie. Bet there's many more wanting a seat at the table.\n46. 24% shorted 10 million shares since $2.90-$8\n\nI'm suspecting ASPI and Gates been discussing silicon-28 since it's now clear Terrapower aim to lock up their HALEU production for ten years. All makes sense to me. Lock up the HALEU to fuel SMRs and build datacentres with silicon-28 semiconductors. Aaaand they build SMRs to power their superior datacentres.\n\nMicrosoft enters the chip wars: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/welcome-to-the-chip-wars-microsoft/\n\nThey will spin off their Uranium business to Quantum Leap Energy. Those who got shares in ASPI will get equal amount of shares in the new company QLE. Plus ASPI will always get 10% of QLEs revenue.\n\nThe HALEU plant Bill Gates is paying for and is expected to be non dilutive to shareholders. He will also buy all the HALEU produced there for a ten year period. Gates want to be the global top dog in small modular reactors.\n\nFinancially their balance sheet have never been stronger with about $43 million dollar cash.\n\nThis is just my opinions and guesses, I'm not a financial advisor. I share information about the company for the community to discuss. So this is not investment advice to sell, buy or do anything speculative. ASPI is worth keeping on the watchlist in my opinion. I keep it in my portfolio, I like the stock so I own the stock. Do your due diligence.",

The CEO stated they will not dilute further and they have all the capital they need especially since customers will pay for their own facilities. The insiders have yet to sell a single share. This company is years ahead of their competitors and can stand up facilities quicker than anyone at a much cheaper cost. They will also be paid to recycle depleted tails ands owning ASPI today will give you shares in both QLE and ASPI when they direct list the spinoff next year.

The CEO stated they will not dilute further and they have all the capital they need especially since customers will pay for their own facilities. The insiders have yet to sell a single share. This company is years ahead of their competitors and can stand up facilities quicker than anyone at a much cheaper cost. They will also be paid to recycle depleted tails ands owning ASPI today will give you shares in both QLE and ASPI when they direct list the spinoff next year. This is a grand slam if I’ve ever seen one. Everything is differentiated imo.</p>\n</div>",
