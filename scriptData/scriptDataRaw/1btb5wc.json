  "selftext": "Alright, first post fellow regards! My first DD is on Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA). Strap in and tuck in those Wendy’s napkins cause this baby is about to get wet 💦\n\nThere are only two key ingredients that are going into this centuries-old Dutch recipe. \n\n1. A gobsmackingly undervalued midstream oil company\n\n2. The best strategic tailwinds in the U.S. oil market since 1945\n\nCompany: TLDR: PAA is a midstream provider that transports and stores crude, natural gas, and other refined oil products. They make money primarily from the Frac Spread which presents a golden opportunity to dive in now. \n\n(more on this later)\n\nFinancials: Three points:\n\n1. Consistent revenue growth over the past three years, with total revenues increasing from $29.28 billion in 2021 to $33.14 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%.\n\n2. PAA has maintained strong profitability margins, with a gross margin of 17.8% and an operating margin of 9.6% in 2023. Through a complex macro-environment for midstream players \n\n3. Balance sheet has total assets of $34.72 billion and total liabilities of $21.84 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.08, indicating a reasonable level of leverage, especially given capital intensive Midstream business model.\n\nU.S. oil is about to have the decade of its life\n\n1. U.S. oil production is at record highs, due embargoes on Russian oil, and sanctions enacted by the Biden administration.\n\n2. Biden has his hands tied because in order to reduce inflation (fed looks at core) he needs to continue drilling— which will further position the U.S. to become a crucial and reliable supplier given extremely high geopolitical tensions.\n\n3. Trump re-election is seen as a potential wildcard, with expectations of heightened demand for oil and increased premiums, prompting strategic longterm investment to capitalize on market dynamics\n\nThe kicker (frac spread)\n1. Currently, oversupply in NG depresses its prices, while NGLs maintain better demand and higher prices. PAA benefits from this spread by purchasing NG-based NGLs at lower prices and selling them at higher NGL rates. The wider the spread, the greater PAA’s profit margin, making its operations more lucrative. Factors affecting the spread’s future include NG pipeline capacity and LNG export capacity. The ‘fatness’ of the frac spread depends on whether natural gas pipeline capacity can keep up with demand growth (IT CAN’T)\n\n1. My plan is to ride this up all year with weeklies and transition to synthetic calls once valuation becomes more rich. That said, calls are essentially FREE at current prices (especially further out you go) I’m deep in with April 19th calls @17.50 for 20c apiece \n \n ",
