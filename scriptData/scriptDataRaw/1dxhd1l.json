I have no idea your age, your risk tolerance and your financial picture.\n\nI can tell you that in my portfolio I have 0% international and 0% bonds....but my time horizon is well over 20 years and my risk tolerance is probably one of the highest.\n\nMy thought process on why i have zero international is because international you buy the ETF in USD but the ETF buys the stocks in local currency.  The companies pay out in local currency and then convert to USD.  Which means you are subject to both stock fluctuation and currency.  Look at Japan for example their markets been going wild, but the yen has been dropping vs a dollar.  So if you had an ETF you would be up around 5%.  If you had a japan etf hedged for currency then you would be up around 20%.  I don't like to play forex (currency markets).  Plus the S&P500 now gets around 62% of its revenue from international markets and companies imo are more efficient both tax and inflation wise in converting currency than an rules based ETF.  So if i own the S&P500 then i'm getting 62% exposure to the world markets.\n\nI also have very few small caps, my thought process is that the US economy has tilted further towards large cap both economically and politically.  They have more money to tilt policy in their favor so i hold mostly large cap growth. \n\nMy strategy even if its thought out, is inherently risky and I wouldn't recommend it to most people since it carries sector and country concentration risk, however I think that over the past few years I have been compensated for taking that risk and my view of the markets going forward that i will continue to be.  I typically look at my strategy every 5-10 years to see if my opinion of the markets still holds true.",

They can benefit somewhat from real estate pricing but beyond market oddities like the post 2020 boom, their main business is collecting rent on invested capital, so they are essentially a kind of specialty bond.  With current bond rates, I am not convinced that most general real estate funds will give enough alpha to compensate for sector specific risk.\n\nThis also means you've got essentially 32% in bonds.  Is that what you are looking to achieve?  There will be greater stability but lower return.  Is there something special about real estate where you think it's going to do well in the future?\n\nI think your international allocation is ok.  Note that international companies tend to be more industrial/manufacturing oriented than US funds which are more technology heavy, which is why they have been underperforming in recent years. But that can always turn around.\n\nPersonally I have been conflicted about small cap.  I always heard small cap is historically been higher risk, higher growth, but they have been underperforming large cap quite a bit for the last ten or fifteen years it seems.  So small cap hasn't done well in a good economy with low cost of money, but if there's a recession I don't think small caps are going to outperform large cap either.

For this reason I've dumped most of my small cap recently and just put it in large cap, I'm not feeling good about their chances if things turn south.\n\nAlso imho monthly rebalance feels a little too often to me, but it depends on what kind of changes you want to capture.",
