Tesla just made a lot of sense to me in 2017. EVs made like normal cars rather than trying some fancy stuff.

Massively undervalued in my opinion and can sink even lower depending on lawsuits for 13th and 14th gen chips. It seems to have a 3x to 10x return in 2 to 5 years. Intel at this value makes sense if they were still massively behind on AMD. On a consumer glance that does seem the case. However, if you look at datacenters their new Sierra Forest is equal on performance with AMD whilst they will still produce improved versions in a few months. Their new 20A and 18A chips will also be a massive improvement introducing technology that TSMC hasn't pulled off yet in backside power delivery. In addition, to using the new ASML machines.\n\nThe only explanation for their low value is due to declines in revenue and profits. However, if you look at the multiples. Intel has 3x revenue and 2x profit than AMD but is trading at 2-3x lower value.",

During Covid oil prices sunk to negative prices and Oil companies fell with it. Managed to 3x my investment in Shell at the time with great dividends.</p>\n\n<p>Banks in 2020 were also at a massive discount. Was quite clear that interest rates had to be raised at some point resulting in the massive profits banks gained in the past 2 years.</p>\n\n<p>*Now I&#39;m a huge Intel simp. Massively undervalued in my opinion and can sink even lower depending on lawsuits for 13th and 14th gen chips. It seems to have a 3x to 10x return in 2 to 5 years. Intel at this value makes sense if they were still massively behind on AMD. On a consumer glance that does seem the case. However, if you look at datacenters their new Sierra Forest is equal on performance with AMD whilst they will still produce improved versions in a few months. Their new 20A and 18A chips will also be a massive improvement introducing technology that TSMC hasn&#39;t pulled off yet in backside power delivery. In addition, to using the new ASML machines.</p>\n\n<p>The only explanation for their low value is due to declines in revenue and profits. However, if you look at the multiples. Intel has 3x revenue and 2x profit than AMD but is trading at 2-3x lower value.</p>\n</div>",
