The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.\n\nThe second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move — to a resounding yes.\n\nMusk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by “wide margins,” without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.\n\nThe initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla’s financial performance and market value — and, while the company has turned into one of the world’s largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.\n\nTesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nCritics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla’s financial performance has not been up to scratch.\n\nSome notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.\n\nShareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla’s future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.\n\nBillionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker’s future.\n\n“At Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,” he said this month.\n\nSome major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-says-tesla-shareholders-likely-approved-his-56-billion-pay-deal.html",

As much as I hated that this might happen, voting for this insane bonus was what fund managers had to do. You can&#39;t just dump a growth stock without major repercussions, and the inevitable fall of TSLA to its true valuation would have likely started immediately if this vote had not passed. Now Elon can continue to lie about numbers and release dates and claim it is no longer and auto company but an AI/robotics company (while diverting the chips needed to make a feeble attempt away from Tesla to his other companies).</p>\n\n<p>It was the best option for short term stock price, but it makes Tesla becoming the next Sears much more likely.</p>\n</div>",
