(\\~300) If I sold the rest of my shares, I will probably have a net gain about 0. Should I continue to hold to see if it will bounce back up or just sell it to invest in other investment vehicles? As for RIVN it is just a complete (excuse my frech) shit show. I bought it during the peak and the stock price never went up from there. In times like these, should I just sell all my shares to reap my loss?  Thanks in advance!",

Being profitable in automotive means being able to churn out volume. But they’re getting g there with Amazon, USPS and FedEx fleet contracts. \n\nTheir trucks are just so nice to drive. They feel so premium in every way, and pretty much every Rivian owner I’ve encountered loves their truck!  They push out new features all the time, and those features actually seem to work. \n\nThe R2 is coming out next year and the R3/R3X the year after. This is where they’ll gain a lot of market share, because they are affordable. People think EV’s are going away, but how many KIA’s Model 3’s, and Model Y’s do you see on a daily basis?  Millions!  And once people start installing home chargers, their gas/maintenance costs will fall dramatically. \n\nOf the EV stocks, I think RIVN has the best story. Lucid might have the best car, but Rivian (especially with VW investment) has a lot of upside, IMO",

But they’re getting g there with Amazon, USPS and FedEx fleet contracts. </p>\n\n<p>Their trucks are just so nice to drive. They feel so premium in every way, and pretty much every Rivian owner I’ve encountered loves their truck!  They push out new features all the time, and those features actually seem to work. </p>\n\n<p>The R2 is coming out next year and the R3/R3X the year after. This is where they’ll gain a lot of market share, because they are affordable. People think EV’s are going away, but how many KIA’s Model 3’s, and Model Y’s do you see on a daily basis?  Millions!  And once people start installing home chargers, their gas/maintenance costs will fall dramatically. </p>\n\n<p>Of the EV stocks, I think RIVN has the best story. Lucid might have the best car, but Rivian (especially with VW investment) has a lot of upside, IMO</p>\n</div>",
