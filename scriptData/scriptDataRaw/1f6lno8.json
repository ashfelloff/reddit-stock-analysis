That’s evidenced by the exact same data - 93% of stock is owned by 10% of wealthiest people. People with money spend more but also save more.\n\nAgain, this is not true. You are conflating nominal increases in the money supply (i.e. inflation) with real added value. [The personal savings rate has tanked over the last 60 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT), therefore currently people have *less* money to invest in the market than ever before. Most of the population in the lower 60% have their equity tied up in their homes.

Those mega-cap tech stocks have such a massive impact on the index because they're trading at much higher multiples due to their growth potential and reinvestment strategies.\n\nIf you look at the S&P 500 without the heavy hitters like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., the multiple drops down to a more reasonable range—around 16x. That's not exactly dirt cheap, but it's definitely more in line with historical averages and offers a better risk premium compared to the 10-year Treasury yield.\n\nBig tech is in its own league right now. Investors keep throwing money at them because they believe in the long-term growth story and are willing to pay up for it. Sure, it adds a lot of weight to the index and skews the overall PE higher, but unless sentiment shifts drastically, they’re likely to keep getting that kind of love from the market. So, yeah, the PE looks high, but there’s more to the story when you dig a little deeper.",

The overall market&#39;s PE looks sky-high, but if you strip out the big tech giants, the picture changes quite a bit. Those mega-cap tech stocks have such a massive impact on the index because they&#39;re trading at much higher multiples due to their growth potential and reinvestment strategies.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at the S&amp;P 500 without the heavy hitters like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, etc., the multiple drops down to a more reasonable range—around 16x. That&#39;s not exactly dirt cheap, but it&#39;s definitely more in line with historical averages and offers a better risk premium compared to the 10-year Treasury yield.</p>\n\n<p>Big tech is in its own league right now. Investors keep throwing money at them because they believe in the long-term growth story and are willing to pay up for it. Sure, it adds a lot of weight to the index and skews the overall PE higher, but unless sentiment shifts drastically, they’re likely to keep getting that kind of love from the market. So, yeah, the PE looks high, but there’s more to the story when you dig a little deeper.</p>\n</div>",
