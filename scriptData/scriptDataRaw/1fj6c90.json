My only access to the history of those transactions if I need it is within whatever limitations my bank puts on their online reporting (sometimes as little as 30 days depending on the bank).  If my bank doesn&#39;t like where I&#39;m sending it to or how often I&#39;m doing it they can just decline to let the money be sent, at any time, because they feel like it.</p>\n\n<p>Zelle/Venmo aren&#39;t real things here, as they are just essentially loans from banks that cover the processing time of the actual transfers, and from a feasibility standpoint if you&#39;re moving around money frequently or in high amounts Zelle/Venmo will shut you down real fast or put cooldown periods on your account where you can&#39;t use it for a few weeks.  We&#39;re talking about a few thousand dollars here.</p>\n\n<p>And god forbid I need to transfer 6 figures or more (not uncommon in real estate).  Then I&#39;ve got to go into the bank, during banking hours, and show ID.</p>\n\n<p>All of this to access and move around my own money.  None of which is a problem with crypto, where your own money is actually your own money and you can do what you want with your money instead of what a bank will let you do with your own money.</p>\n</div>",
