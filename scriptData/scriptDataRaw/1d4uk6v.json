And they kept the petal to the metal with zero percent rates for too long all because inflation is only transitory. And, those three percent 30-year mortgages are probably going to keep a foot on the gas petal for about a decade or two.\n\nThey may have to keep rates at 5 or 6 percent for many more years, or do some meaningful QT to get the balance sheet back to about $4 trillion and then lower rates because too much QT would be too damaging. If they have to change rates, they probably will only increase or decrease about 25 basis points maybe only once or twice a year.

Market forecasters were largely expecting between 0.22% to 0.26%, so this was actually on the high side of the forecast.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1796279892423926260/photo/1\">https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1796279892423926260/photo/1</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240521a.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240521a.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>Fed likely needs core PCE month over month to come in at the most 0.20% (2.4% annualized) for at least 6 months before they can feel comfortable cutting. In fact, if core PCE month over month continues coming in at 0.20%, the core PCE will end 2024 at 3.0% year over year, higher than today at 2.8% YoY</p>\n</div>",
