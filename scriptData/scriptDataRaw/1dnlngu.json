I have deposited $5000 into my IRA so far this year and was up about $1000 and felt I was doing pretty good. I have done my best to learn as much as possible but with the way the market is now I find myself losing a bit daily no matter what I do. I really wish I had started investing years ago to put my money to work but I feel with the way things are now it’s just not that safe to buy into anything. I find I will invest and be up for a couple of days and then go back to the negative. I owe around 60k on my house. I have an emergency savings but other than that I have nothing else. I am not in the best of health and I really hope to pay my house off by age 50. My house is 3% Interest so I thought playing the market may be the best way to go about things and also leave a bit behind just in case something were to happen to me. I do not mind being a tad aggressive but have recently become nervous. I am going to try and max out my IRA each year but I should be able to at least contribute 5k a year. My significant other would be able to just barely afford the house if something were to happen to me and my biggest fear is leaving her with nothing. I feel at this point I am even cautious buying into the S&P. As of now my money is parked in Fidelity Spaxx. Is there any advice you can give me?\n",

The market wants to frustrate you and almost trick you into doing the wrong thing.  \nRather than what to buy, maybe we should be talking about graphing packages.  I could never trade if I could not see a graph with some history of the last year and last 20 or 30 days to actually see how the stock has been performing.  I never enter or exit without seeing the stock behavior so I can see if I am buying it low or at a recent high.  Many people use phones to trade and intuition but I simply cannot do that.  I must be able to see what is going on.  Everything goes up and down and being able to see how stocks behave over the last year or more is important.   Something to consider.",

Some great successes have come from learning to add more on dips instead of selling.  The market wants to frustrate you and almost trick you into doing the wrong thing.<br/>\nRather than what to buy, maybe we should be talking about graphing packages.  I could never trade if I could not see a graph with some history of the last year and last 20 or 30 days to actually see how the stock has been performing.  I never enter or exit without seeing the stock behavior so I can see if I am buying it low or at a recent high.  Many people use phones to trade and intuition but I simply cannot do that.  I must be able to see what is going on.  Everything goes up and down and being able to see how stocks behave over the last year or more is important.   Something to consider.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "You are thinking about investing all wrong.   You shouldn't even be looking at your investments on a daily or weekly basis.   You should be thinking in terms of years.   If you are investing in stocks, you should really be thinking 5+ years at least, preferably 10+.   What happens today, tomorrow, next week, 6 months, or even 2 years, should not be a concern for you.   You invest in stocks because you believe (based on an incredible track record) that your investment will grow over a longer time span (at least 5-6 years, preferably a decade or more).    If you don't have that much time, you shouldn't be investing in stocks.\n\nAlso, when I say \"investing in stocks,\" I mean index funds like the FXAIX that you got out of.   Don't day trade, and don't try to chase winners - it's a good way to end up behind where you would be if you just bought and held things like FXAIX.   Arguably you should diversify even beyond FXAIX.   Seriously consider adding some international diversification, and also small and mid cap.\n\nIf you are risk averse, you should perhaps put more money into a bond fund, or things of that nature.\n\nA good simple way to achieve a good, all in one portfolio, is via a target date fund.   IT will have you diversified across the US market, and international, and will slowly add bonds as you get nearer to your target date, making your portfolio less volatile and more secure as you get closer to actually needing the money.\n\nAt any rate, any investment is going to have its ups and downs.   We are interested in long term trends.   Long term, if you invest in a diverse portfolio (things like FXAIX, or VTI, or VTI + VXUS, or VT), you can reasonably expect to earn about a 5% yearly return, on average (edit: real return, ie accounting for inflation).   Obviously you will not get rich quickly this way, but historically it is a pretty reliable way to build your wealth over a long time span (again, think 6+ years... ideally much more than that).\n\nMoney that is needed in a year or two probably should not be invested in stocks at all.  And again, don't pick individual stocks.   Doubly so if you dislike volatility!   Diversification is how you lower volatility!",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You are thinking about investing all wrong.   You shouldn&#39;t even be looking at your investments on a daily or weekly basis.   You should be thinking in terms of years.   If you are investing in stocks, you should really be thinking 5+ years at least, preferably 10+.   What happens today, tomorrow, next week, 6 months, or even 2 years, should not be a concern for you.   You invest in stocks because you believe (based on an incredible track record) that your investment will grow over a longer time span (at least 5-6 years, preferably a decade or more).    If you don&#39;t have that much time, you shouldn&#39;t be investing in stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Also, when I say &quot;investing in stocks,&quot; I mean index funds like the FXAIX that you got out of.   Don&#39;t day trade, and don&#39;t try to chase winners - it&#39;s a good way to end up behind where you would be if you just bought and held things like FXAIX.   Arguably you should diversify even beyond FXAIX.   Seriously consider adding some international diversification, and also small and mid cap.</p>\n\n<p>If you are risk averse, you should perhaps put more money into a bond fund, or things of that nature.</p>\n\n<p>A good simple way to achieve a good, all in one portfolio, is via a target date fund.   IT will have you diversified across the US market, and international, and will slowly add bonds as you get nearer to your target date, making your portfolio less volatile and more secure as you get closer to actually needing the money.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, any investment is going to have its ups and downs.   We are interested in long term trends.   Long term, if you invest in a diverse portfolio (things like FXAIX, or VTI, or VTI + VXUS, or VT), you can reasonably expect to earn about a 5% yearly return, on average (edit: real return, ie accounting for inflation).   Obviously you will not get rich quickly this way, but historically it is a pretty reliable way to build your wealth over a long time span (again, think 6+ years... ideally much more than that).</p>\n\n<p>Money that is needed in a year or two probably should not be invested in stocks at all.  And again, don&#39;t pick individual stocks.   Doubly so if you dislike volatility!   Diversification is how you lower volatility!</p>\n</div>",
