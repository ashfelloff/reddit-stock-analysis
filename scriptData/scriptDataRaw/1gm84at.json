Earnings releases, tax cuts (elections), lower rates, etc. - there are endless catalysts. The stock market has become a casino. In my opinion, this all started during COVID with the influx of retail investors (and the boom of this sub) and while we've gone through a \"recession\" and down-markets, the excitement around the stock market is at an all-time high, as are valuations. I've mapped out the last 20 years and have taken a *very simple* approach. I know there are a ton more considerations, so please note any large ones I may be missing. Below is a table I put together in excel, and some explanation on each factor mentioned - when you step back, it looks like we're due for a major reset on valuations.\n\n**TLDR (Takeaways from the table):**\n\n**S&P500 Valuation.** Even though I don't like P/E ratios (in favor of EV/EBITDA), I'll use it as most folks here are more familiar with it. P/E ratios have been around \\~20x, and we are currently sitting at 30x. Looking back even further, they used to hover around the 10-20x P/E range. Yes, all companies are growing, so the S&P500 should too. But the growth in valuations is outpacing economic growth (see below). Larger and faster-growing companies deserve higher valuations, so this can be *part* of the reason, but current levels seem to be a stretch, especially if you compare it to actual GDP growth.\n\n**GDP Growth.** This is one I've been focused on lately. Nominal GDP in the US has gone up 2.4x over the last 20 years, yet the S&P500 has gone up 5.1x (total stock market went up 3.7x). Nuances: (1) international revenue of American companies is not in GDP, however the % of foreign revenue in the S&P has remained steady over the last 10-20 years. (2) this doesn't factor in private companies, IPO trends, de-listings, etc. Nominal GDP compares well to S&P500 as both are unadjusted for inflation.\n\n**CPI Index.** \"Inflation has come down, yay!\" The *rate* has come down. Many folks expected deflation after 2022, to restore prices, however that never happened. We're at *higher* prices than 2022. Inflation has picked up 34% over the last 10 years, vs. 24% in the preceding 10 years. Maybe this is the new norm, but it's all factoring into the revenues the S&P companies are generating, and thereby, the valuations.\n\n**National Debt.** I'm not an expert at this category, but we're adding on more national debt at a record pace as well. Most PPP loans were forgiven, credit is cheap (again), so if we keep adding here, when does the circus stop?\n\nEdit: I updated real GDP to nominal GDP below to reflect a more accurate comparison, but the punchline still stands - the S&P has far outpaced it, especially comparing the last decade to the decade before.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8nxjhe27kpzd1.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=39ca7aeda8bfbe0be1ec1f02310c803515ae3d3d\n\n",
