Today, I have an update on the data, the events of the past 2 months, and the position. Please see that topic for a broader explanation of my thesis and reasoning.\n\n**TL;DR**: I thought American consumers were defaulting on credit cards as fast as they were spending, and we were headed into a recession within a year.\n\n# What does the new data say?\n\nThe [G.19](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm) dropped of the 7th with June economic data on the American consumer. Revolving credit is down -1.5% YoY seasonally adjusted, and non-revolving credit is up 3.4%. This seems to confirm that May's increase in revolving credit was a fluke. We can also look at motor vehicle loans and see there was a spike in spending. Since the other part of my \"consumers are tapped out\" thesis was Americans weren't buying cars, what gives? Well two things have happened. First, vehicle interest rates are still quite high, so it's possible that some delinquencies are continuing to pile up interest. Vehicles are generally quick to be repossessed though so take that with a grain of salt and we would expect this to at this point be deflationary. What else is happening is vehicle prices [especially on the used market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02) are starting to fall back to natural levels. This is bringing their prices more in line with actual demand, which is healthy. However it is also deflationary and thus points to a weakened consumer vs. previous market expectations, as current demand cannot sustain the high prices. The used car market is a canary in the consumer demand coal mine, as all discretionary spending will likely follow. The artificially inflated prices we have seen the past few years will begin to fall off a cliff as consumers are forced to make more and more drastic cuts to their spending in order to keep their heads above water.\n\nThis sentiment is being echoed by weak guidance by Q2 earnings reports based on consumer spending habits. In my last post I predicted a mid Q2 earnings followed by weakened guidance and that appears to be what we're seeing, as the ETF I primarily trade, QQQ, dropped from over $500 at its high to around $430 within the past 2 months. All the pieces are coming together and, if anything, it looks like things are happening faster than I anticipated. I see either a market crash before the election, or a major downward pull followed by a strong run-up then the crash in Q4/Q1 2025. It is my opinion that a bear market is on the horizon, and we've already seen a blip of what might be possible when the tumbling begins, so I'm making final preparations to go whole hog into even more bearish positions.\n\n# Position Update\n\nLast post I updated that I'd purchased a $480 strike put on QQQ for June 2025 for $3,400. I sold this on 08/05 for $5,750 and traded a short put against it in the meantime to lower my basis. Now, except for a QQQ 430/435 08/16 CCS I sold, I'm holding cash and playing earnings, waiting for this green rebound to top out before I reposition into long puts for 2025.",
