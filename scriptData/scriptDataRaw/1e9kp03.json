The second source, however, said the CCI was asking an unusually large number of questions.\n\nReliance, which is led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the CCI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. Disney declined to comment. The CCI is still reviewing the merger.\n\nIf it closes, the Reliance-Disney deal will reshape India's $28 billion entertainment market where Zee Entertainment and Sony also operate.\n\nJefferies estimates Disney-Reliance will command 40% of the advertising market share in the TV and streaming segments.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/india-sends-100-antitrust-queries-092540877.html",
