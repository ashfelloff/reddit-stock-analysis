Bubble hotspots like Austin, Boise, Phoenix, Asheville, Jacksonville, Las Vegas etc etc haven’t seen much price reduction even though inventory has returned to pre pandemic levels. Inventory is sitting for months.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause there is no active suffering. There is no current pain for most people who own homes. Anyone who is holding stocks is doing pretty damn good right now. 401k’s are nice and fat for most people of homeowner age. The people in pain right now are those who don’t own assets, aka most consumers. Future home buyers. \n\nThe only thing holding the entire stock market together is AI. AI is in massive hype mode right now. It’s in the “this time it’s different” phase. While it really does produce a massive productivity increase, it’s not the magic people seem to think it is. It’s more like Excel or a calculator. Or the original computers. A productivity and efficiency booster in short. Investors seem to think it can replace everything. It won’t. At least not anywhere in the near term.\n\nWhen the reality of this sets in, and it will, the entire market will start coming down to reality again. \n\nWhy?\n\nEvery single company is reporting that consumers are in a very weak spot right now. Demand for almost everything is coming up less than anyone predicted. Companies are downgrading expectations for the year. People are fed up with inflation and the massive cost of living increases. Salaries are not rising to keep up with the cost of living. Even companies that are historically bulletproof such as McDonalds are surprised by a very weak consumer. Credit card debt is higher than ever right now. Student loans are sky high and aren’t being forgiven. People are graduating from STEM degrees and Master’s degrees yet they can’t find jobs in their field to pay back their loans. People are extremely risk adverse due to layoffs right now. Job openings for anything other than low paying jobs are worse than during the beginnings of COVID. \n\nDirect consumers make up 66% of the entire US GDP. The consumers are at their weakest in a very long time yet many companies and the broader market are near all time highs\n\nWhy? \n\nMarkets are being propped up by AI hype within a few certain companies. \n\nWhen this hype dies, the domino effect of pain and suffering will ensue. The panic selling of housing will ensue. No one will want to buy because no one can time a bottom (but they will try). People will be worth a whole lot less with no way to buy and will seek to off load their houses as quickly as possible to make up for their net worth loss. When retirement accounts and markets are down, this causes severe financial duress on people - mentally and literally. If we had current inventory levels during the crash in 2022, real estate would have crashed as well. Instead, it was propped up by low interest rates and an extremely strong job market. Picture the current weak consumer, with his 401k now cut down severely. \n\nWhen will this happen? I don’t know. How much more can hype propel the market? I don’t know. How low will the bottom be? I don’t know. It’s almost impossible to accurately time the market. But this will be the catalyst. ",

Currently even after the drop in prices it is  worth 550k and if I wanted to buy the same dang home again right now my payments would be like 5-6k a month. Why would I ever sell and buy a new house? Even if I lost my crazy high paying FAANG job I could probably find enough work to make the mortgage payment pretty easy. My savings would suffer, but it wouldn't make me sell my house. In a true recession I think you would see a lot of cars, boats, RVs, and other consumer stuff flood the market but homes locked in at low rates and low prices probably not unless it was the true financial apocalypse. I'd be working behind the dumpster at Wendy's before I sold this house and prices would have to drop 50% or more before it would be cheaper to buy a different home.",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Look in terms of existing home owners this is the reality is a crap ton of people locked in historically low rates at pre COVID prices. As an example I bought in March 2020 375k for a 3050 sq ft house at 2.65%. My mortgage with taxes is like 2800 a month. Currently even after the drop in prices it is  worth 550k and if I wanted to buy the same dang home again right now my payments would be like 5-6k a month. Why would I ever sell and buy a new house? Even if I lost my crazy high paying FAANG job I could probably find enough work to make the mortgage payment pretty easy. My savings would suffer, but it wouldn&#39;t make me sell my house. In a true recession I think you would see a lot of cars, boats, RVs, and other consumer stuff flood the market but homes locked in at low rates and low prices probably not unless it was the true financial apocalypse. I&#39;d be working behind the dumpster at Wendy&#39;s before I sold this house and prices would have to drop 50% or more before it would be cheaper to buy a different home.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "While the AI hype is surely inflating the market right now, it's somewhat of a stretch to say that it will be the main catalyst in bringing down the housing market. Your points on consumer weakness and inflated asset prices are on the money, but it seems a bit much of a simplification to ascribe that all to AI. More than just technological overvaluation, housing crashes throughout history have more to do with high interest rates, job loss, and credit crunches.\n\nYes, you may well be right, and stock markets may well take a dip when the AI bubble bursts, but I suppose relating that directly to the housing crash might be bypassing other major factors in the form of government policy responses, international economic pressures, or unforeseen global events like pandemics. Plus, a lot of people buy homes for long-term living, not short-term investment, which may help mitigate the damage a bit. But then again, I think it is not as simple as this; the situation does go beyond just the AI factor in an economy. What are the policy implications we should be considering here?",

As another poster mentioned, I do think &#39;the masses&#39; will eventually suffer more and more and perhaps this bust will be a catalyst for a bad period for them as you were pointing to.</p>\n</div>",
