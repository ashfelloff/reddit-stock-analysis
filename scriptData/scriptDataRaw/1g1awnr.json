They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. \n\n\nYou must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? \n\n\nThe reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. \n\nGoogle had something called \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS.\"  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. \n\nAI research and development was a part of it.\n\nIn 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.\n\nDeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.\n\n\nThe Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).\n\n\nNow going back to \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS\" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  \"Project Moonshots\" into \"X COMPANY\".\n\nYes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. \n\nThis is what X Company does -\n\nX's mission is to invent and launch \"moonshot\" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.\n\n A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. \n\nWork at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and \"Captain of Moonshots\".\n\nThe lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.\n\n\nSELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. \n\nThey are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).\n\n\nWhile Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. \n\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nGOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. \n\n\n\n. . . . . \n\n\nEDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup \n\n\nIf (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. \n\nIMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture.
