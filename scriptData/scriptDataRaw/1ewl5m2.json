                      "body": "It’s a good question. I don’t know off the top of my head. Here’s what ChatGPT says:\n\nWhen a company undergoes a corporate action like a spin-off, merger, or split into multiple companies, the handling of long-term options (LEAPS) is governed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The specific treatment depends on the nature of the corporate action. Here’s how LEAPS might be affected if a company splits into multiple companies:\n\n### **Scenario: Company A Splits into Companies B, C, and D**\nIf Company A splits into three separate entities—Company B, Company C, and Company D—your LEAPS (long-term call options) would generally be adjusted to reflect the new structure. Here’s what typically happens:\n\n1. **Adjustment of Options Contracts**:\n   - The original LEAPS on Company A would not disappear. Instead, they would be adjusted to reflect the ownership in the new companies (B, C, and D).\n   - The strike price and the number of shares covered by the option might be adjusted to account for the new distribution of shares.\n\n2. **Creation of New Options**:\n   - In many cases, new options will be created for Companies B, C, and D, and your original LEAPS might be converted into a package of options that cover all three companies. This is known as a **”package”** or **”basket”** option.\n   - For example, if you originally held 1 LEAPS contract on Company A, after the split, you might hold an adjusted contract that represents a certain number of shares in Company B, Company C, and Company D, combined.\n\n3. **Contract Symbol Change**:\n   - The ticker symbol of your option might change to reflect the new companies and the adjusted terms.\n\n4. **Strike Price and Number of Shares**:\n   - The strike price of your LEAPS might be adjusted downward to account for the distribution of the new companies.\n   - The number of shares the option controls could be altered to maintain the equivalent value before and after the corporate action. For example, instead of 100 shares of Company A, your option might now cover 50 shares each of Companies B, C, and D.\n\n5. **Expiration Date**:\n   - The expiration date of your LEAPS would typically remain the same.\n\n### **Example**:\nSuppose you held a LEAPS call option on Company A with a strike price of $100, covering 100 shares. If Company A splits into Companies B, C, and D, and each new company trades at $40 per share after the split, your original option might be adjusted as follows:\n\n- Your option might now give you the right to purchase 100 shares in each of Companies B, C, and D at a proportionately adjusted strike price.\n- Alternatively, you could end up with three separate options: one for each new company, with adjusted strike prices and share amounts.\n\n### **Important Considerations**:\n- **Notification**: You would receive a notification from your broker about the specific adjustments made to your options contracts.\n- **No Action Required**: Typically, as an options holder, you don’t need to take any action—the adjustments are automatically processed by the OCC.\n- **Value Preservation**: The adjustments are designed to preserve the intrinsic value of your original options, ensuring that you’re not disadvantaged by the corporate action.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhen a company like Company A splits into multiple companies (B, C, and D), your LEAPS will be adjusted to reflect the new structure. This adjustment ensures that your options maintain their value relative to the new companies. You’ll receive a detailed explanation from your broker regarding how the options have been modified, but the core idea is that you’ll continue to hold a position that reflects the new corporate structure.",

                      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>It’s a good question. I don’t know off the top of my head. Here’s what ChatGPT says:</p>\n\n<p>When a company undergoes a corporate action like a spin-off, merger, or split into multiple companies, the handling of long-term options (LEAPS) is governed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The specific treatment depends on the nature of the corporate action. Here’s how LEAPS might be affected if a company splits into multiple companies:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Scenario: Company A Splits into Companies B, C, and D</strong></h3>\n\n<p>If Company A splits into three separate entities—Company B, Company C, and Company D—your LEAPS (long-term call options) would generally be adjusted to reflect the new structure. Here’s what typically happens:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Adjustment of Options Contracts</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The original LEAPS on Company A would not disappear. Instead, they would be adjusted to reflect the ownership in the new companies (B, C, and D).</li>\n<li>The strike price and the number of shares covered by the option might be adjusted to account for the new distribution of shares.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Creation of New Options</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In many cases, new options will be created for Companies B, C, and D, and your original LEAPS might be converted into a package of options that cover all three companies. This is known as a <strong>”package”</strong> or <strong>”basket”</strong> option.</li>\n<li>For example, if you originally held 1 LEAPS contract on Company A, after the split, you might hold an adjusted contract that represents a certain number of shares in Company B, Company C, and Company D, combined.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Contract Symbol Change</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The ticker symbol of your option might change to reflect the new companies and the adjusted terms.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Strike Price and Number of Shares</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The strike price of your LEAPS might be adjusted downward to account for the distribution of the new companies.</li>\n<li>The number of shares the option controls could be altered to maintain the equivalent value before and after the corporate action. For example, instead of 100 shares of Company A, your option might now cover 50 shares each of Companies B, C, and D.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Expiration Date</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The expiration date of your LEAPS would typically remain the same.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3><strong>Example</strong>:</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose you held a LEAPS call option on Company A with a strike price of $100, covering 100 shares. If Company A splits into Companies B, C, and D, and each new company trades at $40 per share after the split, your original option might be adjusted as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your option might now give you the right to purchase 100 shares in each of Companies B, C, and D at a proportionately adjusted strike price.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, you could end up with three separate options: one for each new company, with adjusted strike prices and share amounts.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Important Considerations</strong>:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Notification</strong>: You would receive a notification from your broker about the specific adjustments made to your options contracts.</li>\n<li><strong>No Action Required</strong>: Typically, as an options holder, you don’t need to take any action—the adjustments are automatically processed by the OCC.</li>\n<li><strong>Value Preservation</strong>: The adjustments are designed to preserve the intrinsic value of your original options, ensuring that you’re not disadvantaged by the corporate action.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h3>\n\n<p>When a company like Company A splits into multiple companies (B, C, and D), your LEAPS will be adjusted to reflect the new structure. This adjustment ensures that your options maintain their value relative to the new companies. You’ll receive a detailed explanation from your broker regarding how the options have been modified, but the core idea is that you’ll continue to hold a position that reflects the new corporate structure.</p>\n</div>",
