That went out the window with the normalization of the internet, for better or worse. Now that everyone has all the information, what is left that makes us human? Intuition. You look at something and it makes you laugh, or smile, or otherwise associate positively to it. It doesn't have to be real. It just has to be trending. Look not into the information, but into the heart of the individual receiving that information. Right now, some AI somewhere already beat you to pricing in real market data. What that AI can't do, is factor in human emotion. The edge has shifted from quantitative to psychological.\n\nGranted, this is a short term strategy and I park long term savings mostly in ETFs. Any individual picks I do long term hold I still use \"stickiness,\" a term I use to encompass how strongly and how positively a quick psychological association would be formed by the average individual, as a metric to derive true value.",

I realized that you can&#39;t pick based on quantitative reasoning long ago. That went out the window with the normalization of the internet, for better or worse. Now that everyone has all the information, what is left that makes us human? Intuition. You look at something and it makes you laugh, or smile, or otherwise associate positively to it. It doesn&#39;t have to be real. It just has to be trending. Look not into the information, but into the heart of the individual receiving that information. Right now, some AI somewhere already beat you to pricing in real market data. What that AI can&#39;t do, is factor in human emotion. The edge has shifted from quantitative to psychological.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, this is a short term strategy and I park long term savings mostly in ETFs. Any individual picks I do long term hold I still use &quot;stickiness,&quot; a term I use to encompass how strongly and how positively a quick psychological association would be formed by the average individual, as a metric to derive true value.</p>\n</div>",

(think the doc was 2000s sometime but from the 90s) It touched on the introduction of all those trading pads they then started to integrate, and all the older traders basically put it down to guts and an almost knowing. Which I found super interesting, as in reality even if you just had a competition of tossing a coin forever, eventually you will always thin the crowd; and more importantly there will always be that outlier. Did they have an impact? Did they really have an edge? Or were they just there by chance?</p>\n\n<p>I had great fun picking stocks, but if someone doing it 9/5 can&#39;t do better, why would I somehow magically be better? RNG. And I have never liked relying on that. </p>\n\n<p>Cathie Woods was a great example, her whole thing has been fascinating to watch.</p>\n</div>",
