Your son is no exception. \n\nAt 12 years old, your son does not have deep technical or domain knowledge, nor financial analysis acumen, nor experience in accounting. \n\nBuilding capital to invest is the first step of being an investor. If your son does not have his own capital to invest, you should not be giving him any. \n\nI say this because it does not make sense to let a 12-year-old invest your money but give him the gains. It’s basically like giving a kid money to go gamble in a casino, where he gets to keep the winnings, but you have to bear the losses. \n\nYou can’t teach this lesson unless you have actual skin in the game. It has to actually hurt when you lose.\n\nThat being said, when I was your son’s age, I told my parents they needed to invest in Google shortly after they IPO’d. They said it was too expensive. Well, obviously, that was probably a mistake. So I do think that young people can spot emerging internet and cultural trends ahead of the market.\n\nSo I would say, support your son in allowing him to research companies that would make a good investments. For each of these recommendations he makes, you should request a written report that analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of the particular company and why your son believes that its growth will outpace the S&P 500. \n\nThen, if you think it’s a good report, pay him what you think the report is worth. Maybe $50 or $100. And then invest that cash into the company he is recommending. \n\n(The other option would a paper trading account, where he can “play around” with an account that allows paper stock trading.

There may be similar places online now for children interested in the market, or you can make your own.  He should use pretend money until either earning his own and/or until he demonstrates enough wisdom, strategy, a realistic goal, can articulate why a trade or investment profited or lost, what did he learn, how does he feel and how did he manage those emotions, and learn knowledge of fundamentals. In the meantime, real or fake money could go into VOO etc for comparison as an investment.\n\nFeeling sad about losses, even in a pretend game, is a normal and appropriate response. It's how the sadness is managed which is important. Does he dump more pretend money into a lost cause? Does he YOLO into something else? Plus, all the biophysical ways of expressing and coping with such emotion. Now is the best time to practice. Sometimes children learn a lot by experimenting in a game just to see what happens, or feel motivated to sit down and read a big dry book to get better at it. Once he is earning his own money with labor, that will be a whole new dimension and influence his goals (hopefully in a healthy manner)",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My middle school had a stock market club using fake money which met in the mornings over the newspaper. I wish I had joined, but my brother did and enjoyed it. There may be similar places online now for children interested in the market, or you can make your own.  He should use pretend money until either earning his own and/or until he demonstrates enough wisdom, strategy, a realistic goal, can articulate why a trade or investment profited or lost, what did he learn, how does he feel and how did he manage those emotions, and learn knowledge of fundamentals. In the meantime, real or fake money could go into VOO etc for comparison as an investment.</p>\n\n<p>Feeling sad about losses, even in a pretend game, is a normal and appropriate response. It&#39;s how the sadness is managed which is important. Does he dump more pretend money into a lost cause? Does he YOLO into something else? Plus, all the biophysical ways of expressing and coping with such emotion. Now is the best time to practice. Sometimes children learn a lot by experimenting in a game just to see what happens, or feel motivated to sit down and read a big dry book to get better at it. Once he is earning his own money with labor, that will be a whole new dimension and influence his goals (hopefully in a healthy manner)</p>\n</div>",
