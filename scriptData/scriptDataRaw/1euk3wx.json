Yen?\n\nWith the exception of possibly the last item on the list, none of these items will really increase systemic risk to US banks. The only geopolitical conflict that would seriously cause the global economy to meltdown is a confrontation between the U.S. and China (as we learned during Covid all manufacturing runs through the Pearl River Delta and the South China Sea!) and I find it interesting that this didn’t make your list. \n\nRussias economy is the size of Italy and Ukraines is even smaller, nothing is going to change in the U.S. equities market or banking system if they escalate. Ukraine just invaded Russia and nothing happened. “Recession possibilities” have been hyped hysterically for years with absolutely no result. We know the Fed is lowering rates this next quarter and every major bank is revising their economic estimates and removing any risk of recession. \n\nI know I sound too optimistic, but I’ve seen people screaming recession for years when all the economic indicators were worse, and they’ve all improved since then. We had a systemic banking problem create a bank run and the economy shrugged it off. A bunch of Trumpers trying to do Jan 6th 2.0 or Iran and Israel shooting missiles at each other isn’t going to crash the American economy. It’s not the 1970’s anymore. We produce most of our oil and most of the foreign supplies we need don’t even come from the Middle East.",

The only geopolitical conflict that would seriously cause the global economy to meltdown is a confrontation between the U.S. and China (as we learned during Covid all manufacturing runs through the Pearl River Delta and the South China Sea!) and I find it interesting that this didn’t make your list. </p>\n\n<p>Russias economy is the size of Italy and Ukraines is even smaller, nothing is going to change in the U.S. equities market or banking system if they escalate. Ukraine just invaded Russia and nothing happened. “Recession possibilities” have been hyped hysterically for years with absolutely no result. We know the Fed is lowering rates this next quarter and every major bank is revising their economic estimates and removing any risk of recession. </p>\n\n<p>I know I sound too optimistic, but I’ve seen people screaming recession for years when all the economic indicators were worse, and they’ve all improved since then. We had a systemic banking problem create a bank run and the economy shrugged it off. A bunch of Trumpers trying to do Jan 6th 2.0 or Iran and Israel shooting missiles at each other isn’t going to crash the American economy. It’s not the 1970’s anymore. We produce most of our oil and most of the foreign supplies we need don’t even come from the Middle East.</p>\n</div>",

They are at peace that they left money on the table for the ability to live their simple lives the way they want.\n\nI don't think current risks are any more significant than usual. We have had one recession a few years ago, and a stock market correction in 2023. Inflation is coming down and interest rate cuts along with the end of quantitative tightening will stimulate the economy. Wars could suddenly end with peace talks! China could pull out of their funk and start growing again. India could kick it up a notch after the slowdown in the last few years. Technology continues to drive more efficiency. So lots of upside as well to balance the risks.\n\nLook into the strategy of a \"bond tent\" - ramp up bonds before retirement, and then spend them down, leaving your equities to grow. Go long with a medium term bond fund. The rates will drop but you'll get appreciation/capital gains. Payments are all taxed at normal income tax rates. I don't know your numbers but you might need to adjust your spending down to account for that. Good luck!",

They are at peace that they left money on the table for the ability to live their simple lives the way they want.</p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t think current risks are any more significant than usual. We have had one recession a few years ago, and a stock market correction in 2023. Inflation is coming down and interest rate cuts along with the end of quantitative tightening will stimulate the economy. Wars could suddenly end with peace talks! China could pull out of their funk and start growing again. India could kick it up a notch after the slowdown in the last few years. Technology continues to drive more efficiency. So lots of upside as well to balance the risks.</p>\n\n<p>Look into the strategy of a &quot;bond tent&quot; - ramp up bonds before retirement, and then spend them down, leaving your equities to grow. Go long with a medium term bond fund. The rates will drop but you&#39;ll get appreciation/capital gains. Payments are all taxed at normal income tax rates. I don&#39;t know your numbers but you might need to adjust your spending down to account for that. Good luck!</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "My thoughts. First, I don't think these are good reasons to be overly defensive.\n\n1. There have always been international conflicts, and the powers driving the current ones, Russia and Iran, are both extraordinarily weak regimes which would likely crumble if aggressively confronted militarily, which won't fully happen anyway given the current state of leadership in the West. Bottom line, there isn't much unusual here, conflict in the ME has been going on for over a century, nothing has changed much, and nothing will.\n\n2. The election will be over in 3 months, and the outcome won't matter much anyway, given how little power a U.S. president actually has, and how small the shifts in legislative power, one way or the other, typically are in U.S. elections. Most of what happens *after* the election is just more certainty, and for that reason election years have historically been good for stocks, especially Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb.  \n\n3. There are always recession possibilities, and at the moment, if anything, they seem to be lower than normal. GDPNow is still projecting 2% real for Q3, and the last Fed rate hike was more than a year ago, so no reason to expect any significant lagged effects at this point. Plus inflation seems to be already just about defeated, the Fed able to begin cutting if needed, and nominal GDP growth likely to come in at a sustainable rate for Q3 (somewhere ~4.5%). Apart from some slight weakening in labor markets, the data is basically screaming \"soft landing\" at the moment. \n\n4. Russia is losing in Ukraine. They can't afford to expand this conflict. Ukraine expanding it, into Russia, should be seen as bullish.\n\n5. The Yen carry trade normally involves mainly short term trades, and isn't an especially high yield strategy (5-6% annual returns). The losses there were due to a sudden appreciation of the yen. I think this was a one-time thing, in response to one surprise move from Japan's central bank, and that Japan's economy isn't strong enough right now (relative to the U.S.) to expect much continued longer term appreciation of the yen relative to the dollar. \n\nThat all said, if you are < 4 years from retirement, it would make some sense to reduce your stocks to around 60% of your portfolio now, anyway. But I really wouldn't go below half. \n\nAnd in terms of diversifying your risk, beware that one of the biggest risks would be a resurgence of inflation, which tends to be bad for *both* equities and bonds, so there is some significant correlated risk there. For that reason, I prefer inflation protected bonds play a significant role in a balanced portfolio. On top of which, with the 5-year breakeven rate under 2% right now, I'd take the over if I'm betting on what inflation will be, so I think TIPS are probably the slightly better investment now anyway. \n\nIf you are a US citizen, I think one of your best options for your safer bond investments is to open an account with the US treasury at treasurydirect.gov. You can buy bonds directly there, but also can buy up to $10k in Series I Savings bonds, which currently pay 4.28%, but will adjust with inflation, and will basically pay 1.3% over CPI inflation for as long as you hold them. There's a small penalty (3 mos. interest) if you hold them less than 5 years, so don't put your short term funds here. But put $10k yearly into these until you have enough of a buffer that you won't have to touch your stocks within 10 years. \n\nAs for Funds, I can recommend also putting some into Fidelity's Capital and Income Fund (FAGIX). That fund is about 20% equities, but is mostly a bond fund, and is a pretty solid fit in a retirement portfolio (less aggressive than your equities, more aggressive than most of your bonds).\n\nFor shorter term funds you might need within the next 5 years, I think Money Markets are still the best bet. I don't think rates will be cut as much as some expect. I think they'll stay over 4% for the next couple of years, so long as fiscal deficits continue to remain high.",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>My thoughts. First, I don&#39;t think these are good reasons to be overly defensive.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There have always been international conflicts, and the powers driving the current ones, Russia and Iran, are both extraordinarily weak regimes which would likely crumble if aggressively confronted militarily, which won&#39;t fully happen anyway given the current state of leadership in the West. Bottom line, there isn&#39;t much unusual here, conflict in the ME has been going on for over a century, nothing has changed much, and nothing will.</p></li>\n<li><p>The election will be over in 3 months, and the outcome won&#39;t matter much anyway, given how little power a U.S. president actually has, and how small the shifts in legislative power, one way or the other, typically are in U.S. elections. Most of what happens <em>after</em> the election is just more certainty, and for that reason election years have historically been good for stocks, especially Nov, Dec, Jan, Feb.  </p></li>\n<li><p>There are always recession possibilities, and at the moment, if anything, they seem to be lower than normal. GDPNow is still projecting 2% real for Q3, and the last Fed rate hike was more than a year ago, so no reason to expect any significant lagged effects at this point. Plus inflation seems to be already just about defeated, the Fed able to begin cutting if needed, and nominal GDP growth likely to come in at a sustainable rate for Q3 (somewhere ~4.5%). Apart from some slight weakening in labor markets, the data is basically screaming &quot;soft landing&quot; at the moment. </p></li>\n<li><p>Russia is losing in Ukraine. They can&#39;t afford to expand this conflict. Ukraine expanding it, into Russia, should be seen as bullish.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Yen carry trade normally involves mainly short term trades, and isn&#39;t an especially high yield strategy (5-6% annual returns). The losses there were due to a sudden appreciation of the yen. I think this was a one-time thing, in response to one surprise move from Japan&#39;s central bank, and that Japan&#39;s economy isn&#39;t strong enough right now (relative to the U.S.) to expect much continued longer term appreciation of the yen relative to the dollar. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That all said, if you are &lt; 4 years from retirement, it would make some sense to reduce your stocks to around 60% of your portfolio now, anyway. But I really wouldn&#39;t go below half. </p>\n\n<p>And in terms of diversifying your risk, beware that one of the biggest risks would be a resurgence of inflation, which tends to be bad for <em>both</em> equities and bonds, so there is some significant correlated risk there. For that reason, I prefer inflation protected bonds play a significant role in a balanced portfolio. On top of which, with the 5-year breakeven rate under 2% right now, I&#39;d take the over if I&#39;m betting on what inflation will be, so I think TIPS are probably the slightly better investment now anyway. </p>\n\n<p>If you are a US citizen, I think one of your best options for your safer bond investments is to open an account with the US treasury at treasurydirect.gov.
