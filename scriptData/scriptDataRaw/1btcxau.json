In an industry where guidance is critical to stock valuation, Carnival posted a record quarter in which it upped its yearly estimates for just about every metric.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Performance over the quarter was impressive](https://preview.redd.it/yxifvud04xrc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf5370671a5ff7609f74362c43443a44fff527a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Guidance was also increased](https://preview.redd.it/cazkp5i34xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e2c9169f6c5569d21905b881c4d09461db41a0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).\n\nHowever, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10. Considering that Carnival has positioned itself even better as of today, I see this phenomenon repeating itself soon. This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wouldn't be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings](https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDebt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being ahead of schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Debt repayments have accelerated](https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :\n\nCarnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 3).\n\nCarnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.\n\nWhy I think the stock took a beating: If I’m being honest, I do not understand why the market’s reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnival’s key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.\n\nAt this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.\n\n\\*This is not Financial advice\\*\n\nPosition:\n\n[Position is fairly optimistic, but i think the thesis is sound](https://preview.redd.it/soqd93mk4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b860ecc709beca6678602924fece0c9af8ee05e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - buy undervalued cruise line stock; it about to go up; if you dumb-dumb and want to gamble like me, purchase short-term OTM calls\n\nWhy won't automod let me post is someone short this. Nvm, let me try removing links. Sources will be in the comments. ",

In an industry where guidance is critical to stock valuation, Carnival posted a record quarter in which it upped its yearly estimates for just about every metric.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/yxifvud04xrc1.png?width=1084&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0bf5370671a5ff7609f74362c43443a44fff527a\">Performance over the quarter was impressive</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/cazkp5i34xrc1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a7e2c9169f6c5569d21905b881c4d09461db41a0\">Guidance was also increased</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).</p>\n\n<p>However, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10. Considering that Carnival has positioned itself even better as of today, I see this phenomenon repeating itself soon. This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5\">Wouldn&#39;t be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Debt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being ahead of schedule.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4\">Debt repayments have accelerated</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>The Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :</p>\n\n<p>Carnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 3).</p>\n\n<p>Carnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.</p>\n\n<p>Why I think the stock took a beating: If I’m being honest, I do not understand why the market’s reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnival’s key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.</p>\n\n<p>*This is not Financial advice*</p>\n\n<p>Position:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/soqd93mk4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b860ecc709beca6678602924fece0c9af8ee05e6\">Position is fairly optimistic, but i think the thesis is sound</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>TLDR - buy undervalued cruise line stock; it about to go up; if you dumb-dumb and want to gamble like me, purchase short-term OTM calls</p>\n\n<p>Why won&#39;t automod let me post is someone short this. Nvm, let me try removing links. Sources will be in the comments. </p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",
