The AlexNet paper which was just about the first paper to leverage (Nvidia) GPUs to scale up image recognition did not come out until 2012.

Nvidia developed the first domain specific language (Cg; circa 2004) for building programmable shaders. Before Cg was invented, shaders were incredibly hard to program. Games like DOOM3 had to have specialized code paths for different GPUs and I believe the shaders themselves had to be written in a low level assembly-like language.\n\nCg not only simplified the creation of shaders, but it also locked in gamedevs for several years into Nvidia's ecosystem.

                                  "body": ">You’re conflating multiple technologies with CUDA now. Physx isn’t tied to CUDA either and predates it to begin with.\n\nNvidia basically rewrote PhysX when porting it to CUDA, and again for PhysX 3, when they rewrote several solvers. There's no point in bringing up Ageia PhysX when it hasn't existed for 2 decades now, especially since it was bespoke to the Ageia PPU. Nvidia's PhysX GPU acceleration only works on CUDA on CUDA compliant GPUs. And Maya supported GPU accelerated PhysX. \n\n>Fine, I was incorrect about Blender but You complain that Blender needed AMD to add OpenCL support and your own link shows NVIDIA needed to contribute support for their own APIs.\n\nExcept AMD didn't add openCL support to Cycles, and I didn't say they did. I said they had to pay to get the Cycles openCL backend rewritten to support their cards. That happened because of how broken their openCL drivers were and they apparently found it easier to make some software compatible with their drivers than fix their implementation of openCL. The re-written split kernel openCL backend was released in 2015 with Blender 2.75. So the only reliable way to use Cycles with openCL for 4 years was with Nvidia cards, which ran better on the CUDA backend anyway. Optix doesn't even have anything to do with the fact that Nvidia was the only company putting any effort into offering OpenCL as a viable platform. I'm not even blaming AMD for offering a broken feature and claiming they supported it, but pointing out how Nvidia was de facto the only company putting effort into supporting openCL, and the 2nd best option was a distant second, so your insistence that openCL went down because of nvidia doing some underhanded things is absurd. \n\n>And yes khronos is a consortium. One I’m very well familiar with and have worked with which is why I am making the claim I am. Anyone who was involved with Khronos at the time knows this. NVIDIA have a very outsized influence there. Consortiums don’t mean equal influence.\n\nDo you work for AMD or something? Saying nvidia sabotaged openCL is usually something someone with a vested interest against them would repeat.\n\n>Consortiums don’t mean equal influence\n\nGood thing there are dozens of members then. A plurality can't beat a majority. Saying they have an outsized influence is just a hand wave, disregarding the fact that they're still only a small part of a cross-industry consortium.  \n\n>And if you would read rather than just rush to argue, I’m saying OpenCL 3 is essentially DOA because everyone moved on after OpenCL 2 died. Part of its death is because the biggest vendor decided to not support it. It’s not the only reason. Literally multiple times I’ve said OpenCl 3 arrived too late and everyone had moved on.\n\nIt's convenient for you to say that openCL 2 was the point at which openCL died even though it was also DOA like OpenCL 3. OpenCL 3 has conformant devices from most of the major manufacturers, except AMD. So it's strange to say it's dead when there's probably more device support for it than 2, especially with AMD's marketshare shrinking and intel launching discrete GPUs.

Physx isn’t tied to CUDA either and predates it to begin with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nvidia basically rewrote PhysX when porting it to CUDA, and again for PhysX 3, when they rewrote several solvers. There&#39;s no point in bringing up Ageia PhysX when it hasn&#39;t existed for 2 decades now, especially since it was bespoke to the Ageia PPU. Nvidia&#39;s PhysX GPU acceleration only works on CUDA on CUDA compliant GPUs. And Maya supported GPU accelerated PhysX. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Fine, I was incorrect about Blender but You complain that Blender needed AMD to add OpenCL support and your own link shows NVIDIA needed to contribute support for their own APIs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Except AMD didn&#39;t add openCL support to Cycles, and I didn&#39;t say they did. I said they had to pay to get the Cycles openCL backend rewritten to support their cards. That happened because of how broken their openCL drivers were and they apparently found it easier to make some software compatible with their drivers than fix their implementation of openCL. The re-written split kernel openCL backend was released in 2015 with Blender 2.75. So the only reliable way to use Cycles with openCL for 4 years was with Nvidia cards, which ran better on the CUDA backend anyway. Optix doesn&#39;t even have anything to do with the fact that Nvidia was the only company putting any effort into offering OpenCL as a viable platform. I&#39;m not even blaming AMD for offering a broken feature and claiming they supported it, but pointing out how Nvidia was de facto the only company putting effort into supporting openCL, and the 2nd best option was a distant second, so your insistence that openCL went down because of nvidia doing some underhanded things is absurd. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And yes khronos is a consortium.

Saying nvidia sabotaged openCL is usually something someone with a vested interest against them would repeat.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consortiums don’t mean equal influence</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Good thing there are dozens of members then. A plurality can&#39;t beat a majority. Saying they have an outsized influence is just a hand wave, disregarding the fact that they&#39;re still only a small part of a cross-industry consortium.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you would read rather than just rush to argue, I’m saying OpenCL 3 is essentially DOA because everyone moved on after OpenCL 2 died.

Literally multiple times I’ve said OpenCl 3 arrived too late and everyone had moved on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s convenient for you to say that openCL 2 was the point at which openCL died even though it was also DOA like OpenCL 3. OpenCL 3 has conformant devices from most of the major manufacturers, except AMD. So it&#39;s strange to say it&#39;s dead when there&#39;s probably more device support for it than 2, especially with AMD&#39;s marketshare shrinking and intel launching discrete GPUs. At the very least it&#39;s more alive than 2 ever was. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You seem to want to have a very binary view of the history of OpenCL and CUDA. Which, fine, have at it.

Maya included OpenCL deformers before it had any CUDA or Optix use (which came later when they bought in Solid Angle).\n\nIIRC FLIP launched with CUDA and built out openCL over the next few years. What parametric software? Because simulation software or features adjacent to parametric software supported CUDA first. Autodesk Moldflow and Ansys only supported CUDA in the early 2010s and after a quick search they might still be CUDA only. Not sure what parametric modeling software would need CUDA or openCL unless it was doing sims, in which case CUDA (or Nvidia GPUs rather) was usually the first to be supported.\n\n>Maya included OpenCL deformers before it had any CUDA or Optix use (which came later when they bought in Solid Angle).\n\nMaya 2012 (in 2011) straight up used physX for physics simulations. I can even pull up their press release. GPU deformers were added several years later. \n\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20110823050610/http://news.autodesk.com/news/autodesk/20110301005102/en/Autodesk-Maya-2012-Software-Ways-Explore-Refine](https://web.archive.org/web/20110823050610/http://news.autodesk.com/news/autodesk/20110301005102/en/Autodesk-Maya-2012-Software-Ways-Explore-Refine)\n\n>For rendering , yes Blender used CUDA but not directly. It used it via Optix which is an important distinction to make because it offered Ray acceleration algorithms and denoisers which don’t necessarily use CUDA under the hood to run. Optix has become sort of the gold standard for rendering acceleration APIs I’ll grant it that.\n\nCycles only had a (bespoke) CUDA backend for years. They didn't add Optix support until they added support for RTX specifically. The first optix implementation wasn't even up to feature parity with their CUDA implementation. \n\n[https://developer.blender.org/docs/release\\_notes/2.81/cycles/#NVIDIA\\_RTX](https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.81/cycles/#NVIDIA_RTX)\n\n>You also can’t just claim “the problem was with with OpenCL” and ignore that OpenCL 2 is a product of Khronos. You also can’t ignore that NVIDIA is one of the more influential members of Khronos either. \n\nKhronos is a consortium. Having influence doesn't mean you just get what you want. When something is designed by committee and contributions you're just as liable to get what you didn't want as much as you are to get what you wanted. It's not like it's just AMD and Nvidia either. Adobe, Intel, Apple, Arm, EA, IBM, Qualcomm, Samsung, etc. are all influential members and most of them barely care about OpenCL and they all have employees contributing to openCL standards. Apple was going to drop support for OpenCL yet they still had employees working on openCL 3.0. \n\n>Whether other companies has problematic support is just whataboutism to escape that NVIDIA specifically refused to support it at all after being one of the drivers for the changes to OpenCl from 1 to 2.\n\nIt's not whataboutism at all. You're saying Nvidia not supporting openCL 2 was an underhanded move to make openCL fail, but the reality is no one was actually supporting it. The consortium just produced something no one actually wanted to support.  \n\nThe only OpenCL 3.0 conformant AMD device is apparently an unreleased APU in a chromebook, at least I don't think there any APUs with Zen 4 (Raphael) and RDNA 2 (mendocino). The last openCL version they were conformant to was 2.0. Does AMD not supporting OpenCL 3.0 mean AMD is sabotaging openCL? You can see for yourself here.\n\n[https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opencl](https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opencl)",

What parametric software? Because simulation software or features adjacent to parametric software supported CUDA first. Autodesk Moldflow and Ansys only supported CUDA in the early 2010s and after a quick search they might still be CUDA only. Not sure what parametric modeling software would need CUDA or openCL unless it was doing sims, in which case CUDA (or Nvidia GPUs rather) was usually the first to be supported.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maya included OpenCL deformers before it had any CUDA or Optix use (which came later when they bought in Solid Angle).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maya 2012 (in 2011) straight up used physX for physics simulations. I can even pull up their press release.

They didn&#39;t add Optix support until they added support for RTX specifically. The first optix implementation wasn&#39;t even up to feature parity with their CUDA implementation. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.81/cycles/#NVIDIA_RTX\">https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/2.81/cycles/#NVIDIA_RTX</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You also can’t just claim “the problem was with with OpenCL” and ignore that OpenCL 2 is a product of Khronos. You also can’t ignore that NVIDIA is one of the more influential members of Khronos either. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Khronos is a consortium. Having influence doesn&#39;t mean you just get what you want. When something is designed by committee and contributions you&#39;re just as liable to get what you didn&#39;t want as much as you are to get what you wanted. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s just AMD and Nvidia either. Adobe, Intel, Apple, Arm, EA, IBM, Qualcomm, Samsung, etc. are all influential members and most of them barely care about OpenCL and they all have employees contributing to openCL standards. Apple was going to drop support for OpenCL yet they still had employees working on openCL 3.0. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether other companies has problematic support is just whataboutism to escape that NVIDIA specifically refused to support it at all after being one of the drivers for the changes to OpenCl from 1 to 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#39;s not whataboutism at all. You&#39;re saying Nvidia not supporting openCL 2 was an underhanded move to make openCL fail, but the reality is no one was actually supporting it. The consortium just produced something no one actually wanted to support.  </p>\n\n<p>The only OpenCL 3.0 conformant AMD device is apparently an unreleased APU in a chromebook, at least I don&#39;t think there any APUs with Zen 4 (Raphael) and RDNA 2 (mendocino). The last openCL version they were conformant to was 2.0. Does AMD not supporting OpenCL 3.0 mean AMD is sabotaging openCL? You can see for yourself here.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opencl\">https://www.khronos.org/conformance/adopters/conformant-products/opencl</a></p>\n</div>",

I’m not saying NVIDIA led to its demise alone but they weren’t exactly passive about it. For folks who were involved with the khronos group, a lot of the requests that led to OpenCL 2 being a pita came from NVIDIA before they dropped plans to support it even. </p>\n\n<p>OpenCL 3 came out far too late to cover the lost ground. </p>\n\n<p>And I already said the competitors kept messing up their response to CUDA but part of that was trying to deal with coming to terms with Open CL 2 failing, and finding their own strategies.</p>\n</div>",

          "body": "I let chatgpt answer the OP question as we are on the topic of A.I. Here's what chat gpt said when I pasted the question.... ->\n\nAbsolutely, I can provide some thoughts on those questions:\n\n### 1. **Was Jensen Huang a visionary for investing in CUDA, or simply lucky?**\nHuang's decision to invest in CUDA back in 2007 was far from guaranteed success. CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) required a huge amount of foresight because, at the time, GPUs were primarily used for graphics processing. Huang and Nvidia bet on the future of parallel computing, recognizing that GPUs could be repurposed for a wide range of computing tasks, particularly in scientific, machine learning, and AI fields. This decision to push CUDA, despite slow adoption, shows strategic foresight.\n\nWhat prevented others from doing something similar was likely a combination of risk tolerance, a lack of vision for GPU usage outside of gaming, and perhaps the failure to see the potential for parallel computing to become so widespread. Many companies are hesitant to invest heavily in something that doesn’t promise short-term returns, which Nvidia was willing to do.\n\n### 2. **If you are invested in Nvidia, how much do you consider Hwang's foresight a valuable \"x-factor\"?**\nIf I were an Nvidia investor, I would place significant weight on Huang's foresight as an \"x-factor.\" His ability to anticipate market trends, like the rise of AI, data centers, and GPU-accelerated computing, has positioned Nvidia as a leader in several emerging fields. The value here isn't just in technological innovation but in consistently understanding the next big computing wave, as Nvidia's dominance in AI shows.\n\nHuang’s track record of driving Nvidia through multiple technology cycles—graphics, parallel computing, AI—suggests that his leadership and vision are crucial to the company’s long-term value. For many investors, his strategic foresight may be seen as priceless, and likely a major reason behind Nvidia’s market premium.\n\n### 3. **If you don’t like Nvidia, how much of that is due to Huang?**\nFor those skeptical of Nvidia, Huang’s aggressive and ambitious strategy may be seen as a risk. While his success with CUDA, AI, and GPU leadership is undeniable, critics may point to potential overreach in his broader ambitions. Nvidia has seen some regulatory scrutiny, especially around its acquisition attempts (like ARM), and this could be seen as a reflection of Huang’s risk-taking behavior. Critics might argue that Nvidia has focused too much on diversifying into multiple sectors, which could dilute its focus and stretch resources.\n\nMistakes might include underestimating competition from companies like AMD in the gaming and consumer space or failing to bring the ARM acquisition to fruition, which could have been a game-changing move for the company. Another potential criticism could be that Nvidia’s products are premium-priced, which sometimes alienates broader markets.\n\n### 4. **What about Huang’s other projects (Omniverse, Isaac, self-driving)?**\nHuang has certainly diversified Nvidia’s portfolio. Projects like Omniverse (for 3D design and simulations), Isaac (robotics), and Nvidia's self-driving platform demonstrate his ambition to position Nvidia at the forefront of multiple revolutionary industries. These are all cutting-edge fields, and if successful, they could provide Nvidia with additional revenue streams that further solidify its leadership in tech.\n\nHowever, the risk of overstretching is real. These projects demand immense resources, and the market for them is still maturing. For example, while self-driving cars are promising, widespread adoption has been slower than many expected. The Omniverse could become a big player in virtual worlds and digital twins, but it's not guaranteed. Critics might say that Huang is spreading the company too thin across too many unproven areas, which could detract from Nvidia's core strengths in GPUs and AI.\n\nThat said, Huang has proven to have a knack for placing strategic bets, and if even a couple of these projects succeed, Nvidia could continue its dominant trajectory. Whether these ventures become big winners or overreach will depend largely on market timing and execution.\n\n---\n\nIn summary, Jensen Huang’s mix of foresight and risk-taking has undeniably shaped Nvidia’s success. While luck may play a role in any business venture, Huang’s consistent ability to stay ahead of technological trends has solidified Nvidia’s position. Whether Nvidia’s future success hinges on continuing to make those strategic bets or potentially slowing down to focus on core products is an open question.",

Many companies are hesitant to invest heavily in something that doesn’t promise short-term returns, which Nvidia was willing to do.</p>\n\n<h3>2. <strong>If you are invested in Nvidia, how much do you consider Hwang&#39;s foresight a valuable &quot;x-factor&quot;?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>If I were an Nvidia investor, I would place significant weight on Huang&#39;s foresight as an &quot;x-factor.&quot; His ability to anticipate market trends, like the rise of AI, data centers, and GPU-accelerated computing, has positioned Nvidia as a leader in several emerging fields. The value here isn&#39;t just in technological innovation but in consistently understanding the next big computing wave, as Nvidia&#39;s dominance in AI shows.</p>\n\n<p>Huang’s track record of driving Nvidia through multiple technology cycles—graphics, parallel computing, AI—suggests that his leadership and vision are crucial to the company’s long-term value. For many investors, his strategic foresight may be seen as priceless, and likely a major reason behind Nvidia’s market premium.</p>\n\n<h3>3. <strong>If you don’t like Nvidia, how much of that is due to Huang?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>For those skeptical of Nvidia, Huang’s aggressive and ambitious strategy may be seen as a risk. While his success with CUDA, AI, and GPU leadership is undeniable, critics may point to potential overreach in his broader ambitions. Nvidia has seen some regulatory scrutiny, especially around its acquisition attempts (like ARM), and this could be seen as a reflection of Huang’s risk-taking behavior. Critics might argue that Nvidia has focused too much on diversifying into multiple sectors, which could dilute its focus and stretch resources.</p>\n\n<p>Mistakes might include underestimating competition from companies like AMD in the gaming and consumer space or failing to bring the ARM acquisition to fruition, which could have been a game-changing move for the company. Another potential criticism could be that Nvidia’s products are premium-priced, which sometimes alienates broader markets.</p>\n\n<h3>4. <strong>What about Huang’s other projects (Omniverse, Isaac, self-driving)?</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Huang has certainly diversified Nvidia’s portfolio. Projects like Omniverse (for 3D design and simulations), Isaac (robotics), and Nvidia&#39;s self-driving platform demonstrate his ambition to position Nvidia at the forefront of multiple revolutionary industries. These are all cutting-edge fields, and if successful, they could provide Nvidia with additional revenue streams that further solidify its leadership in tech.</p>\n\n<p>However, the risk of overstretching is real. These projects demand immense resources, and the market for them is still maturing. For example, while self-driving cars are promising, widespread adoption has been slower than many expected. The Omniverse could become a big player in virtual worlds and digital twins, but it&#39;s not guaranteed. Critics might say that Huang is spreading the company too thin across too many unproven areas, which could detract from Nvidia&#39;s core strengths in GPUs and AI.</p>\n\n<p>That said, Huang has proven to have a knack for placing strategic bets, and if even a couple of these projects succeed, Nvidia could continue its dominant trajectory. Whether these ventures become big winners or overreach will depend largely on market timing and execution.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>In summary, Jensen Huang’s mix of foresight and risk-taking has undeniably shaped Nvidia’s success. While luck may play a role in any business venture, Huang’s consistent ability to stay ahead of technological trends has solidified Nvidia’s position. Whether Nvidia’s future success hinges on continuing to make those strategic bets or potentially slowing down to focus on core products is an open question.</p>\n</div>",

In America, there’s a strong tendency to attribute success entirely to merit, but this isn’t really the case. CEO are just people, they’re not the god like figures many people believe they are. Very often, success comes from events that are largely unforeseen and not under executives control. There’s plenty of studies that back this up.</p>\n\n<p>That isn’t to say CEOs are useless. There are certainly some very good ones. But people tend to attribute a greater share of a company’s success to outstanding leadership than is really the case.</p>\n</div>",
