No actual track record of fully driverless driving approved by regulators. This is a Level 2-3 autonomy based on the SAE's official criteria. It is available worldwide and I think that is awesome, and I know it's a great experience under human supervision, but still objectively a Level 2-3 autonomy.\n\nWaymo, Cruise has: Fully driverless self-driving. It has cleared regulatory compliance to be actually able to drive around driverless, and is actually doing so. Geographically limited though, meaning it is a Level 4 autonomy based on the SAE criteria. It is commercially available to average customers, meaning that you and I can sign up and ride it today. \n\nSo based on 1) The SAE's official hierachy of Levels of Autonomy, and 2) Actual commercial availability and regulatory clearance of fully autonomous cars, I think it is safe to claim that Waymo and Cruise are way ahead of Tesla.",

      "body": "1. Fundamentals aren't weak. They are the only profitable EV automaker in the world with a $30b cash stack and little to no debt. Other automakers lose billions selling a few thousand EV's. Ford just reported results and loses $44k per EV sold - the same amount they sell EV's for. For this entire year, Ford is expected to lose $5.5b selling EV's. \n2. P/E ratio is such a horrible metric to use. Companies grow in stages. P/E ratio only works when you're comparing mature companies in similar industries. It's a metric highly valuable in 1990's but largely phased out as soon as tech companies burst into the scene. Tech companies take time for R&D to pay off. Often times, losing money for many years (increases P/E ratio) for a payoff in the future. Think companies like Amazon.\n3. EV sales are a downward trend in high inflation, high rates, and declining incomes. It's common sense. If you're struggling due to a higher cost-of-living, you're not going to take a chance buying an EV (new technology) and will buy what you know because it's consistent. When these factors reverse, EV's will benefit more than ICE sales.\n4. You forgot to mention energy storage, supercharging network, self-driving tech, and robotics. Self-driving tech/robotics, you either believe it will happen or not. These are very difficult products/services because they are revolutionary. So it will take time, R&D, and insane amounts of effort to perfect it. There are lots of YouTube videos for you to make a decision on whether self-driving will happen. I'm betting that it will. Robotics is tricky because Tesla wants to make it a humanoid robot with human actions. I'm not as high as they are on it and think it's better suited as a commercial robot that can replace tedious work in a factory or work environment.\n5. The only thing that affects a stock price is what people are willing to pay for it. The low P/E ratio with other automakers has to do with the fact that no one wants to buy those companies. Low growth, highly leveraged debt, and an inability to innovate. Ford's stock price today is the same price it was in 1996. Imagine holding for nearly 30 years and you've made nothing except paltry dividends.\n6. The Elon factor is huge. And why wouldn't it be? People hate on him because of his politics but one thing you can't question is his vision and innovative mindset. EV's don't exist without Elon. FACT. What other auto companies are trying to accomplish by having a profitable EV, Elon led Tesla to accomplishing it without having any experience previously working with vehicles. He wanted to buy a rocket from Russia to launch his own space rocket. Russia laughed at him because of his lowball offer. What did he do? Started SpaceX. Last year, they launched the largest space rocket into space in human history. And btw, it's a REUSABLE rocket. People all across the world can now access the internet using Starlink, a product that uses satellites launched into space via SpaceX rockets. It went from doing $1.4 billion in revenue in 2022 to expected revenue of $6.5-7 billion this year. They're securing contracts from cruise and airline companies because it's the best option by far. My point is, whilst I disagree with Elon being as politically involved as he is, the market loves a visionary and innovative individual and no one can deny that he isn't. It's the same reason why Steve Jobs is a notorious dick but you couldn't question his vision for Apple.",
