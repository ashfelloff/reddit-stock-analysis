It tests us to the limit and builds character. \n\nI entered the stock market in Jan 2021. The first stock I bought was CCIV (now lucid) with options and it was the tail end of the spac-mania. Put in about 20k and life was good. I didn’t know making money was so easy. Waking up and find thousands of dollars in my account. In 1 month, I 4x the money. Surely I can do it again? \n\nFast forward, I lost it all. All 80k. No risk management, nothing. \n\nTook a 6 months break. But I came back, 100% on options. \n\nThis is not addiction. This is dedication. \n\nHonestly, I can’t remember what I bought when I returned. I only remember buying Chinese options when HSI (hong Kong index) went back to 1997 level. Gained lots but lost more and I swore to never touch Chinese stock again. But they become relevant again because of the stimulus. (More on that later)\n\nMy low point was 7k at the start of 2024 and I managed to 5x it with the AI boom. I’m fucking sure no one expected the market to recover late last year. AI carried the entire stock market. \n\nI’m lucky I was out before the implosion happened on late July - August. I was still down 20% but remember, it’s 100% options. It could be much worse. \n\nRight now I’m 60% in US stocks (30% in Tesla for the robo taxi) and 40% in Chinese stocks. \n\nWhat I’ve learnt so far:\n-slow money is faster. Fast money is death. \n-price to dream ratio is the best when things are hyped and uncertain. (Hence Tesla and Chinese stock)\n- don’t earn the last dollar. Run when everyone is onboard. (Totally out of AI) \n-never concentrate more than 30% in 1 holding. \n-when you are not certain, Buy/Sell half of the intended position. \n- you only buy more/leverage more if you are in the green. Never the other way around. \n\n\nLooking ahead, I positioned more Chinese options. I think this is the moment I’ve been waiting for. I can read Chinese and I find that English DD doesn’t go into the details of the stimulus. Particularly, 800b yuan swap facilities for collaterals (including stocks which makes even less supply) can ONLY be used to buy stocks. This is their equivalent of QE and their timing is impeccable. (They were waiting for fed to cut rates.) they probably also need the stock market to replace their currently dead real estate market. \n\n3 Reasons to buy\n1. Stocks can be used as collateral and be locked up (supply drops) and the money must go into the stock market. (Demand increase)\n2. It’s mentioned that there could be more rounds of the same size. \n3. They are cheap. Many stocks’s Forward PE is single digit. Vs high 20s in US. \n\n3 Reasons not to buy. \n1. It’s Chinese. \n2. It’s Chinese. \n3. It’s Chinese. \n\n\nTLDR. Got greedy + cocky and lost it all. But I’m glad I lost it all early rather than later. I made a comeback over the past 10 months. Betting on Chinese stocks now. Still 100% on options. ",

      "body": "China was one of the largest holders of US Treasuries,Bonds and Notes but seeing what happened to Russia,Iraq,Iran,Libya,Afghanistan,Lebanon,and others money in the US they decided that that they had to sell as their money was not safe and bring it back home.When it went back home they figured they would do what the FED did in America and BOJ did in Japan which was to put it into their markets to prop up local economy. The difference though is the US and Japan were printing money to do so. By doing this China can pretty much do what the US and Japan did. Manipulate GDP numbers,put money into people’s pockets which would then increase spending from profits made from stock market rally. When the Chinese make money, the first thing they do is go out and buy cars and houses. This would resolve quite a bit of the housing glitch market issues in China. This would also increase spending, which would change a lot of the numbers in China. It would also raise funds for manufacturers in China that are competing with the US and the chip industry. With all this money coming back from the US into China’s market, it would make China’s market more stable and by doing so many countries would view China’s market and economy as being stable just like they did of that of the US in Japan, which then led to money coming in from other countries The same what happened in China. The Chinese are actually quite smart. They figured if Japan and the US could do it. We could do it as well. The Chinese stock, market and indexes pretty much rallied over 35% in under 10 days trading. What took US index nine months to gain they did and just under 10 days so imagine the buying power in China compared to that of the US. The same applies to Japan. I don’t think any index or market around the world was able to gain 35% or more and under 10 days. That is what you call a bull market. In the US, the money from QE was the equivalent of $100 billion per month but recently overtime has dropped to around 80 billion per month. When you do the numbers that is roughly $4 billion per day that they have at their disposal to inject into the market at any time. It’s pretty much pure manipulation and they were able to manipulate the market and index for the Dow to go from 20,000 to 40,000 just over double And the same applies for NASDAQ and the S&P 500. China never really did this. They use their money to prop up their infrastructure and their country. They did not use their money to prop up the stock markets. Now that they’re infrastructure is way ahead of out of the US. They can start propping some of their money into the markets as well when Covid hit the US put out stimulus packages and gave the people money. China did not do so and many of their people were not happy many businesses shut down many people lost money. Many people are unemployed, and this is where the problems started for the Chinese and China. China has now realize this and wanted to put some money into the pockets of their people so the money that they sold from US treasury notes and bond, which came back to China pretty much got directly injected back into their markets and will continue to do so.  I speak some Mandarin as well myself.",
