Concentrate sales were 1 point behind unit case volume, primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments.\n\n**Full Year 2024**\n\nFor comparable net revenues (non-GAAP), the company expects a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) is expected to include a 1% to 2% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes. — No Update\n\nThe company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 14% to 15%. — Updated\n\nThe company expects comparable EPS (non-GAAP) growth of 5% to 8%, versus $2.69 in 2023. — No Update\n\nThe company expects to generate free cash flow excluding the IRS tax litigation deposit (non-GAAP) of approximately $9.2 billion.\n\n**Fourth Quarter 2024 Considerations** \n\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include an approximate 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions, in addition to a 4% to 5% headwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural changes.\n\n**Full Year 2025 Considerations**\n\nComparable net revenues (non-GAAP) are expected to include a low single-digit currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.\n\n  \nKey Takeaways:\n\nOrganic sales shine again Organic revenue rose 11% during the quarter vs a 9.3% consensus estimate, with unit case volume up +2% and Latin America up +12%. The organic sales growth outpaced PepsiCo's 9.3% mark in a recently completed period. Unit case volume was down 1% for Coca-Cola globally during the quarter, with growth led by Brazil, the Philippines and Japan but more than offset by declines in China and Türkiye.\n\nNorth America outperforms Unit case volume in North America showed flat growth in trademark Coca-Cola products, while water, sports, coffee and other beverages saw mixed results. Price/mix grew 11%, driven by favorable mix and pricing actions in the marketplace. Operating income grew 10%, benefiting from organic revenue growth.\n\nMargins march higher Consolidated comparable operating margin rose 90 basis points to 29.7% in the period. This improvement was primarily driven by strong organic revenue growth and restructuring bottling operations, partially offset by currency headwinds.\n\nLooking ahead Coca-Cola sees full-year adjusted organic revenue growth of +10% vs +9.0% consensus. The company expects to deliver comparable currency neutral EPS growth of +14% to +15%.\n\nComparable EPS (non-GAAP) percentage growth is expected to include a mid-single digit currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions.",

Techs market share has actually gone no where since the late 60s. It peaked in the .com bubble and is again in a slight bubble now, but overall, not changed since then.

Lots of boom and busts and big time consolidation and concentration of value. \n\nStaples havent really changed much either in terms of market share but like I try to describe above, its very easy to pick winners from staples precisely because they are not boom and bust. At worst, they get bought out but they will never go obsolete. This low risk characteristic is extremely valuable because even a dummy can pick winner 90% of the time. You cant say that about picking tech or finance or even energy stocks. Are the big tech giants of the 60s still around? Some yes, but mostly no.
