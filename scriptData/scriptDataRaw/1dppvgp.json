The kind of stock to keep for the next 10 or 20 years is the second important component — will the company or commodity exist in the future, or is it a dying business that’ll be outlawed eventually? Fundamental analysis is used in finance to evaluate the intrinsic value or real worth of a security as well as entire sectors and markets.\n\nThere’s widespread agreement that assessing investments through fundamental analysis is necessary for long term investing.

Unlike fundamental analysis, which focuses on the intrinsic value of an asset, the technical analysis examines the volume and price of shares over time.

Whether one is seeking to improve their lifestyle or prepare for retirement, the data is important to consider. Investing is risky. The more confluence one could find pointing toward a similar direction, the better.\n\nIt’s important to use both techniques in investing and not to be susceptible to impulse investing or simply trusting someone’s piece of advice.

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH). The EMH distinguishes between weak, semi-strong, and strong efficiency. In a weakly efficient market, price data cannot be used for excess returns. In a semi-strongly efficient market, fundamental data cannot be used for excess returns. Research often finds markets to be weakly efficient, with less evidence supporting the semi-strongly efficient market hypothesis (one of the hottest debates in finance). Hence, trading/investing on fundamentals should offer more opportunities for alpha.\n2. The social media argument. Just look at the sheer number of traders that focus on technical analysis. Most trading tools are also focused on charting and other technical indicators. This means potential alpha is arbitraged away more quickly in technical strategies. One might argue that this observation is mainly true for the retail market, but it still serves as an indication of the overall market trends. Structuring fundamental data for quantitative trading is much more difficult due to lower data quality and irregular time intervals, which may reduce competition and leave more opportunities for alpha.",
