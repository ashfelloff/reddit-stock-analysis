Shares had tumbled more than 30% last year amid challenges including ongoing litigation over the Monsanto unit and high net debt.\n\nThe company said in a statement Wednesday that there was “no basis for a different outcome on appeal,” and that it believed the Washington Court of Appeals’ decision had identified three errors in the case, including that testimony for the plaintiffs regarding PCB exposure lacked scientific validity.\n\nBayer argues the claims relate to industrial materials which Monsanto voluntarily ended manufacture of in 1977.\n\nBayer acquired U.S. agrichemical-maker Monsanto in 2018.\n\nThe deal has led to the company fighting myriad legal challenges in various U.S. courts over alleged negative health effects, including cancer, from exposure to Monsanto products including Roundup weed killer.\n\nAccording to Reuters, around 125,000 charges have been brought against the product in the U.S., more than half of which had been resolved following a $10.9 billion settlement in 2020.\n\nIn September, the company secured a legal win when the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia found in its favor in a claim that Monsanto violated state law by failing to add a cancer warning to the Roundup label.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/09/bayer-shares-drop-after-us-court-announces-review-of-monsanto-case.html",

Moreover, Mr. Portier received $160,000 from law firms suing over glyphosate. When asked about this potential conflict of interest, Mr. Portier initially claimed to be advising firms on other IARC-related lawsuits and not glyphosate litigation.

It is also worth noting that Mr. Portier had no experience with glyphosate prior to his work on it for IARC.\n> \n> Following Mr. Portier’s arrival at IARC, the final glyphosate study was altered in at least 10 ways to remove or reverse conclusions finding no evidence of carcinogenicity. The agency removed multiple scientists’ conclusions that studies found no link between glyphosate and cancer in lab animals and statistical analyses of studies with negative findings were turned into positive ones. The determination that glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic” was based on “limited evidence” of carcinogenicity in humans and “sufficient evidence” in experimental animals.",

At the same time Mr. Portier was working for the agency, he was being paid by the Environmental Defense Fund, an anti-pesticide group. Moreover, Mr. Portier received $160,000 from law firms suing over glyphosate. When asked about this potential conflict of interest, Mr. Portier initially claimed to be advising firms on other IARC-related lawsuits and not glyphosate litigation. He later acknowledged that his statement was wrong. It is also worth noting that Mr. Portier had no experience with glyphosate prior to his work on it for IARC.</p>\n\n<p>Following Mr. Portier’s arrival at IARC, the final glyphosate study was altered in at least 10 ways to remove or reverse conclusions finding no evidence of carcinogenicity. The agency removed multiple scientists’ conclusions that studies found no link between glyphosate and cancer in lab animals and statistical analyses of studies with negative findings were turned into positive ones. The determination that glyphosate was “probably carcinogenic” was based on “limited evidence” of carcinogenicity in humans and “sufficient evidence” in experimental animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>",
