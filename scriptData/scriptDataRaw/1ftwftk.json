If the people who know the company best are buying its stock, it's a good indication of confidence in the company's future. Lynch values insider buying as a sign that the company won't go bankrupt soon and that management is aligned with shareholders' interests.\n\nMy examples: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) & Carnival Corporation (CCL)\n\n***The Company is Buying Back Shares:***\n\nCompanies that buy back their own shares reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases the value of the remaining shares. This action typically indicates the company believes its shares are undervalued and is a way to reward investors. Lynch sees share buybacks as a very positive move, often more beneficial than other use of capital like dividends or acquisitions​.\n\nMy examples: Apple (AAPL) & Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)",
