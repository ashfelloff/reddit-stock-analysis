I've been reading up on the major financial crises recently (see below summaries in case you're curious) and I am wondering what people think might trigger the next one and when it might happen.\n\nWhile there's a lot of hype around AI, which could potentially be a risk factor, it's also highly beneficial in many areas, so I might be off the mark.

What do you think could lead to a major downturn?\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSUMMARIES OF MAJOR CRISES \n\n1. 1973 Oil Crisis\n Triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. This caused severe inflation, economic recession, and a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide.\n\n2. Black Monday (1987)\nOn October 19, 1987, global stock markets crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 22.6% in a single day. The exact causes are debated but include computerised trading and overvaluation.\n\n3. Japanese Asset Price Bubble (1991)\nA massive speculative bubble in Japanese real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. The Nikkei index lost about 50% of its value, leading to a prolonged economic slump known as the \"Lost Decade.\"\n\n4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997)\nBeginning in Thailand with the collapse of its currency, the crisis spread across East Asia, leading to massive currency devaluations, stock market declines, and economic turmoil in countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\n5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000)\nAfter a period of extreme speculation in internet-related companies, the bubble burst, leading to a massive decline in the NASDAQ and global stock markets. Many tech companies went bankrupt, and trillions of dollars in market value were wiped out.\n\n6. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)\nThe most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Stock markets around the world plummeted, leading to the Great Recession.\n\n7. European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010)\nThe crisis started with concerns over Greece's high debt levels and quickly spread to other Eurozone countries. Stock markets across Europe fell sharply, and there were fears of a Euro collapse, leading to significant volatility in global markets.\n\n8. Chinese Stock Market Crash (2015)\nA dramatic decline in the Chinese stock market, fueled by a combination of high levels of margin trading and government intervention. This led to a significant drop in global stock markets, with concerns about China's economic slowdown.\n",

This would affect various industries, including:\n\n*  Electronics: iPhones, laptops, and other devices would be delayed or unavailable.\n*  Automotive: Car production would slow or stop due to the lack of semiconductors.\n*  Healthcare: Medical equipment, such as ultrasounds and vital sign monitors, would be impacted.\n\nTSMC controls 61.7% of the global semiconductor foundry market. That would be an INSANE shock to the market.\n\nPrice Increases: With reduced supply, prices for affected products would surge, contributing to:\n\n* Inflation: A global recession could ensue as prices rise and consumer spending decreases.\n* Trade Imbalances: Countries dependent on imported electronics and automotive goods would face significant trade deficits.\n\nGlobal Recession: The combined effects of supply chain disruption, price increases, and trade imbalances could lead to a global recession, potentially worse than the 2008 financial crisis. \n\nTSMC is directly tied to AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, among others, which rely on TSMC for manufacturing services.

This would affect various industries, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li> Electronics: iPhones, laptops, and other devices would be delayed or unavailable.</li>\n<li> Automotive: Car production would slow or stop due to the lack of semiconductors.</li>\n<li> Healthcare: Medical equipment, such as ultrasounds and vital sign monitors, would be impacted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>TSMC controls 61.7% of the global semiconductor foundry market. That would be an INSANE shock to the market.</p>\n\n<p>Price Increases: With reduced supply, prices for affected products would surge, contributing to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Inflation: A global recession could ensue as prices rise and consumer spending decreases.</li>\n<li>Trade Imbalances: Countries dependent on imported electronics and automotive goods would face significant trade deficits.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Global Recession: The combined effects of supply chain disruption, price increases, and trade imbalances could lead to a global recession, potentially worse than the 2008 financial crisis. </p>\n\n<p>TSMC is directly tied to AMD, Apple, ARM, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Qualcomm, and Nvidia, among others, which rely on TSMC for manufacturing services. If they go down, the entire stock market goes down. </p>\n\n<p>A Chinese invasion of Taiwan and the destruction of TSMC would have far-reaching and devastating consequences for the global economy. The resulting supply chain disruption, price increases, and trade imbalances would trigger a global recession that will easily last for years. That outcome would make the Japanese Lost Decade pale in comparison to what devastation could happen.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "You forgot to add the recession of 2020. It was the last formally declared recession, and was quickly declared over due to the immediate emergency response. This ended up resulting in a lot of weird actions such as the excessive carry trade with the Japanese yen which began unwinding recently, causing a panic for a few days, that is no longer considered a threat.\n\nThere was also an undeclared recession in 2022, after the peak of 2021 in November. Take a look at (5) year charts of the NASDAQ for example, which demonstrated a -30% decline. The \"magnificent 7\" collective lost an incredible amount of value, and Tesla in particular lost around 75% of its value during that time.\n\n2023 AI boom, which has continued to this day, is on an absolutely unsustainable course. But the levers of financial manipulation currently work too fast to actually catch up to reality, and that is ultimately going to be the downfall, as it always is.\n\nLook at Nvidia's chart for another example. It has spiked in ways that rival or exceed the dot-com bubble, which took about a decade to ramp up & crash to a bottom.\n\nBut this time it is happening at breakneck speed, so may perhaps only take half the time to crack.\n\nI've speculated in the past, however, that a catastrophic act of war may be the impetus for the next crash which is unavoidable in terms of political & financial market rhetoric. However, NBER would need to be pressured to announce & acknowledge this, and the sitting President would need to admit the reality of the situation.\n\nSo, in short, the series of bubbles from COVID money printing, AI stock options, and a lacking underlying economic engine to support this false sense of growth is what is going to cause the next collapse, but it is unlikely to become transparent without an event such as the invasion of Taiwan, or advanced aggression in the Pacific with DPRK, retaliation from Russia, a broadening of the Middle Eastern conflict (which is already happening) in conjunction with America losing a grip on it all.",

      "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>You forgot to add the recession of 2020. It was the last formally declared recession, and was quickly declared over due to the immediate emergency response. This ended up resulting in a lot of weird actions such as the excessive carry trade with the Japanese yen which began unwinding recently, causing a panic for a few days, that is no longer considered a threat.</p>\n\n<p>There was also an undeclared recession in 2022, after the peak of 2021 in November. Take a look at (5) year charts of the NASDAQ for example, which demonstrated a -30% decline. The &quot;magnificent 7&quot; collective lost an incredible amount of value, and Tesla in particular lost around 75% of its value during that time.</p>\n\n<p>2023 AI boom, which has continued to this day, is on an absolutely unsustainable course. But the levers of financial manipulation currently work too fast to actually catch up to reality, and that is ultimately going to be the downfall, as it always is.</p>\n\n<p>Look at Nvidia&#39;s chart for another example. It has spiked in ways that rival or exceed the dot-com bubble, which took about a decade to ramp up &amp; crash to a bottom.</p>\n\n<p>But this time it is happening at breakneck speed, so may perhaps only take half the time to crack.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve speculated in the past, however, that a catastrophic act of war may be the impetus for the next crash which is unavoidable in terms of political &amp; financial market rhetoric. However, NBER would need to be pressured to announce &amp; acknowledge this, and the sitting President would need to admit the reality of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, the series of bubbles from COVID money printing, AI stock options, and a lacking underlying economic engine to support this false sense of growth is what is going to cause the next collapse, but it is unlikely to become transparent without an event such as the invasion of Taiwan, or advanced aggression in the Pacific with DPRK, retaliation from Russia, a broadening of the Middle Eastern conflict (which is already happening) in conjunction with America losing a grip on it all.</p>\n</div>",
