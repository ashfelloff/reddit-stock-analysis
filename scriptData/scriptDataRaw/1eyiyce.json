If growth here is restricted, TD could deliver sub-par earnings growth relative to peers over the next several years,\" National Bank analyst Gabriel Dechaine wrote.\n\nThe $2.6 billion provision announced on Wednesday comes on top of $450 million it set aside in April.\n\nThe probes have been a major overhang on TD's stock over the last year, with investors concerned about the resolution timeline and potential cost. The clarification of the direct financial impact of the bank's AML issues could result in a short-term \"relief rally,\" Dechaine said.\n\nThe stock has fallen 5% so far this year, underperforming the TSX banking index's 8.6% growth.\n\nIn Canada, personal and commercial banking recorded a 13% rise in net income driven by new account openings and volume growth. TD's wealth management and insurance earnings were flat, reflecting impact from severe weather events.\n\nThe net loss was C$181 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, in the three months ended July 31, compared with a profit of C$2.88 billion, or C$1.53 per share, a year earlier.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, TD earned C$2.05 ($1.51) per share, 2 Canadian cents short of analysts' estimates, according to LSEG data.\n\nProvision for credit losses rose to C$1.07 billion, compared with C$766 million a year ago.\n\nTD kicks off the earnings season for Canadian banks with others slated to report their results next week.\n\nSource: https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/td-bank-swings-quarterly-loss-101701381.html",
