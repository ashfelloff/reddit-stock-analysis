  "selftext": "Walgreens on Thursday reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that fell short of expectations and slashed its full-year adjusted profit outlook, citing a “challenging” environment for pharmacies and U.S. consumers.\n\nThe retail pharmacy giant now expects fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings of $2.80 to $2.95 per share. That compares with the company’s previous outlook of between $3.20 and $3.35 per share.\n\n″’We assumed.. in the second half that the consumer would get somewhat stronger” but “that is not the case,” Walgreens CEO Tim Wentworth told CNBC. \n\nHe added that “the consumer is absolutely stunned by the absolute prices of things, and the fact that some of them may not be inflating doesn’t actually change their resistance to the current pricing. So we’ve had to get really keen, particularly in discretionary things.” \n\nStill, Walgreens topped revenue estimates for the quarter on strong performance in its health-care segment. The company views that business division as critical to its ongoing push to transform from a major drugstore chain into a large health-care company. \n\nThe results come as Walgreens works to slash costs after a rocky last year marked by low pharmacy reimbursement rates, weakening demand for Covid products and a challenging macroeconomic environment. \n\nThe company on Friday said it is simplifying its U.S. health-care portfolio and finalizing plans to close underperforming U.S. stores over multiple years, among other ongoing cost-cutting efforts. \n\n“75% of our stores drive 100% of our profitability today,” Wentworth said. “What that means is the others we take a hard look at, we are going to finalize a number that we will close…”\n\nHere’s what Walgreens reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 63 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $36.4 billion vs. $35.94 billion expected\n\nWalgreens booked sales of $36.4 billion for the quarter, up 2.6% from the same period a year ago. \n\nThe company reported a net income of $344 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter. That compares with a net income of $118 million, or 14 cents per share, for the same period a year ago.\n\nExcluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 63 cents per share for the quarter. \n\nWalgreens did not provide a new revenue forecast for the fiscal year. The company has not offered that guidance since October, when it said it expected $141 billion to $145 billion in sales. \n\nStrong performance in health-care division \n\nWalgreens reported growth across its three business divisions in the fiscal third quarter. But the company’s U.S. health-care unit stood out, as sales jumped 7.6% compared with the same period a year ago. \n\nRevenue for the segment came in at $2.13 billion. Analysts had expected sales of $2.08 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. \n\nThe company said the higher sales reflect primary care provider VillageMD and specialty pharmacy company, Shields Health Solutions. Shields saw sales jump 24% during the period, driven by growth within existing partnerships.\n\nSpecialty pharmacies are designed to deliver medications with unique handling, storage and distribution requirements, often for patients with complex conditions such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThose results come one quarter after Walgreens posted a steep net loss as it recorded a hefty nearly $6 billion charge related to the decline in value of its investment in VillageMD. The company now plans to shutter 160 VillageMD clinics, executives announced during the company’s fiscal second-quarter earnings call in March. \n\n“We are working with their management team to ultimately still be an investor, but meaningfully reduce our investment as well as gain some liquidity so that we can invest back in the retail pharmacy business that represents our future,” Wentworth told CNBC of the company’s investment in VillageMD.\n\nWalgreens’ U.S. retail pharmacy segment generated $28.5 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter, an increase of 2.3% from the same period last year. Analysts had expected sales of $28.34 billion, according to estimates compiled by FactSet. \n\nThat segment operates more than 8,000 drugstores across the U.S., which sell prescription and nonprescription drugs as well as health and wellness, beauty, personal care, and food products.  \n\nThe company said that sales growth came entirely from comparable pharmacy sales and partially offset by a decline in retail revenue.\n\nWalgreens said pharmacy sales for the quarter rose 4.4% and comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.7% compared to the year-earlier period due to price inflation in brand medications and prescription growth. \n\nTotal prescriptions filled in the quarter including vaccines totaled 306.4 million, a 0.5% increase from the same period a year ago. \n\nRetail sales for the quarter fell 4% from the prior-year quarter, and comparable retail sales declined 2.3%. The company pointed to a “challenging” retail environment, among other factors. \n\nWalgreens’ international segment, which operates more than 3,000 retail stores abroad, posted $5.73 billion in sales in the fiscal third quarter. That’s an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/27/walgreens-wba-earnings-q3-2024.html",
