If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi, then many analysts see this as a major positive.\n\nTesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one, and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla’s main asset, but its self-driving robotaxi network, which is just now coming fully into focus, is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product, which would give Tesla very favorable economics.\n\n**Bear Viewpoint:**\n\nOn the other side, many believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business, labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company, metrics that have really suffered in 2025. \n\nIn order for features such as FSD, or full self-driving, to be as accurate as possible, Tesla needs more data. To get more data, the EV maker needs more cars on the road, hence where the Model 2 comes in.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
