I understand that the Fed has a mandate to make money, but my searches indicate that the Fed has no longer been underwater on these assets since mid 2023. I think most economists would agree that the percentage of MBS and \"other\" assets on the balance sheet should be close to zero, and for better or worse, 100% of fed members are economists.

It seems to me that the Fed can cut interest rates, which helps everyone, even low-income earners, and still attack inflation by the selling of mortgage backed securities. Lower interest rates should give a boost to real-estate, but the Fed could conceivably manage any related real-estate growth by accelerating and decelerating the sale of MBS and other assets. \n\nThe reason I am asking is that I'm heavy on tech and waiting for warnings signs of economic trouble. Anecdotally, a ton of REIT deals that were financed at low interest rates pre-covid will have to refinance at much higher rates late this year and early next year. Many companies won't be able to do so. I personally don't mind if they can't, and I even experience joy at the economic troubles of all the companies with business models that involved leasing office space and parasitically re-renting it at much higher prices, with speculators adding no value to the economy. I would love to see these speculators get burned. If they still come out ahead because the Fed doesn't want them to be burned, then that reeks of moral hazard.\n\nHowever, I am worried that Fed members know more than I do, and that Fed members are worried about real-estate exposure on bank balance sheets. For example, CITI has a price/book around .55, which ordinarily would be a no-brainer buy. But, a number like that makes me worried that banks are in more serious trouble than their typically well-above book value prices represent, and that the Fed is happy to allow for real-estate inflation, even though it is driving overall inflation, to keep is MBS assets from going underwater again. \n\nI'd love to hear from any economists who know what is actually going on or anyone who is very plugged into the MBS market.",

Due to locked in effect, existing home sales volume is incredibly low at 2009 level. That means that homeowners are in no rush to sell, unless if the sale price is incredibly attractive. Homebuilders also don't want to lower official listing prices, but choose to give incentives worth around 5-10% discount under the table instead. Due to the low mortgage rates, people who want to upgrade their home will also try to buy a second home and rent out their primary one, instead of selling then buying. Homebuyers are also constantly told by their RE agents to just buy a home now and refinance 1-2 years later when mortgage rates drop. Homebuilders even buy down their rate by 2% for the first 2 years to make the mortgage payment look cheaper before they refinance. These four factors mean only the super wealthy, or someone who severely downgraded their standards, who really need a home will buy a home, propping up official home prices.",

Due to locked in effect, existing home sales volume is incredibly low at 2009 level. That means that homeowners are in no rush to sell, unless if the sale price is incredibly attractive. Homebuilders also don&#39;t want to lower official listing prices, but choose to give incentives worth around 5-10% discount under the table instead. Due to the low mortgage rates, people who want to upgrade their home will also try to buy a second home and rent out their primary one, instead of selling then buying. Homebuyers are also constantly told by their RE agents to just buy a home now and refinance 1-2 years later when mortgage rates drop. Homebuilders even buy down their rate by 2% for the first 2 years to make the mortgage payment look cheaper before they refinance. These four factors mean only the super wealthy, or someone who severely downgraded their standards, who really need a home will buy a home, propping up official home prices.</p>\n</div>",

It was really the perfect storm.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST1F\n\nLook at housing starts and then compare that to the population. The only thing that is going to fix the issue is time to build more homes. People thinking housing is going to crash just don’t understand that in desirable areas where there are jobs there just aren’t enough single family homes for the number of people who want to own them. Prices don’t fall because every drop in price is met with the next buyer with that price range and there is demand all the way down. It’s more likely prices will just stagnate for years while houses get built. ",

It was really the perfect storm.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST1F\">https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HOUST1F</a></p>\n\n<p>Look at housing starts and then compare that to the population. The only thing that is going to fix the issue is time to build more homes. People thinking housing is going to crash just don’t understand that in desirable areas where there are jobs there just aren’t enough single family homes for the number of people who want to own them. Prices don’t fall because every drop in price is met with the next buyer with that price range and there is demand all the way down. It’s more likely prices will just stagnate for years while houses get built. </p>\n</div>",

They believe we have a data collection problem where real-time rents aren't flowing through on the data, but I don't get the sense they are concerned about rent inflation. Real time rent is slowing down, but not on the data. They've been patient with the data flow lag for about 1 year now, and I think they're not gonna grow impatient until maybe 2025. I think as long as monthly core PCE doesn't annualize to 3.0%+, they are okay with letting the rent inflation stay high on the data. Once it goes above 3.0%, they will become uncomfortable, and that's when they start looking for the low hanging fruit to bring inflation down.\n\nNow as far as housing affordability goes, I have zero clue why housing prices haven't dropped yet. People keep saying demand is way too high. Where is all this demand popping up from out of nowhere in the last 4 years? WFH is almost done, homebuilders are still ramping up supply, housing affordability is at 40 years low. I have a house, and even I cannot afford the mortgage if I just bought it this year.\n\nMy guess is that the people with second/third houses and 3% mortgage are refraining from selling them because they believe it's too good to throw away. They are renting those houses out instead, even if the rent only breaks even the mortgage. So while housing prices are still high, rent prices are much lower relatively. Rent demand, however, is also elevated due to the influx of immigration (legal + illegal) in the US over the last 2 years. It's estimated that there were 4m of new immigrants in the US since 2022, double the usual amount.\n\nSo until immigration slows down to the normal level and rent demand slows down, forcing these rental homes to be empty and eventually sold for profits, I don't think housing prices will normalize. Or if we including mortgage cost into the inflation metrics, then maybe they start addressing the housing affordability issue.

              "body": "To your point, the Fed IS trying to offload and unwind its MBS positions.  It doesn't benefit them to hold onto MBS that are no longer underwater, because the goal of the Fed is NOT to generate profit, but simply to achieve price stability and maximum employment.  The process of buying up toxic assets like MBS is to clean up the financial system whenever it crashes, so that firms don't shut down.  It is a safety protocol for the economy, not a profit-generating protocol.  The Fed has been trying to slowly offload its MBS since 2022.  Maybe it's not as fast as what people would like, but they've been holding a lot of toxic assets over the years since they rescued the economy twice in 2008 and in 2020.  It will take time for the process to occur, because they don't want to flood the market with MBS, and offloading a large amount of them will put upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nI'm not here to make excuses for the Fed, because they DO need to shrink their balance sheet.  If their job is to act like a sponge to soak up toxic asset when \"shit hit the fan\", then the sponge is looking pretty full and saturated right now.  It needs to empty some of those assets off its books so that it can get ready for the next financial crisis (which will inevitably happen, since we've designed the economy that way).  However, the process of quantitative tightening (QT) is still being worked out, and we don't know what negative effects it can have, so the Fed is proceeding with caution.  They are offloading their balance sheet as fast as they can, in order to get ready for the next crisis, without adversely affecting the \"landing\" of the current financial crisis.\n\nThis article from Richmond Fed is helpful for example:  https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2022/q3_federal_reserve\n\nI don't understand why traders are obsessed with the Fed's balance sheet.  As traders, you make money based on what will happen next, but the Fed's balance sheet is not deployed to rescue the economy until crisis already happened.  Focusing on the Fed's balance sheet doesn't help you predict the future of where the market will move next.  It's like trying to predict where the next crime will happen, by looking at how full are the jails.  I can assure you that the Fed doesn't know when the next crisis will happen; they just know that it will definitely happen again because we've engineered our economic system that way.",

The MBS that the Fed buys are essentially securities (backed by the value of homes, but they are not homes themselves) that the banks no longer want, because their value have dropped too much.  When the Fed buy these MBS from the banks, they're bailing out the banks because they're giving the banks valuable cash equivalent securities in return for the toxic value of the MBS.  The Fed can hold onto these toxic MBS assets on their balance sheet in the long-run, because they have infinite liquidity to absorb the losses.  So you can think of the Fed as going around soaking up all the toxic MBS asset, and absorbing losses from these MBS assets in the short-run.  Eventually, they will sell these MBS back at market value, but the price of these MBS usually bounce back in the long-run and so the Fed often make some profit when they sell the MBS (generating profit is not their goal though).  I'm describing this mechanics to you, because the action of buying and selling MBS is just a clean up tool AFTER a crisis already happened; it's not an effective tool in managing inflation, and predicting when the next crisis will occur.  \n\nI also don't know which economist you're talking who believe that the amount of MBS on the Fed's balance sheet should be \"close to zero\".
