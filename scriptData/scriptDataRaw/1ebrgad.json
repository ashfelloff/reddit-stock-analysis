      "body": "Yep, luxury trade is at an end.  LVMH is much better than Kering, but I wouldn't touch either.\n\nThe massive growth was due to Covid and China.  Luxury watches are similarly in free fall.  China was the region that was driving most of the growth in luxury goods.\n\nRight now, the Chinese economy is doing badly, and I am actually seeing a culture shift too.  Before, all Chinese wanted to buy the premium Western luxury, but now many are shifting to buying Chinese brands and no longer chasing Western luxury as much.  I think even if the Chinese economy rebounds, it isn't coming back.  Don't get me wrong, there will always be a big luxury market in China, but not the same extent as before.\n\nI can't really see India being the next country.  Their growth is pretty unevenly distributed, and I think culturally, when they have more money, they probably want to spend more on gold and jewelry than designer goods?",

Luxury watches are similarly in free fall.  China was the region that was driving most of the growth in luxury goods.</p>\n\n<p>Right now, the Chinese economy is doing badly, and I am actually seeing a culture shift too.  Before, all Chinese wanted to buy the premium Western luxury, but now many are shifting to buying Chinese brands and no longer chasing Western luxury as much.  I think even if the Chinese economy rebounds, it isn&#39;t coming back.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, there will always be a big luxury market in China, but not the same extent as before.</p>\n\n<p>I can&#39;t really see India being the next country.  Their growth is pretty unevenly distributed, and I think culturally, when they have more money, they probably want to spend more on gold and jewelry than designer goods?</p>\n</div>",

Inflationary pressure doesn’t affect upper class income nearly as much as lower class and clothing makes up a much smaller % of their total spending. Because of this the rich don’t downgrade to Coach from Gucci during a recession. The upper middle class does downgrade to Coach during a recession so it should be expected to see some loss in revenue. The reason why LVMH is more defensive is because you don’t have to worry about LVMH ever falling out of fashion. In 10 years from now LULU lemon may not exist but I guarantee Dior , Prada and Gucci will. This is an excellent time to start buying LVMH in my opinion because of all clothing stocks like Nike, Lulu ect LVMH is the one that most certainly will bounce back eventually. Nike I believe is a good buy also but you may be waiting for years. LULU could be gone in 2 years from now.",
