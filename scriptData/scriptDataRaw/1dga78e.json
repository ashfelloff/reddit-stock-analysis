      "body": "Besides what is already mentioned I would like to add the following problems at Etsy. I am a seller fyi.\n\nLegitimate items are being deactivated in the masses and practically next to impossible to get Etsy to reinstate them. The CEO said in an earnings call last May that sellers can appeal a deactivated listing. However, many sellers are finding this almost impossible. If you are quite persistent you can get your items reinstated. The fallout from this - loss of revenue, if it was a best seller loss of that status, loss of star seller, shop suspension, shop closure are some of what is being reported. Then it is next to impossible for a seller to get any help with the latter. Either the CEO intentionally lied or there is a major disconnect between management/lower staff/sellers. And if the latter that is real problem. (My own experience, reported in the Etsy reddit subs and on the Etsy forum-blog posts).\n\nEtsy DMCA process for out of country sellers. A U.S. seller can file a DMCA against a non U.S. seller but that seller cannot submit a counter-notice! So completely unfair to the non U.S. seller they are sitting ducks basically. It is a widespread problem with sellers filing false DMCA's as well. (Reported in the Etsy subs and my guess in the Etsy forum- I can't view as a seller that pays full fees - see below).\n\nPoor customer support. I myself have experienced (and a star seller) the inability to access support in any manner at all at times. Chat does not reply, no email us option, no phone call option! I have gone weeks with it like this as well. This is a widespread issue. (Reported in the masses in the Etsy Reddit subs and when I used to be able to view the Etsy forum, and my own experience).\n\nEtsy's dispute resolution process. They don't follow their own terms of use. They do not process disputes. I myself have submitted two properly submitted disputes, the latest about the issue below I mention. Both are ignored. I have asked for a settlement conference per their own terms of use and ignored. I have seen other sellers say their dispute was ignored as well. I call their terms of use \"fake.\" (my own experience x2 and reported in the Etsy Reddit subs). [**https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use#arbitrationagreement**](https://www.etsy.com/legal/terms-of-use#arbitrationagreement) **11c**\n\nEtsy bullies sellers. I have my own experience with this. (my own experience and reported in the Etsy Reddit subs as well as when I used to be able to view the Etsy forum there as well).\n\nIt is as if management just does not give a damn how the site is run. Even though it has greatly affected the stock price they still do not seem to give a damn. They just want to sit up there at Etsy HQ and rack in the millions with as little work in as possible. Again, the stock price is a reflection as well as to how Etsy is run. I thought once a stock price got so low that there should be a turnover in management. Why is this not happening?!! Something needs to change. Management does not acknowledge the problems and in fact acts if all is rosy at Etsy.\n\nI would not know if Etsy did acknowledge the problems anyway since I have been bullied by Etsy and they blocked my IP address a few months ago so I can't even see crucial announcements via the forum. They lied about doing this but I have proof they did and caught them in their lie. If something happens like last year where we had to comply and verify banking info or our shop would be suspended I would not know about this since I can't view announcements. Etsy is a bully to sellers. I have seen it many times over.\n\nI had Etsy on my radar some time to buy the stock but I see nothing from a technical or fundamental  standpoint that justifies a buy. If the stock gets into the $30s or $40s like someone else said then maybe. They aren't too far off from the $40's.\n\nFYI they lost me as a habitual buyer that over the course of years has spent probably about $40k on the site. Granted most of that was supplies for my business. They lost me due to how they treat me. I made my plight known to management even. They don't care. Etsy would rather bully a seller than do right by a seller and keep a habitual buyer. You investors don't care about Etsy's need to be a bully do you? You want them to retain habitual buyers right?\n\nAnd read Etsy reviews on Google. Etsy does not even care about its own reputation. A total disconnect at Etsy.\n\nYou can't tell Etsy management the problems (well you can and I have) but they don't listen nor care. It goes in one ear and out the other. Actually, their solution to the problems of Etsy from what I am told and also see in a blog post of a seller's is moderators immediately close technical threads of sellers needing help like deactivated listings. They want to bury the thread and not bring attention to it since it is public. (this is new and did not used to be the case). They claim that the seller's issue has been escalated to a team. How much do you want to bet if this is actually true and that the seller actually got the help needed? (Edited to add - just as I expected it is being reported by sellers that no one has reached out to them - ETSY LIES!). Their other solution was to take the forum private in March so the rest of the world and even some sellers many wrongfully banned can't see the Etsy dysfunction.\n\nElliot Management are you listening because Etsy isn't?!",
