Model Y with temporary tags everywhere. The cybertruck is a damn shame, no doubt. I’ve been driving a Y for about a month now, 50-60 miles per day, recharge each night on a standard household outlet (slow AF, but it tops me off), and the car is luxurious and fun. I think it looks stupid, and I look even more stupid kicked back and relaxing while it drives me to/from work. But I’m telling you, Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in EVs and people will continue to change their minds about EVs… one at a time. Anyway, good luck on the puts. I’m betting on a boost; not because it makes sense but exactly because it doesn’t make sense.</p>\n</div>",
