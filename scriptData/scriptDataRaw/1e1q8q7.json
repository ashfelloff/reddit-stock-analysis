I can imagine there being a significant sell off in the 2040s. \n\nWe did not really see that when silent money transferred to boomers but the level of wealth the older generation had is not comparable to what the boomer generation has. The boomers cost of living was also much less when they were our age. Keep in mind that silent generation didn’t also have Schwab and fidelity apps and as much trust or access to the stock market.

Everyone has more opportunity now to get an education, escape poverty, bust their ass working, and accumulate wealth the old fashioned way than ever before. Expecting to accumulate wealth with low effort, unskilled, low wage jobs has never worked and will never work. Career choice is important. Spending $250k on a private college liberal arts degree that will never pay for itself is a really really bad decision. Wealth cycles. It gets consumed in 25-30 years of retirement. Very little gets passed on from one generation to the next, and almost no real family wealth survives three generations due to the carnage of math with generational division. No amount of blaming others will do it for you.",

Millennials will probably retire as a whole with more wealth than previous generations. Everyone has more opportunity now to get an education, escape poverty, bust their ass working, and accumulate wealth the old fashioned way than ever before. Expecting to accumulate wealth with low effort, unskilled, low wage jobs has never worked and will never work. Career choice is important. Spending $250k on a private college liberal arts degree that will never pay for itself is a really really bad decision. Wealth cycles. It gets consumed in 25-30 years of retirement. Very little gets passed on from one generation to the next, and almost no real family wealth survives three generations due to the carnage of math with generational division. No amount of blaming others will do it for you.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "You’re making a lot of assumptions here that I think are wrong. \n\nAssumption 1: the 50-60% of wealth boomers have/will have is distributed roughly evenly among them. \n\nBoomers as a generation might own 50–60% of all wealth despite being only 20-25% of the population, but plenty will die with nothing or even in debt. Heck, Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos (boomers) are somewhere in the range of 2-3% of all wealth by themselves.\n\nAssumption 2: assets cleanly pass down from one generation cohort to the next upon death. \n\nThat’s not how generation cohorts or estate planning work. First, generation cohorts use made up dates to loosely describe cultural phenomena. Actual generations within a family don’t hold to those lines. I’ve got one silent generation set of grandparents and one elder boomer set. I’ve got one younger boomer parent and one elder gen x parent. I’m a millennial but my sister is Gen z. These lines aren’t especially useful for this kind of data. Also, even if we’re talking actual generations rather than cohorts, assets often don’t pass cleanly to the kids. They might skip a financially secure group of empty-nesters to set young adults up for the long term. They might got to charity or to other non-family entities. \n\nAssumption 3: once passed down, assets will remain as a package.\n\n“Grandma’s money” (probably) doesn’t all stay together when Grandma dies. It likely gets broken apart and diluted, with some going to Grandma’s debts, some to her children, some to her grandchildren. If she has more than one child or grandchild, it’s not all staying together.\n\nAssumption 4: when these assets are passed down, they will largely be liquidated. \n\nMaybe, maybe not. My priors lead me in the opposite direction - the kind of parents who leave a large nest egg are also likely the kind of parents who raise financially literate children who know about compounding growth and may well be in a position to let it ride. \n\nAssumption 5: if they are liquidated, it will collectively be a large enough hit to affect the market. \n\nThis is a *big* assumption. First, there’s the issue: I raised above of wealth concentration within the boomer cohort and messy transfers between cohorts, which lowers the effective number we’re worrying about from 50-60% of all wealth to probably more like 45-50%. Second, boomers aren’t all the same age now and won’t all die at the same age. There’s a large wealth transfer *already happening* that will continue to happen *over the next four decades*. Some boomers are already dead. Some are going to live to be 100+. You’re worrying about aggregate numbers, but the ones that matter are the center of the bell curve - still big, but a *lot* smaller. \n\nAssumption 6: if #5 comes to pass, the effect will be lasting stagnation.\n\nFundamentally, markets are resilient. advances in technology and gains in productivity have always - yes, *always* - trumped any other forces in the medium-to-long term. Stagnation in the market based on generational wealth transfer rather than the underlying strength of the stocks themselves leads to undervaluation, leads to market correction when people buy the stocks. \n\nNow, I don’t *know* that the market is going to be hot in the 2040s. Statistically, that decade will probably include one or two downturns either way. And your assumptions *might* all be correct. But if any one of them is wrong, it’s business as usual. If it gives you peace of mind to adjust your retirement plans to compensate for this or other risks, do it. I for one think this one is fine to ignore.",
