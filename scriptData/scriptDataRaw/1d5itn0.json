So if you were doing it today you would take the returns from September 2023 through August 2024. Then you rank them by the highest return.

So I think we might see some more pain before any relief.  This is a momentum stock which just inherently has more volatility. One of the things with momentum is to remember that it tends to reverse in the short term. In August the stock was up almost 30%. For it to sell off and give some of that back isn't completely unreasonable. You can also see that behavior in the chart where it goes up a couple months and then pulls back then goes up a couple months and pulls back.  The final thing I'm looking at here is just that it's September which is a bad month for stocks generally and the whole market is down (not as bad as IESC but generally everything is down).  The other thing I kind of think back to was owning super micro last year. It's wipsawed all over the place but was the best performer in my portfolio in 2023.  My plan for this name is to watch the retest see if we can hold the 125 to 135 level and then rally back. I think we do get a rate cutting cycle starting this month that will take some of the pressure off of the market and when we see that and the risk on trade I think we will rally back. It's a tough ride though.\n\n\nEdit: I'd also say that the fundamentals are still strong and have been improving which is really what drives values long term. Finally, the sell off is on no news and I think that is telling. ",

Traditionally momentum is determined by looking at the return over the last 12 months excluding the most recent month. So if you were doing a screen today you would look at the return from August 2023 through July 2024. You rank your stocks and look at the top 10% of returns. Those are your stocks to pick from. I throw out anything that has a weird return profile. Sometimes you get a biotechnology or something that jumps 100% overnight because of a drug approval or something like that. Any of those are out. Then I try and make a balanced portfolio. I shoot to hold 15 stocks but at least 10. I've got a couple open slots to fill right now. \n\n\nGenerally I don't like technical analysis because indicators are backwards looking. Additionally, the technicals that you can learn publicly are typically bad and dont work. Momentum is a forward looking indicator. I say that because of the research on momentum (it is a big topic in academic papers) that shows that stocks in the top of all returns tend to continue to do well.

          "body": "Hey its great to hear your getting into investing. I got my degree in finance and have been a portfolio manager for the last decade at several large US banks. Hopefully I can help with some of the basics. Building wealth and financial security is a lot like getting health. You Get healthy by eating right and getting exercise and doing that simple stuff for a long time. Finance and investing is the same thing. Make a regular monthly contribution, reinvest your dividend, and do that for a long time. \n\n\nGetting started those are the most important habits to build. As for diversification it's very easy these days. Go check out VOO or SPY they are S&P500 index funds. They are in an ETF which means you just buy and sell them like stock. They own the 500 largest companies in the US. It's a very easy way to get a diversified portfolio in just one investment. That will get you the market return and do the heavy lifting for you as far as returns go. A really good start is to set up a monthly contribution to buy one of those funds automatically and reinvest the dividends through a dividend reinvestment plan. Just focus on that for a while and let it grow for the next 5 years. \n\n\nI typically don't encourage individual stock picking for new investors because it usually doesn't help grow long term wealth for new investors. It can be fun for sure but I'd recommend getting the basics down so you have a strong financial foundation. ",

          "body": "I agree with everyone on here suggesting that you put almost all of the money in SPY and just make regular contributions. It’s basically impossible to be “good at investing” by consistently picking winners. Just take that steady index-fund return and then—and this is the hard part—be patient. \n\nAlso, there is one fool-proof way to increase your portfolio—one secret method that works 100% of the time without ever failing. Here’s the secret: SAVE MORE MONEY. You’re only 24. That means that as you get older, you’ll almost certainly start earning more money. Make yourself a promise that you won’t let your lifestyle increase as fast as your salary does. So when you get that raise and start making $100 more per month, maybe only increase your lifestyle by $75/mo—then put the additional $25/mo into the market. When you eventually make $1000 more per month, maybe set aside even more and save $400 more per month.\n\nFinally, I’ll say this:  Although trying to pick individual stocks is a BAD investment idea, we can all agree that it’s more fun than passively investing in index funds like SPY. So it’s fine to take 10% or even 20% of your total portfolio and try to pick individual winners. Just be disciplined enough to limit it to that small portion of your portfolio, and rebalance your portfolio each year if you’ve picked successfully enough that your individual stocks are more than 20% of your portfolio. I find that by giving myself a small percentage of my portfolio to gamble with in this way, I end up saving more because I want to have the chance to pick another winner. But keep it to less than 20%!\n\nGood luck! You’re way ahead of most people your age if you’re already saving something.",

          "body": "Hey its great that your starting early! Investing for long term growth is the right way to think about it. I'm a Portfolio Manager at a Bank and I manage a little over a billion in assets for the bank. Here is what I tell people about Investing: the most important thing is time. Your 24 this is a great time to start because the money you invest has a whole lifetime to grow. The S&P 500 averages 10 to 12% per year (that's the SPY etf you bought). When you have a small portfolio (less than a few 100k) you don't need to worry about picking stocks. Most of the research says that even professionals don't beat the S&P 500 consistently. As a 24 year old who is just learning I would recommend just sticking with the SPY ETF, making a monthly contribution to buy more, and earning the market return. There is a good youtube channel called the Money Guy Show and they have done the math and basically the dollars you invest in the S&P 500 or the Market will end up being worth 83 dollars when you retire. So you put 1 dollar into SPY now and you get 83 back later. Good places to do this are in a roth or traditional 401k if you have one through work or a ira through like fidelity. You don't need to be a geart investor when you can earn the market average return by just buying SPY every month and getting 83x your investment back. Right now your focus has to be on adding dollars to the account through regular savings. On a 1,000 dollar investment even if you were a great investor and earned 100% per year you would only make 1,000 so focus on building that habit of just putting in some every month for now. Focus on an ETF like SPY (which owns the 500 largest companies in the US including all the names you bought individually so you still get those good investment even if you just own SPY). The next thing I would tell you is that the day to day stuff doesn't matter in long term Investing. 35 years ago the DOW 30 index traded for 2500 bucks today its at 40k. It doesn't matter that there was the 2008 crisis or that there was COVID or that there have been wars or scares. Your buying today to earn that return in 35 years. Another great option is a target date retirement fund which are pretty typical in 401k plans where they manage the portfolio for you. \n\n\nIf your just doing it on your own you can buy SPY every month until you have 100k saved and then go get a financial planner to help you after that. ",

With QQQM and VGT the top 3 holding in both funds are APPL, MSFT, and NVDA. In VGT those 3 account for 45% of the fund holdings and in QQQM they account for 25% of the holdings. The thing is those 3 stocks are also the top 3 holdings in VOO at about 19%. \n\n\nIf you were looking to make a tweak to the portfolio I would recommend trimming VGT and looking for something that would add some diversity to the portfolio. Maybe a small or mid cap etf for 5 or 10% of the portfolio or something defensive that will perform well in a down market if the tech stocks are down like utilities and consumer staples. Still the same 5 or 10%. Just something that balances out your exposure to those 3 names. \n\n\nHope that helps.",

One thing I would point out is that most of your larger holdings have APPL and NVDA as top 5 exposures. You also show that you own them individually. Based on a quick glance you are probably really allocated 20% to APPL and 18% to nvda as far as those single stocks go(estimates you would have to check the math to be exact). That might be to much of those names to have. I might cut some of the single stock exposure and allocate those dollars into some of your diversified etfs where your holdings are less than 5% and up those a little. Going into a rate cutting cycle I like your bond fund as a place to add because bonds go up when rates go down so you will get some extra return over the next 24 month there. \n\n\nHope that helps. ",

If your more conservative then bum it by 2% per year from 50 to 60 and stop when your at 40%. \n\n\nThe most important thing is just keep that monthly deposit in 10 years you will be so happy with yourself! ",

As I get older that will move up by about 1% per year until I hit 35 or 40% in my 60s. You can think about it like if you start at 30 and add 1% per year you will hit 35% at 65 and that&#39;s pretty close. If your more conservative then bum it by 2% per year from 50 to 60 and stop when your at 40%. </p>\n\n<p>The most important thing is just keep that monthly deposit in 10 years you will be so happy with yourself! </p>\n</div>",

They had a bad earnings call and are cutting 15% of the work force. That is probably going to be a tough stock to own right now.

I don't want to see you give up on investing because it let you down after 8 months. Typically stocks are appropriate for money you don't need for years. I always give the example that when I was born in 88 the down was 2,500 and today its 39,500ish. That's why you invest the big long term move is the game changer. Hope this helps",
