The quarter’s net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\n“We believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,” CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement.\n\nThe company’s Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said.\n\n“We generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,” Ittycheria said. “We realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.”\n\nOn Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker Elastic, said the volume of client commitments it closed in its [fiscal first quarter](https://ir.elastic.co/news/news-details/2024/Elastic-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx) was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products.\n\nWith respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.\n\nManagement nudged up its fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That’s up from the May guidance of $2.15 to $2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billion to $1.90 billion in revenue. Analysts had predicted $2.26 per share in adjusted earnings, along with $1.90 billion in revenue.\n\nExcluding the after-hours move, MongoDB shares were down almost 40% on the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% in the same period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/mongodb-mdb-q2-earnings-report-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/mongodb-mdb-q2-earnings-report-2025.html)",
