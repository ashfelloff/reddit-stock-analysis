Stock has been stronger than expected despite pullback.\n* [**LLY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LLY&p=d) - Reported blowout earnings- raised guidance from $13.50-$14 to $16-16.60 for 2025. EPS of $3.92 vs $2.60. Revenue of $11.3B vs $9.92. Watching how this will trade at the open but will be light because stock is so high priced.\n* [**SMCI**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d) - Reported earnings two days ago, stock is still extremely weak. Will watch at open, but currently hands off for now due to high price.\n* Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)/[**ARM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d)/[**MU**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MU&p=d)/[**SOXL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)/[**NVDA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)/[**NVDL**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDL&p=d). Still long NVDA.\n* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - We saw a pretty big spike yesterday, they got cleared to operate Bluebird direct-to-smartphone satellites from the FAA. ASTS needs closer to 20 satellites (and plans to launch 168). I think an offering might be imminent from the way they need to raise capital. Not sure how else they can secure additional funding at that high valuation. Will elaborate in another post.\n* [**DDOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DDOG&p=d) - EPS of 0.43 vs 0.35e. Revenue of $645M vs 623M expected. Guides increase in revenue.\n\nEarnings of note: [**SOUN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOUN&p=d), [**ELF**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ELF&p=d), [**PARA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=PARA&p=d), [**RKLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d)",
