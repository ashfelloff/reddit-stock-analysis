      "body": "There seems to be a lot of confusion about Hims and GLP-1s and what Hims will do regarding GLP-1s in the future. Let me try to clear up a few things:\n\nFirstly, Hims started offering GLP-1s (Semaglutide) on May 20, 2024. They recorded approximately $16 million in sales between May 20 and June 30 that were included in their second quarter earnings. \n\nTo date, Hims has not yet offered Tirzepatide, which is the active ingredient in Zepbound and Mounjaro, which are both manufactured by Eli Lilly. \n\nWhat Hims is currently offering is a compounded version of Semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, which are both manufactured by Novo Nordisk. \n\nLast week all doses of Tirzepatide are no longer on shortage according to both Eli Lilly and the FDA website. \n\nThis week all but one dose size of Semaglutide (Wegovy 0.25 milligram) are no longer on shortage according to both Novo Nordisk and the FDA website. \n\nSo what happens now…\n\nHims made it clear on their earnings call this week that they are going to remain in the GLP-1 business even after these drugs are removed from the FDA shortage list. \n\nDirect quotes from CEO Andrew Dudum on the call:\n\n“The compounding and customization operates regardless of shortage. This is an exemption for which we operate the entire business under and we have for the last six or seven years and there is really an established precedent.”\n\n“The short answer is that the compounding exemption is relatively clear and theres been decades of established precedent with regards to what qualifies as personalized.”\n\n“There is really established precedents with regard to the compounding exemption which allows for this level of personalization.”\n\nWhat he is basically saying is that Hims can continue to sell these compounded GLP-1s as long as they are customized/personalized to the customer in a way that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk do not offer. \n\nThey are so confident in this that they announced they are acquiring an FDA registered 503B compounding facility located in the U.S. for approximately $31 million.  They are going to use this sterile facility to manufacture GLP-1s as well as introduce new product categories such as hormone therapy. \n\nThey plan on offering both Semaglutide AND Tirzepatide (again as long as they are personalized). They are also going to offer Liraglutide which is coming off patent in a couple of months. It’s not as effective as the others but it still works to a degree and will not need to be personalized to the customer since it will no longer be patent protected. \n\nThey will also offer the branded versions once supply becomes available. Although since Hims does not take insurance and these can be over $1,000 a month I’m not sure how many customers will actually buy them from Hims. \n\nObviously there is a ton of hype around the GLP-1s but don’t forget about the weight loss kits (oral pills) that Hims launched at the end of 2023 that already has a run rate of over $100 million in sales which is the fastest category launch in Hims history to reach that milestone. \n\nThere are over 100 million people who struggle with weight loss in the U.S., Hims is going to do everything that it can to reach as many of them as possible.",
