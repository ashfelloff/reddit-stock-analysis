      "body": "Plenty of different investing styles. My advice for someone young would be relatively simple.\n\nInvest. Dont take massive risks with large positions in any single stock pick. Ideally stick most of your investing dollars into basic low cost etfs. As you get older and gain more experience and a stronger worldview then consider single stock picks. Most people when they retire will have some money in an sp500 etf for example. It might only be 20% of their portfolio. So if you spend the first 10 years of your investing just tossing money into an sp500 etf I suspect it will be more than fine. Later you can always pick other things to invest in. \n\nI would avoid is individual stock picks early on. If you make a mistake you will kick yourself. Even if you make a good pick it might turn sour in the 40 years until you retire. That means you will either have to sell it along the way for a realized profit or for a tax write off if its in a taxable account. Lets say you want to have 20% of your retirement portfolio be single stock picks. You could probably make all those picks in the last 15 years of your working career. \n\nSo maybe from now until your 45 or so I would stick to the etfs. I might take risks by investing some money into sector specific etfs. Say you think AI will be a big thing. Maybe put 80% of your money into an sp500 etf and 20% into qqq or a semiconductor etf. That would make sense. Then when you get to around 45 I would think your more likely to have a stronger view of the world and where it will be when you retire. So at that point sure, do the single stock picks. \n\nNow before you ignore this advice do yourself a favor. Someone 65-70 is likely retiring in a few days. So for them to be around your age we would have to roll back to the early 1980s. Take a minute and look into what companies were the hot thing back in the early 1980s.
