I’ve honestly never had a problem with fidelity’s UI/UX (both the app and the website).  iOS app has always been good.  In my opinion, that shouldn’t be the main reason to choose a broker.  Obviously, if the app/website are shit then sure, don’t go with that broker, but the main thing you should consider is which company is better for your money.  Judging by your list, fidelity wins on that metric.  Also, I’ve had all good experiences with their customer service.  My employer payed out our pensions last year and it was seamless to call fidelity to roll it over into an IRA.</p>\n</div>",
