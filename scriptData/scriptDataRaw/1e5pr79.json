Given that the market forces influencing today's drop are less nebulous and more intuitive than usual, I figured I'd explain what I'm seeing. Bear in mind that I have no actual qualifications, most of this just comes secondhand from people smarter than me. \n\n\n\nThere are two large scale things at work today that are getting the bulls gunned down in the streets; one is an overall force that's just inherent to how the market moves, and one is more specific to the current outlook and recent news.\n\n\n\n**TLDR: Monthly options expire on Friday, and options on VIX (the volatility index) expire today. These lead to increased market volatility, multiplying every potential market shift. Couped with some pessimistic news for semiconductors and big tech last night and this morning, we were put at high risk of a big drop across the board.**\n\n\n\n\n\n1) The Overarching Market Mechanic: \n\n\n\nThere are two important expiry dates this week. First, Friday is OPEX, when monthly options expire. This happens on the third Friday of every month, and creates volatility as big money tries to influence the market in the direction that benefits them. Naturally, this volatility is most felt by the tickers that have the highest volumes of options expiring that month. Currently that's big tech, MAG7 and semiconductor centric stocks in particular.\n\n\n\nThe other date is today, when VIX options expire. This happens on the third Wednesday of every month, which means it's usually (but not always) two days before OPEX. VIX is a measure of volatility in the market as a whole, rising when the market is fluctuating more and falling when it's consistent. In the same way that stocks get more volatile when options on them are close to expiry, volatility itself gets more volatile when VIX options are close to expiry. So volatility is changing at a faster rate.\n\n\n\nBoth of these add up to make this week more prone to big swings in market prices overall. Without this extra volatility, the market is more likely to continue on its trend and pace (consistently bullish of late). These dates instead make reversals and spikes/dives more likely, but they're not inherently bearish.\n\n\n\n\n\n2) Specific Developments:\n\n\n\nThere have been a few developments since yesterday's close that increased bearish sentiment. First, current presidential betting favorite Donnie T seemed to commit to not defending Taiwan against potential Chinese aggression during his RNC speech last night. This is bearish for Taiwan-based companies and those dependent on them, which most significantly includes the leading semiconductor manufacturer TSM and the tech companies dependent on it, NVDA most of all. We can see that Intel is doing particularly well, up over 1% during today's bloodbath, because they're one of TSM's largest competitors and aren't dependent on Taiwan.\n\n\n\nSecond, ASML (a Dutch semiconductor manufacturer) released disappointing earnings this morning. They technically beat EPS expectations, but were down since last quarter and had only lukewarm future guidance. This is a big step down from the recent expectation of continued exponential growth for semis and AI-related stocks, and decreases optimism for other companies in the same field. Which, once again, is big tech.\n\n\n\nThird, news came out this morning that President Biden is considering increasing restrictions on chip sales to China in order to slow their growth in their own semiconductor market. Restrictions on sales are obviously perceived poorly for growth, so this is once again bearish for chip makers and those dependent on their success. TSM, NVDA, and Big Tech in the crosshairs again.\n\n\n\nAll of this combines into bearish news for semiconductor companies specifically, and Big Tech by extension. Since Big Tech makes up a huge portion of the market, it drags down everything. We can see this in SPY, 34% tech, failing almost twice as much as something like IWM, only 15% tech.\n\n  \n\n\nIn a quick summary: a few pieces of pretty bad news for semiconductor and tech since yesterday's close increased bearish sentiment across the board. Since we're in a period of higher volatility due to options expiry in the entire market and on the volatility index, this bearish news had a much larger impact than it normally would. Volatility will probably cool off next week after the VIX options expiry and monthly OPEX, TBD on whether we get some upwards push in the tech market movers.",
