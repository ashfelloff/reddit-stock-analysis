  "selftext": "> As Boeing Co. lurches from one crisis to the next, there’s been one constant for the embattled planemaker: Its predicament appears to be only getting worse.\n\n> From a freak accident that blew a door-size hole into the fuselage of an airborne 737 Max to revelations of sloppy workmanship and now a crippling strike entering its second month — the icon of US manufacturing hasn’t been able to catch a break since the first days of January. Cash is dwindling, plane production is anemic and the stock is heading for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis in 2008.\n\n> Combined, the episodes have exposed quality lapses at Boeing and its supply chain, alongside a corrosive culture a quarter-century in the making, where pressure over costs and schedule permeated decision-making. Earlier this year, customers finally revolted and the board shook up leadership, hiring Kelly Ortberg in August out of retirement to fix the beleaguered manufacturer. \n\n> In his two months on the job, Ortberg has made a series of blunt moves. He removed the head of the defense and space division and tried to short-circuit a strike by taking a higher offer directly to workers — a move that backfired and only hardened the union’s resolve. \n\n> His latest maneuver came late on Friday, when Ortberg said Boeing would cut 10% of its workforce, equivalent to about 17,000 people. And he tucked in a hint that more dramatic steps might be needed to get the company back on course. \n\n> The comments suggest that Boeing under Ortberg may double down on the field for which it is best known: Commercial aviation. The unceremonious departure of Ted Colbert as head of the defense and space business put those subsidiary’s shortcomings into sharp relief — made more glaring still on Friday when Boeing said the unit would have about $2 billion in charges in the third quarter. \n\n> Rating agencies have put Boeing on notice with a warning that it may slip below investment grade, a move that would make the planemaker the biggest so-called fallen angel in corporate US history. The company has only a small buffer on top of the $10 billion of cash and short-term securities that it needs to avoid slipping to jut status. The toll from the strike increases the urgency to tap markets sooner rather than later for fresh financing. \n\n> All told, Boeing will record $5 billion in combined charges for its two largest businesses when it formally reports third-quarter earnings, the company said Friday evening in a surprise announcement. Besides the defense and space charges, Boeing will book additional costs for pushing back its 777X model once more, leaving its largest widebody aircraft with a delay of about six years.\n\n> Much is unclear about Boeing’s turnaround efforts. The ramp-up in production that was supposed to help cash flow has been undercut by the recent strike, and the defense and space business continues to hemorrhage money. \n\n> Longer-term, Boeing may need to make some tough calls on unprofitable areas like its space endeavors. The division made global headlines a few weeks ago when its Starliner capsule returned to earth without humans on board. It was an ignominious end to its first crewed mission to orbit after NASA decided not to risk putting two astronauts back into the glitch-prone spacecraft.\n\n> When the strike started in mid September, the CEO urged workers to embrace the future and not hold grudges, a nod to a 2014 contract that cost them their pensions. Senior management took solidarity pay reductions when Ortberg announced furloughs to preserve cash, and the latest job cuts will also include executives and management, he said.\n\n> But with so-called touch labor accounting for less than 5% for the total cost of a commercial aircraft program, some observers wonder why Boeing isn’t moving with more urgency to end the work stoppage that’s adding to its financial distress. \n\n> The strike is cascading through Boeing’s supply chain, heightening the risk that the recovery in the planemaker’s own factories will be slow and halting even once workers are back on the job. And so far, Boeing hasn’t said where the workforce cuts will occur, or what they might cost the company in terms of severance. Announcing the job cuts in the middle of labor negotiations is also a strategy fraught with risk. \n\n> On the one hand, Ortberg wants to instill a sense of urgency and shared sacrifice, said George Ferguson, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. But on the other hand, the move threatens further antagonizing the very workers Boeing needs to restart jetliner production, at a time when skilled mechanics are in high demand. Even before Friday’s announcement, the war of words had intensified. Both Boeing and the union filed formal complaints accusing the other of breaching the protocol for labor negotiations.\n\n(Selected Excerpts from Bloomberg)",

I have worked for all the biggest aircraft companies in the world, including Lockheed, Boeing and Airbus and at least 8 others. I have written class 1 software, (DO-178C DAL A), and achieved certification for that software on those aircraft. Additionally I have designed complete avionic suites inculding all sensors, integration and testing (DO-254). I have also been a developer for ILS and GPS systems. As a contract consultant I am totally capitalist, however even I know the importance of an experienced loyal workforce. \n\nI know the steps that have to have happened to fuck up that badly. The Flight Control Systems (FCS) are safety critical. They are class 1, (DO-178C DAL A). Nothing should interfere with their operation. Yet MCAS was allowed to overwrite the FCS. When you design a Safety critical system you use multiple types of sensors from multiple locations as input. MCAS used 1 sensor in 1 location and used this to overwrite outputs from the FCS. The amount of lies and fake documents produced to get that through the certification bodies is a lot!\n\nThe whole reason for Boeing doing this is because the Airbus 320 family were using engines that were 20% more efficient. That is a big saving on the operating costs and customers liked that. Boeing had to change their engines to compete. They added larger engines which changed the position of the 737 centre of gravity. When this happened the Flight Control System (FCS) software should have been rewritten and retested. This would have cause around 12 months delay  and around $20 million. Instead they came up with MCAS. That is inherently  unsafe as it it one sensor in one location. They also never told the pilots about it as that would have meant retraining. They have now provided retraining however MCAS is still unsafe! The correct solution would be to change the FCS software.\n\nYes I am totally serious. Each of the CEOs Muilenburg onward are no different from each other. The only hope is a 180 degree shift in position and I don't think that will happen. \n\nMy prediction is that Boeing are in the shit. They will be split up and those parts sold of. Defence is worth having, someone like Lockheed or Airbus will take over commercial and space will be dumped. There will be other bits too. Most buyers will be unwilling but will be forced to take them. Current shareholders will take a bath!\n\nGood luck in your investments.",
