  "selftext": "Hi, everyone. I'm not formally trained in computer science or finance. I'm just someone who is passionate about the transformative potential of AI, financial markets and investing, among other topics.   \n  \nI've been working on an \"investment thesis\" of sorts (shown below) that involves a potential risk that seems to be somewhat overlooked in discussions about AI stocks. I am sharing it here in the hope that it might spark some interesting and fruitful conversation, particularly among those more experienced in the field of AI.  \n\n\n**The Overlooked Risk in AI Stocks:** While investors focus on the AI hardware race and GPU shortages, a more fundamental challenge looms: the growing scarcity of high-quality, diverse data for training advanced AI systems, particularly AGI. This overlooked bottleneck could significantly impact AI company valuations and the timeline for AGI development (if it can be achieved at all).  \n  \n**Current Market Narrative**  \n◾Investors fixate on computing power, driving up valuations of hardware-focused companies.  \n◾The prevailing logic: more GPUs equal more AI capability and value, which overlooks a critical flaw in the race towards AGI.  \n  \n**The Real Bottleneck**  \nAI performance, especially for AGI aspirations, hinges on three data factors:  \n◾ Quality: Accuracy and reliability  \n◾Quantity: Volume of useful examples  \n◾Diversity: Range of scenarios represented  \n  \nWhile data quantity grows exponentially, we face a 'data wall' - the supply of high-quality, novel, human-generated data becoming insufficient for advanced AI training and development. This poses critical risks:  \n◾Closed-loop AI content generation leading to digital entropy and degraded data quality/diversity  \n◾Amplification of biases and errors in AI outputs  \n◾Fundamental limitations on achieving true general intelligence  \n  \nEmerging AI techniques like few-shot learning offer potential ways to scale this data wall but may not fully address the complex data needs for AGI development. Notably, while synthetic data can augment datasets, it cannot replace the richness and variability of real-world data essential for true understanding.  \n  \n**Key Takeaways:**  \n◾ Data scarcity is a critical risk in AI investment.  \n◾ The \"data wall\" limits advancements in AI/AGI.  \n◾ Quality, Quantity, and Diversity of data are essential for AI performance.  \n◾ Emerging techniques may help but have limitations.  \n◾ Synthetic data cannot fully substitute for real-world data.\n\n**Overvaluation Risks**  \n◾ Companies valued primarily on computational capacity  \n◾ Firms lacking robust data acquisition strategies  \n◾ Businesses dependent on public/synthetic data  \n  \n**Hidden Opportunities**  \n◾ Companies with unique data access  \n◾ Firms innovating in data collection and curation  \n◾ Enterprises focused on diverse, high-quality datasets crucial for AGI  \n  \n**Regulatory Considerations**  \n◾ Evolving privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) create new challenges  \n◾ Data access restrictions limit large-scale dataset use  \n◾ Cross-border data flow regulations risk creating regional \"data silos\"  \n◾ Demands for algorithmic transparency necessitate diverse, well-documented training data  \n  \n**Investment Framework**  \n**Key Questions:**  \n◾ What’s their data sourcing strategy for advanced AI and potential AGI?  \n◾ Do they have unique high-quality data access?  \n◾ How sustainable is their data advantage in the AGI race?   \n◾ What if data becomes the primary constraint for AGI achievement?  \n  \n**Risk Indicators:**  \n◾ Over-reliance on public datasets  \n◾ Lack of proprietary data sources  \n◾ Limited data diversity for general intelligence tasks  \n◾ No clear data quality maintenance strategy  \n  \n**Portfolio Implications**  \n**Large Cap AI Stocks:**  \n◾ Reassess hardware-centric valuations  \n◾ Seek evidence of sustainable data advantages for AI development  \n◾ Consider data quality risk exposure in long-term AI/AGI strategies  \n  \n**Emerging Players:**  \n◾ Identify genuine data moat builders with AGI potential  \n◾ Seek innovative data acquisition approaches for general intelligence  \n◾ Prioritize quality and diversity over mere quantity  \n  \n**The Long View**  \n◾ The demand for high-quality data transcends economics, entering geopolitical realms  \n◾ \"Data wars\" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy  \n◾ AGI achievement may prove more complex than current valuations suggest  \n  \n**Questions for Investors**  \n◾ How are you factoring data constraints into AI valuations, especially for companies pursuing AGI?  \n◾ What metrics evaluate a company's data advantages in the context of general intelligence development?  \n◾ How might data bottlenecks reshape the AI landscape and AGI timelines?\n\nI hope this perspective provides new insights into AI investment risks and opportunities, especially regarding the pursuit of AGI.

I was googling curb weights of cars recently and it was providing objectively incorrect information, even while it&#39;s cited source did have the correct figures.  There seems to be no plan yet for ensuring the data used by these models is both accurate initially, and understood by the language model in order to relay good information.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "> \"Data wars\" may emerge as nations battle for data supremacy\n\nThis is already a thing.  It is just not as flashy as real war, and only failures get known about.  Edward Snowden made it all very visible for a short time.  \n\nI think the reason AI hardware is getting all the noise right now, is because it is new, fast changing, and requirement.  Data, dataharvesting, data retention, has been around for a long time.  How that data gets interpreted to generate new data is the key.  \n\nRegarding integrity, one thing I learned recently is the big AI neural networks don't care as much about errors, they want their system to adapt to their errors.

              "body": "> The challenge isn't just about having more data; it's about having the right kind of data that reflects real-world complexities.\n\nI think there are implicit biases in your thinking here that the \"right kind of data\" is human data, that human data is good data, and that we have hit a soft threshold on good human data, so AI won't continue to improve, as it has continued to improve thus far. If all of these postulates are true, then your thesis is right. I would argue that there is no evidence that any of these are true. \n\nOpen AI did an interesting AMA a few days ago, and your post reminded me of [this question about hallunications](https://old.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1ggixzy/ama_with_openais_sam_altman_kevin_weil_srinivas/luq6uch/?context=3). The open AI SVP responded:\n\n>We're putting a lot of focus on decreasing hallucinations, but it's a fundamentally hard problem - our models learn from human-written text, and humans sometimes confidently declare things they aren't sure about.\n\n>Our models are improving at citing, which grounds their answers in trusted sources, and we also believe that RL will help with hallucinations as well - when we can programmatically check whether models hallucinate, we can reward it for not doing so.\n\nI agree with them that human data is not good data. I know that when I am wrong, I am confidently wrong until someone points out why I'm wrong. \n\nIf high-quality data isn't human data, the GPUs, algorithms, and reinforcement learning are still the solution to improving model performance. For example, a recent paper pointed out that LLM math performance benchmarks are polluted by human data, and that when you replace the names or numbers in story problems, the models will give wrong answers based on the original names and numbers. This paper didn't analyze o1-preview, which implicitly adopts the \"think step-by-step\" prompt that is essential for getting AI to correctly solve a complex math or programing programming model. The other way to solve it is by brute forcing training on each story problem, and replace any name with hundreds of thousands of names and any number by hundreds of thousands of numbers, until the LLM begins to internalize the logic. But, right now, if you ask an LLM to give you a 1-shot answer to a random story problem that is highly similar to a story problem on the Internet, there is a good chance it give you the wrong answer, which is the right answer to the story problem posted on the Internet. Note that even with reduced performance, the AI solutions to mutated story problems are still right most of the time, and perform far better than your average college student, and they are still getting better over time. \n\nAlso, all mathematical proofs can be reduced to strings of numbers, Goedel numbering, and you can generate infinite synthetic data from that using GPUs, and then train using GPUs. Math problems can be reduced to lists and solved via a set of list operations (this is what Mathematica does), and you can generate infinite completely accurate synthetic data from that. Note that it is computationally simpler to train the transformers on this synthetic data than it is to generate the actually accurate synthetic data, also pointing to the need for GPUs and ASICs to improve AI. \n\nAnother criticism is that AI doesn't understand the real world when it is trained only on text input. Multimodal AI is starting to come out, mostly trained on videos, but making it better will require a lot of compute. Awhile ago, based on the resolution of human vision, I read that 4-year-old has transmitted more information in their optical nerves than the entire text corpus of the Internet. Right now, there are no LLM-based robots with human-resolution vision that have explored the world for four years, but there will be. Getting vision right requires compute.\n\nAlso, it's a completely accurate statement that someday AI-related cloud demand will saturate and that cloud margins will go down, demand for GPUs and ASICs will go down, and associated stocks will crash if they have high multiples. However, the fact that a technology adoption curve presents itself over time doesn't mean that it is rigorously mathematical or has predictive value. It was proposed by a sociologist decades ago, it's not an algorithm you can use to long or short stocks. All high-growth stocks with high PE and revenue multiples are risky investments, but all stocks huge price appreciation experienced it with high multiples through most of the run-up. \n\nFinally, since the early nineties, people have pointed out what AI can't do right now, and confidently assert that this points to a fundamental limit of what AI can't do that humans can do. So far, every time people have asserted that current limits are global limits to AI, they have been really wrong. \n\nPosition disclosures: current large stakes in NVDA, TSM, and AVGO, smaller stakes in GOOG, MSFT, QCOM. I won't hold large and risky exposures forever, but nothing in the earnings reports this quarter has me concerned, with 20-35% hyperscaler cloud growth and optimistic 2025 demand forecasts. A GPU doesn't have to pay for itself the year you buy it (when ramping spend, it doesn't make sense to highlight that this year's spend exceeds this year's revenue), it only has to pay for itself over 8-10 years, to get an ROI that exceeds treasury and typical S&P 500 returns. I will sell when billionaires and hyperscalers give up on AGI and start cutting spend, which will almost certainly be after the top. Also, even with the technology adoption curve as gospel, the first peak followed by a multi-year crash usually isn't the all-time peak.",
