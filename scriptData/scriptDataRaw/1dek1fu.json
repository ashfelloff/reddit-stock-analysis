The cinema company was purchased from owners Altamont Capital Partners, Fortress Investment Group and founder Tim League. Between 1948 and 2020, film distributors were prohibited from owning an exhibition company under what was known as the Paramount Consent Decrees.

Now, some four years later, Sony is the first to invest in a theatrical company. Alamo Drafthouse CEO Michael Kustermann will remain at the helm of the dine-in movie theater chain and will report to Ravi Ahuja, president and CEO of the newly formed Sony Pictures Experiences division. The company’s 35 cinemas will continue to be operated by Alamo Drafthouse and its headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas. “We look forward to building upon the innovations that have made Alamo Drafthouse successful and will, of course, continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors,” Ahuja said in a statement.\n\n> The acquisition comes after Alamo Drafthouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2021 due to Covid-19 pandemic disruptions. It was rescued by a private equity firm. However, just last week, five North Texas locations closed after a franchisee filed for bankruptcy.",
