What the fuck is going on here. The market is currently ripping off of the consensus we have officially bottomed and there is no threat of an imminent recession. CPI comes out under 3% and the market rips the next day. We all think this is the holy grail bull run coming that has drowned our underwear in substances during our wet dreams of this time. But realistically, CPI going under 3%, which it hasn’t done in three years, just means that the economy is slowing down to rates we haven’t seen in 3 years. Doesn’t that just mean we are more likely heading to a recession. All of the data is pointing to the economy “cooling down”. Economic indicators globally in other nations are pointing towards the same “cooling down” phase. Just a little fucking curious as to why anyone is even ripping the market long term right now. Citadel doesn’t even know what the fuck to do as most of their positions are straddled with heavier percentages of assets allocated in puts. Just curious as to what anyone thinks of this. Am I slow (as in slow I mean a word that is banned by Reddit)? Am I going crazy? At this fucking point it could be both. But I think that everyone entering the market right now in long term securities could be entering a death sentence. Please let me know what you guys think. Currently working on a MCMC quant strategy relating certain market corrections to the drawdown that just happened. Highly suggest looking into MCMC. Will post more about what I find from this strategy soon. Please let me know if I should just shut the fuck up and throw some Gs on the TQQQ. ",

That’s the entire point. \n\nSo when inflation is down it’s because there has been a slow down (not necessarily reduction though) in economic growth. That’s when and why interest rates come down. \n\nSo that’s a good insight you have, but it is literally the economic theory underlying the Fed’s monetary policy.\n\nIt’s also the bullish case for the economy. High interest rates throttle the economy on purpose. That throttle is about to be slowly removed. The resistance that caused the slow down you’ve observed is going to go away. Hence bullishness.",

That’s the entire point. </p>\n\n<p>So when inflation is down it’s because there has been a slow down (not necessarily reduction though) in economic growth. That’s when and why interest rates come down. </p>\n\n<p>So that’s a good insight you have, but it is literally the economic theory underlying the Fed’s monetary policy.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also the bullish case for the economy. High interest rates throttle the economy on purpose. That throttle is about to be slowly removed. The resistance that caused the slow down you’ve observed is going to go away. Hence bullishness.</p>\n</div>",

      "body": "the \"draw down\" that happened into early August was due to an idiotic wall street trade, triggered by the JPY unwind. The USD/JPY tracks the QQQ very closely since much of this trade was in tech stocks.\n\nJap data came out showing good GDP growth, repatriation of cash into domestic stocks, while they are dumping dollars and printing domestic bonds.\n\nA decent chunk of the very risky leveraged trash was margin called over the past few weeks. There are likely still positions that need unwound, but much much less impactful since our ice queen Yellen over at Treasury is balls deep on the unwind trade while shuffling treasuries.\n\nMy speculation is that the unwind trade is mostly done. This past Friday there was a deviation in price movements between forex USD/JPY and QQQ. The former retracted (dumped) to a prior support while the latter did not.\n\nJapan keeps strengthening their Yen while short term yields increase. If there were still a lot to unwind in the indexes, I'd expect this pressure to cause more margin calls and dumping, but that seems to have petered out. Should the Yen continue to strengthen we might get one more correction at some fraction of the magnitude of the early August one, but I think the name of the game right now is 'suck retail into the markets before pulling the plug down the road' -- think long term, massive wealth transfer from boomers to millennials is underway -- why freak everyone out because of some shitty Yen carry trade?

The USD/JPY tracks the QQQ very closely since much of this trade was in tech stocks.</p>\n\n<p>Jap data came out showing good GDP growth, repatriation of cash into domestic stocks, while they are dumping dollars and printing domestic bonds.</p>\n\n<p>A decent chunk of the very risky leveraged trash was margin called over the past few weeks. There are likely still positions that need unwound, but much much less impactful since our ice queen Yellen over at Treasury is balls deep on the unwind trade while shuffling treasuries.</p>\n\n<p>My speculation is that the unwind trade is mostly done. This past Friday there was a deviation in price movements between forex USD/JPY and QQQ. The former retracted (dumped) to a prior support while the latter did not.</p>\n\n<p>Japan keeps strengthening their Yen while short term yields increase.
