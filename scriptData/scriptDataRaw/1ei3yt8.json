FPS devices could get better, I remember when the wii made these guns that you fit the remote into, Squads the pc game could be targeted for this because it's the most realistic roleplay military sim game. Anyways they could make their own line of weapons that had sensors for something on your tv. IDK, it would be cool to get into talks. Also 2026 when gta drops. I could see people buying fanatec racing car simulators and weapons to freaking hold, Anyways, Corsair seems really discounted rn but personally I wouldn't feel safe about it. It sucks because I really like corsair and even bought some of their equipment including but not limited to, my pc case.",
