      "body": "Usually starts with finding a company I like in a sector I like.  Then I go look for reasons not to buy it.  If I don't find a compelling reason, then I buy it.  What I look at is stuff like financial health, my fee fees about the future for the niche they're in and the economy in the next several years, their current valuation, how they've performed vs competitors, how they've performed vs the market in general, how strongly they're correlated with the market in general, beta, what's already in my portfolio, skimming analyst reports, etc.  What I like is very non-technical feelings.  Like if I'm nervous about the future or I think my portfolio is running on the risky side, I might be looking at leaders in more boring market sectors.  When things go poorly (e.g. 2022), I might be looking for deals.  \n\nThe harder part for me is figuring out when/how to get out.  \n\nNot buying a stock isn't really a mistake, it's a non-event.  There's *always* that company you didn't buy.  What matters is how well you do on what you buy.  So in your scenario, the mistake would have been buying intel.  Like, if you wanted in on semiconductors, NVDA would have been great... but so would broadcom, kla, amat, etc.  There was no shortage of opportunity.",

If I don&#39;t find a compelling reason, then I buy it.  What I look at is stuff like financial health, my fee fees about the future for the niche they&#39;re in and the economy in the next several years, their current valuation, how they&#39;ve performed vs competitors, how they&#39;ve performed vs the market in general, how strongly they&#39;re correlated with the market in general, beta, what&#39;s already in my portfolio, skimming analyst reports, etc.  What I like is very non-technical feelings.  Like if I&#39;m nervous about the future or I think my portfolio is running on the risky side, I might be looking at leaders in more boring market sectors.

The most recent example I can think of is RTX - bottomed last year at $75 over liabilities associated with part of the Pratt &amp; Whitney business. Well, they also supply the most amount of weaponry to Israel. Turns out the market was wrong. </p>\n\n<p>I limit my hypothetical buys to stocks where I can see the value (low p/e compared to peers, future benefits not priced in, capex not in excess of net income, not highly levered, and share repurchases are prioritized). In addition, I’m not afraid to take a short term 10% gain and walk away if the thesis plays out sooner than I think it will.</p>\n</div>",
