You can hide that with inflation, but at the end of the day people and what they do is really the economy. \n\nEurope, Japan, China, and the US are all looking at serious demographic issues to various degrees. It boggles my mind that people are against immigration with the act of more people being in your economy will likely be more beneficial than not. There are diminishing returns of course, but it still more people with more supply and demand of labor. \n\nI dont think our economies are built for infinite growth. I think our expectations for the economy are for infinite growth and we get that growth through increasing efficiency, increasing population, or inflation.

              "body": "Inflation is put a fork in it done. \n\nTech stocks might be overpriced in many cases, but some may actually be cheap vs where they will be in a few years. Id say NVDA for example will likely continue up. TSLA is probably overpriced. MSFT will go up long term. Googl might have issues. apple likely isn't as much a growth stock as it used to be. meta is still growing, but it will slow down before too much longer. Many of the smaller but still big tech are a mixed bag of potential and issues. \n\nHousing is overpriced due to throttled supply. Most homeowners are not willing to trade their low rate for higher rates due to the risks involved with a higher mortgage. When rates drop a bit supply will likely jump up dramatically. That will likely be when fed cuts about 150-200 basis points so we are still quite a ways off from that tipping point. Tack on the issues with insurance in many areas and you have people leaving those places and going elsewhere that is putting pressure on the already limited housing supply where they are going. For example I bet Florida house prices will drop over the next few decades, but further north in NC and TN it will be pressured by many FL folk moving there. CA will see similar issues, but I dont know where they are all moving towards. I live in NC and anecdotally Im seeing a huge influx of FL plates in the area year around now. They built around 50 homes a few hundred yards from my house and roughly half of them were bought by people from FL. Few of the homes were bought by locals. Beyond the FL crowd we got a mix of people from other states with few NC residents moving in there. I have friends in TN and they are seeing similar things in their area. Lots of new homes going up, but most of them being bought by folks from elsewhere. Not complaining about it. I'm observing its happening and its makes sense for it to continue to happen.\n\nUnemployment has trended up a bit, but not spiked and all of that is relative to where its been for the past few years. A bigger issue is that skilled labor is excessive in one place and absent in another due to the housing issues. People aren't going to bear that cost  and risk for a bit more pay. Businesses aren't willing to cover that cost for the most part and its becomes a chicken and the egg kind of situation. Rates come down enough, people move, critical skill shortages get filled, economy stops grinding on problems the rates are causing. It doesnt help that many of these skilled labor jobs are not super high skilled labor, but rather just critical for a smooth operation. Without them you cant spin up all the related jobs. As an example the local hospital has had several opening for higher end nursing. The jobs aren't being filled and they are trying to make do with temp nurses. Not enough nurses are willing to move here and these specific jobs are mid to late career type nursing jobs. The pay offered is fine in normal times, but if the nurse you need has to sell the house out of town and get a house here then they either need to come out ahead or the new job has to pay enough to make it sensible. right now that simply isnt the case. Sell your house for a profit, get the same exact amount of mortgage in the new place, pay more due to rate by several hundred dollars a month at a minimum and your 24 or 25 mortgage is now back to 30 years. I know because I used to work at the hospital and someone I know there literally had this discussion with someone a few months ago. The lady didnt take the job because moving was only going to net her perhaps another $100 a month if you dont factor in the rental truck, the hours of packing, and if you factor in getting the prices just right on both the sale and the purchase.",

              "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Inflation is put a fork in it done. </p>\n\n<p>Tech stocks might be overpriced in many cases, but some may actually be cheap vs where they will be in a few years. Id say NVDA for example will likely continue up. TSLA is probably overpriced. MSFT will go up long term. Googl might have issues. apple likely isn&#39;t as much a growth stock as it used to be. meta is still growing, but it will slow down before too much longer. Many of the smaller but still big tech are a mixed bag of potential and issues. </p>\n\n<p>Housing is overpriced due to throttled supply. Most homeowners are not willing to trade their low rate for higher rates due to the risks involved with a higher mortgage. When rates drop a bit supply will likely jump up dramatically. That will likely be when fed cuts about 150-200 basis points so we are still quite a ways off from that tipping point. Tack on the issues with insurance in many areas and you have people leaving those places and going elsewhere that is putting pressure on the already limited housing supply where they are going. For example I bet Florida house prices will drop over the next few decades, but further north in NC and TN it will be pressured by many FL folk moving there. CA will see similar issues, but I dont know where they are all moving towards. I live in NC and anecdotally Im seeing a huge influx of FL plates in the area year around now. They built around 50 homes a few hundred yards from my house and roughly half of them were bought by people from FL. Few of the homes were bought by locals. Beyond the FL crowd we got a mix of people from other states with few NC residents moving in there. I have friends in TN and they are seeing similar things in their area. Lots of new homes going up, but most of them being bought by folks from elsewhere. Not complaining about it. I&#39;m observing its happening and its makes sense for it to continue to happen.</p>\n\n<p>Unemployment has trended up a bit, but not spiked and all of that is relative to where its been for the past few years. A bigger issue is that skilled labor is excessive in one place and absent in another due to the housing issues. People aren&#39;t going to bear that cost  and risk for a bit more pay. Businesses aren&#39;t willing to cover that cost for the most part and its becomes a chicken and the egg kind of situation. Rates come down enough, people move, critical skill shortages get filled, economy stops grinding on problems the rates are causing. It doesnt help that many of these skilled labor jobs are not super high skilled labor, but rather just critical for a smooth operation. Without them you cant spin up all the related jobs. As an example the local hospital has had several opening for higher end nursing. The jobs aren&#39;t being filled and they are trying to make do with temp nurses. Not enough nurses are willing to move here and these specific jobs are mid to late career type nursing jobs. The pay offered is fine in normal times, but if the nurse you need has to sell the house out of town and get a house here then they either need to come out ahead or the new job has to pay enough to make it sensible. right now that simply isnt the case. Sell your house for a profit, get the same exact amount of mortgage in the new place, pay more due to rate by several hundred dollars a month at a minimum and your 24 or 25 mortgage is now back to 30 years. I know because I used to work at the hospital and someone I know there literally had this discussion with someone a few months ago. The lady didnt take the job because moving was only going to net her perhaps another $100 a month if you dont factor in the rental truck, the hours of packing, and if you factor in getting the prices just right on both the sale and the purchase.</p>\n</div>",

We have significant parts of the economy that are doing fine and other parts that are not. Its been that way since the pandemic in particular.\n\nInstead of thinking about recession or not a better way would be to think about what works for the new normal post pandemic and what doesnt. Then think about are those things priced for those outcomes. Office buildings are in serious trouble. Restaurant locations that depended upon the office crowd for business are in trouble. Retail that depended upon commuters heavily are in trouble. Services in the vicinity of homes are doing ok to great. All of that has to shake out and stabilize. When it does we will go up from there. Until then expect parts of the market to leg down further, some parts to tread water, and for parts that are doing fine to leg up rapidly when concerns about them are resolved. \n\nIf you are in a part of the economy that is treading water it likely feels like a recession. If you are in a part of the economy that is struggling from the changes in the new normal you probably feel like its about to be a depression. \n\nThen there is the rates. Until rates come down materially dont expect people to be buying things that are typically financed. That means, homes, cars, large appliances, many home upgrades, campers/rvs/boats are all under pressure with the exception of some luxury parts of those markets. \n\nIf that is all too much for you, just think about it like this. The economy shifted in a dramatic way because of the pandemic and the new normal post pandemic is significantly different from the pre pandemic for a substantial part of the economy. The pricing for assets does not accurately reflect all of that yet so expect things to be in flux for a few more years. I figure it would take 5 years from the height of the pandemic before we settle into the new normal more or less. \n\n  \nNow if you disagree with that view thats fine, but please think about it and why you think it isnt valid enough. If you haven't thought about it like this before mull over it for a few days and see if it makes sense to you. If you can think of holes to poke into it feel free to comment with them.",

Until rates come down materially dont expect people to be buying things that are typically financed. That means, homes, cars, large appliances, many home upgrades, campers/rvs/boats are all under pressure with the exception of some luxury parts of those markets. </p>\n\n<p>If that is all too much for you, just think about it like this. The economy shifted in a dramatic way because of the pandemic and the new normal post pandemic is significantly different from the pre pandemic for a substantial part of the economy. The pricing for assets does not accurately reflect all of that yet so expect things to be in flux for a few more years. I figure it would take 5 years from the height of the pandemic before we settle into the new normal more or less. </p>\n\n<p>Now if you disagree with that view thats fine, but please think about it and why you think it isnt valid enough. If you haven&#39;t thought about it like this before mull over it for a few days and see if it makes sense to you. If you can think of holes to poke into it feel free to comment with them.</p>\n</div>",
