The expected decline for a completely untreated placebo group (as per other studies, etc.) for 6 months would be (very very roughly) 4 points.\n\nFundamentally this aspect of the study was too short and too small to statistically support ANY conclusion, for or against, the drug.\n\n> they had an opiate and went to war with the FDA\n\nI mean, they had an opiate drug that *worked*. They fought the FDA to get it approved and released. Ultimately, they lost. No one is surprised that the FDA didn't want another opiod pain killer coming to market in the midst of the very public opiod crisis, but it's weird to suggest SAVA did anything except work in the best interest of their shareholders to get Remoxy, a working drug, approved for use. Your argument is that they fought TOO hard?\n\n> Every time they start running out of money, they hype to retail investors and sell some shares to keep it going\n\nNo insider has sold shares since the company became Cassava Sciences in 2018. Not once. In fact I don't think an insider has sold since the inception of the company in 2013.\n\nAs for dilution, they've had share offerings to raise capital as needed. Literally the most common thing in the world for a fledging corp in every single market sector, ever.\n\nIn no cases could you reasonably argue they had \"hype cycles\" prior; the offerings were generally attached to decent stock performance as a result of material findings in the form of trial data releases.\n\nYou are trying to make the most boring and normal form of corporate fundraising in existence appear nefarious somehow.\n\n> Company was at some point under CRIMINAL investigation as well as some number of civil and regulatory 3 letter agency investigations for their alleged shenanigans. There's been no update on that\n\nReally? Please point to the official statement from any of these three letter agencies or organizations where the company has been under investigation for anything, criminal or otherwise?\n\nThe SEC, DOJ, and FDA have never, not once, not ever, made any formal investigation known to the public, made any formal charge or allegation against Cassava Sciences of any form of wrong-doing, or even said anything in private to Cassava Science management to suggest this.\n\nIt's also been almost 3 years since Cassava initially indicated they were cooperating with any and all agency requests, and we STILL have heard nothing from any of these agencies about Cassava or its potential wrong-doing.\n\nAnd do keep in mind, a few months after Cassava announced their cooperation with DOJ and SEC investigators, the DOJ and SEC DID happen to announce their wide spread, ongoing, many months old investigation into illegal short selling practices.\n\nWe literally have no official confirmation of why the SEC and DOJ were talking to Cassava Sciences.\n\n> Lab of the main investigator was raided by the feds\n\nFDA inspections are not \"raids\". They are not even particularly uncommon. And the result of correcting the errors identified by the FDA inspection findings resulted in no material change to the data in the report in question.\n\nIt's also irrelvant because this is talking about a single 13 year old study that has nothing to do with the promising phase 2 trial data or the ongoing phase 3 trial data collection.\n\n> Main investigator has seen numerous academic papers many of which were adjacent or involving this retracted\n\nThe 13 year old paper everyone seems to care about was never retracted. Dr. Wang has had some other papers retracted, sure (and some of those retractions were since reversed). None of those papers have anything to do with this drug.\n\n> Main investigator was subject to a research misconduct investigation\n\nKey takeaways from the leaked, never finalized investigation are that there is not a single mention of fraud or data fabrication, nor a single instance where Dr. Wang violated data retention or handling procedures in place at CUNY.\n\nYou also forgot to mention that the investigation wasn't just \"not finalized\", it was formally *halted* by CUNY and followed by a new investigation *into the original investigation process* because there was sufficient concern over the entire process around the original investigation.\n\n> Very few if any researchers outside the investor group and the company believe their theory of Alzheimer's\n\nFor the longest time they didn't even HAVE a theory. Took a while to suggest how FLNA might affect this process at all.\n\nBut your argument is \"because they don't know how it works, evidence showing it works cannot be trusted\".\n\nThere are hundreds of drugs that have clear statisical efficacy even though we have no idea exactly how or why they work.\n\n> There are no other companies pursuing drug development towards this target either\n\nHow could you possibly know this? We have no idea what internal candidate drugs are being scoured for early trials at pharma corps. Certainly the monoclonal treatments are dead-ending, with the latest FDA rejection.\n\nCassava holds multiple patents on FLNA, the biopharms can't just manifest a new FLNA-affecting drug out of thin air. They could be chewing through potential patent-free candidates right now and we'd never know until they find something noteworthy and start announcing trials.\n\n> They constantly p value hack their press releases - lots of dropped patients, they pick cutoffs for things like mild and moderate to show efficacy\n\nThe phase 2 trial data stands alone with no stratification. As a whole, the performance of the complete trial population (mild and moderate) in aggregate is already hugely promising and would blow any existing treatments out of the water if replicated in phase 3.\n\nThe only reason anyone cares to dig further is because the improvement in mild cases specifically is even just so much better than that.\n\nRegardless, the phase 3 trials are stratified mild and moderate. There will be no statistical hangups in their ability to pull out data for the different groups.\n\nYou'll have to provide specific examples about dropped patients. Never seen that for phase 2 stuff.

There are no other companies pursuing drug development towards this target either, including the alleged evil big pharma that have refrained from investing in them.\n* They constantly p value hack their press releases - lots of dropped patients, they pick cutoffs for things like mild and moderate to show efficacy, etc. It's sketchy by biotech standards. I'm only slightly exaggerating that they'd report a stat like 'people who have 2 vowels in their first name and prefer carnitas tacos to beef burritos had a 30% slowing of mental decline!' if they could find it. If you mess with the cutoffs you can make anything look decently good...\n\nThe stock is suitable for nothing other than day trading up and down and seems semi-glued to $20. It's possibly a good thing to sell vol on - I personally think they crash and burn on p3 this year, but the price wont go a lot under 10 because management is great at shoveling dung to morons.\n\nVery long term it goes to zero because this management team cant execute and the drug appears to not work. I'm sure they'll make tons of money personally on the way though. And options dealers will make the most of all.\n\nI don't have any positions in it and haven't in quite some time. If I was to trade it now, I'd probably just use a short-vol strategy. If I thought P3 end was imminent, I'd probably consider selling call spreads or buying put spreads down to $10 (because I think the CEO is very skilled at hype and would be able to take a total failure and convince his investors its a win).\n\nAnd this is all of course opinion because they sue people who don't say that.

          "body": "> if the science in any way looked like it did, it would be far far far more expensive than a $1 billion market cap\n\nFunnily, the current SP is mostly suppressed for *other* reasons hanging over it, not the science. Not going to get into the weeds of those issues.\n\nLooking ONLY at the science -- the P2 trial data, safety, and drug MoA -- this company is probably undervalued.\n\nWe know that in a [12-month 200pt open label trial of mild and moderate Alzheimer's](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-positive-top-line-clinical-results), cognitive decline was virtually halted. Looking into the details it actually gets even better than that for mild pts, but regardless, that's the topline headline.\n\nThat's extraordinarily suggestive.
