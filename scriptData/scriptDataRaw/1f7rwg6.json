  "selftext": "**Intro & numbers:**  \nThere have been a few DD on HIMS in this forum but I have a few new notes to add.\n\nExcellent growth (75% CAGR), 81% Gross Margin (Q2 2024), and trading at about 15x forward earnings...with $1.4B revenue, and 3 consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability.   Almost all of this is prior to GLP1...which added around $10-15M rev. last Q.  No debt.  $200M in bank.  \n  \n$3.2B Market cap....I see it as at least 3x undervalued just this year.  \n\nThey are the #6 health app on Apple apps.\n\nThey are taking 54% of all new entrants the entire telehealth market, with about 2M users (estimated, 1.9M as of Q2 earnings).\n\nInsider buy of millions on open market around $16-$19 (board member) and new board members as titans of industry (former Novo COO, Netflix subscription goddess, etc.)\n\nThey sell hair loss, weight loss, ED, and Hormone to come soon! among others.\n\nThe biggest fear from investors is : This excellent growth can't continue.  Telehealth is the future, HIMS is the growth leader by marketshare, but look at Teledoc!\n\n**Missunderstandings on the stock:**\n\n^(GLP1 shortages are ending, they won't be able to sell it anymore!)\n\n  \n-doesn't matter, they will sell customized doses, confirmed on CNBC by LLY CEO btw, or their extremely profitable and cheap to consumer oral (10x the rev of their glp1 currently btw).\n\n^(LLY or NOVO might sue them!)  \n\n-Yes they might.  But if HIMS does what they say they are doing, sell only customized doses of compounded glp1, non patented GLP1 (Liraglutide) made in house (vertically integrated), or orals (also VI), they will not be in trouble.  In fact, they will likely just sell branded in order to bring in customers and then cross sell more profitable products, but more on that later.\n\n^(Teledoc failed! Telehealth is trash)\n\n-You really think people other than boomers with no life want to go to the doctor for ED, hair loss, weight loss, or even most common ailments?  No one wants to do that.  Americans will spend $50 to have mcdonalds delivered with uber eats rather than drive to Mcdonalds for $5.  Americans spend excessively for convenience.  HIMS will give you 1 pakcage a month with all your drugs.  Teledoc was garbagio on a million software platforms, failed to modernize, no margin, no marketing, horifically bad operations, and took 20 years to reach 2.8B rev.  even then it's only at 1/3rd the price to sales ratio of HIMS, showing how undervalued a growing technology first company taking 54% of market share really is right now.\n\n\n\n**Finding their moat:**\n\nLook at their website: it's extremely clean and user friendly, uses back and forth dialogue to make recommendations, and when you get to weight loss end boss, it puts Oral Pills (compounded, $70) next to compounded GLP1s (Semaglutide, etc.) for couple hundo. and branded GLP1 as well, so legit Ozempic etc. is available for full price (thousands).  HIMS own COO has been taking the compounded GLP1 as proof of her faith in it.\n\nFor the record, the reason you want to see compounded sales increase is because it's extremely profitable vs branded which is a wash.  However, we value growth AS WELL as realize most glp1 customers fall off (fatigue from injecting, lose weight and dont want to inject drugs anymore and try to keep it off naturally as their set point has adjusted).  Here we will likely eventually see cross sell to orals, as they have about 33% of the efficacy.\n\nThis cross sell hasn't happened yet, if it does their $2M users will generate absurd revenue.  But it's only had GLP1 for a few months.\n\nSo what is different than before?  WHERE IS THE MOAT?  It's in the way they present these products for future cross sell.  It's how they make the user experience excellent.  It's how they market.  It's how the have such efficient operations to have such a high gross margin.\n\nOk how can marketing and operations be a moat?\n\nDark Patterns; the very best master this via many methods: Subscription methods, colors on the webpage, wording, packages, bundles, etc.\n\nWhat companies excel at Dark Patterns?  Amazon is generally considered the best at this, with Prime being difficult to cancel, BUY now buttons all over, subscription models with discounts but still overpaying, and focus on customer experience so we all shut up and overpay for the convenience.  Amazon has at least 11 different Dark Patterns in their buying process.\n\nMarketing is no longer some cut and paste thing in 2020's, nor is branding.  HIMS has mastered both, with an amazing gross margin to boot.  Excellence in all areas of business operations.  When all 3 of the pillars are aligned you have a moat.  Reminds me of Amazon when they sold \"books.\"  They spend all of their excess revenue that would be profit into MARKETING.  WHY DO THEY DO THIS?  Because they are taking ALL OF THE MARKETSHARE.  They have KPIs associated to their spend and thus it makes sense to pump as much cash as possible into that!  Remember when people were mad Amazon wasn't profitable?\n\n**Potential upcoming Catalysts:**\n\nThere is a rumor of Testosterone replacement therapy coming to HIMS given they announced in Q2 they are bringing hormone therapy to their platform.  Given Test rep therapy lends itself to the subscription model (it's legal steroids, xD) and is basically TAKEN FOR LIFE, this combined with HIMS recently aquired facility (FDA approved) that will be able to manufacture their own Test rep therapy, Liraglutide (a GLP1) and other drugs, means HIMS will continue to take market share, offer all drugs under one roof, and be extremely profitable regardless of if the FDA makes them stop compounding Tirz or Sema versions of GLP1.  TAM for Test rep therapy is $1.8B and will likely grow to $3B in the next 6 years, but i'd anticipate even more TAM growth as US men in their 20s are the least sex'd ever.  Test rep therapy is the fountain of youth and we will see more men trying to date in their 30s and 40s (50s as well) hopping on it, along with many other HIMS offerings.  This is like investing in cat food for all the growing # single mothers out there.  \n  \nTHEY WILL STILL SELL NON PATENTED GLP1, granted it's not as good BUT ITS CHEAP AS FUCK and who is spending thousands on Ozempic?  HIMS was never meant for the rich but luckily the middle class in the US have a ton of expendable income.   \n\nInsider buys: The stock is around where it was when we saw insider buys last quarter, as their financials are improving rapidly i'd be surprised if some new additions don't make some buys as well.\n\nContinued execution: This company has executed quarter after quarter.  It is a beast.\n\nThese catalysts are no joke: The stock runs insanely hard when stuff like this occurs so i'd say buy and hold vs. try and time this, it legit will open up 20-30% at a time if there is an insider buy.  Price is down just from a bit of a hangover from the GLP1 yoyo that no one understands fully.  The reason potential lawsuits don't matter: HIMS can just sell branded GLP1 and their own unpatented ones.  They will sell personalized doses just enough to keep\n\n**How to make money on this Asymetric Opportunity on the ground floor of the Telehealth industry:**\n\nThe price has fallen around 30% on news of GLP1 shortages ending, despite the fact that in 7 months they had $100M revenue growth in their oral weight loss pill alone, at $70.  Even if the FDA no longer allows them to compound, they will continue to sell branded GLP1 and that gets customers to...YOU GUESSED IT, DARK PATTERN buttons with subscriptions and other extras and substitutions for orals etc. that will maintain some margin and most importantly: FUEL GROWTH.\n\nI think this 30% pullback and extreme drop in volume and IV make long term call options very interesting again right now.  I'd suspect we see $45 end of year if smart money decides this is a risky but great chance at a 10X gain over the next few years.  I think $11 is the floor, but the stock can move fast so if I wasn't already in I'd enter now rather than wait.  It's at $14.7 range...the price they had before GLP1 was announced.\n\nShares are a smarter play...this stock can skyrocket 20-30% in a day depending on news.\n\nI'm at the point that random locals from the barber to friends are recommending HIMS for random things; not even using the drug names by this point. Just \"go to HIMS for that.\"  This convinced me that the cross sell opportunity is there.  People aren't saying \"go shop on Amazon for your semaglutide and ur xyz drug it's super great and nice and clinical and confusing with 3 carts etc....\"  \n\nI think there is of course risk they stop executing, but I don't see a more solid opportunity for a 10x and thus the risk return fits my profile.  Granted, my risk profile is infinite.  ",
