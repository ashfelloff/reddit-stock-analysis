A deal had weeks earlier been stopped in its tracks.\n\nThe latest iteration of the deal will see the buying consortium, which includes RedBird Capital Partners and KKR, invest more than $8 billion into Paramount and to acquire National Amusements. The deal gives National Amusements an enterprise value of $2.4 billion, which includes $1.75 billion in equity.\n\n“It’s a new Paramount, it’s not just a catchphrase,” said RedBird’s Jeff Shell, the former NBCUniversal CEO, on a call with investors Monday. “We think it’s going to be a new day for these combined assets.”\n\nEllison will lead the combined company as CEO, while Shell will serve as president.\n\nThe merger is subject to regulatory approval. It also includes a 45-day “go-shop period,” in which the Paramount special committee can solicit other offers.\n\nA completed Skydance merger would mark a major shift for the ownership of Paramount, as well as for Hollywood as a whole.\n\nThe Redstone family has long controlled the movie studio — known for films such as “The Godfather,” “Top Gun,” and “Forrest Gump” — as well as the CBS broadcast network and cable TV networks like MTV and Nickelodeon.\n\nThe merger will also put David Ellison, the founder of the production company Skydance and son of Oracle founder and billionaire Larry Ellison, at the helm of a major movie studio and among Hollywood’s elite.\n\nParamount’s shares were trading at roughly $12 per share premarket Monday.\n\nThe stock has been on a roller coaster in the last year as the legacy media giant faced a weak advertising market and the continued bleeding of cable TV customers. Its flagship streaming platform, Paramount+, is also yet to reach profitability.\n\nReaching a deal\n\nLate last year Paramount began deal discussions with interested buyers, including, at the time, Warner Bros. Discovery. On top of the industry headwinds, Paramount is strapped with a hefty debt load of nearly $15 billion.\n\nSkydance and Paramount inched closer to a deal in recent months, during which time Bob Bakish stepped down as CEO of Paramount and was replaced by a trio of company leaders.\n\nThe parties first agreed to terms of a deal in early June, only to see the deal stopped in its tracks by Redstone a week later.\n\nShortly after, Paramount’s so-called “Office of the CEO” — CBS CEO George Cheeks, Paramount Media Networks CEO Chris McCarthy and Paramount Pictures CEO Brian Robbins — set out on their plan to restructure the company by cutting debt and finding a streaming joint venture partner.\n\nDuring recent weeks, other interested bidders have surfaced, including media mogul Barry Diller.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/08/paramount-skydance-merger.html",
