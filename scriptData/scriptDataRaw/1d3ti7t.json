  "selftext": "Hello fellow regards,\n\nMany of you messaged me personally today to tell me I'm a loser since I was the author of a few posts related to shorting Abercrombie and Fitch (ANF) over the past few weeks. Here's a brief summary:\n\n* [*ANF continues to be the biggest shorting opportunity of 2024 - numbers don't lie*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1atdgdv/anf_continues_to_be_the_biggest_shorting/) - from Feb 17 (ANF up 57% since then)\n* [*Doubling down on Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) short position*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b7jlnj/doubling_down_on_abercrombie_fitch_anf_short/) - from Mar 5 (ANF up 35% since then)\n\nLet's first get loss porn out of the way:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jk1ocbtm0h3d1.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb4c0069a5ec1dcbc014d9e62cb839990deeb3db\n\n100 shares short at $90 and 3 naked calls at 160, 197.5 and 200 strikes. Total unrealized loss 16,479 USD.\n\nI know that is more than what most of you make in a year so I get why your balls are tingling, but in the big boy world I live in, this is just part of doing business.\n\nNow let's get to the actual analysis why I'm not fucking leaving.\n\nThe stock jumped 24% today on earnings after already having a run up this year greater than NVDA (in the past 12 months, NVDA is up 186% while ANF is up 503%).\n\nEarnings breakdown:\n\n* Revenue is up 22% YoY (went from 836m to 1,021m)\n* Net income is up 538% YoY (went from 18m to 115m)\n\nWhile the numbers do look impressive, the stock is plain and simple - overpriced. To use simple calculation, XRT (retail sector etf) P/E ratio is 13.29. ANF P/E ratio is 18.96. To bring ANF in line with retail sector, it's price should be \\~$130 per share. Tonight its sitting at $189.\n\nSecond, it's a clothing store for fuck sakes. Competitors will copy paste whatever fashion magic they are creating, the same way Alo started eatings Lulu's lunch (-41% YTD).\n\nThe only theory I have at this point is that someone on Wall Street has insider information that someone big is short and the opposing hedge funds are pumping this into clouds to squeeze them out of their position. But that's not my concern as I focus on my game and my cards.\n\nHaving said that, this Friday my naked call will most likely be assigned at $160, and that will bring me to a total of 200 short shares with an average of $125.\n\nI sold 197.5 naked call today as well, expiring Friday, which could get assigned too if the pump continues into the week. That would bring my average even further up and set me up higher so I can laugh in your faces when ANF inevitably dumps.\n\nStay tuned.\n\nWith love,  \nSilbergleit Junior\n\n",
