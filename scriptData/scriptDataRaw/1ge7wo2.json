Too many competitors in mobile and online pharmacy like HIMS etc.</p>\n\n<p>Walmart is excelling in the medicine home delivery phase. And I&#39;m not saying CVS won&#39;t make money any other ways but, when you dent the main weapon usually they have only 2nd best options. Rarely does a company that established shift course really well. And with the advent of business adjusting solutions to become your own self competitor like PLTR business solutions in data. The less nimble companies will die.</p>\n</div>",
