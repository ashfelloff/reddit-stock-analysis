That would probably be a case of share price going down because, if anything, from the back-of-the-envelope DCF share price math that results from paying a huge slug of cash for capex in a single period (so no help from discounting those cash outflows), which might also drain your cash balance or secured revolver, hindering near term liquidity. Probably why the dividend got cut, and if said ShitCo was paying a divvy before, they are probably being valued (to some extent) on that yield.\n\nMoral of this story is this: if you're trying to beat the market by picking single name securities, there's no real shortcut to dissecting an earnings call by just focusing on two or three line items in the 10-Q. Everything matters.\n\nIf you don't believe me, read earnings call transcripts to see what sort of questions the equity research community is asking (closest thing to a shortcut I can offer up the stock picking brainlords in this thread that will ignore all of the above advice)",
