A monopolist is lazy, ineficient, not innovating enough because they have their revenue secured. No matter the DoJ decision, it will be breaking the status quo and push GOOG to innovate and create more value for shareholders. The same thing for NVDA. Long term, the worst for them is to be a monopolist and maintain the status quo.

      "body": "It's because tech doesn't trust the government (anymore). This leads people in tech to believe that the government is likely going to fuck shit up badly. So they want the government to stay out of it and oppose these probes.\n\nNow, this certainly wasn't always the case, but since 2016 and the whole Facebook election interference saga the sentiment in both camps definitely has turned sour and uncooperative. Thus the general lack of trust nowadays. If there was more trust between tech and the government, it's quite likely that people in tech wouldn't oppose these probes.\n\nI'm in tech, so I'm obviously biased. I'll try to give you my (very biased) view of why all this opposition: \n\n1/ There has been a lot of negativity towards tech in media for multiple years now. Many people (including me) feel that most of it is quite unjustified, and we are basically made into scapegoats for some stupid political games that we would have preferred to stay out off. Many of the antitrust probes feel flimsical in their justification (the GOOGL one being among the more solid ones) and thus feel more like political games than justified by actual economic interest. This sentiment is further aggravated by the fact that the DoJ keeps losing many of its antitrust probes. \n\n2/ Tech companies' economic activities and incentives are highly complex, with lots of trade offs, and the view is that the government has an overly simplistic picture of these trade offs, or simply doesn't acknowledge them. The worry is that (whether due to lack of knowledge or care) the DOJ/FTC will get some of these trade offs wrong, which will cause a lot of blast damage that hurst both the consumer and general economic activity. (E.g. the GOOGL case could easily kill Firefox, basically leading to a duopoly of GOOGL/AAPL for browser engines, with GOOGL being a monopoly outside of Apple's ecosystem.) This is something that is already playing out right now outside of the US. The EU has gone much further with legislation, including GDPR and the DMA, and there is the not uncommon view that these legislations are not actually benefiting consumers in any meaningful way (and are in fact actively causing consumer harm and harming economic activity). So the worry is that, like the EU, the FTC/DOJ are going to get things badly wrong and cause more harm than good.\n\n3/ The merger blocks basically cut off one of the common outs for VCs, effectively reducing the expected return on their investments. As such, there is less interest in pumping money into one of the US' biggest growth drivers, directly causing a huge cooling off of economic activity. Obviously, sometimes merger blocks are necessary, but general hostility towards merges is poison for the type of investments that were and are responsible for creating a huge amount of wealth in the US.",
