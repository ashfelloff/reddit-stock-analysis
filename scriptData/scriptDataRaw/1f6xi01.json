For fun I did a simple histogram to show what TIME was the most common for someone to be let out of the hospital.  The answer was... 4:05pm</p>\n\n<p>Why 4:05pm?  Because the medicare rules say that if someone is there after 4pm the hospital can bill medicare for another night&#39;s care.   So they COULD let the patients go at 11am, but they keep them there until 4:05pm. </p>\n\n<p>Get the government the FUCK out of healthcare.</p>\n</div>",
