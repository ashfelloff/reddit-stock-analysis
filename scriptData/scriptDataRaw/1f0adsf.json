Either the Congress comes in with Trillions more to prop up the system, which will cause massive inflation as we just saw, or they let it all go down in a deep recession. Let me know the other choice. You're so dumb, saying people have been calling for recession since 2021. Yeah, the Congress passed a $1.9 Trillion stimulus bill in March 2021.

YouTube channel Financial Education released a video within the last 24 hours that was comparing today to 2007. </p>\n\n<p>Before you use GDP as your thesis for an argument, watch that video.</p>\n\n<p>There are some things that are different. Government spending is atrociously high, and you don&#39;t have balloon payments or as much risky lending to homeowners like you did then.</p>\n\n<p>That does not mean a recession won&#39;t happen, nor does it mean a crash won&#39;t happen. A crash seems to be unlikely caused by anything housing, though.</p>\n\n<p>Don&#39;t think it&#39;s all hunky dory out there. Dollar/Yen moves a little bit and sends the VIX to 65 overnight. That&#39;s a crack if I&#39;ve ever seen one. Maybe it remedies itself, maybe not.</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m positioned to benefit from a crash, I&#39;m positioned to benefit from another bull marker, mostly interest rate sensitive names.</p>\n\n<p>Up or down, I&#39;ll make money. I&#39;m definitely not comfortable with the direction of the economy and markets, though. We&#39;re trying to ignore 15 signs of an impending recession because of 2 or 3 other positive ones. </p>\n\n<p>Hedge, hedge, hedge. Let it play out.</p>\n</div>",
