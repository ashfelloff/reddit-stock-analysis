          "body": "You wouldn’t be the first to say that.  IMAX has flown under the radar for decades after peaking 10 years ago.  AMC and its meme-stock madness has dominated WSB message boards in recent years.  But in my opinion Cinemark is still the best pure play theater stock with a long runway ahead of it.  However, IMAX is the Apple of cinema with the biggest screens, highest quality sound, and best projection tech in the industry.  So much so, IMAX makes a lot of money selling/leasing their equipment to other exhibitors like AMC and CNK, and others in Europe and Asia.
