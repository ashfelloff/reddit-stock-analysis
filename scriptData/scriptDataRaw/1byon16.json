My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.\n\n[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. \n\n[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.\n\n[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. \n\n**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.\n\n[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.\n\n**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. \n\n[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.\n\n[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.\n\n**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.\n\n**Bear Case**\\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. \n\n**My personal position**\\- UNH $410 Put 5/3\n\n**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",
