If SIRI rises by the time of the conversion you'll make more.  If it falls by then you'll make less. << *This is  oversimplified*\n\nI suspect it will hold or rise.\n\nI'll leave my reasons for that in my comment below so we can skip the \"Howard Stern is sus\" comments (he definitely is, that's his schtick), the \"I can't afford a car with a radio\" comments (no shame in that, cars are expensive) and get to picking apart this play.\n\n# Part two: the options are calling.\n\nFor some reason LSXM- has been ignored compared to SIRI, and that includes its option chain.\n\n[Take a look at the IV on SIRI calls for Aug 16.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SIRI/options/?type=calls&date=1723766400)\n\nI picked that date because it's the middle of the quarter and the deal should be done by then or at least close enough that arbitrageurs are closing the gap.

What's truly ATM right now?** The price of LSXMK or the price of (SIRI \\* 8.4)? If the latter, then the true ATM strike is $29 and the last sold price is 10¢.\n\nWhen those shares convert you'll be holding ATM calls on SIRI with a lot size of 840 shares and a cost basis of 10¢ per share.\n\nIf you think the merger will take longer to complete or that SIRI may be worth owning after the discount then the leaps may be an even better deal.\n\n[Here are the LSXMK calls for Jan '25.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LSXMK/options/?type=calls&date=1737072000)\n\nThe $28 strike last sold for 55¢ with an IV of 57%.

SIRI is being shorted to the point that no shares are available by the people whose thesis is the satellite-radio version of the \"dying brick and mortar\" argument.\n   2. SIRI is being shorted by people in this trade who want to be sure they are getting the full arbitrage experience. (Not me!)\n   3. The income is just too strong to support the stock staying below current levels of support. The CTB is extraordinary, when shares are available.\n   4. LSXM- just does not bounce on its own.\n      1. Evidently a major reason for this deal was the fact that LSXM- always trails SIRI.  Everybody knows the brand, nobody knows the encoded ticker belonging to the company controlled by the majority shareholder.\n      2. It's like setting up a business exchanging currency.  If you offer a dollar for 4 quarters and a penny, but I offer a dollar for 8 bits and a penny, you'll rack up the pennies.  Everybody will walk right past me.\n2. Delayed deal\n   1. They haven't set a hard date yet, but have only seemed confident that this would be an easy deal and that it would go through \"early in Q3\" in most of the official releases.\n3. No deal\n   1. I think it's the 8-k linked in the comments here where they say that a group owning a 48% block of the LSXMA shares has committed to voting \"for\" and I have not heard any opposition.\n4. Asteroid\n   1. You just never can have full certainty, right?  There can always be something I haven't considered.\n\nEdit: Couldn't make the numbering work right in my mixed (numbers and bullets) list so I removed the bullets and went with just the numbers.",
