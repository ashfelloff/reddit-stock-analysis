Historically, the stock price of OXY has been highly correlated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and it appears the company is undervalued in relation to both its assets and potential future earnings.\n\nOver the past two years, every time the price of oil has approached $65 per barrel on the WTI Crude oil , it has marked a significant bottom for both crude oil prices and OXY's stock price. Given the cyclical nature of the oil market and the company's strong fundamentals, OXY's current valuation represents an attractive entry point, with considerable upside potential as the oil market stabilizes and eventually recovers.\n\n\nHistorically, OXY has seen strong price recoveries whenever oil prices have tested this level multiple times, and each time, prices rebounded as demand fundamentals improved or geopolitical factors led to tightening supply.\n\nCurrently, oil prices are once again nearing this critical $65 level, which suggests that the downside risk for OXY may be limited. With global demand for oil still robust, and supply potentially constrained by geopolitical tensions or production cuts from OPEC, there is a reasonable expectation that oil prices will stabilize or rise in the medium term.
