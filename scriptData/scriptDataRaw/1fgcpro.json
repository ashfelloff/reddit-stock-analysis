They're down 99% from all time highs, it's basically like the worst investment opportunity of all time... they're about a dollar share right now with a market cap of 50ish million, they're absolutely running on fumes and have basically no cash left... Only someone highly regarded would consider them a buy... Luckily their CEO is on the spectrum... SEC filings reveal large insider buying from their highly regarded CEO... They're announcing revenue from their recycling business soon, and one large commercial partnership could make them pop... or they'll end up in the toilet...
