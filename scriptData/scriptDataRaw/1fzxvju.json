But the minutes indicated that others also favored a smaller move. It was the first time a governor had dissented on an interest rate vote since 2005 for a Fed known for its unity on monetary policy.*\n\n*“Some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes stated.*\n\n*“Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved,” the document added. “A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization.“*\n\n*Since the meeting, economic indicators have showed that the labor market is perhaps stronger than officials favoring the 50 basis point move had expected.*\n\n*In September, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, much more than expected, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%.*\n\n*The data has helped cement expectations that while the Fed likely is in the early days of an easing cycle, future cuts likely would not be as aggressive as the September move. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in recent days have backed the expected 50 basis points in cuts indicated by the “dot plot” unofficial forecast released after the September meeting.*\n\n*The minutes noted that the vote to approve the 50 basis point cut came “in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks” against the labor market. The minutes noted that a “a substantial majority of participants” favored the larger move, without specifying how many were opposed. The term “participants” suggests involvement of the full FOMC rather than just the 12 voters.*\n\n*The minutes also noted that some members favored a cut at the July meeting that never materialized.*\n\n*Though the document was more detailed about the debate over whether to approve the 25 basis point cut, there was not as much information about why voters supported the larger move.*\n\n*At this post-meeting news conference, Powell used the term “recalibration” to sum up the decision to cut, and the term also appears in the minutes.*\n\n*“Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants’ assessments of the appropriate path,” the minutes stated.*\n\n*Such a recalibration would bring policy “into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market.” Supporters of the 50 basis point cut “also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks.“*\n\n*Under normal circumstances, the Fed prefers to cut in quarter-point increments. Previously, the Fed moved by half a point only during Covid and, before that, the 2008 financial crisis.*\n\n*Market pricing is pointing to the fed funds rate ending 2025 in the 3.25%-3.5% range, about in line with the median projection of a 3.4% rate, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch. Futures markets previously had been indicating a more aggressive path and in fact now are pricing in about a 1-in-5 chance that the Fed does not cut at its November 6-7 meeting.*\n\n*The bond market, though, has been acting differently. Since the Fed meeting, both the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields have surged about 40 basis points.*",

He chose to signal a rate cut in Dec 2023 when financial condition was already over-pricing Fed cuts, and after financial condition had loosened a lot a month prior.\n\nHe chose to dismiss the hot inflation prints in Q1 2024 as noise until the third hot print where he basically couldn't dismiss it anymore.\n\nHe acknowledged that there're seasonal factors that artificially bring up inflation early in the year and bring down inflation later in the year. If this is what he believes in, he should slowly cut until early next year and observe what inflation does, not start with 50 bps cut. There's also the new president next year which would be inflationary no matter what, so that further adds reasons to go slow and wait until next year.\n\nUnemployment rate going up is due to more labor supply, not layoffs. What's the rush in that? Unemployment was going up for months while we continued to add 250k+ jobs, and everyone was saying nothing but positive things about the economy. We only shifted down to 150k jobs for 2 months and now suddenly the labor market is weak? Consumer spending is strong, job confidence is strong. If there was any real risk of recession, economists and the market would've already flagged that, but none have so far.\n\nBtw, a dove focuses more on the job mandate, and a hawk focuses more on the inflation mandate. It doesn't matter what the reason for their focuses are, but Kashkari is now a much bigger dove than the rest when the rest of them saw the same data. Same with Powell.",

He chose to signal a rate cut in Dec 2023 when financial condition was already over-pricing Fed cuts, and after financial condition had loosened a lot a month prior.</p>\n\n<p>He chose to dismiss the hot inflation prints in Q1 2024 as noise until the third hot print where he basically couldn&#39;t dismiss it anymore.</p>\n\n<p>He acknowledged that there&#39;re seasonal factors that artificially bring up inflation early in the year and bring down inflation later in the year. If this is what he believes in, he should slowly cut until early next year and observe what inflation does, not start with 50 bps cut. There&#39;s also the new president next year which would be inflationary no matter what, so that further adds reasons to go slow and wait until next year.</p>\n\n<p>Unemployment rate going up is due to more labor supply, not layoffs. What&#39;s the rush in that? Unemployment was going up for months while we continued to add 250k+ jobs, and everyone was saying nothing but positive things about the economy. We only shifted down to 150k jobs for 2 months and now suddenly the labor market is weak? Consumer spending is strong, job confidence is strong. If there was any real risk of recession, economists and the market would&#39;ve already flagged that, but none have so far.</p>\n\n<p>Btw, a dove focuses more on the job mandate, and a hawk focuses more on the inflation mandate. It doesn&#39;t matter what the reason for their focuses are, but Kashkari is now a much bigger dove than the rest when the rest of them saw the same data. Same with Powell.</p>\n</div>",

The Fed is constantly adapting to changing data.  And all the recent data points to strong economy (the recent jobs report was insanely bullish), so I certainly could see them pausing, particularly given their historical hawkishness.  Although quarter point is also possible.  I think the most likely scenario is two quarter point cuts.\n\nAs far as where the median lies, I don't understand your math.  There aren't 19 relevant people in the Fed.  Non-voters opinions don't matter -- they can talk all they want, but they don't set policy. The 12 votes that matter are here: [https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/](https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/)\n\nYou can somewhat assume the 4 hawkish dots in the June dot-plot are likely Bowman, Schmid, Bostic, and Kashkari.  Of those, two are voting this year, and two are voting next year.  So at best (worst?), 2 of the 12 voting members of the Fed are effectively not in favor of cutting much further.  Moreover, the 2025 Fed voting picture gets even more dovish since it brings in Goolsbee...you're going to have 4 doves, 2 hawks, and a middle that slides a bit more dovish.",

The Fed is constantly adapting to changing data.  And all the recent data points to strong economy (the recent jobs report was insanely bullish), so I certainly could see them pausing, particularly given their historical hawkishness.  Although quarter point is also possible.  I think the most likely scenario is two quarter point cuts.</p>\n\n<p>As far as where the median lies, I don&#39;t understand your math.  There aren&#39;t 19 relevant people in the Fed.  Non-voters opinions don&#39;t matter -- they can talk all they want, but they don&#39;t set policy. The 12 votes that matter are here: <a href=\"https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/\">https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/</a></p>\n\n<p>You can somewhat assume the 4 hawkish dots in the June dot-plot are likely Bowman, Schmid, Bostic, and Kashkari.  Of those, two are voting this year, and two are voting next year.  So at best (worst?), 2 of the 12 voting members of the Fed are effectively not in favor of cutting much further.  Moreover, the 2025 Fed voting picture gets even more dovish since it brings in Goolsbee...you&#39;re going to have 4 doves, 2 hawks, and a middle that slides a bit more dovish.</p>\n</div>",
