      "body": "Some very good points made and some very incorrect points. Accounts receivable is likely fully recoverable. This represents amounts due from their customers who have credit terms with Intel. Typical trade terms are net 30, net 60, net 90. Intels customers are very solid and I suspect Intel has a good process in granting credit to their customers. The inventory maybe an issue and could be subject to a write down. The PPE is somewhat arbitrary depending on depreciable lives but it is a rough gauge as to the replacement cost of the PPE. The Goodwill is a byproduct of acquisition accounting. It’s the cost of the acquisitions minus the tangible asset value of the acquisition. Every year end as part of 10-K report, the company should evaluate the carrying value of the Goodwill accounts on a discounted cash flows basis. If the NPV of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value on the Balance Sheet a reserve should be booked. This is a tricky calculation with many assumptions that is audited by their outside auditors at year end. The tax value of the Goodwill is amortizable and deductible on the company’s tax returns over 15 years. This tax value differs from book or GAAP value but goodwill does provide a tax benefit. A quarterly statement half way through the year isn’t the best document to judge a company’s value but the audited 10-K will be. The stock of a company trading at or below tangible book value is usually the sign of either a deep value stock or a company in distress that has made bad decisions in its use of capital in building the company. The jury is still out on Intel. I own 250 shares I think it’s a deep value stock but my faith in management has been shaken. They have seemed to miss the next big thing at almost every turn the past 15 years. Now it seems they are behind in the AI race. It could be the next GE, HP or blackberry. I’m hanging in there. Not buying anymore but not selling either. I’ll be patient for another year. Good luck to you.",

It’s the cost of the acquisitions minus the tangible asset value of the acquisition. Every year end as part of 10-K report, the company should evaluate the carrying value of the Goodwill accounts on a discounted cash flows basis. If the NPV of the estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying value on the Balance Sheet a reserve should be booked. This is a tricky calculation with many assumptions that is audited by their outside auditors at year end. The tax value of the Goodwill is amortizable and deductible on the company’s tax returns over 15 years. This tax value differs from book or GAAP value but goodwill does provide a tax benefit. A quarterly statement half way through the year isn’t the best document to judge a company’s value but the audited 10-K will be. The stock of a company trading at or below tangible book value is usually the sign of either a deep value stock or a company in distress that has made bad decisions in its use of capital in building the company. The jury is still out on Intel. I own 250 shares I think it’s a deep value stock but my faith in management has been shaken. They have seemed to miss the next big thing at almost every turn the past 15 years. Now it seems they are behind in the AI race. It could be the next GE, HP or blackberry. I’m hanging in there. Not buying anymore but not selling either. I’ll be patient for another year. Good luck to you.</p>\n</div>",
