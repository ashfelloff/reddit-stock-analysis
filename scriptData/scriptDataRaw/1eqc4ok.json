              "body": "You raise an interesting question. I asked Chatgpt whether Nvidia's flagship GPUs are only useful for LLMs, here's its answer (obviously take with grain of salt):\n\nNVIDIA's flagship GPUs, such as the A100, H100, and even the older V100, are not only useful for large language models (LLMs) but are also highly versatile and valuable for a wide range of machine learning (ML) tasks. Here's how they are used across different types of ML:\n\n* Deep Learning: These GPUs excel in training deep neural networks, which are fundamental to many areas of machine learning beyond LLMs, including image recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning.\n\n* Computer Vision: NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are commonly used for tasks like object detection, image classification, segmentation, and more. They are particularly valuable in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems.\n\n* Generative Models: They are also used to train generative models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), which are applied in areas like image and video synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.\n\n* Scientific Computing: These GPUs are employed in scientific research for simulations, modeling, and data analysis across disciplines like physics, chemistry, biology, and climate science.\n\n* Reinforcement Learning: NVIDIA's GPUs are often used to train agents in complex environments, such as those found in robotics, gaming, and finance, where the computational power is needed to handle the large amounts of data generated during simulations.\n\n* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Beyond LLMs, GPUs are used for a variety of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization.\n\n* High-Performance Computing (HPC): In addition to ML, these GPUs are crucial for HPC tasks, where they accelerate workloads like molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other simulations that require significant computational resources.\n\n* Data Analytics: These GPUs can also accelerate large-scale data processing tasks, enabling faster analysis and insights in fields like finance, marketing, and healthcare.\n\nIn summary, NVIDIA's flagship GPUs are powerful tools that support a wide array of machine learning and computational tasks beyond just LLMs, making them highly valuable across multiple industries and applications.",

They are particularly valuable in applications such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and security systems.</p></li>\n<li><p>Generative Models: They are also used to train generative models such as GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and VAEs (Variational Autoencoders), which are applied in areas like image and video synthesis, style transfer, and data augmentation.</p></li>\n<li><p>Scientific Computing: These GPUs are employed in scientific research for simulations, modeling, and data analysis across disciplines like physics, chemistry, biology, and climate science.</p></li>\n<li><p>Reinforcement Learning: NVIDIA&#39;s GPUs are often used to train agents in complex environments, such as those found in robotics, gaming, and finance, where the computational power is needed to handle the large amounts of data generated during simulations.</p></li>\n<li><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP): Beyond LLMs, GPUs are used for a variety of NLP tasks including sentiment analysis, translation, and text summarization.</p></li>\n<li><p>High-Performance Computing (HPC): In addition to ML, these GPUs are crucial for HPC tasks, where they accelerate workloads like molecular dynamics, fluid dynamics, and other simulations that require significant computational resources.</p></li>\n<li><p>Data Analytics: These GPUs can also accelerate large-scale data processing tasks, enabling faster analysis and insights in fields like finance, marketing, and healthcare.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In summary, NVIDIA&#39;s flagship GPUs are powerful tools that support a wide array of machine learning and computational tasks beyond just LLMs, making them highly valuable across multiple industries and applications.</p>\n</div>",

Meanwhile 99% of other companies out there have a c-suite going 'hey we doing any of this AI stuff' and a legal department scrambling to write a policy so that a already stretched IT department can think about trying out copilot...those are the companies over the coming 5-15-20 years who will drive this AI data center growth. The usecases mature, the implementations mature, they feel that they will be able to garner value from an AI usecase without the superfluous spend of those 1% of companies.\n\n\nTL;DR: Data Center demand and spend will remain strong regardless of AI....the amount of value and market out there as it relates to AI spend is still astronomical.",

We just bought another operating company recently - all of that data went straight to the cloud, we have practically no on-prem assets in that part of the business anymore. </p>\n\n<p>If you think of cloud and subsequently data center demand as two streams - AI and ex-AI driven, you&#39;ll realize, that regardless of the sentiment surrounding AI (it it a bubble, is it not)...there is unquestionable and significant &#39;safe&#39; base growth in the ex-AI department that will help justify these investments. </p>\n\n<p>As for the AI growth - we haven&#39;t even scratched the surface. I dont know where this idea that &#39;everyone tried it out and realized it wasnt a huge deal&#39; came from. </p>\n\n<p>There are a select handful of companies who have the capital to spend - have thrown a ton of money at AI everything - and unsurprisingly to them (and everyone else in the room) - not all those use cases have cost/value that makes sense - they now triage and find stasis in their AI spend. Meanwhile 99% of other companies out there have a c-suite going &#39;hey we doing any of this AI stuff&#39; and a legal department scrambling to write a policy so that a already stretched IT department can think about trying out copilot...those are the companies over the coming 5-15-20 years who will drive this AI data center growth. The usecases mature, the implementations mature, they feel that they will be able to garner value from an AI usecase without the superfluous spend of those 1% of companies.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: Data Center demand and spend will remain strong regardless of AI....the amount of value and market out there as it relates to AI spend is still astronomical.</p>\n</div>",
