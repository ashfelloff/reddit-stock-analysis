There are also Google's TPUs\n\n> CUDA, Nvidia, and deep learning basically evolved together\n\nNvidia may be the pioneer, but it doesn't mean competition won't evolve soon. Same with ChatGPT — OpenAI had a headstart and took everyone by surprise, but as of now there are plenty of alternatives, many of which are better than ChatGPT\n\n> It takes weeks+ on a half million dollars of Nvidia GPUs to train a modern model\n\nYou can still finetune a model in a few hours/days for a few dozen/hundred dollars. And you don't need to train a new model every day (not even every week or month)",
