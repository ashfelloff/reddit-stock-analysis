Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\n“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”\n\nThe company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.\n\nToyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.\n\nThe latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.\n\nEarly in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.\n\nThe wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/toyota-posts-nearly-20percent-drop-in-second-quarter-operating-profit-missing-estimates.html",
