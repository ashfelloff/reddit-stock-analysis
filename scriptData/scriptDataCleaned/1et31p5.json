It then went down to $2 because everyone thought management were regards - like actively trying to ruin the company, they became a massive short target. PR is non-existant. They missed every single deadline for 2 years straight. Diluted on every piece of good news, their calls sounded like a pile of excuse bullshit etc etc.\n\nTurns out they're not regards, just really fucking clever. They spent 2 years 'secretly' building a moat with patents, signing pre-agreements with almost every major MNO on earth and over-achieving on the numbers they promised their tech would deliver. The sats they're putting up will be compatible with 6G, Starlink can't currently deliver 4G reliably.\n\nThe thing that sold me the most when I picked up at 2.21, was that the CEO doesn't take a salary and their staff salaries are heavily share based/incentivised. I checked out how many insiders have sold shares...\n\nZero. Fucking zero.\n\nThey ALL diamond handed from $20 to $2, they know what the potential is.\n\nYesterdays call essentially confirmed this company is now a legit major player, they have enough cash to deliver 5G mobile broadband to the entire US with the MNOs from fucking space.",

So if you think a stock is going down when its currently 50 dollars and then goes to 20 dollars, you pocket 50-20=30 per share. But shorting has interest. And when a stock goes the opposite direction, you have to buy back the stock. So say someone that had a short at 15 dollars and the price is now 30 dollars, they lose 15-30=-15 PLUS the interest for the length they held it.\n\nThe scary part about a short is that \"technically\" a short has infinite potential for loss. If they dont close out now and the stock goes to say 100 in a few months, they have to pay 15-100=-85 PLUS interest.\n\nSo shorts closing means they are NOT confident that the price is coming down.

The terms almost always state that the company will call the warrants for redemption if it is trading for over $18 for 20 of 30 trading days to limit your upside (what's basically assignment risk on their end).

Also all the time premium dried up on the warrants and now they're too deep in the money for me. Plan to buy some LEAPs in the retirement account if I see a bit of pullback. Realized some gains, and would rather have LEAPs with similar upside, but not being 70% ITM. Overexposed. Might as well just own the shares at that point.\n\nNo more call writing on this one though.
