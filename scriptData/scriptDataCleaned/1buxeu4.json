  "selftext": "Nothing has changed fundamentally for BA in last month and the selling is not done yet.  I have been watching the tape for last several months and it pulls back a little bit when news is slow or when they tease something a little bit positive, but then goes back flat.  It's a buy long term, but selling has to wind down first, which won't happen till the next set of heavy news cycle from the upcoming hearings and results.  Sit on this for next month or so, but keep an eye, once it breaks out, Boeing is gonna be hitting $230 (medium term) and $350 within 12-14 months.",

I don't know, but it's not like you can just go buy airplanes from a different company easily, isn't Aerobus booked out for years on their orders?\n\nSo, airlines are still going to need planes. Who else are they going to buy it from?\n\nThe government still needs its contracts fulfilled. Who else has the capacity to do that?\n\nBasically, how much flexibility is there in this market for customers to move elsewhere, and how quickly can that happen? Maybe 5-10 years down the line other manufacturers can bring up capacity to take Boeing's marketshare, but I don't see them losing much in terms of revenues in the shorter time horizon. \n\nAside from negative publicity, what has ACTUALLY changed in their business environment? Is their cost of doing business going up? Are they losing customers/orders? \n\nCause if they're not losing revenue, and their costs aren't increasing, and the only thing that's happening is that news is beating down the stock price then it seems like a great buy.\n\nAnd fwiw I am legitimately asking these questions. I don't know.",

      "body": "The decision to buy Boeing's dip should be carefully considered in light of the company's recent challenges and the potential for a rebound. Here's a summary of the information from the sources provided:\n\n1. **Challenges Faced by Boeing:** The challenges faced by Boeing in 2023 include issues with its defense business, margin pressure, costly charges, manufacturing quality issues, and delivery delays in the commercial airplanes division. These challenges may impact the company's financial objectives and stock attractiveness, raising concerns about its medium-term outlook.\n2. **Potential Rebound Factors:** Despite the recent decline in Boeing stock, there are several potential tailwinds that could support a rebound. The recent incident involving a 737 MAX 9 jet in an Alaska Air Group flight may have caused a spike in bearish sentiment, leading to the stock's decline. However, analysts at The Goldman Sachs Group have rolled out an outlook for 2024 that favors a breakout in the United States manufacturing sector, which could benefit Boeing. Additionally, the backlog of orders in the industry is beginning to rise, indicating increasing demand.\n3. **Valuation and Market Sentiment:** The recent decline in Boeing stock may have been overdone, as 100% of all the jet orders involve either 737 MAX 8 or MAX 10 jets, and none of these orders include MAX 9 jets. This suggests that the market may be bidding up the stock in anticipation of an earnings beat. The article also discusses the valuation of Boeing and Spirit AeroSystems, noting that both stocks are being punished for the faulty MAX 9 incident, despite the majority of their revenues coming from MAX 8 and 10 models. This could indicate that the market is willing to pay a premium for these stocks, suggesting a potential turnaround.",
