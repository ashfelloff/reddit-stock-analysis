  "selftext": "EDIT: I admit my timing was off, but classic rally and dump. Rallied due to powell saying there won't br rate hike on the next meeting (duh), and obviously marker realized how BS the speech was and sold off. Close enough\n\n2PM EST: FOMC announces no change in rates. Markets stay flat/minor rally due to surrounding fears for a rate hike. Personally shorting NQ if there is a rally. \n\nThe relief rally (if any), will be completely sold off by the time the meeting stream starts.\n\nPowell: \"Need to see more data to have an accurate gauge for inflation\" No they don't, what they're doing is not working. \n\n\"Rate cut expectations are not to be forecasted in the near future\" Likely cut expectations for 2024 decreases to 1 or 2. Markets will likely start dumping or gradually selling off during the meeting.\n\n\"Inflation persisting more than expected\" Obviously. \n\nHowever, if Powell hits us with the line \"Further rate hikes are not off the table and potentially may be necessary and expected if conditions do not improve\", the markets will take the largest dump we will see in a while as everyone's fears are confirmed.\n\nPersonally, I don't think there will actually be any cuts for this year, with a hike more likely than rate decreases. Even though it's an election year, the data we've been getting have been perpetually atrocious, and fear is finally starting to gather up. I will stay cash into market open, and enter puts/shorts after the rate decision is announced and we rally a little bit. Will hold shorts throughout the meeting, as it will provide way more downside potential than any upside unless Powell explicitly confirms that three rate cuts are still guaranteed to be expected. Good luck",

We know housing accounts for something like 30% of GDP when you factor in everything that goes into buying and owning/maintaining a home.

I remember Costco, Apple, Wal Mart, Amazon etc all saying they need to change inventory for a recession. The fact remains this economy is strong, the consumer hasn’t been weakened by higher rates. We live in a new world where 2% plus inflation isn’t that bad ….  The market is horney and wants to really hard. Wait for nfp, I guess we rally and sell off until nfp, then starting next week, bears will begin to get crushed again!\n\nPlease don’t short this marker. It’s gonna be trappy and complex, stay patient cuz market is horney just needs to get wet first … ",
