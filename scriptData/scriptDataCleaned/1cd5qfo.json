His 405c average was between 24-25$ (63% gain =$40.58) but there was  no transaction higher than $36.75 for those calls. That said his $40.58 call price screenshot is showing unrealized gains. He sold calls at $28.50. So let‚Äôs assume his purchase price was $24.50 sold at $28.50. That gives him $80k profit. And profit on 410c is even less than that. I challenge this guy $10k to show the proof of securing a penny more than $200k. It is a lot of money. I hate when ppl like OP mislead people. He is trying to show off unsecured gains. He deserves ban.",

Even if I did have that kinda money to gamble, I still couldn't throw that kind of coin on one play, no matter how much rational sense it makes. I think I'd need to have a net worth of at least 50M to be comfortable risking 700k on a single weekly call option earnings play. How many other companies recently beat projections, crashed hard, and took more than a week to recover, if they even recovered. I've definitely learned the hard way that there is no better way to lose lots of money at once, than to be 100% correct about a stock, but even slightly off about the timing!",
