  "selftext": "I’m going to argue personally that nvidia is not one of them. They’re down less than 5% since Tuesday. Of course this metric alone means almost nothing, but I’d like to discuss companies which are great buying opportunities solely because of this dip. \n\nAs others have stated, AMD seems to be a great buying opportunity. It’s down about 15% since Tuesday, from what I believe was already an appealing price. I’d say the same for Qualcomm. \n\nThe broadest and likely “safest” are going to be TSM and QQQ. Personally I’m in a position where I’m deep in TSM and TQQQ, hedged with INTC. \n\nI’d like to add that I believe these tickers will all run downward a bit longer. I’ve lost bit of $$ due to impatience and buying too early. I do have funds in reserve for when I see evidence of a proper reversal. ",

Whenever there's something China doesn't want people to pay attention to (or they need to get a bit more national spirit) there's always another gunboat moving around, or some war hawkish comments. It's all mostly a distraction.\n\nThis [article](https://www.vox.com/world-politics/355547/soldiers-shortage-demographics-population-conscription) about the world running out of soldiers makes some good points, but basically the current estimations are that China simply couldn't land on Taiwan and take it. Maybe they can, who knows, and additionally a war could halt chip production anyways. \n\n*But*, in the event China invades Taiwan presumably we have much much bigger shockwaves happening worldwide than just chip stocks heading downwards. That said, the companies are aware of this - Intel, for all it's flaws, is opening fab plants just about *everywhere*. TSMC and Global Foundries are close behind - by 2035 I'm comfortable saying that unless the US collapses (which it could, I suppose) the world chip supply is safe.",
