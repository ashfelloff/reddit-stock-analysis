I'm thinking real estate should do well in general as well.\n\nIf you had to choose the three areas that will do best from these declining interest rates what would they be and how would you rank them from 1 to 3?\n\nPersonally I've already rotated some into small caps and I'm debating if should move some more of my mega cap/large caps to real estate funds.",

If you buy REITs, either get a diversified fund, or look very closely into their financials to make sure they aren't overleveraged.\n\nOffice REITs, for a example, are a huge gamble. Many are trading as low as 2x their cash flow, but the catch is their cash flow is declining every year as leases don't get renewed. So it's a very speculative investment on how much more their cash flows will decline before they stabilize.\n\nYou can do your DD by looking up their portfolios and see what companies they lease to, then scour the web for public information on the company's in-office policy. If they are still mostly remote and offices are sitting empty, place a high chance on a non-renewal when the lease expires. If they're all back to office and offices are packed, they'll probably renew.",

So investing in companies like Lennar corp and Toll brothers is good (they’re undervalued too at least in my opinion).  \n\nSmall caps: small caps obviously have to rely on keeping interest payments down since these companies tend to be on the young side and don’t have a lot of profit or cash flows coming in from already made investments.  My favorite quote from Aswath Damodaran (highly recommend his videos) “You can’t make interest payments with potential”.  So low interest rates tends to make small caps do better in the market since they can refinance and keep their debt burden down while they wait for future cash flows.  \n\nLeveraged companies: companies with high debt to equity ratios (often seen in industrials like $ET and $WM).   They will likely rally when rates come down sufficiently as they are now able to refinance the debt they have and acquire new debt in the future at cheaper costs.  So this rate cutting environment may aid them significantly leading to stock rallies.  \n\nWhile all of this is useful, it still matters that the business you’re investing in is fundamentally sound.  Good luck.",

Doubt the new high rates are impacting them very much unless they are total idiots, in which case you dont want to invest in them anyway.

Those guys should see a boost to BV as rates go down, which in turn allows them to lever more, increasing dividends. They do well when rates go down, but not when rates totally collapse to near 0% as they did during COVID. Keep that in mind. Your choices are commercial or agency mREITs. I would stick with agency.",
