  "score": 403,
  "selftext": "Got into investing a few years ago (2021?) and bought 100 NVDA shares around an average of $230. Held it through the crash down to $120 or so, then it recovered to $400 which I thought was nuts and with all the articles about it being overhyped I sold my entire holding (I know it's dumb) as I'd almost doubled my value. By now it would have been triple even that. I don't think I really have the mindset for investing in general but how do I move on from missing out on up to 70k USD in gains? :(\n\nI don't need the money either but it's more than I'll save in many many years.",

One of the many advantages of this approach to investing is that it totally avoids the kind of heartache you are describing.\n\nIf you are stock picking, even if you are wildly successful, you cannot and will not avoid the psychological pain of the stock you almost bought but didn't and rocketed to infinity, and the stock that you sold too early. Even on the rare event that you bought the right stock at the right time, you will regret not buying more. I plowed $20k into Google when it was around $90, now it's $176.

Buy a few shares of NVDA if you are confident in its continuous growth. Other wise just turn off all news of nvida if its stressing you out that much.

No, because that portfolio is just 19% up, with monthly contributions from July 2021.\n\nYou are earning more from those shares you sold, but you feel missing out and wanna get in again?

Do not and I repeat, DO NOT, enter or exit based on someone's else comment. This is reacting to the market, and for that you need rules.\n\nWhat could rules look like? You might want to enter only if the price is above the 4 week EMA. Or sell only if under the 4 weeks EMA. Maybe you only sell if the week made a lower low and lower high. \n\nIn general you do not want to sell strength. It will build and keep going for a while, so in the worst case exit slowly on up trends.\n\nYou will never get the whole move, but you will at least not rely on someone's else fear to trade. gl",
