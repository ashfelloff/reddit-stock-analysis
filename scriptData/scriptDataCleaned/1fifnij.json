                              "body": "There's an interesting phenomenon in certain video games (mainly online is what I'm thinking of, with real economies, but can be within solo games as well) which, say, have a lot of resources/items to constantly process (optionally) and potentially value and/or collect for one reason or another, and take some potential energy and time to do so, however small per unit. I believe something about this is representative of the real world, and it's actually the majority of people/players who fall for the wastefulness of it one way or another, if not many. Note, this is not to dismiss similar behavior as not a result of trauma, it could be that, but what I am talking about here is basically a dopamine loop, or maybe they work together.\n\nTo \"process everything\" is to always have something to do and work for, often mindlessly because it's going for the lowest common denominators, the low hanging fruit right in front of you. Frugalness, to me, seems like an attempt to process nearly every resource/transaction to properly extract as much numerical value as possible, because there is this time to exchange. It's comfortable to certain types, and not necessarily a rare type from my observation. However, the trap is in basically throwing time/energy out as if it isn't valued highly. Like in video games, time is almost assumed to be what should be wasted, by default, so it is often excluded from calculations, when in reality, time and energy should in tandem be the top resource(s) that exist, and value extraction that demands time+energy would ideally be reserved for the greatest effect per unit. And if not, skipped. Leave it on the ground. Time and energy are actually so important, that often doing nothing, or using it to better plan, is a much better use of it. And if you know exactly what you are doing, you plow ahead by skipping waste that most others would try to deal with.\n\nProbably a major part of it is how society gets people to agree to selling their time and energy for relatively low amounts of resources per unit. Even when you hoard and have a lot, the wiring for how to spend excess time/energy doesn't necessarily change, at least not without the awareness of the situation.",

I think in psychology they refer to this as a feeling of 'scarcity', and it presents in lots of different ways. And some are super straightforward. Grew up poor, you feel a need to hoard money. Never had enough to eat? You hoard food, and never waste a grain of rice. Like survivors of the Great Depression. Stuff like that sticks with people at a core level. Whatever the reason, fundamentally it's a need for security through control and hoarding resources. Like you say here though, it's becomes problematic or a disorder when it goes beyond logic. When you are not, as you say, getting a return for time or energy invested. It becomes irrational, the act becomes the entire point. It's like calling out of work to walk around all day looking for a dollar you dropped. Btw.. I actually do this in video games lol. You should see time I waste and all the hoarding I do in Skyrim",

          "body": "This article is great PR whitewashing.  It's a distraction article.  \"Look over here, he's hard on his kids, lol.\"\n\nBuffet said he would only give his kids enough money to get by.  But when you're worth $142 billion, the definition of \"getting by\" is a little different.  He was aw-shucks, but [he had two \"wives\"](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=warren+buffet+two+wives+arrangement) and when the first one passed, he made the second government legal (His first wife was in agreement with it, unlike Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos' first wives).  Aw, shucks, I'm a simple, traditional Midwestern Christian, with good PR.  I'm not judging him, just pointing out he has a private life different from his public image.\n\nWhen his company workers go on strike for money or safety, aw shucks I can't influence that, I just have a ton of fame, can move markets with my words, and own a big chunk of the company.  I let the CEO handle all that union busting, I don't know about things like that.  Gee willikers.  Now let me call the congressmen I own and have my workers forced back to work.\n\nWhen Warren Buffet says he pays less taxes than his secretary, he's not saying the tax system is corrupt -- he's humble-bragging.\n\n* See [Buffett's kids](https://www.google.com/search?&q=buffett+children+foundation) and their foundations.  No, he's not giving them the money to their personal bank account.  He's offloading [tens of billions to the individual foundations](https://www.google.com/search?&q=how+much+has+warren+buffet+given+to+his+children%27s+foundations) they control (avoiding taxes, minimizing any chance of dilution via divorce, et al).  The cash gift he gives them personally is immaterial by percent compared to the billions he gave their personal foundation.   And they decide how the foundation spends it, including on their own pay and comforts, the same way Mark Zuckerburg took his shares and tied them up in the Zuckerburg foundation.  Buffet is a man who gains or loses a billion or five every day depending on how the market swings.  Foundations pass down money and you don't have to offshore any of it (which is a whole other topic of hiding money from the country the wealthy live in and exploit).  Either Zuckerburg is broke, or Buffet's kids are incredibly rich--their money is tied up in foundations.\n\n* Buffett responded to Bernie Sander's call for higher pay for steel workers at a metal company he owns. Buffett's response: That is not my job. [Link here.]( https://www.sanders.senate.gov/in-the-news/bernie-sanders-pay-your-workers-better-warren-buffett-thats-not-my-job/).  His profitable company offers a union contract where health care costs increase almost 400%, no pay raises in the first year (and 3% total over 3 years), reduces vacation days -- while also taking back already earned vacation days [(CNN Link on steelworker strike)](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/31/business/bernie-sanders-warren-buffett-steelworkers-strike/index.html)\n\n* Warren Buffett buys up mobile home parks (where homes aren't mobile) and jacks up the rent on the poor\nhttps://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/the-mobile-home-trap-how-a-warren-buffett-empire-preys-on-the-poor/\n\n* Buffett publicly states companies should pay more in taxes, all while quietly supporting corporate inversion, which allowed Burger King (another company Buffet owns a position in) to claim residence in Canada, avoiding US tax laws\n\n* Berkshire Hathaway (among his many interests) gives millions each year to lobbyists, PACs, and other political interests (far more Republicans than Democrats) to keep politicians in office who WON'T upset the gravy train.\nhttps://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/berkshire-hathaway/summary?id=D000021757\n\n* Buffett is the son of former US Congressman Howard Buffet. Please do not think Warren came from humble beginnings. He plays the part of the common man, but came from a background that could only guarantee success.\n\n*  Warren Buffet, despite all his PR efforts to appear to be \"one of the good ones\" is, like all billionaires, a raging a-hole, as he tells his son's adopted daughter \"I have not emotionally or legally adopted you as a grandchild\"\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-cut-off-granddaughter-152900004.html?\n\n* Warren Buffett's kids will be fine.  [The ‚ÄòGlass Floor‚Äô Is Keeping America‚Äôs Richest Idiots At The Top](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-glass-floor-is-keeping-americas-richest-idiots-at-the-top_n_5d9fb1c9e4b06ddfc516e076?):  Elites are finding more ways to ensure that their children never run out of chances to fail.\n\n*  See also the [\"Buy, Borrow, Die\" strategy](https://www.google.com/search?q=buy+borrow+die+strategy)\n\nTo keep it in perspective, here's How big the numbers are -- people not trained with large numbers, their mind cannot grasp it.\n\n* 1 million seconds = 12 days\n\n* 1 billion seconds = 32 years (11,688 days)\n\n* And we have trillion dollar corporations now.  (32,000 years/11,688,000 days).\n\nJon Oliver had a great/entertaining/educational bit on the buy-up of locally owned mobile home parks and then doubling or tripling the rents on residents who can't move.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCC8fPQOaxU",
