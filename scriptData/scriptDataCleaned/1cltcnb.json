Before GAI you had crappy data scientist that did shit work and over promised and under delivered. In that time period Palantir made a lot of sense.\n\nNow, a 16 year old with a phone can do the same data analysis through a GPT app. The entire \"magical\" gains by data scientist are getting eaten buy an all purpose \"general\" model.\n\nThis will not end well.
