That's VERY VERY bad for business if more than 10% of the vaccinated suffer horrific injuries. \n\nSure, governments might cover their losses for the COVID vaccine, but they're NEVER getting another public health contract ever again.  Pharmaceutical companies make money off government grants, and if that well dries up, they're fucked. \n\nPeople really need to separate out some concepts with respect to the pandemic.  \n\nWas there a MASSIVE and criminal amount of wealth transfers that ROYALLY fucked the middle class? Abso-fucking-lutely, without doubt. \n\nAmazon, and other tech companies made BILLIONS from the pandemic.  Did corporations receive criminal amounts of money to \"stimulate the economy\"? Abso-fucking-lutely.  Look at PPP loans, as an example.  The cunts who took out those loans en masse got them forgiven. And TRUMP'S administration was behind that. But when the GOP is asked to forgive student loans, \"That's communism/socialism\".  \n\nThe GOP did a lot of criminal things with respect to financial fuckery during the pandemic and yet, somehow, it's Biden's fault, or it was \"woke liberals who fucked us\". No. It was the GOP.  The current increase in taxes in the US are what the GOP enacted prior to leaving office. They poisoned the well before Biden took office so they could have the public blame the Democrats for increasing taxes.\n\nOverall, wealth transfers was a GOP thing. \n\nNow, did Big Pharma make excess profits and exploit the pandemic? Abso-fucking-lutely they did. But here's the catch, does that mean they didn't produce an effective vaccine? No. They did deliver an effective vaccine. So, yeah, they ripped off the public, but they delivered the goods. So, like every US government contract, something was overvalued, shareholders made bank, but there was a useful product at the end of the day.  This is what happens when you let the private sector take control of publicly beneficial programs.  \n\nIf healthcare RnD, and healthcare in general was a publicly funded thing, then the bill for taxpayers would have been significantly lower.  Because there wouldn't have been a need to pay off shareholders, etc... again, the GOP will tell you that \"healthcare is a privilege, and fuck you if you're poor. Survival of the fittest, bitches.\"\n\nSo, multiple things can be true at once:\nWealth transfers happened and it was criminal. Big Pharma made out like bandits. Big Pharma produced a publicly beneficial product that taxpayers funded.  \n\nThe solution is quite clear: bring healthcare back into the public domain, or at the very least, ban health insurance companies, and furthermore, ALL healthcare providers and healthcare-adjent companies CANNOT be \"for profit\" entities. I.e. ALL staff work to make a product.  ALL profits go back into the company.",

The suit alleges the drugmaker misled the public when it said it had a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine.\n\nPfizer said its vaccine would prevent the transmission of Covid-19, even though the company knew it never studied the effect of its vaccine on transmission of the virus, according to the lawsuit.\n\n‚ÄúPfizer said its COVID-19 vaccine was safe even though it knew its COVID-19 vaccine was connected to serious adverse events, including myocarditis and pericarditis, failed pregnancies, and deaths,‚Äù the state wrote in the complaint.\n\nPfizer‚Äôs actions and statements relating to its Covid-19 vaccine violated the Kansas Consumer Protection Act, regardless of whether any individual consumer ultimately received Pfizer‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine, the complaint said.\n\nThe company administered more than 3.5 million vaccine doses in Kansas as of Feb. 7, 2024, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe complaint also said Pfizer maintained its own adverse events database, separate from the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a national early warning system managed by the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to detect possible safety problems in US-licensed vaccines.\n\nPfizer‚Äôs database contained cases of adverse events reported spontaneously to Pfizer, cases reported by the health authorities, and cases published in the medical literature, according to the suit.\n\n‚ÄúUpon information and belief, Pfizer‚Äôs adverse events database contained more adverse event data than VAERS because it included both information in VAERS and information not in VAERS,‚Äù Kobach wrote.\n\nPfizer in an email statement said ‚Äúthe representations made by Pfizer about its COVID-19 vaccine have been accurate and science-based‚Äù and the company ‚Äúbelieves that the state‚Äôs case has no merit and will respond to the suit in due course.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúSince its initial authorization by FDA in December 2020, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to more than 1.5 billion people, demonstrated a favorable safety profile in all age groups, and helped protect against severe COVID-19 outcomes, including hospitalization and death,‚Äù the company said.\n\nThe state seeks damages for Pfizer‚Äôs violations of the Kansas Consumer Protection Act and asks the court to order Pfizer to pay civil penalties for alleged violations of previous consent orders with the state.\n\nThe regards, as they call themselves, at r/Wallstreetbets have differing opinions about the lawsuit. Bloomberg keeps a close eye on these regards as we inverse their trades and will keep the public informed on their regarded trades in accordance with our bylaws. \n\nThe case is Kansas v. Pfizer Inc., Kan. Dist. Ct., No. unavailable, 6/17/24.",

                  "body": "lol somebody downvoted you.\n\nMore details on how badly Brownback fucked the economy, because it's both hilarious and I love pointing out what an obvious grift the GOP economic platform is.\n\nTL;DR: The tax cuts fucked the economy up so bad the GOP-dominated legislature went over Brownback's head with a supermajority vote to increase taxes, the state supreme court ruled that the budget shortfalls for public education violated the state constitution's guarantee of access to education, and the voters elected a Democrat as governor at the same time it voted for Trump by 21 points.\n\nAnyway, Brownback started off saying the massive tax cuts would be like \"a shot of adrenaline\" to the state's economy. Direct quote. After a while the damage was piling up and became impossible to deny. The budgets were falling short by hundreds of millions of dollars, job growth was worse than every neighboring state. Shocking, lowering taxes did not in fact raise taxes. *Again*. Because this isn't the first time they've \"tested\" the theory.\n\nThey know it won't work. It's not about it working, it's about their donors who want to pay less tax.\n\nSo to keep the grift going as long as possible Brownback starts lying about the lies he told originally, claiming that he \"always\" said it was going to take a long time for this to pay off. They just had to stay the course and not fix the massive, *massive* fuckup that was his tax cut, and keep delivering that value for his donors.\n\nSo they do that for a good long while, and shit just gets worse. And worse. And worse. It gets to the point where the state GOP is begging him to back down from his ruinously stupid policies. And he just won't do it. So the state GOP passes a billion dollar tax increase. The Gee Oh Pee increased taxes. In Kansas. That's how much of a problem this was. And Brownback fucking vetoes it because he has actual shit for brains and/or is fully in the pocket of the billionaires who made so, so, *sooooooo* much money from this. Luckily the legislature isn't nearly as committed to the grift as Brownback was and overrode the veto, but it wasn't enough. Public education funding dropped so low that the state supreme court ruled that it violated the state constitution. Here, I'll quote from the ruling.\n\n>We conclude the state‚Äôs public financing system, through its structure and implementation, is not reasonably calculated to have all Kansas public education students meet or exceed the minimum constitutional standards of adequacy.\n\n\"That doesn't count, it was a political ruling!\" I can hear some right wing culture warrior screeching, as they always do when the courts rule against them.\n\nYeah, no. It was a unanimous ruling. By the *Kansas* supreme court. It's not a liberal state, you don't get to use that escape hatch this time. I mean, it's dumb as fuck every other time you do it too, but this time it's even dumber than that.\n\nAnd the people of Kansas agree, Brownback was the biggest dipshit of all time. How do you think a Democrat got elected in a state that Trump carried by 15 points in 2020 and 21 points in 2016? By having her opponent be six hundred used diapers in a burlap sack named Sam Brownback.\n\nSeriously, this was such a legendarily huge fuckup they study it to understand how to not fuck up like this again. It is literally a case study in failure. Has its own wiki page, too.\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas\\_experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_experiment)",

What this means for the safety risks, particularly the possible integration of this DNA into the human genome, i.e., the risk of insertional mutagenesis, should be a secondary focus of the discussion required, which must go far beyond what could have been considered years before the so unexpected introduction of mRNA pharmaceuticals into the global market.‚Äù\n\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/2409-9279/7/3/41?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email",
