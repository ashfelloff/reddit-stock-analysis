Large cap stocks only, or even better, stick with SPY and QQQ.\n\nAlso, it helps to have a bullish bias in general because stonks do go up. The ratio of bull/bear markets are like 9:1, so it‚Äôs just common sense to want to buy calls over puts generally. I know I‚Äôll get a ton of bears calling me an idiot considering the past month has been a bear market, but believe it or not, I was able to grow that small account mostly off of calls, not puts. \n\nLast thing I‚Äôd say is to completely ignore the noise, whether it‚Äôs on reddit, webull comments, or YouTube videos. Trust the charts and the TA. Also follow price action. I was able to save my ass today by offloading calls because the price action told me Nasdaq was going to drop. \n\nIf all else fails, it‚Äôs never too late to switch to buy and hold, keep 10-15% on tripled leveraged ETFs and keep holding for a decade or two.",

Focus on steady % returns. It is almost impossible to perfectly time the market. If you even made just 1% a day or every other day that is impressive over a year as wins accumulate\n* Do not buy short expirations and out of the money (unless you want to flip a quick day trade after an unnaturally high rise or drop that clearly won't last). Mostly you should buy decently deep in the money 2-4 week calls or do LEAPS. You want to have time in case things don't go as expect to come back. It isn't as thrilling but it is much safer. And even if you lose, you significantly lose less and you can quickly make up.\n* Try to sell long before expiration. Don't let time decay eat up your earnings. Even if its a small win or loss it in some cases is better to accept it and buy new options if it gets too close\n* Volatility increases option premiums. Consider staying out until VIX and thus premiums simmer down\n* I primarily buy only around 3:45PM - close. Most often the market dumps or pumps and I often reverse it unless there is some external event that I think will make this not happen next day/morning. Even if it doesn't it usually does within a few days at most\n* I primarily sell by 10:30AM next day at least (or next best day). Most often stocks peak in a day by then. Even if they don't you still usually get a solid profit.\n* Stay away from earnings, keep up with your news/current events (stay out of the trading when there is a lot of risk), and if you plan on buying see if there are any significant economic reports the next day or coming up to be mindful of due to their potential implications on your options\n* I would take some time to learn at least some basic analysis skills such as analyzing data available to you and determining stock price valuation. It will never help you perfectly predict an irrational market, but it really can help you identify when stocks you may want to do options on are over or under valued and potentially offer an opportunity to profit off that in the near term\n* Lastly, do not trade options emotionally. When you purchase an option make sure you are doing it because you genuinely believe in your choice, not because of hype or what people online are saying. And if watching stocks constantly fluctuate makes you struggle emotionally with stress practice not looking for some time and set reminders/stop losses/whatever helps you\n\nI am sure there is more im forgetting but those are some key things that have helped me thrive",

Some say it would‚Äôve been better had he waited a day, but the way I see it is he caused that because they took the other side of that order and now are trading against the poor kid.\n\n2. Be more aggressive with your stops. Don‚Äôt take a loss for shit! Be patient. If you‚Äôre going to have a losing day, don‚Äôt let it be a big one. If your trading options, that means smaller positions. Maybe you need to go back to regular shares where the risk is easier to manage than trying to fight the theta burn at the same time.\n\n3. Practice and wait for the best trades.",

      "body": "Okay everyone, OP here.. Thanks for all the advice, especially T2Kills, that one guy who told me to charge my phone, and the surprisingly large amount of high effort responses.  I think the gist of the answers would be: 1. Clarify daily goals and loss tolerance 2. Be disciplined to follow these and step away after a loss 3. Use common sense by having a simple TA method and buying ITM or Near the money options with a far out strike date . I also liked one guys response that he only shorts on high volatility by selling appropriately dated covered calls as it comes down eventually.\n\nAnd lastly, if I don‚Äôt do these adjustment, just quit and go eat at a nice steakhouse as it‚Äôll be a better return on investment.\n\nThanks y‚Äôall, I‚Äôm checking out and getting some zzz",
