  "selftext": "I know this is a newish account, but I can't have you seeing my salacious Reddit history from my real account. However, I have a very particular stock strategy that when I do see the stars align it works out well.  So if you are sick of losing and want a nice win that should net at least 40% gains then this is the one for you.\n\nNerdwallet is a website that relies on all monetization through their website. In their most recent 10-K (you don't need to worry about it its finance stuff) they said that **\"In 2023, over 70% of all traffic to NerdWallet came organically through direct or unpaid channels.\"** they then go on to say \"**we are dependent on internet search engines particularly Google... if our search results page rankings decline for other reasons, traffic to our platform or user growth or engagement could decline, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\"**\n\nI think it's pretty clear they need Google visits for the business to survive. If you really care, you can go back through other previous earnings calls and see they mention traffic nearly every time.\n\nSo why does this matter and how do you make money? Every few months Google releases an update to their algorithm that determines how a website should show up. I know this is a massive oversimplification, so when you Google \"whats the best credit card for people with bad credit\" these companies make money when you go to their website and click through to a partner credit card offer.\n\nBut what happens when Google says NerdWallet you aren't as good as we thought you were and moves you down in rankings? For those not smart enough, if clicks go down money goes down. \n\n**So here are there expectations, to be better then Q3 of last year.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odyjnvxrlqxd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=577c772611e98c61c4033982f222e102962cdf76\n\n**But what actually happened to NerdWallet website visits over the last 12 months?**\n\nAs you can see in Q1 of last year NerdWallet was at a high point. This lead into a increased expectation of the value in Q3/Q4 last year. However, note in Q2 and Q3 they got hit by Google and lost a significant amount of web visits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/go437jjylqxd1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=f815abc08eec2d9c94a1c3ecf89a98d4e29c3ec5\n\n**What's a real World example of this?**\n\nIf you Googled \"home equity loan rates\" last year, NerdWallet would show up on the first page of the results. Now, if you Google the same thing, they aren't there. \n\n**For those of you who like numbers, what does this actually mean when comparing quarter over quarter and even year over year?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c78sdxemqxd1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=224a23e405ae9657bac99a3f7701a3307c3e48ed\n\nBecause the market is closing soon I am not even going to get into all the headwinds and losses they will also take as a result of Google AI overviews. This is only going to threaten their business over the next 18 months.\n\n**My position: 11/15 Puts @ $15**",
