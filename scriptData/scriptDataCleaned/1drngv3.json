It's cervical cancer that is very prevalent, and the HPV vaccine is 97% effective in preventing it if the vaccine is received prior to exposure, which means that it should ideally be received prior to becoming sexually active, and it requires getting as many young men and women vaccinated as possible to reduce the incidence. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the USA. Different strains of HPV are linked to most cervical cancers, genital warts, and some rare forms of cancer of the anus, vagina, penis, mouth, and throat. I certainly had my daughter and my 3 boys vaccinated, as cancer vaccines are a holy grail of preventative healthcare. As a physician, this is one simple thing that I could do to give my children and their future partners the best chances of avoiding a common and potentially catastrophic illness.",

And we shouldn’t pretend that AI has some secret sauce where it can predict how a new drug type will work in the human body. \n\nEven if it could, you’d still have to do clinical trials which are both the most expensive part and often the only part where pharma gets involved. The way science works in the US is that academic labs often work on the basic science (not basic=simple, basic=more fundamental vs. applied) so they are the ones who often come across novel molecules. \n\nPharma steps in and carries those products over the finish line when the research is 5-10 yrs away from a drug rather than 20+. \n\nSo, I think AI is and will continue to help reduce the failure rate but it’s still gonna be very high. \n\nIn the short term, the reason for optimism are the weight loss drugs which will fund companies and their research for years.",

There are companies that focus on a stage in the process like target, or optimisation or design or clinical trials, etc, and there are single companies that do all the processes.  Either way, all of them are in pharmaceuticals. \n\nThere are two things pharmas target. Best in class and first in class. Some do both and others just focus on one. Best in class is easier. \n\nWhat has been described by someone else is how AI is disrupting healthcare. Which is equally good (as long as it makes healthcare cheaper and more accessible.) All still worthy of investment.\n\nSo to my own experience.  I’ve seen the application of AI reduce the number of potential candidates. Let me explain. Done by human around 2500 potential hits are identified. All of these have to go through the (long and expensive) process to get to one or two that are good enough to take to clinical trial. Huge failure rates, big expense and a lot of time spent on so many to find that one that has the best chance of success.  With the application of AI this has been less than 250!  This means huge cost savings and a much higher chance of success. Quicker getting to the one with the highest chance of success.\n\nThere are many drugs in clinical trials discovered by AI. I worked somewhere that had a few. \n\nI’ve also seen the AI discover compounds that a human would not or a human said would never work. But it was explored all the same and testing in labs on assays it was found to have unique properties and unexpected good results. \n\nI’ve also seen AI choose a drug combination for a cancer sufferer that the consultants hadn’t thought of (this was part of a programme in Europe when all hope was lost and the patient agreed to it as a last resort).  The drugs selected by the AI extended the life of the patient. \n\nThere is more but hopefully this gives you enough of a flavour. \n\nTo the person who asked about google and pharma, look at Isomorphic.",

Here are the key points to consider:\n\n- FDA-approved treatment for Melanoma.\n- Active in 50 treatment centers with plans for further expansion.\n- Clinical studies underway to extend treatment to other cancer types.\n- Expanding manufacturing capabilities.\n- Current market cap is $2.25 billion.\n\nLooking ahead as an investor, setting a three-year goal: projecting 10,000 patients annually with $5 billion in revenue suggests a market cap around $22 billion, implying a potential 10x increase.\n\nAs an investor, the focus is on long-term growth rather than short-term fluctuations. Whether the stock moves from $8 to $80, the approach remains steady without being overly concerned about daily price movements or immediate buyout expectations. Management's focus is on sustainable long-term success, not solely on potential buyout offers. If such an offer arises, it should reflect the stock's true value and potential for sustained growth.",

I’m not trying to shill this as a no-brainer risk-free investment or anything.\n\nTreatment efficacy vs current therapies: the second-line anti-PD1 melanoma treatment approved by the FDA does not have any competing treatments. Patients receiving this therapy literally do not have any options left. It’s their last hope. Currently there’s debate in the medical community about whether or not the treatment should move up to frontline. The primary concern is the toxicity of the IL-2 treatment rather than the effectiveness. I’ve seen discussion from providers that it may be good for younger patients that can tolerate the IL-2 in a frontline setting. However, next-generation therapies in the pipeline would greatly reduce toxicity (if approved).\n\nPrice: price is $500k per treatment, in-line with CAR-T therapies. There was initial concern about approval from insurance companies but these have largely been worked out. The majority of patients are covered by medicare or their private insurance plans.\n\nLogistics: you rightly point out the logistics for this are challenging. Rather than a pill or an IV, patients must undergo surgery and then wait approximately 30 days as the treatment is developed for them. It’s capital-intensive which has been a major thesis behind shorting the launch. From keeping up with company calls and hearing the testimony of treatment providers, this seems to be going as smoothly as possible. Approved treatment centers have been ramping up and processing patients as quickly as they can, and hospitals have worked with the company on scheduling. I hate to be reductive but you either believe Iovance can handle the logistics or you don’t.\n\nGeography: the company just this week completed their European application.\n\nBuyout: the company wasn’t bought out in ph 1 or ph 2 likely for several reasons. First, as noted, this is a capital-intensive treatment vs a pill or drug. Big pharma likely wanted to see proof it’s a viable business model first. Second, previous management of this business was pretty bad. They had trouble working with the FDA, missed their own deadlines, and diluted like crazy. That’s changed with the involvement of Wayne Rothbaum, famous billionaire biotech investor. He helped turn IOVA around and now likely won’t allow a sale of the business for cheap. The goal is to fully develop the business to provide big pharma an immediately profitable bolt-on acquisition which should afford a high buyout multiple.\n\nAt this point the bear thesis mostly revolves around whether or not Iovance can pull this off on their own for long enough to be undeniably attractive to big pharma. From what I’ve seen from the data and their execution, I’m a believer, but the risks are there and obvious. It wouldn’t be trading at $2B if there weren’t uncertainties. I just think the uncertainties are overblown.",

Still, it’s an insanely complex area, even with all the information above I would still look for more before investing. \n\nSome more to think about:\n- You mention toxicity potential issue, any idea what % of patient population can tolerate IL-2? Could limit uptake\n- New pipeline therapies as competition, what kind of efficacy are they anticipated to bring, got any ph2 data to indicate? When do they launch I.e. how long have IOVA got without competition? \n- On potential use in young patients, would be potentially great value to healthcare systems if you can demonstrate long-term efficacy. But you need the evidence, have they got RCT data / label indication in below 18s?\n- European application for label doesn’t equal uptake unfortunately. They need to complete strict European HTAs to get proper market access which are notoriously resource-intensive. Good luck to a 500-person company with that\n\nDon’t think I’d follow you on this, but best of luck - looks like there’s potential but I don’t know the population/efficacy/comparators well enough.",

It's in specific companies that have been hoovering up cheap power contracts and heavy energy dense infrastructure for another lower margin use (like bitcoin mining). \n\nLook at the CORZ's Coreweave deal. Or BTBT or APLD. \n\nThis infra takes years to assemble and is the real bottleneck. Raw energy isn't that hard to get. \n\nIt's the massive gigawatt facilities that had to be started 3+ years ago, the land, the transformers, hardcore cooling systems, etc. The facilities have to be built for unprecedentedly dense compute from the start.

ASTS currently 11.50 or so per share. \n\nAST D2D 5G technology ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. AST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them 10 years to establish. Starlink are who people fear the most but they have shite tech, are largely in a diff lane - Broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. They’ve literally just said in the last year that they’re gonna get involved in D2D. \n\nAT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through agreements with MNO’s. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles providing signal). It also doesn’t include governmental/DoD contracts. \n\nSo to give you an idea of revenue potential: \n\nWe don’t know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.\n\nSo pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn’t include dead zone users, governmental contracts and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). ASTS will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price therefore you can see how Deutsche Bank are predicting such a high PT in 2027. DB forecast a share price of 650 in 2027.",
