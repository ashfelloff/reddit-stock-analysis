Then sometime later bought like 1.3k worth at 40 dollars. I then sold some other holdings to buy 13k worth of nvda this year at 80 dollars post split price. \n\nThe reason i didnt buy more was because thats all I had and didnt want to make it 100% of my portfolio. I had 17.5k and bought 2.5k of amd, nvda, intel and then 5k of microsoft, and apple because im a gamer. So i technically could have put more but that would have been regarded without hindsight. Even before i put in 13k, it was still my largest stock investment at 8.7k. I just wish i was richer when I entered the stock market :( or that I didnt pay off my student loan first. I made 20k profit at my job senior year of college and when i graduated, i also had about 20k of student loan debt so I just paid it off in full on the first payment. I didnt know debt was a good thing at 22. That woulda been another 20k. Prob would have put at least 3k more into nvda. Aka lost 100k which is alot to me just on nvda, and then microsoft and apple and amd still went up, esp amd so lost money there Intel lost but it would be like a 3k loss at best lol.\n\nF.
