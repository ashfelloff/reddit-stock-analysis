      "body": "The entire thing about this depends on whether you believe that there will be the same or more people (net) acquiring bitcoins post halving compared to now. Restricted supply of beanie babies with a larger and larger supply of buyers drove the price to the moon, but even if that supply continued to be low, then the price would still dramatically decline since the amount of new net buys slowed.\n\nIf the objective of buying Bitcoin was to make money off of someone else buying it from you, then eventually those buyers will exit their position and/or stop acquiring more (net # of Bitcoin). For the price to not drop/become completely illiquid, more buyers will need to enter the space at a continuous rate, or others will need to continue to acquire a larger and larger share of the outstanding Bitcoin to maintain the price. If the new supply is cut, but the net demand also falls, then there will be no impact on the price if they maintain equilibrium. However, if demand falls further than even the reduced new supply, then the price will begin to slowly decline even if no one that's holding sells out of their positions.\n\nThis would be the ideal scenario for a currency, as the value would stabilize to a controllable net inflow of new money supply, but would pretty much be Armageddon for speculators since they'd be holding something that will never again see a major increase and value and they'd be slowly bleeding unrealized gains. \n\nThis is why people say that Bitcoin is doomed to fail. Its end goal is incompatible with speculators, but speculators are what mostly hold and trade the currency. No speculative vehicle has withstood the test of time, especially one that has no intrinsic value beyond restricted supply, and never before has one that actually costs a lot of money to maintain existed.",

          "body": "Probably the most sensical comment on this entire thread - and I agree with you. I used to hold bitcoin until I realized that it really wasn't gaining much traction as a real currency, which is really the only value proposition. Bitcoin is not digital gold, since gold actually has value in manufacturing computer hardware and other things. You can't manufacture anything with bitcoin in the same way that you can't manufacture computer hardware with computer software. You need the materials.\n\nSo if bitcoin isn't digital gold, then the only value proposition left is as a currency. I ask people on r/cryptocurrency how to spend bitcoin, and the universal answer seems to be to buy gift cards with it, then use the giftcards to purchase things. This isn't really how currencies work though. I should be able to purchase goods with bitcoin directly without an asinine middle man gift card - but broadly, you can't. Maybe in 0.2% of stores in the US, but the majority do not accept it and probably never will. Why? Because it is far too volatile. Most merchants are already commanding a low profit margin, anywhere between 2 to 20% in most industries, and so an asset like bitcoin that could fall 10% in an hour for literally no reason will be scary as a merchant, to hold.\n\nSo they won't, which means it will not become a currency. At that point, you have to start to wonder. What is the actual value in bitcoin in the long run? There's really none, and even all the people that say blockchain can do certain things, well...technology doesn't need blockchains to do certain things just fine as they are today. You don't need a blockchain to track a deed of a house - we have companies and governments that coordinate to do this for us, with a high degree of success. You don't even need a \"hard money\" to replace the USD as the USD is doing just fine. And inflation isn't even a bad thing (as long as it is low, like 2-3% per year at most), as it incentivizes economic growth and investing. \n\nIn the long run, bitcoin will reach an all time high price that it will never hit again - its just a matter of waiting for demand to reduce enough to below the halvings' supply restrictions. But this is honestly inevitable, especially as people realize more and more en masse that it will never become a true currency.\n\nAnd I say that as someone who bought below 4k in 2018 and sold most of my position between 40-60k in 2021. I don't believe in it anymore tbh",
