White collar means professional and highly educated work. Doctors, laywers, engineers etc. They wear a white dress shirt and tie to work, hence \"white collar\"\n\nBlue collar refers to trade work and less \"esteemed\" jobs, like being an electrician or a plumber or a mechanic. Traditionally uniforms for these jobs include a darker blue shirt that doesn't show dirt quite as easily as a white one, hence \"blue collar\".\n\nIn this instance, white collar fuckery would refer to crime that rich people commit but poor people don't, like tax fraud or redlining or something.",
