In reply to @altryne asking him, \"Does it talk or is someone walkie talkie through its speakers? What do you think?\" he replied, \"Walkie Talkie.\"\n\nIn reply to Scoble's video he added, \"Found the answer - 1:13 timestamp on the video here. Engineer says there are 'assisted' which seems like another way to say teleoperated without saying teleoperated haha.\"\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/can-teslas-optimus-really-talk-what-we-know-1967628",

Elon even went so far as to say at the end of every fiscal year that people who buy tesla's will be able to rent them out as a taxi service, which is fundamentally false advertisement annually. Elon decided a while back to remove all exterior facing sensors due to cost and decided to use cameras instead so now a bug or a drop of rain can land on a lens and disrupt the entire journey.  \n\nSo now elon has 10 years of promising very specific features to investors that he simply cannot deliver so he is doubling down to attempt to con more investor interest so that he can deter any investigstion about false advertising by saying \"What do you mean the cybertruck is a scam? I have advanced robots that can give you a handy j! Some of this surely wasn't a scam!\".\n\n\nBut I would like to talk about the Russian assets history of stealing companies and ideas and supporting them with a high turnover environment and snake oil. \n\n\nElon in the 90's stole tech from a company called First Virtual Bank. First Virtual's whole thing was attempting to make the merchant side of bankings things easier digitally to enable a better consumer. So they built paypal for online retailers. Elon sniffs it out and decides he is going to open up the simple mail transfer protocol driven software to both consumers and merchants and steals everything for paypal. \n\n\nElon has always been terrible and I feel better now that I live in a world that recognizes it.",

I don’t think anyone at Tesla claimed that the robots at the event were 100% autonomous, but understandably that was what the audience kind of expected.\n\nWhen talking about the robots, Musk gave examples of such robots doing mundane tasks like watering a garden, so he was talking about a hypothetical future in which the robots are fully autonomous.\n\nAs the intern operating the robot says, some of it could be AI—like, sure, there’s possibly some things in place that prevent the robot from stumbling or tripping or falling regardless of what the vr operator is trying to do, and that’s AI.\n\nBtw, I’m not surprised they didn’t go with the augmented reality angle, which is quite impressive: a robot serving drinks requires a lot of fine motor skills regardless of being vr operated, but given that Musk wanted the whole theme to be a future in which robots walk among us unsupervised, there you have it. But imagine you being able to teleoperate one such a robot from thousands of miles away to virtually visit a place while being able to interact with the things surrounding the robot.
