It’s also horrendous for inequality where low rates just tell every property hoarder to simply re-leverage and acquire more - ultimately resulting in higher costs to purchase/rent. Every company gets bloated and tries to build the next currency/metaverse/useless AI tools. Markets rage and push returns further into the future. \n\nIt’s a great cycle to capitalize on high paying jobs and expand assets if you have a good starting point to begin with. Average worker however gets fucked and inevitably stops the consumption where those returns are suppose to come from. \n\nAs someone in his 30s, the thought of a plateaued decade kinda sucks.
