  "selftext": "The CEO of 23andMe Anne Wojcicki (Sergei Brin ex-wife, ARod ex-girlfriend, and Susan Wojcicki current sister) just announced her intention to buy the company out and go private: [https://investors.23andme.com/node/9436/html](https://investors.23andme.com/node/9436/html)\n\n`In April 13, 2024, Ms. Wojcicki notified members of the special committee (the \"Special Committee\") of the Board that she is considering making a proposal to acquire the Issuer in a potential go-private transaction. Ms. Wojcicki indicated that she was working with advisors and intended to begin speaking to potential partners and financing sources. Ms. Wojcicki stated that any proposal by her would be conditioned irrevocably upon the approval of the Special Committee and a majority of the unaffiliated stockholders of the Issuer. Ms. Wojcicki also indicated that she wishes to maintain control of the Issuer and, therefore, will not be willing to support any alternative transaction. There can be no assurance that the foregoing will result in any transaction or any other strategic alternative and or whether or when any of the foregoing may happen.`\n\nAt the same time, the company has an anti-cancer drug due to complete clinical trials on July 30, 2024\n\n[https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/27/2750742/0/en/23andMe-Announces-Poster-Presentations-on-23ME-00610-an-Investigational-Antibody-Targeting-CD200R1-at-The-Society-for-Immunotherapy-of-Cancer-s-SITC-2023-Annual-Meeting.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2023/09/27/2750742/0/en/23andMe-Announces-Poster-Presentations-on-23ME-00610-an-Investigational-Antibody-Targeting-CD200R1-at-The-Society-for-Immunotherapy-of-Cancer-s-SITC-2023-Annual-Meeting.html)\n\nIf this cancer trial comes out with positive results, the current market cap of 172.06 million dollars would be an egregious undervaluation.\n\nIn 2023, the anti cancer monoclonal drug KeyTruda *made $25 billion in sales*\n\nNow if this CEO knows something we do not, then she must be screwing over investors who have been bagholding on this SPAC turd for the past 3 years by trying to go private right before some spicy announcements when the current stock price is in the fucking gutter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is a golden opportunity. Buy ME and either make it as expensive as possible for a management buy-out to happen, or failing at that, harvest the gains from cancer drug development.\n\n&#x200B;",

There are two ways this plays out:\n\n* They do a reverse split to get the price back above $1. Generally speaking, reverse splits are not a good sign and typically just provides more runway for further stock price erosion.\n\n* They let the company be delisted, decreasing stock liquidity, and letting it drift lower and buy stock back and take the company private for pennies on the dollar. \n\nOne might ask *\"Why not buy puts?\"* Well, those puts are basically untradeable when the stock is delisted. \n\nEither way, ~~stockholders~~ bagholders lose.",

The percentage of drug candidates that make it to Phase 3 trials, much less succeed, is single digit of all Phase 1/Phase 2 drugs.
