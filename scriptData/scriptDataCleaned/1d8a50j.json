              "body": "OP specifically asked about hedging not selling. And the answer is obvious, you'd buy puts. That's literally what they were made for. Since he has 4000 shares, to hedge all of it, he'd need 40 puts.\n\n$1000 2025 puts are ~7k a pop, $900 ~4.2k and $800 is ~2.4k. So anywhere from ballbark to 96k to 280k dollars to hedge this position into next year. Doesn't matter what happens with NVDA, with the hedge he will be able to always sell his shares at a decent price and still has the upside.",

                  "body": "The only issue with this plan is it involves having $100k-$300k cash for insurance on your position. I know this guy has $4 million in stock, but he bought it for less than 50k so there's not really any indication he's got hundreds of thousands of dollars lying around. \n\nAnother options is sell calls. I know this means there's a chance he sells everything if they hit, but with the amount he's got he could stagger them with like 10 x 1300 September calls, 10 x 1400 calls and 10 x 1500 January calls. Each of those net $100k and if they all hit he sells 3k shares for $4.2M and still has 1000 shares kicking around. If none of them hit then he got $300k, which is 6x his initial investment. Dude could live large on covered calls and just be a regular rich person if enough of them hit. Could even use the call money to buy some puts if he's real concerned it might dip.\n\nIt really depends how much of this guys net worth is tied up in this.",

However this position won and there is no need to be this concentrated. \n\nSell 90% of your holdings tomorrow on the open. You will be left with 400 shares, this is still a substantial holding at 440k. \n\nThe other roughly 4.1m you invest based on your situation in life. Large/mid/small cap mix with bonds. Id probably also allow if you were my client to keep a good 400k in cash to do with as you please to invest in whatever you want to invest in because you clearly had a good eye. But the vast majority of your wealth would be locked in boring shit and allowed to grow. You're Nvidia position being a large concentration would still likely grow as well. But if for some reason it gets wrecked it would be a 10% hit instead of a massive life changing wipe out. \n\nMy advice would change depending on your debt status, housing status, etc.",
