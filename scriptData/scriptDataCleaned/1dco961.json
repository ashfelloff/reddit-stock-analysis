  "score": 172,
  "selftext": "Regarding Musk's $56 billion pay package, should Tesla shareholders BEFORE approving FIRST demand from Musk to give written, legally-binding guarantees on how precisely he wants to develop AI at Tesla and explain how his other company xAI won't compete with Tesla? \n\nI think it's problematic Musk diverted nVidia chips paid with Tesla money to his other company xAI and will allow xAI to use those chips till at least end of 2024. That will benifit xAI but not necessarily Tesla.  \n\nI honestly think retail investors in Tesla should vote NO on the pay package and first get more legal guarantees from Musk regarding Tesla's AI future. Stock dilution is another problem.",

Look at it on a 5 year chart, and it's not as bad. \n\nI agree, he's currently doing a bad job, and any other CEO would be looking at a chopping block perhaps. But he also popped the stock up 20% giving a speech at a garbage ER. You miss my point. I'm not saying he's doing a good job, I'm saying the \"I hate Elon\" cult on reddit often brings nothing of value to the table and it's a bit of pot and kettle.",

                  "body": "Roughly speaking there are two issues with the pay package. First, the  package is in huge excess of what other CEO's make. Second, the board has a duty to negotiate a fair pay package on behalf of the shareholders. They have not done so, and instead they are basically giving Elon everything he is asking for. \n\nThe common counter argument is that shareholders voted to approved this pay. But this fails to note that while shareholders get to vote on the package, they can only vote to approve or reject the pay. The failure of the board results in a \"hostage\" situation. They can vote to give Elon the pay package, but in doing so they are arguably greatly overpaying Elon. Alternatively they can vote to reject the pay and risk Elon leaving, which could tank the value of the stock.\n\nA functioning independent board would negotiate a fair compensation package with Elon. One that is on par with what other CEO's make. Elon has  a right to earn a fair compensation from his work as CEO. He does not have the right to use his ownership and influence over the board to inflate his compensation far and above what is reasonable.",
