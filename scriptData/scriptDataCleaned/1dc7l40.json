So this guy is always trying to raise money and is fully distracted from his other ceo jobs. Plus why is he trying to raise money all the time he should be able to fund any startup idea on earth with money from his couch cushions. \n\nI think he has some major insecurities because he’s not the founder of companies but always says he is, so he probably feels like he needs to found at least one company for real instead of just buying companies and taking credit.",

He lost in court\n\nEven more recently he told NVDA to prioritize chips to his AI company over TSLA\n\nThis is almost undoubtedly bc of his feud over his bonus package. He’s esstbailly said as much. He said if he wasn’t given 25% of the company he would start his own AI company not under the TSLA umbrella \n\nBut the chip prioritization is a break of his duties as CEO of TSLA and he’s being called out for it and there’s a non 0 chance he could end up sued over all this\n\nSo he is likely with this tweet making a pretty public statement that he is maintaining his fiduciary responsibility while also kind of threatening to take his AI company public. \n\nDude really wants his bonus package.
