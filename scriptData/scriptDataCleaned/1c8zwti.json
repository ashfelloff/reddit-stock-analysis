I think it’s fund managers pulling risk off the table due to tech earnings starting this week, and Israel and Iran saber rattling, especially the latter.\n\nVolatility noticeably increased (seems to have doubled, on SPY at least) after the Israel/Iran fiasco began. The spikes in gold and oil confirm this, too. Oil pops off when war potentially breaks out, and gold pops off whenever there’s uncertainty around foreign exchange currency pairs and what lies ahead. A flight to certainty before you reevaluate putting risk back on the table\n\nIn a real potentially recessionary environment (e.g. what we saw in 2022) you’d see gold selling off, and you’d see oil selling off doubly so.\n\nThis looks more like what we saw in early 2023 when Russia first started its special Ukraine operation",

              "body": "Yup. Baby Boomers are often considered the luckiest financial generation.\n\nNope.  They were biggest voting block in American History.  Guess what they voted for: \n\n1970’s Inflation reduction when they were young and building lives.\n\n1980’s Economic Expansion, lower interest rates, and deficits when they were ready for houses and needed more supply and lower mortgage rates.\n\n1990’s Sound financial policy to build surpluses when it looked like social security, pensions, and sound money would be the most beneficial to them.  Notably, only surpluses in American History were then. \n\n2000’s deficit spending to enforce stable mono-polar world and globalization to make non-house things cheaper once they were established.  No one in the middle class gave a damn about China except cheap.\n\n2010’s ZERP to repair the Internet Crash and GFC to fuel a back half decade stock market rally to repair their 401(k)’s once it became clear that asset inflation helped them more than sound money.\n\n2020’s Massive debt spending and monetary expansion right up until their peak retirement years.  Immediately followed by massive\nRising Interest Rate policy to hold off inflation, oh, and look at that.  Fixed Income paying substantially right as they needed to retire and sell their stocks.  Literally their peak retirement year hit as Interest Rates skyrocketed.  If you call that luck you haven’t been paying attention.\n\nThey didn’t get lucky.  They voted for leadership and policies that helped their generation and didn’t care that it screwed anyone/everyone else.  They always won by virtue of their size.  Democrat vs Repub/Urban vs Rural was a smokescreen for the marginal upper class baby boomer voters oscillating to the policy that helped them the most.  They didn’t turn into Yuppies from Hippies out of a change in perspective as they got older.  They marginally voted their collective wallets every step of their way.\n\nI’m Gen X born to the Silent Generation.  My generation, the Millennials, and Gen Z weren’t less lucky.  The massive Baby Boomers strip mined the wealth the Silent Generation built out of Depression and War, then left those behind them with the financial cleanup.  \n\nI am shocked when I hear some of them talk about how lazy and unmotivated the millennials are.  No shit asshole they aren’t having kids and buying houses.  You created zoning laws for them that created a housing crisis.  Fuckers.  No respect for them.\n\nEDIT: I should have added that the state budgets covered most of college costs for their generation - about 70/30.  The slow bleeding of that is pointed toward the federal expansion of student loan programs.  While true, who was the biggest beneficiary of that?  The Baby Boomer generation that had college mostly paid for and whose kids weren’t going to college during the next 25 years while the states cut college funding to the bone.  They got their college paid for by the prior generation and voted not to pay for the next generation. Asshats and greed bags that abandoned the Greatest generation’s belief in building a better world for the next generation along the way.",

Vacation spots and restaurants are seeing a decline in traffic in many places or are otherwise reflecting on credit card statements.  \n\nWith few exceptions, there are not many who can accurately spot a pending recession because each one is unique. The last one was largely fueled by subprime lending; the pending one is being fueled by savings liquidation to buy “all cash” and buyers who appear creditworthy because current measures are positively skewed due to generous pandemic related aid and legislation.\n\nEveryone is living large and doing great before a recession ;)",

There would need to be some sort of financial crash/crisis (or otherwise something to unwind the job market and slow production) to cause a recession, and at this point there is no clear culprit. Even the long awaited collapse of commercial realestate wouldn't do it.\n\nBut boomer will keep cashing out, but they won't just outright sell. They've seen too many bubbles and pullbacks and have likely lost too much money by leaving the market to \"make that mistake again\".",

The millennials have the population numbers ( similar to the boomers ) . Can the millennials carry the weight for the next 15 years with gen Z somehow filling in the gap ? The boomers have 20 years roughly left to live so who really knows how all of this affects the stock market . . I think we have a couple years of upside left in the stock market as the tail end of the boomers and Gen X begin spending less and less which creates a snowball of less and less corporate earnings.\n\nThe stock market is presently showing some oversold readings so I would not be a seller at this time. Longer term I'm beginning to question how all this plays out.",
