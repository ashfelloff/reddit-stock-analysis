Also just how sharp everything is.  The water on earth makes dust and sand and everything smoother and less troublesome to get on you.  It makes everything cleaner here.  Mars is just so dirty, and that dirt gets into everything, even as you try your best to create an inside safe space.  \n\nI used to think the radiation problem for mars was game over, but there is an achievable scientific solution to that for ships and the planet as well.  \n\nI ask people, for a billion dollars, would you go to Mars, but you can never come back (though you can influence earth from there).
