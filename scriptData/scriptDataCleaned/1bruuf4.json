If you maintain these numbers for the entire year, you would achieve about a 22% return. That's not bad, considering the market moved sideways between May and June.\n\nHowever, I wouldn't take this as a sign of mastery. You've only been trading for a couple of months, exclusively using TSLA stock, during a period when the market was moving sideways. You need to test your strategy under various conditions as well.\n\nBy the way, looking at the stock during that period, you would have made a 59% return in those two months had you bought it on the day of your first trade and sold it on the date of your last recorded trade. But, of course, this is with the benefit of hindsight.",
