  "selftext": "\nHELLO I HAVE A $136K margin call due to a credit call spread on MRNA I opened last week. I'm not worried about it. \n\nHere is why:\n\n\n\nThe stock has rallied from about $100 to $170 on a couple non-sensical things.\n\n1) Moderna \"lost\" a markman hearing against ABUS. Markman hearings are not super important, it's basically the judge defining what's actually going on in a patent litigation, the definitions, the claims, etc, so that the actual hearing doesn't get too tangential. But the way the claims were defined make it almost certain ABUS will win in court. If they win, MRNA will owe ABUS somewhere in the range of $1 to $7 BILLION.  just depends what % Royalty the hearing ultimately decides what's fair. BUT THE STOCK SHRUGGED THIS OFF. Likely a crowded short that didn't go down because it's a markman... not down? Then up! Shorts covered.\n\n2) RSV vaccine approval not assured. The efficacy of mrna rsv vaccine is not the best, GSK and pfizer have RSV vaccines, and depending on what time point you look at, mrna is either the middle or the worst. https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Announces-Update-on-Investigational-RSV-Vaccine/default.aspx\n\nThe fda delayed their PDUFA approval to the end of the month. I assume it'll get approved, but that approval is already priced in, it was priced in at $80... (were at $160).\n\n3) h5n1 bird flu. This is an obvious covid play book. Mrna went crazy during covid. Bird flu is scary. But mrna, right? Wrong.\n\nHUGE different here, most importantly, WE HAVE BIRD FLU VACCINES APPROVED FOR H5N1. There's 3. \nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1_vaccine\n\n[Here is the NBC article discussing the same](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna149961)\n\nSo people are buying MRNA as a covid-like play, but there is no reason any government will give mrna a stock piling money now - they'll give it to the APPROVED VACCINES (HINT: THEY ARENT MRNA)\n\n4) ASCO conference for their \"cancer vaccine\". This is a whole rabbit hole that would take a long time to explain, but in early June Moderna and merck will present updated data to their mrna vaccine in melanoma. It's a relatively small follow up where we already know the outcome. It \"worked\" but it's unlikely to work in a very large trial.\nPeople think that the results are so good that Merck (and moderna) will file for accelerated approval to the FDA. That's not going to happen. It's too small a trial in too early of a disease setting. As such they will have to run a very large Phase 3 trial. Moderna has been telling investors they can file on accelerated approval, but if you ask Merck, they say no lol, that would be preposterous. \nThe ASCO event is a non-event, but people apparently think it's a big deal. But we already know it \"worked\" in this early trial. This update isn't going to change anyone's opinion and isn't meaningful for approval.\n\nAs you can see, every reason MRNA is up is actually at best priced in when it was $80. But some of these catalysts are actually quite negative (ABUS markman hearing).\n\n*MRNA burns $1b a quarter.*\n\n\nEven if approved, the RSV vaccine will be mediocre at best, likely quite sluggish and not meaningful to topline.\nASCO cancer vaccine update is a non event and if no accelerated approval, that's very negative for the stock here.\nABUS will win in 2025 and mrna will owe them probably 4-5 billion dollars (they won't have that much cash then!) \n\nThe long term puts (2025 and 2026) are quite cheap, given this stocks fair value in my opinion is probably $60.\n\n**GLTA except mrna bulls.
