Exact specific 15 years time frame left to live and its game over? Returns are still better than any pension i ever analyzed.\n\nBut for example 15 years is up and you just take out the money on day 1 and blow it all on hookers and blackjack? Its more advisable to take the money as you need it and leave the rest to still grow.\n\nA good financial analyst i met once outlined a plan where once a person dies he could be richer than the day he retired. So technically the calculations wouldn't stop at retirement day as all money wouldn't be withdrawn day 1 but just a specific portion and rest left to still accumulate.\n\nStarting investing at 36 there is still 24 years till 60 that would catch both lost decade and an insane one. Governments wants us to work till 75 these days till state pension, that would make for 39 years in market, really also depends on a day when one after calculations can retire. Obviously start early and get the coochie early, but life is not nice to everyone.\n\nIts even better to compare it with your countries pension plans as well, they will take your money, yeet it and bunch of indexes of stocks and bonds and what not and their own bank, take up to entire 1% fee for it and in my countries return around 0.5% past 4 years, then they will take your own money and pay you back in small pieces and call it a pension.

They will take the most pessimistic option like its actually possible for them to win the lottery and invest in exact years of no returns, never before or after, somehow passing triple digit returns before and after.\n\nI really don't have to explain how past 16 years i have not seen this as realistic outlook what so ever?

During the dot-com bubble, there was a less publicized bubble in telecommunications companies. This estimated $2 trillion bubble ended in a similar bloodbath with the bankruptcies of companies like WorldCom and Global Crossing.\n\n> Before the bubble burst, telecom companies raised $1.6 trillion on Wall Street and floated $600 billion in bonds to crisscross the country in digital infrastructure. These 80.2 million miles of fiber optic cable represented fully 76 percent of the total base digital wiring installed in the United States up to that point in history and would allow for the maturation of the internet. And because of a resulting glut of fiber in the years after the dot-com bubble burst, there was a severe overcapacity in bandwidth for internet usage that allowed the next wave of companies to deliver sophisticated new internet services on the cheap. By 2004, the cost of bandwidth had fallen by more than 90 percent, despite internet usage doubling every few years. As late as 2005, as much as 85 percent of broadband capacity in the United States was still going unused. That meant as soon as new “killer apps” were developed, there was plenty of cheap capacity allowing them to roll out to the masses. The tracks, as it were, had already been laid.\n\nSemis are cyclicals, and GPUs are infrastructure. Welcome to the dotcom bubble 2.0: smart money already knows.\n\nhttps://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ais-600b-question/\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/technology/top-goldman-sachs-analyst-warns-on-ai-bubble-but-likes-nvidia-infrastructure-plays/\n\n> In the \"Top of Mind\" report, Covello added: \"How long investors will remain satisfied with the mantra that 'if you build it, they will come' remains an open question. The more time that passes without significant AI applications, the more challenging the AI story will become. And my guess is that if important use cases don't start to become more apparent in the next 12 to 18 months, investor enthusiasm may begin to fade.\"",

      "body": "I think the issue is there will always be a 30% correction coming. Timing it is incredibly difficult and the math says that in most cases being way early is just as bad or worse than being terribly late. \n\nHaving said that I think most of the correction will be in the high growth stocks when it happens and I think everyone would be smart to always have some cash held back for discounts. With that in mind I think the smart move would be to take profits regularly and keep a decent amount in a money market account or short term treasury etf. The goal shouldn't be to get the absolute best outcome, but to avoid getting the worst outcomes. \n\nMy guess is we are probably still a ways off from the eventual top. It could be a days, but it could also be quite a few months. My guess though is we are possibly already above the bottom that we will eventually drop to. If the top is soon I bet we will go back to Oct 23 lows. If it is still a ways off we will drop to April 24 lows. The difference between those two is large. Now before anyone jumps up and takes shots at me over that please look at 1995-2009. There was a good stretch of time in the 1998-99 where we were above the low that would be visited in 2002. And then there is the issue of the low in the GFC. There is huge stretch of time of quite a few years where we were above that low. I wouldn't suggest to anyone they exit the market and wait for a low like that one. It wouldn't make sense. \n\nYounger investors should just ride it out. Middle aged investors probably should hold back a bit more cash or have a bit more dividends going on to help smooth over things, and people on the verge of retirement should probably be tilting their portfolio more and more towards cash flow over long term growth.",
