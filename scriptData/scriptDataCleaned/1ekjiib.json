A standard model is like double the price. You can say more features, safer etc. but it's still 19 or 20k to buy a 7 year old car. Saving that kind of money doesn't happen quick.\n\nHousing, can't even put into words how ridiculous it's gotten here. I'm locked out of the shittiest of apartments.\n\nBasically it feels like there's absolutely no value in anything anymore. You are just wringed for every cent in anything you do.

Surprised Im down just 1% after all of that. \n\nI bought meta, google, nvda, amzn, avgo, vti. The nvda/avgo bounce was super sweet.\n\nSucks some people couldnt get their brokerage to wrok on the dip. I was having some lagging on fidelity and had to log in again a few times, but I was able to get the buys in with some persistence.\n\nI dont know how to feel about the dip in the next few weeks. On one hand, this seemed like a classic overreaction. On the other hand, it could be a longer term downtrend due to all these companies reporting negatively especially in the retail sector, which would then affect companies like google and meta as a part of their business, and Im hearing about more layoffs coming, for example at CVS, and we just heard intel doing the same.\n\nMy poor gambling old self would have bought calls this morning and sold at lunch, but Im up 170% ytd so no need to do risky stuff like that anymore. Im just going to let the sheer net worth carry my profile from here.",

Any US based brokerage (Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard, Robinhood, ...) will offer your typical ETFs like VOO, VTI, VT, etc. It's the mutual fund or Target Date Retirement Funds you might find restrictions on depending on which brokerage you use.\n\nOnly thing to ask is if you're okay taking such a market neutral POV on global diversification. The advantage of VTI + VXUS (or VOO + VXUS) is you have control over the allocation to the rest of the world. VT is just whatever the weights are today (like 60/40). On the other hand, perhaps such a diversified POV is best for someone older in age.\n\nAnd I'll just re-iterate what I said below: you don't need to buy VT *and* VOO/VXUS etc., you're just getting more overlapping funds since VT is literally the whole world. The person above is suggesting to basically go all in VT (which is fine).\n\n(There are people who unironically will own portfolios like 20% VOO, 20% VTI, 20% VT, 20% VXUS, 20% QQQ)",

Not all of course, but some stocks. I had transferred money to RH last night and was ready to buy in the morning.  But within 5 minutes of market open stocks I was looking at had recovered to levels that I didn't want to invest in. So it was not just me who was ready to buy.
