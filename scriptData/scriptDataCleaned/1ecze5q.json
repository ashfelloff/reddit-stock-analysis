If we don't go there now even though we‚Äôre capable of doing so, then we will be blamed by our descendants. If others go there, then they will take over, and you won‚Äôt be able to go even if you want to. This is reason enough. *-Ye Peijian, head of China's Lunar Exploration Program*\n\nA lot of powerful countries are suddenly interested in lunar exploration and moon bases and it's not because they've all discovered a sudden love of planetary science. Space was already known to be critical for national defence with the importance of GPS, communication satellites, and spy satellites; the war in Ukraine underlined this by showing what Starlink enabled soldiers and drones could do; launch costs have decreased significantly with the advent of reusable rockets and will decrease further as they improve; and the moon is strategic territory in all this.\n\nThe southern polar region of the moon is thought to have large quantities of water that can be used to make fuel and propellant for spacecraft and having this in a shallow gravity well is very useful. I won't belabour the point but that stuff is very important for anything you do in space and it's much easier to get it into space from the moon than from Earth. There are also only a few strategic places on the moon that are good for that: you need perpetually shadowed craters (basically only at the south poll) and preferably you also need some ridges that can get good sunlight too (there are seasons on the moon that are relevant at high latitudes, since you get darkness or light for half the year, but some places can actually get good sunlight despite the darkness of the lunar winter, if I remember correctly).\n\nThere's also the issue of time. If you look up talks and interviews with civilian and military people who are concerned about this kind of thing they'll say whoever gets there first (i.e. the moon, or more specifically the strategic parts of the moon) will get to establish the norms of what happens there. So if China shows up first and takes all the good territory and sets the standards for how countries behave up there, the US would be on the back foot. Some people in powerful and influential positions are really, really worried that China will treat the moon like the South China Sea.\n\nSo for me the thesis for a company like Intuitive Machines comes down to national defence. NASA is specifically helping private moon companies develop with their CLPS (commercial lunar payload services) program similar to how they helped SpaceX and others develop with their COTS (commercial orbital transportation services) program. (Slightly off topic but I saw I think a former director of NASA say once that they actually wanted to do this via prizes for reaching certain milestones like Google's lunar X-Prize back in the day, but NASA legally couldn't do that, so they came up with CLPS instead.)\n\nSo yeah, admittedly, the purely commercial play is hard to see. Lunar resources are something that's being worked on (look up Interlune for instance) but it seems speculative, and it's hard to imagine getting a 20 billion company from ferrying science projects to the lunar surface.\n\nBut if there's one thing the US spends money on it's defence and I think Intuitive Machines knows this. Look up interviews with their CEO about his vision for the future of the company and you'll see him say over and over again that he wants IM to be the Lockheed Martin of the moon. The comparison to a defence contractor isn't an accident.\n\nSome videos if you're interested (sorry I can't link them directly without being automodded, but you can search them, they're from the \"Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies\" if you can't find them):  \n\n*Policy Paper Release: Securing Cislunar Space and the First Island Off the Coast of Earth*   \n\n*Cislunar Space: The Latest Zone of Competition in the Space Race*",
