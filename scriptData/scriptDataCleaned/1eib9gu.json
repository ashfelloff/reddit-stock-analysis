Intel stock dips way below 27, now I can sell them stock and take the difference as profit. Vice versa with calls instead of puts. options trades generally have higher risk and reward than just owning stock, your contract could expire worthless after the expiration date, or you could 100x your money because you bought some dumb options for very cheap, and then the stock moves enough that your previously almost worthless options become worth something.\n\nBut anyways smart people use it to hedge against stocks falling too much and stuff like that, WSB regards use it as a 10x or nothing button",
