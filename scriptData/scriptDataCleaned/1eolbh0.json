      "body": "Question. Say I sell shares when it's priced high and buy back when it goes down. My avg price gets fuct, but I can skim profits or rebuy for extra shares. My question is, will the irs think I sold 3500, then 3650, then 3800, 4k etc, or will they tax me on the 4k of the very last sale. Bc I didn't make 11k just whatever gained from 3500 to 4k. I don't wanna run into april and have them say you made 145k when the bag I'm finally holding is 25k. If that makes sense. Anyone have any experience or input. Greatly appreciated to know if I gotta change my strategy.",
