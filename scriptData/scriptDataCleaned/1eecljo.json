                  "body": "Maybe, I think it's more of a 'to each their own thing'. The insults are the focus though for the 'running gag'.\n\nTo me, it's teenage bullshit talking, or busting balls, for the lols behavior. It is normally pretty pee-pee poo-poo disgusting shock type humor. Part of that whole high school culture is, or was, gossip and making fun of others mistakes or misfortunes. Normally part of that is taking what you dish out, and you should 100% expect retaliation. It's all supposed to be in good fun though. Sometimes it's used as a coping mechanism.  \n  \nI think your degenerate part works, but the 'know anything' is a bit off (just my opinion). Everyone knows the odds are against you gambling, and anyone who does it is considered a fool yet to be parted with their money.... yet we do it anyway in various forms. So knowing that, but doing it anyway is counterintuitive or hypocritical. Margin options as a shortcut to true DD + time + risk management for profits definitely meets the definition.\n\n  \nI don't think everyone here is dumb, I think this is their vice to be risky for that slight high hope of making a lot of money from a small amount. It's a way to justify the gambling and losing cash to a risky 'play'. I mean, normal people have their vices and that can be considered a 100% loss for enjoyment. At least with ours we might make some cash? Well like any good addict that's just a justification. Might as well enhance the whole thing and have some extra fun by joking around. For that you need to go to a place with others like you, and here it is. It also helps to laugh if you feel terrible, miserable, sad, dumb, etc. We also cheer on the winners we wish was us, but give some shade in the form of FU.\n\nI do think this place attracts inexperienced people who are looking to make money fast, and that might be the leading type of person making the loss posts. I think it also attracts people who want to make fun of wallstreet for 'supposedly' being a thing you can 'invest' in.\n\nSo if you ever bought a call you knew would most likely expire worthless, well, you are one of us. One of us! ONE OF US! Now grab your apron and Wendy's hat. You gots to make up that loss! We are stationing you by the order speaker because it's broken.
