  "selftext": "If Yellow Corporation's common stock is ultimately worth ZERO at the end of its Chapter 11 proceedings (causing the U.S. Government and 4+ hedge funds to lose all of their investments), why has YELLQ consistently gained over 1,800% since last July and now holds steady above $8 per share? I welcome all genuine, factual replies. Troll account misinformation attempts and union-backed (posturing) comments will no longer be responded to.  Yellow's massive % rise firmly places the company in the top five performing American stocks of recent years.  📈\n\nThis is a very rare bankruptcy story of \"Assets Over Liabilities\" and the jury is clearly out on which way professional/institutional investors believe the equity will go in the future.  Naysayers who cannot back their own theses with details & facts should never be listened to.  The unusual (significant undervaluation) situation essentially makes Yellow Corp the Hertz of 2023/2024, but on steroids!  Predicted asset sale and future cash flow numbers show real potential for a share price of $18+ in the coming months, as the company continues property sales and works through validating the many unsecured claims.  *Yellow finished paying off ALL of its secured debt (incl DIP lender financing and 2020's CARES Act loan) back in February.  They were formerly the fifth largest transportation company in North America and nation’s 2nd largest LTL freight carrier, behind only FedEx Freight. \n\n$YELLQ ",

If you can add a pallet going 200 miles onto a load going 600 miles and spend an extra half hour loading and unloading it you've added some nice profit to you a trip that was already profitable.\n\n\nBut when you look at Swift or CFI they are going from point A to point B with no extra stops in between to mix the freight.\n\n\nSo there's profit here that OTR companies aren't making because ITR company pay their drivers by the mile and give a piddly extra stop pay. If they tried to add an extra half hour to a driver whose already working a lot of free hours then they are going to get resistance.\n\n\nYellow doesn't have that problem.\n\n\nAnd now they are debt free and able to concentrate on expanding in a country that is going to build out it's industrial and manufacturing capacity over the next ten years.\n\n\nBut they already have infrastructure and experience in place. \n\n\nHaving thought this out I'm going to go look for an entry.",
