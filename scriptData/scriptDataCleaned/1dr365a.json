With the predatory practice of PBMs (and recently GoodRx), Walgreens will lose money on every prescription that they fill (due to shit reimbursement rate and clawbacks). They have been relying on their photo department to pay for the overhead. Yes, the fucking PHOTO department, in 2024! Their direct competitor, CVS, has their own fucking PBM and their profit margin is still shit (like 1.2% or worse). How the fuck is  Walgreens gonna turn a profit without a PBM?\n\n18 Oct $10 Put ",
