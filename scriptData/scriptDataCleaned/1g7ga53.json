      "body": "AI clusters are completely different than legacy data centers. \n\nLegacy companies have tons of low power density properties. That's great for stuff like delivering Netflix. AI compute is the exact opposite. \n\nThey haven't been multibaggers because they're like a legacy auto business with an EV division bolted on. They're not a pure play. \n\nThat's why the AI data center multibagger darling is a converted Ethereum miner called Corweave (private company unfortunately). \n\nCorweave jumped between gold rushes because they had the energy, land, and power density. They were in the business of dense GPU compute just as Ethereum switched from Proof of Work and AI ramped up.\n\nThey made a landmark hosting deal with Core Scientific which is a publicly traded Bitcoin miner which would be the closest proxy bet if they keep adding more AI contracts. Other miners like Iren have smaller deals with AI firms like Poolside.\n\nYou really want power dense assets that aren't currently doing AI but could transition from a lower margin business and massively reprice up. \n\nMost importantly hyperscalers want that energy *now*. Nuclear facilities and new utility hookups have years long backlogs. Miners have the energy and locations today. \n\nRight now Bitcoin miners are the most obvious play I know of in this respect. \n\nThe miners have hoarded real land, energy, and infrastructure assets which can have a *huge* re-rating if they get an AI compute contract like CORZ did with Coreweave, APLD with NVDA, or get bought out by a hyperscaler. WULF popped recently after the nuclear deals due to their proximal nuclear assets. \n\nThey also have major convex exposure to BTC. That's because you're paying for their mining margin with these stocks (which also makes them super volatile). \n\nFor example, if they are making 10k per BTC mined at 50K, and BTC spikes to 100k, they are suddenly making 60k per BTC mined. Or 6x the margin for a 2x BTC price increase. \n\nThere are risks of course. Execution risk, dilution risk, geographic risk, BTC price risk, etc. But when their energy infra valuations are near book value during an energy gold rush and BTC is lagging the QQQ's currently they have huge upside asymmetry on two fronts, imo.",

A lot less convexity than you'd want for exposure, but I think asset management is the least considered play (and potentially the most stable) for data centers.",

The thinking is if people want to hold BTC then hold BTC, BITI, or MSTR while they just invest into more mining or AI capex. \n\nOf course a BTC reserve can boost returns in a big BTC run. So there's a tradeoff at different times and each miner has their own strategy. Some have more exotic strategies like BTBT who sells for Ethereum and then stakes the ETH for a yield. BITF does some stuff with options. \n\nThe other nice thing about AI is a diversified income stream. So even in a BTC bear they have cashflow to smooth out BTC returns which can be boom & busty.",
