NVDA... i kept feeling like i missed the train. my only NVDA play was a put. And for those wanting a column for puts or calls i just put parentheses on the tickers that i bought puts on\n\n2. i only exercised a big AAPL and a big WULF one on accident because i forgot about the exp date. i sold the next day because it basically drained all of my cash. so essentially same gains as if i just sold to close the calls. \n\n3. Hot damn.. enough on the colors. i added it last min and didnt even think about your tiny brains not being able to just spot a trend and ignore the color yellow for 5 seconds\n\n4. in terms of strategy... a lot of these losers are from stupid DD posts on this thread. most of the winners are just from me thinking a stock got unfairly beat up after a piece of news. like the LOGI calls for 405% were just because the stock tanked after the submarine imploded. the media blamed a logitech controller and i thought that was regarded so i bought short term calls back to their average and it printed prettty quick (69 days)\n\n5. i have owned a bunch of stocks for a long time and didnt want to show total portfolio value because it sort of takes away from only the options activity. have roughly $650k in the market right now and try not to have more than $30k in options exposure at any given time. \n\n6. Lastly... i just let the losers run to expiration because im hoping for big news and then i forget to sell them. For the winners, i lost out a lot on being greedy but many times when its over 100% i will take out my investment and just roll with the house money. most of the time these -%100 positions were up considerably well before exp and i was too greedy to sell and take some money off the table. \n\nHope that helps or explains some of the questions ive been getting ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4276)",

Instead of realizing  a normal investor's 20% gains over the period, you have realized 91% gains while at the same time adding a ton of downside potential which thankfully you avoided.\n\nSeems like a solid strategy to be honest if you were looking for more risk = more reward. But at the end of the day it isn't sustainable and you should quit and put the balance into VOO or something.\n\nYou show good bankroll management skills based on the risk you are putting out there at least. The problem is if you only put 5% of your money at risk the other 95% is sitting in money market account and those rates are dropping tremendously now and into the future.\n\nSo I would take a strategy of 95% of the funds sitting in voo, taking 5% out at a time for options plays.",
