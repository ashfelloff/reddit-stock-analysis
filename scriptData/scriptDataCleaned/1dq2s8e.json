If you were the closing manager you counted the remaining bags of meat, cheese, etc and then you put that into the computer which knows every item sold that day, how much inventory was there at the beginning of the day and how much should be left. The scooping utensils were designed so you'd know how much to use, sour cream guns too, but the cold items you sprinkle on need to be judged by hand. They franchise company owned over a hundred stores, but still kept a close watch on it.\n\nInterestingly enough, they also got mad if too much was left over as well (quality assurance or something) so you might get a little extra on those days.",
