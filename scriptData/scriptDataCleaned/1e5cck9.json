Same cost, much higher probability to make a profit, and much higher return until TSLA reaches $760 (But even then, at that point it would not matter much).\n\n  \nHeh, you could buy a vertical $300 (buy call)/$400 (sell call), and have 4 contracts, to make even more money, same cash outlay.\n\n  \nAnyway, you belong here, fellow regard.",

The $320 call is worth ($540-$320)=$220 in the money, so $22k profit (for a $8k risk).\n\n  \nIf TSLA is $760 (so $220 higher, so same difference), the two $540 calls are worth $44k total, and the single $320 call is also worth $44k. Above that, OP’s call will double the profits compared to the $320 call. But by that point, the probability becomes lower and lower for that to realize.\n\n  \nIn any case, never ever buy a straight leap (long dated), always buy a vertical instead, so you reduce your cost, don’t pay the full volatility and theta (someone else is paying a good portion of it). You will end up with a better risk profit profile overall.",
