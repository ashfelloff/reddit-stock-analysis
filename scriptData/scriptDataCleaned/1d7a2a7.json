I know they had elections yesterday but why would this impact stock prices this much? If there is such a big movement something must have happened, right? I don’t care about the money I have in the etf, I am just genuinely curious if anyone knows what is going on. And I couldn’t find anything on google so either I am regarded or it’s really weird.",

Scheinbaum is way more data-driven and has ridden his popularity - due in no small part to increased welfare payments - to a super-majority.\n\nHonestly feels like we’re starting to see another autocratic wave in Latin America. El Salvador, Mexico, Noboa in Ecuador doesn’t want to wait to be in charge again once his turn is up, Venezuela (obviously), and young adults are actually quite open to the idea.\n\nAdd in Chinese heavy investment like the multi-billion port in Peru and likely further involvement, and that’s a bit of what’s happening.\n\nEdit: Sorry it’s all over the place. There likely wouldn’t be anything but trouble if you think energy engineering  - something Scheinbaum has professional experience and education in - would pay off by putting money with firms tied to Mexico. I wonder if a generous possibility is private firms seeing a teeny tiny ROI from little morsels of “control,” which, good luck defining that in Latin America, as firms like H&P found out in Venezuela.",

Corruption and violence run rampant and there's no foreseeable future of that even stabilizing. That adds extra coats of performing business in Mexico. Finally, the exchange rate is artificially kept, since the central bank has an extremely high interest rate lots of US capital has gone over the border, but it's only temporary until inflation recedes and stabilizes. The. The central bank will slowly lower their interest rate until it reaches around 4-5% as that's the historic rate to maintain the goal of having an approx of 3% inflation. When that happens all that US investments will go back to the US market leaving a huge depreciation of the peso behind. The current 16-17 USD/MXN does not reflect a historic reality.
