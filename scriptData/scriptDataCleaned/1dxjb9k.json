  "selftext": "Sc Pharmaceuticals manufactures a wearable version of Lasix, used to combat fluid retention, manage kidney failure, and manage congenital heart failure.  The FDA has set Saturday, August 10, 2024 as the pdufa deadline to decide whether to expand use of Furoscix to New York State class 4 heart failure patients. \n\nBased on recent timing of press releases for positive developments, the FDA will likely release approval news on Thursday, August 08 2024 afterhours.\n\nIf my prediction is correct, the stock will increase 10-15% afterhours following news release, and then go negative on the following trading day when yearly sales guidance is released during conference call, similar to Akebia Therapeutics.  The best way to take advantage of this is to buy the stock before news, dump the stock after news release during afterhours trading, and then buy 5 dollar strike put options expiring 08/16/2024 at market open following day.  \n\n",

This is 2 year old news??\n\nOk so my bad. It was approved for NYHA class 2 and 3, but not 4. Class 4 NYHA is a segment, but I work in a heart failure unit. I'll ask our clinicians if they've heard of this, but realistically oral lasix is fairly effective (1:2 conversion oral vs IV) and the limiting factor here isn't drug delivery, it's monitoring kidney fx and low potassium. A 1-time subcut isn't doing much oral lasix wouldn't do just as well.  By the time someone is at class 4, the kidneys are already starting to fail, and even if not they're always teetering on cardio renal syndrome. We are admitting these patients.  \n\nMaybe doctors will use this as a last ditch alternative, but again:  why do this instead of simply increasing po lasix at home? \n\nPuts on this.  I'll ask my heart failure docs if they've heard of this or would prescribe it, but as someone who works with these patients and understands it...seems gimmicky.\n\nEdit:  maybe calls in this regarded economy. Your average investor probably thinks like op.\n\nEdit 2 update: talked with heart failure provider at work. They're already using it when possible, but it's covered under Medicaid and not Medicare. It's too expensive for most patients. They've already been prescribing it off-label / outside of the guidelines for NYHA class 4 so those numbers are not likely to change",
