All of their stores exist in areas for the cash strapped and impoverished, how is this bad for them? I assume this is more of an indictment that they are terrible at business and can’t take advantage of their position.  We’ve all seen that John Oliver episode all they do is shamelessly max exploit everyone from their employees to customers, what’s changed for their business plan?\n\nOnce the mid late September scaries have had their way with the market how is this not a good gamble for some calls like 1/26 etc? It’s a strange word salad combo to hear our core demographic has expanded but we are weaker then ever.",

And employees, who actively hope for your business to fail in every possible way won´t be a strength to build on. In many way Dollar General and Boeing may suffer from the same deficiency: Managers, who cannot manage. They consider every decision a cash flow. But they are completely unable to calculate the cash flow correctly. They cut personell and simply raise the goals for the remaining. Cash flow looks great. But you can only push that so far, before the remaining won´t be able to cover it and from there it´s just going down hill. It´s a very american manager deficiency. European Managers, who are forced to reasonably negotiate with unions and assess actual workloads and what is humanely possible on the long run tend to not fail as hard.",
