I think for many it's the opposite: closing the position as soon as you see any red, and letting the winner run without any TP. Or as you said letting it run even when red, hoping for a reversal\n\nEither way, the issue is unclear profit/loss boundaries (I'm a victim too ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31225) it's very hard to learn)",

      "body": "I have literally watched every single market perform differently in every scenario one can imagine. Things that should make money, lose, and vice versa. The only thing that is consistent is that the stock market is completely rigged against the majority. They are purely thieves, and everything in the stock market is a lie used to scam people. There is no regular trading supply and demand. The numbers are all artificial, the shares are all fake, and the price is whatever they want when it suits their goals. The hedge funds and market makers belong in jail, but they instead are paying off politicians. Regular people are enslaved to the economy and inflation this way. There is no hope, and for every 1 person who gets rich and actually makes money in the stock market, think about the hundreds who definitely will lose it all. \n\nIf all of us grouped up and actually made real and accountable companies and a brand new stock market from scratch, we'd probably have a better chance. But trusting the stock market and the hedge funds, giving them our money to take a chance with. It's absolutely stupid because they will just steal everything. The gap is growing, and if 1% can own everything in the world. It just demonstrates the levels of stupidity. If a person can not physically hold or determine how much of something they have, they can not technically physically own it. We have reached a point where money has no value anymore, beyond hording. If they weren't hording the money, a lot more normal people would be considerably a lot wealthier. Which would be another dent in the economy from their perspective because the economy needs slaves. Think about that next time you invest. \n\nThe stock market is just a way to turn the wealthier middle classes into the poor servant class. By trapping them into \"poor financial decisions,\" but literally investing anything can and will do that to someone. Investing anything can be considered a poor financial decision if it goes wrong. However, a majority of investments will go wrong, at the very least, initially for a while. Even the ones that pan out will statistically barely make 7% returns. Only the manipulators really survive in the markets long term. The manipulators are making billions, if not trillions of dollars, and at no risk whatsoever to themselves because it is guaranteed for them. At best, a regular person can expect to get in and out and make a decent gain, but not very often, and I wouldn't push my luck either. If you do manage to make a profit, it should probably feel dirty and a little illmoral because of all the people who just won't. That's life, though, and this is still considered a dog eats dog world. They should be in prison with Madoff and their new fall guy SBF, but that's what they do. They put away their fall guys and continue their thieving. Rinse and repeat.",
