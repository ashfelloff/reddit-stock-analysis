  "selftext": "Sup regards, jump straight to my last paragraph if your ADHD is too much. we've been on a bumpy road these past couple of weeks, with TSLA literally publishing shit-stain results, yet we all saw puts getting smashed, and many bearish TSLA tards prepping CVs for Wendy's. I myself, took a beating betting against the Musktards, but prefer McDonalds... just a question of taste tbh.\n\n..but this post is slightly different.\n\n1. 10y yields broke 4,50, yet we moved the pain bar to 4,75... Nearly there, but 5% will truly be the apocalyptic yield, until the goal post gets moved to 5,50... Etc. Mkt doesn't give a shit about yields ATM.\n2. Inflation is being shrugged off too as we witness record inflows...\n3. Hubris in the air and everyone BTFD.\n4. the economy is a disaster\n5. Which leaves us with geo-political risk. Iran has a tasty plan for the bearish tards, and if your put margins are well covered, and you have enough time on your contracts (at least few weeks) I believe we're going to get some juicy fireworks a la Guy Fawkes soon. Here's my reasoning:\n\nWhile the world celebrates that Iran and Israel have calmed down, we must remember war strategy, the art of war, and how real war games work. If you wish to have a successful offence: A) the element of surprise is key. B) never reveal dates or timing of an attack\n\nIran will not announce a real counter-attack and will play this down as much as possible. IDF has since, remobilised troops to Rafah, leaving the North vulnerable. Iran clearly stated that a counter-attack by Israel will not go unanswered and we know that \"the best future defence is a good offence\". Iran will launch a massive attack soon, either by proxy or together with their proxies and when this happens, bulls will be spraying diarrea like scatter guns and Wendy's HR will collapse with bullish tards trying to get burger-flipping internships.\n\nSo fellow bears üêª üêª, clutch those puts as if they were your imaginary trans wife's balls, and hang on for the ride.\n\nTLDR: War is heating up, WTI futures pressured, this mini run is a text book bull-trap\n\n\\[Excuse spelling and lack of elaboration, but I'm prepping for my MCD interview in an hour.\\]\n\nGood luck to all of you twats whether long or short.",
