This contract is a 5 year $4.28billion that has a chance of doubling to a 10 year contract. And it's more than just a landing too it's actually sending \"microsatellites to map the Moon’s surface in 4K resolution.\" And \"will use the $4.82 budget to develop infrastructure, logistics and mapping solutions to facilitate the Moon’s exploration\" in my opinion (as much as that means) I think lunr has a lot of potential over these next few years specifically the first 5 years of the contract. If they do double down into a 10 year I think that would be good for the revenue of the company and the investors like us.",

What he said sounded good and made sense and I did a judgement call from that.\n\nOther times I have kinda just trusted a comment here and gone in, recently made some money from selling my clover shares that I bought after reading someone’s comment here.\n\nI’m new to this and I had a casino addiction that cost me big in my younger years, so I admit it’s like educated gambling for me.  But, so far so good.\n\nAlso, I only started buying a lot of stocks after I made some money from ethereum etfs, which I bought when it was low just because I thought crypto would go back up.  Had it not gone up my story would be different.  I could’ve made more had I not sold to early, but I’m satisfied with what I have.  \n\nMy gambling addiction taught me to not get too addicted.",
