I feel like I‚Äôm finally disciplined enough to make it happen. It actually feels, rather easy to do this now. It‚Äôs been a journey and hope it continues to be. \nI just want to say that if you‚Äôre down bad just re align yourself. Look at it all from a 3rd person POV, take your own advice that you would give to someone else and set emotions aside. \nDon‚Äôt try and ‚Äú make it all back ‚Äú by adding more to your already loosing positions. \n",
