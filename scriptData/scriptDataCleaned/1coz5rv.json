Then they had people that wanted to influence him buy the shares as needed to keep the stock value above 45.  It trades between 45 and 55.  Not much more money out there to pump the value up.  Too expensive to borrow for people to short when its 200%.",

I suspect that DJT will eventually merge with an insurance group owned by Don Hankey or one of Don Hankey's holdings.  SPACs have shown the way.  Besides, how does an Insurance company make money? Write policies that never have to pay out? It's the perfect way to receive bribes.  DJT has a lot of crooked people.  If I can imagine it, they they've already planned it.",
