I guess these investors were hyped when they heard a potential monopoly.  \n\nHonestly, their business model is really great for consumers.  But the cost basic is just bad.  As a consumer, I and all of us should be rooting for them.  I have never seen such a streamline process to car selling and buying.  I tried it once as a test, and the offer was up within 10mins, and I was one click away for them to pick the used car up or do a trade in with a new car on the same date.
