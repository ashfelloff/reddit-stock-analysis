I try not to short, it’s just superstitious. \n\nAnother strategy that I left out but found to be really profitable (hope I don’t jinx myself) are 0DTE credit spreads against the winning direction. For example when spy is already up or down 0.8%, the premiums on OTM 0DTE are usually pretty inflated. I then enter credit spreads that ensures a max win at an expiry below or above some OTM strike, and luckily we haven’t seen +1.3% days. Obviously you’re risking more than you’re gaining, but I’ve gotten pretty lucky off of this strategy I suppose. A huge factor in my recent upswing in winning is simply getting past the PTD restrictions for the first time in six years thanks to my annual bonus (started trading when I was 18). Selling 0DTE premium and hopping on 0DTE swells has done me well over the past month.",
