  "score": 45,
  "selftext": "\nGood morning, everyone! I've been tracking Duolingo (DUOL) stock closely, and I noticed something intriguing. After the market closed yesterday, Duolingo reported their earnings, which were quite strong. However, despite the positive earnings report, there was a significant drop in the stock price. It closed yesterday at $244.64 and opened today at $204.98.\n\nCan anyone explain why the price dropped even though the earnings were good?",

It's sort of an annoying meme but *P R I C E D   I N* is true:  a lot of these are all priced in by institutions on big beats or whatever, and so it comes down to guidance as the remaining variable to be priced in correctly or not. \n\nI'd wager a big volume of trades are pretty much algorithmic based on various models of priced in, finances-tracking, retail sentiment, order-flow, etc from data harvesting. So many are pegged to a particularly priced in number assuming some X-value of guidance, and if ER doesn't exceed the model's predicted priced-in data then trades are done comparing to the current market value over the expected market value to harvest the gains of what they consider surplus. \n\nThis volume is huge compared to retail and then retail piles in on the coattails further giving data for algorithms to trade off in a positive feedback loop.",

      "body": "I'm surprised that the stock dropped wit the earnings timing too, but evaluating the fundamentals of their financials and their product, the stock still seems overpriced. The good news is their paid subscribers grew from 4.8 million to 7.4 million from end of Q1 2023. Their monthly active users of 97.6 million shows that paid users are 7.5% of the monthly user base.  Their subscription revenue was $131 mill, and advertising + in-app purchases $23 mill. So 7.5% of the users generates 85% of their revenue. \n\nThis shows me that they have essentially not figured out how to monetize their free users. If you use duolingo free version you'll notice that almost all their ads are for the paid version, i.e. few external advertisers are willing to go on their platform. So it's all about getting more subscribers. Although this did grow 50% y/y, it's not a massive number and I am skeptical it can continue to grow. The core issue is the product isn't great for language learning - it's a fun game, they've gotten people addicted to it and trying to maintain daily streaks. But if you're serious about learning a language, it's at best a piece of the puzzle. I was a subscriber in years past but now use the free version sporadically for some practice - I am more focused on watching videos and finding conversation partners. I think churn will be an issue in coming years. Duolingo may improve their margins by reducing staff and R&D investment, but I see a ceiling to their revenue. Given the crazy P/E ratio with the stock, it doesn't seem like a good growth bet.",
