China haas special plates for gas powered vehicles and EVs. Blue plates foe gasoline and green for electric. They green plates dominate the roads. As an car enthusiast that has spent some time with quite a selection of vehicles from all segments The design, interior, and layout of these Chinese EVs are exquisite for their price point. The interior I can say quite confidently can compare to mid tongigh end luxury class vehicles. The dash and center console is well thought out with a nice mix of physical buttons for everyday use fuctions. White the rest are nicely places on an large display. So fk you bot I talk how I want and I sure as hell don't care about the tariffs. Just bring these damn EVs to the United states and light a fire under GMs ass. So Ford and all American automakers can stop slacking off and actually come out with something that can compete with Tesla and W.e. china is pumping out. Also Ford Thank you for cracking down on dealers upcharging consumers and good luck on the GTD project. That Mustang if the last will be legendary.",

Any foreign manufacturers are welcomed to come and stay, with a major caveat, more on this later.\n\nImports are 25% tariff (that's why base tariff on Chinese imports is also 25%), 17% VAT, and 1-40% sales tax depending on price and variable displacement tax that tops at 40% on displacement over 4L. Then there is a formula to calculate the effective tax rate. The dominant factor is sales tax and displacement tax, which essentially are taxed on RR, S series, Range Rovers, AMG and M etc, basically the luxury and sports cars. On top of all this, there is a 10% luxury tax that triggers at a certain price point. Overall something Reddit would be cheering on, ironically (tax the rich and go green). \n\nMore importantly there's just no domestic competition to those cars to start with, it's not to protect domestic manufacturing even it can add up to close to 250% tax rate but it's not a 250% tariff. I suppose this is how you got your simplified version of \"300% tariff\".\n\nWell I guess the point is to know your facts before trash talking, with all due respect. Here is how the Chinese get their cut: they force everyone (except Tesla) to form joint ventures so they get their profits **and** keep the supply chain and manufacturing local. On the other hand you can argue these things potentially saved GM, VW so they have more budget on R&D etc, well another topic. Anyhow, that's how they took the shortcut in the auto industry, actually somewhat similar to Japan except US supplied those contracts voluntarily and didn't go after Japan during its copycat era.",

PS2 will only be made in China until it is discontinued in a few years. Their US market development is now reliant on the PS3 becoming successful. It will be manufactured in Volvo’s South Carolina plant in the US and will also be the plant that exports to Europe. If the PS3 sells well in the Western world the US factory will supply those vehicles, meaning they can reduce their tariff costs on imported cars with the export. They desperately need the 3 to be sucessful in the west and the 4 to be sucessful globally (excluding the US for now). PS2 demand is decreasing. Going from like 12,000 vehicles in Q4 to 6000 PS2:s in Q1 is not natural seasonal variation. Polestar’s global success is now fully hinged on the 3 and the 4’s success. Which brings some uncertainty to their stock. Furthermore, their $1bn in debt financing that they got just recently included a covenant which requires $5,4bn in revenue this year. Starting off the year with only 7200 vehicles sold in Q1 does not bode well in terms of meeting this requirement. Q2-Q4 is what everything relies on now.
