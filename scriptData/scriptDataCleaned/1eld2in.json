  "title": "What's the deal with German automakers being so undervalued?",
  "score": 131,
  "selftext": "German car companies like Mercedes, BMW, Porsche being valued at under 50 billion with P/E of around 5 seems massively illogical. Musk paid 44 billion for Twitter. Porsche's market cap is 30 billion. You could not even buy all the Porsches that are produced in a single year for 30 billion (roundabout 300k cars times 120k average price = 36 billion) let alone come anywhere close to buying the company. \n\nSo how does it make sense that in theory, owning 51 % of the shares, which equals only about 15 billion worth right now, makes you the owner of the Porsche company? Of course this is in theory because you cannot just go and buy 51 % of the shares but you get the point.\n\nAs reference, Intel currently is still valued 4 times as much as Porsche and twice as much as Mercedes while basically being a company on lifeline supported by tax money while Mercedes released the first approved level 3 self-driving car (ahead of Tesla) so these companies aren't just sleeping on new tech and living off of past glory like Intel to be valued only around or under the 50 billion mark. But that's how they are valued.",

Germany and the EU have suggested these companies are receiving unfair government support, which could threaten retaliation from China, potentially costing European manufacturers access to the Chinese market.",

              "body": "Indeed. IMO a lot of investors are still really under-estimating the difficulty of the EV transition by automakers. And the worst part about it is that not only will it be really expensive, but it WON'T let them make more profits then ever before. Consumers won't start buying more cars because of EV's, so the only way the automakers are going to make more money from EV's are if they can steal sales from someone else.\n\nAnd the worst part is that consumer demand for EV's vs ICE can move way faster then any automaker can shift their lineup from ICE vehicles to EV's. It takes 3 years on average to bring a new vehicle line to market.",

An asset really only benefits an owner if it’s converted into cash. In which case, why have them, just sell them. For most businesses, you only want assets that are a needed to generate cash flow. \n\nFor a car marker. You have massive assets in production capabilities but those all required cash to build, and are depreciating assets. Same thing is true with houses. If I gave you a house that you couldn’t sell, unless you rent it out, your negative cash flow in taxes and general depreciation (have to replace the roof every 30 years). \n\nA car company might have $20B in facility assets. But that production line needs constant upgrades. And it’s listed as $20B because that’s how much it cost and you want the ability to write it off as it decreases in value, but are there really a lot of buyers who would buy it from you for $20B? \n\nAnd it’s a risky thing to own. You put $20B in a production line (instead of paying it out to owners) in hopes you can generate positive cash flow from in for 10 years. But what if you can’t? And even if you can, that just means in 10 years you have to make another capital investment of $20B. It’s sort of a never ending capex sink.",

They are still at high multiples so clearly the market thinks this margin compression is a short term issue rather than a long term trend (which is of course debatable). \n\nEven now though Tesla’s net margins stand at 13%, more than twice the sector average and higher than Mercedes at around 9%. BYD have slashed prices further so their net margins are lower currently at about 5% though this includes a lot of other low margin industries like their hybrid vehicles, semi production, mobile components, facemasks etc. \n\nLike most of investing this is nuanced but I do think Tesla and BYD deserve a higher multiple just because of their vertical integration, minimal debt and higher growth potential.",

I don't know exactly about the current situation at BYD, therefore the following will only hold true for Tesla. With sales dynamics slowing down and an aging product range, it seems likely that huge investments are just around the corner, lowering margins and increasing debt at least in the short term. From my point of view, people consider Tesla not only as an automotive company, but more as a tech company. Sure, they have other projects in addition to manufacturing cars. But as far as I know, the vast majority of their earnings is still from the automotive business. Probably the market prices in a large expected growth in other product categories such as the robots or their solar department. However, if Tesla ends up to be just another automotive manufacturer in the long term, I just can't see how their business model differs that much from other OEMs to justify their high P/E.",

Where are Dick and Harry living in the back appartment 3rd floor who park their cars randomly on the nearby street going to charge regularly? Just hope for the best that 3 charging stations in the street used by 200 cars will be free at some point once EVs have a significant market share?\n\nRegardless of whether you believe or don't believe in EVs, Tesla offers a whooping 4 models. How do German car makers have \"few models\"? Mercedes has the all-electric A, B, E, S classes as well as SUV models and even the G class and will soon release the all-electric C class. How does anyone even look at the new Audi A6 E-tron and put a Tesla S besides it and find that the Tesla is actually worth more money than the A6? Completely ridiculous to me. You are paying more for a far lower quality car and it's very obvious. \n\nThe main problem with EVs is however that no one will be able to compete with the Chinese, not even Tesla. EV is a much simpler technology than combustion engines given that EVs don't requite 2.000 parts in a combustion block that need highest engineering ability to be built efficiently and profitably. So the Chinese will buy their own cars from now on and even export their cars, okay. Everyone loses but the Chinese. But that still doesn't explain how Tesla would be 12 times the worth of Mercedes.\n\nI suppose the guy who said: \"Because Germans don't invest in the stock market\" has a point.
