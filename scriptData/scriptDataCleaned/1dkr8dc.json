  "selftext": "‚ÄúXLK, which has $72 billion in assets under management, will increase its allocation in Nvidia from roughly 5% to more than 20% and drop its allocation of Apple from about 21% to 5%, reversing the stocks‚Äô positions in the ETF with Nvidia becoming the second largest holding.\n\n‚Äú‚ÄòXLK will be a forced seller of ~$11 billion worth of $AAPL and a forced buyer of almost $10 billion worth of $NVDA in a rebalance... assuming Nvidia remains larger than Apple at market close on Friday,‚Äô‚Äù\n\nIf Jensen Jackets sold $31m worth of shares today and NVDA is down 3.54 on the day, wtf is XLK buying $11b worth of shares gonna do?\n\nTL;DR NVDA go brrrr üíµ ",
