  "selftext": "Bro I have not bought a single call since the whole NVDA hype train started back in 2022. I swear to fucking god I have not taken a single bullish action on NVDA since the beginning. Yesterday (06/21) I bought my first call after debating whether or not to after this week's absolutely ridiculous gains for NVDA, so I decided, maybe it's time to *finally* get a piece of the action... Needless to say I got gaped yesterday. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK",
