  "selftext": "Bro I have not bought a single call since the whole NVDA hype train started back in 2022. I swear to fucking god I have not taken a single bullish action on NVDA since the beginning. Yesterday (06/21) I bought my first call after debating whether or not to after this week's absolutely ridiculous gains for NVDA, so I decided, maybe it's time to *finally* get a piece of the action... Needless to say I got gaped yesterday. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK",

I’ve been a huge AMD and NVDA bull forever\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nI said in 2021 they were going to triple in price, no one does what they can do and the world will revolve around their tech, I even said they might be the most valuable company in the world years ago \n\nBeen putting AMD and NVDA in datacenter for over ten years.  But the media onslaught shoving NVDA in your face so everyone age 15-80 with no clue what they do in datacenter is talking about the stock keeps ringing alarm bells in my head that I can’t shake.  Like I’ve seen this setup before.  \n\nPeople who don’t work in semi don’t realize how cyclical it is.  And these semi stocks can and have dropped 66% dozens of times.  The amount of times I’ve seen Elon tweet lately about AI, NVDA, Dell, SMCI is enough to make me think I smell a rat.",
