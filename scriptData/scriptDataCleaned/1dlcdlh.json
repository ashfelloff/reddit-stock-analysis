I did a couple of small options trades the previous week, like 1 or 2 contracts at a time, and ended up $1000ish in the green. I was GEEKED, so yesterday morning I pulled the trigger on calls, half of my pot, so today I pulled the trigger on puts, that los the rest because it didnâ€™t dip low enough. Iâ€™ve got about $500 left in calls that expire next week so weâ€™ll see if I can win it back but I am I nearly through the stages of grief. \n\nThis was a lot of money for me :(",

If you want to minimize risk, buy in the money and u will still make/lose $100/contract every dollar the underlying increases/decreases. If you think the price will move a lot, buy out of the money but never more than like 10%/month. If the underlying moves against you though, you are quickly fucked. Options are inherently high risk, I don't personally see the need to make them even riskier buy buying OTM 0DTEs or weeklies (I've done it and usually end up losing)",
