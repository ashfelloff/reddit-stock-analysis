  "title": "DD: Apple x OpenAI: The Worst Kept Secret Ever",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Hey WSB,\n\nI've been doing some serious digging and speculating, and it looks like Apple is gearing up for a blockbuster announcement on June 10th. Here’s why I believe a partnership with OpenAI is the worst kept secret of all time and why I’m betting big on AAPL.\n\n**1. Today's iOS18 Feature Announcements**\n\n* Apple just dropped some semi-major features for iOS18: Accessibility improvements and new CarPlay options. Including controlling an iPad using only your eyes.\n* These are important, but not exactly groundbreaking. It feels like they’re clearing the deck for something much bigger on June 10.\n\n**2. ChatGPT 4o on Mac Desktop First**\n\n* Despite Microsoft/Windows having equity in OpenAI, ChatGPT 4o was launched on Mac desktop first.\n* Why would OpenAI prioritize Apple over their own investors unless there's a deeper partnership brewing?\n\n**3. Key OpenAI Employees Bailing**\n\n* Several key OpenAI employees have left in the past 48hours.\n* It sounded like they were off-put or upset by some recent developments, and nothing would make you more upset as a revolutionary than working for the old guard imho.\n\n**4. Media Leaks Leading Up to This**\n\n* Various media leaks have been hinting at a big AI-related announcement from Apple. Apple themselves have signaled this is their big coming out party.\n* These aren’t just rumors. They’re too consistent and well-timed to be random.\n\n**5. ChatGPT 4o vs. Siri**\n\n* ChatGPT 4o is everything Siri is not. It’s powerful, intuitive, and already works \"free\" on people’s iPhones.\n* Imagine Apple integrating this level of AI into every iProduct. Both parties will make bank on every device sold from now onward and create the ultimate AI-driven hardware-software ecosystem.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n* This partnership is a match made in heaven. The June 10 keynote is set to be an absolute blockbuster.\n* For these reasons, I’m all in on Apple.\n\n**Counter Point:**\n\nThis is the worst kept secret ever and already baked in to the price.\n\n**Present Position**: 110 x AAPL $200 Call 6/14.\n\nTL;DR: Apple x OpenAI partnership is almost certain. iOS18 feature drops, ChatGPT 4.0 launch on Mac, key OpenAI employee moves, and consistent media leaks point to a major announcement on June 10. I'm betting big on AAPL.",
