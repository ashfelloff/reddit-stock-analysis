Gucci, their main 'premium' brand, is trash now. \n\nLVMH has at least managed to keep their image intact, but they also suffer from the weakness of the Chinese market. US demand has collapsed as well -> middle class buyers have less disposable income (to waste). It's still a high quality company that is worth a look, as there will be better times again in future.\n\nI'll personally stick to **real** luxury that is out of reach for most people. The truly rich don't really care about market cycles and spending money.",
