  "title": "why the economy is doomed. A samsclub paper towel perspective.",
  "score": 2387,
  "selftext": "Hello, thanks for taking the time to read this due diligence on the economy.\n\nOver the last 4 years I have gone to my local samsclub to purchase paper towels over 800 times. every week for 4 years, I purchased a 12 pack of bounty select a size paper towel. \n\nDuring covid paper towel like toilet paper became a rare resources. It was not guarenteed that the economy could produce enough to sustain the paper towel needs of the citizens. This lead to the terrible pratice of hoarding paper towl and while sad, was very bullish for the economy in general.\n\nAfter witnessing this sad pratice of hoarding I began to realise that the broader market could be tracked (in generalities) by following how much paper towel my local sams club could keep in stock. I keep track of this number by creating an acronym for these amounts of paper towel stored on pallets at the previously mentioned club. \n\nS.P.T.P Sams club paper towel pallets. (by creating this acronym I have saved not only myself time while writing, but also you time while reading)\n\nBack during the covid days my local samsclub rarely had more than 2 s.p.t.p delivered a week. buying paper towel was hit or miss. As the economy recovered this increased to a more reliable 4 s.p.t.p.\n\nNow we come to the crux of this post. s.p.t.p remained steady in the 2 to 10 range for the last 3 or so years. Untill this very week. I counted over 45 s.p.t.p on rakes strewn throughout the store. Which leads me (and you if you have even an average IQ) to 1 conclusion. \n\nNo one has extra money to buy paper towel anymore. The economy is toast. Over. To say the world is ending is not even one tiny bit of an exageration.\n\nOn monday I will sell every asset I own and fullport into week puts on whatever sector produces paper towels. \n\nI hope you have the sense to follow this amazing play to prevent ultimate finacial ruin to me (and you)\n\nThanks again for reading. Best of luck out there.\n\n\nEdit. As we enter a new week I wanted to thank everyone who replied to this post. Especially the humorous ones that gave me some great laughs. I even learned a few things too. Cheers fellow degens.",

Or simply a typo. \n\nI used to work in the bike industry - in 2018-2019, a huge component brand accidentally added a zero to one of their mid tier wheel models on their annual projection sheet, and the procurement department just went ahead and scheduled the orders from China. Voila - 10x of these wheels started arriving at their warehouses. They had to fire sale them at the end of the season for like 90% off. I still have two pairs as spares in my basement, they're great wheels. I saw a guy last year on a big ride with the same wheels and we had a good laugh about the story - he also worked at a shop at that time and had done the same thing.",
