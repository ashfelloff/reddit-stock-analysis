Weed businesses are now poised to become far more profitable than they are now.\n\nWho will the winners be, we don’t know, but the industry as a whole legitimately got a huge boon yesterday, resulting in a completely justified bump in stock prices which I truly foresee continuing.\n\nWhat’s the bear case here?

                      "body": "The bear case is that weed is an agricultural commodity at the end of the day that is grossly overpriced because of regulations and legal restrictions. Weed used to be 20$ a gram back in the day, it costs less for a quarter of an ounce here now that its state legal. What will happen to the price of the commodity when it becomes federally legalized, and why? How much are you investing in alcohol or cigarette businesses these days? You long wheat? When weed becomes legal, the bubble pops. There is no lack of supply, the shit grows fine just about everywhere; when it actually becomes \"just a plant\" or even a lightly-regulated plant like tobacco, these stocks are gonna be worth dirt.",
