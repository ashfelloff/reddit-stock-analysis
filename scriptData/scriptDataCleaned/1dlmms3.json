I know “time in the market beats timing the market” but it’s hard to justify buying companies like NVDA, Googl and AMZN at this price knowing that the massive optimism at the moment usually indicates top is near and correction is nearby the corner. Nobody knows when but I would rather buy some still beaten down companies out there. We know Fintech and banks are still kinda low. It’s weekend now so it’s time to throw some ticker symbols out here. I don’t wanna see SMCI NVDA MSFT Googl aapl here. Go \n\nEdit: people have unjustifiable love towards intel. But I just don’t see how ",

Like honestly AMD was in the same position as Intel is now, the only major difference in this is the AI pitch which they still are not competing with at any level. They are not worth 160 unless they can do something with AI frenzy currently. Otherwise they trade at low 40's.\n\nNVDA moat is CUDA and that will not last forever as everyone else other than NVDA is saying FUCK your crazy margins, lets partner with AMD or INT to try and figure out a CPU/GPU Solutions.\n\nEven when AI has a massive fall off (Nothing AI currently makes money = to effort), AMD, INT and all the custom card work they are doing for META/Amazon/Apple/Microsoft/Google ect... will come online eventually.\n\nWith AMD you are at 160, way way way over what they are worth vs INTC who is also over what they are worth (but much more sane). You'd be a fucking idiot value wise and future wise to add to AMD over INTC right now. This is coming from someone with no positions in either as there are a lot of other positions medium/semi long I'd rather take. INTC could go to $40 and would still be cheap over 10 years. AMD needs to drop to at least 55/low 40's to be worth it (unless some how in the next 6 months they figure out how to not make as ass AI codex).",

Within that Search business is Google search, Gmail, maps, news, chrome...all of which have ads and all of which are big enough to be a business on their own.\n\nWith the fact Google own Android, any new Ad products can come pre-baked into every Android phone, same as Apple's services share, but with 70% of the global market, not 30%.\n\nGoogle can still be the biggest company in the world by focusing on being second in everything....because noone will catch-up on their ads distribution. Meta has tried for nearly 2 decades, and is still nowhere near.\n\nA quick personal reference: I work for the largest travel bookings company in the world (I am sure you can work it out from that statement). Despite people coming to our website directly and the fact we have over 500 million app installs, our highest % of high quality traffic (traffic that converts into a booking) comes from Google, by a long way. In the past 3 years we have doubled our spend with them and I don't see that easing up anytime soon.",
