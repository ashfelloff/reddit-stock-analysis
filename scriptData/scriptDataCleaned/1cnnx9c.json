While there is a good case to be made for doing that for housing, it's bonkers that they do it for credit card interest too, because the effect of higher CC interest is felt by consumers within a few weeks at most.  I think this is one of the sources of disconnect between \"the economy is doing great\" vs \"lower end consumers are hurting bad\".\n\nThere is no effective distinction for higher monthly CC payments due to higher prices vs higher interest.  It's all the same to the person who has to pay.\n\nA Forbes article - not exactly a clown outfit - claimed CPI would have peaked at around 18% with the older formula instead of nine and change.",

As of 2024, the average American saves just 3.2% of their income and spends the rest. \n\n40% of Americans say they can't cover a 400 dollar emergency.\n\nYet here you are lining up at Chipotle to pay 15 dollars for a burrito. New car sales are nearly at all-time highs with 8-12% rates. \n\nConsumerism is a disease. No one is going to bail you stupid fucks out yall arnt the big banks this debt is going to fuck you for decades. \n\nStop spending.",
