I was selling covered calls but if the underlying tanks it's awful feeling, there's less risk using options to sell calls or open spreads than buying shares. \n\nIt's crazy how negative, doubtful and cynical people can be when discussing options. I hate gambling and losing money, this is the only strategy I'll use from now on cause it eliminates so much risk. I only lose what I pay. I have so much flexibility, time. It's amazing compared to buying shares and eating 100% of the directional movement. Glad you caught on as well, someone's vouched for this strategy saying it's the best and have a decade doing it. It really is the best strategy in the market imo cause it eliminates so much risk.",
