  "selftext": "Providing this to guys on discord yesterday or anyone else who cares....\n\nPosting positions for you dumpster divers.\n\nBtw the CEO has worked as a derivatives trader, just like the WD dumpster divers here....so maybe a reason to go long, lol.\n\n**Applovin' Warning to Shareholders**\n\nIt has been alleged in a newly filed class action lawsuit in CA, that Nasdaq ticker APP (Applovin) has been engaging in the black/greyhat practice of collecting and using very private user data, without their consent. Has this been done to attain an advantage over competitors, and offer better “value” to their advertising clients? You tell me.\n\nConsequently, they have had their first profitable full year in 10 years. This makes them a “darling” on Wall Street. Perhaps shareholders have, or will be impacted by some or all of the things mentioned here,  \n**My lesson...Caveat Emptor. I need to dig into sec filings before shoveling hard earned money into ANY stock.**\n\nThe following narrative is demonstrable:\n\n**Story 1:**\n\n1. [Developers in the industry have been fully aware that APP has been generating revenue by using techniques that are illegal, and dishonest (harvesting very private information). ](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32407906)This has been their “edge.”\n2. [Their largest (and original) investor (KKR) has divested 99.9% of their shares.](https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/kkr-entities-sell-146-billion-in-applovin-stock-93CH-3442964)\n3. [Their 6 highest executives divest their vested shares immediately (the day that they receive them), and have been doing this for 18-24 months.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fwvaMVkHg6YTB8SYGOuGsFXD_iprk8egwjboPwWuqGQ/edit?usp=drive_link)\n4. [They are finally being faced with a class action lawsuit in CA.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zPACsHdxAEtO1HnKMkJS6sEX96cPXc7U/view?usp=drive_link)\n5. **The press is not aware of this lawsuit**. which will have dire consequences. \n6. This lawsuit  may cause a cascade of new lawsuits (US and EUl).\n\n**Story 2 (perhaps tied to result of Story 1?)**: \n\n1. Because of the above, [for the last 2 years they have had an incentive program for their executives and its sole purpose has been to drive up share price as quickly as possible (the program says so). They vest this stock on predetermined quarterly dates.](https://contracts.justia.com/companies/applovin-corp-12319/contract/274105/#:~:text=For%20purposes%20of%20this%20Award%20Agreement%2C%20a,a%20given%20year%2C%20provided%20that%20if%20the)\n2. [At each vesting date, employees dump all or most of their shares.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RHwEt8yGSi9D2qbBgp7aT9CnZ_bbPBEo7r_z4zlwnHA/edit?usp=sharing)\n3. [In many cases this diluting effect has reduced the stock value, allowing KKR/Applovin to very public declare a “buyback” which then inflates the price and lets insiders dump even more. ](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/4E4egaoI/)\n\nNone of this should be a surprise! [APP speaks to the “hazard” of both of these end results coming to fruition in their annual/quarterly filings….to cover their butt.](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001751008/60f699fc-5521-4c15-8165-8eecb688d4ea.pdf)\n\nThe research project video: [Academic Research on Low Float Tech funds](https://vimeo.com/1004472127?share=copy)\n\nThis is information – *not financial advice* or recommendation · Do your own research and seek independent advice when required · Investing carries risks.",

Please flesh that out for me in plain terms.\n\n(B) many of these executives with over $20m in stock have sold most if not all of it. Even when they are awarded more stock as incentive, they cash it out.\n\nWith enormous gains already pocketed, it would seem that executives would be MORE willing to wager that the value of their holdings will go up over the middle to long run. Yet they don’t do this?!\n\nI will put my money on the side of what principles DO with their holdings, and not what they SAY about their future prospects, or some hip new take on how to frame future outlook.\n\nThis nonsense makes the market MORE inefficient. It would make sense to me that the sec or preferably a for-profit corporation, be tasked with spotting and calling out this type of nonsense using AI.",

You think something negative about a company and then you search for the thing that must prove it to be true. You are so focused on justifying your hypothesis(Whether conscious or subconscious) you ignore so many things that are blatantly obvious contradictions to your hypothesis. You say these exacs are diluting while also saying they are selling shares for profit while also saying they are propping up the stock price. Here's the thing. You are either stating this company is committing mass fraud with their financial statements or these large sums of money the execs and early investors are getting are in fact justified. \n\nYou compare the last 12 months of stock compensation to the 2023 Net Income. But why wouldn't you compare it to the last 12 months of Net income or the projected next 12 months of net income? You stat they had net income of $355M in 23' yet fail to mention that net income was $310M in the most recent quarter alone. It's the same exact concept when you want to take the lawsuits of a company that is very recent then dilute their revenue you are comparing it to by including revenue from 5 years ago that was a fraction of current revenue. Once again you are cutting out the context to prove your hypothesis instead of trying to really understand what is happening. \n\nI finished watching your video and it's clear to me that you are using technical analysis and are frustrated because they can manipulate technical analysis. But any normal value investor or long term investor would not be affected by this or would actually benefit. Not once did you analyze the actual company's prospects. All that hard work and DD just to live in fantasy land is crazy. I would have loved to see what your conclusion on META was in 2022 when Zuck has complete control of META and the narrative was that he lost his mind and kept focusing on the metaverse only for the stock to tank 75% and so Zuck could buy back 10% of outstanding shares. \n\nIf you know that APP is manipulating shares up and down, why would you short the stock when you can just buy it when it goes down?",

Their product is solid in a bunch of ways (granular, real time, programmatic advertising), AND they benefit from a lower threshold of required security, than google, fb, etc. This is a significant factor in gauging future success. The lawsuit in California is the first, there are many other states, regions, and countries with regulations that are as strict, if not more strict.\n2. Execs dump most if not all of their shares, within days of receiving. The value of this divestiture yields income to them that is  many multiples of what the company has made in it's 12 year lifespan (this is a fact). Executives are able to pocket hundreds of millions, and put much of it into trusts (also a fact).\n3. This, consequently has two very real effects: (a) dilution of the stock and more importantly, (b) signaling  (outsiders begin to wonder why key execs dump their stock 10 minutes after receiving it). Both of these points are demonstrable. Fact  and fact.\n4. After this has happened, it has been the case, that they then buyback shares with borrowed money when the price is at a relative low (fact). They receive positive press for this show of \"strength. (fact)\"\n5. These \"preplanned\" vesting/sales and \"strategic\" buybacks have the effect of: overwhelmingly enriching a small set of executives (each getting, to the detriment of the company's most cherished resource....it's shareholders (fact).\n\nThis $ could be use to build a stronger financial profile (like paying down debt) AND some should be allocated to execs for a job well done (subjective).\n\nThis form of compensation is fully rationalized in the  10K section where it discusses how VITAL these team members are (fact). They may be incredible at their jobs....but let's not get the cart before the horse, and remember to call out the good AND the bad (subjective).\n\nIn summary, future limitations due to privacy law, myopic cash management, and at the very least the APPEARANCE of greed, and discounting of the company by executives.....these are the issues which put the stock valuation at risk. IN MY OPINION.\n\nUnless they are fully remediated, asap, the share price will most certainly decline at a more accelerated rate than many solid tech companies.",

Management turned into a fraternity and only promote ppl within the 'circle'. Engineers placed on projects out of their depth just to hit deadlines. Countless acquisitions to boost stock prices but are horribly mismanaged and a large HR department was establish to insulate the workers from the owners. I know the C suites fiduciary duty is to maximize value for the share holders but when 80% of the company is owned by a hand full of parties a lot of shady shit can take place without being scrutinized as long as the overlords are in corroboration. It feels like a public company thats actually private is using the stock market and low float to manipulate their capitalization with unsavory tactics just to benefit the very few on top.",

If Applovin sold their app business for that same multiple they would bring in almost $4bn for the sale of that asset. If you remove that from the EV and value Applovin software business at 50% of the historical EBITDA multiple of trade desk (50x EBITDA x 50% = 25x EBITDA). Applovin business would be worth > $165/share so more than 30% higher from today.
