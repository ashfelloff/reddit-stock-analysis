  "selftext": "Oracle is trading at ATH (almost), and I think it's going to follow NVDA because a lot of the ORCL gains came from the AI bandwagon. Since NVDA has shed over half a trillion dollars in value, and AVGO followed the trend post ER, I expect ORCL to follow the same trajectory unless the overall market reverses and rips starting tomorrow. \n\n\nInterestingly enough, Robinhood shows that the Hedge Fund ownership of ORCL decreased by 2.62 million shares Vs Q1. \n\n\nLarry Ellison Sold 2,250,000 shares (Informative Sell) on July 17th. Edward Screven (Chief Corporate Architect ) has been selling (Informative Sell) all the shares that were awarded/granted. \n\n\nNote - I have no positions right now but I'm thinking about getting 09/13 Puts tomorrow before ER, because I'm completely regarded. \n\nAlso, this is Not A DD. This is pure regarded and speculative. \n\n\nLet me know if you regards are getting Puts or Calls and what's your reasoning. ",
