When production actually starts and the revenue starts flowing any slight disappointment will make the stock drop.  But by then I expect INTC to be in the 100s.\n\nIf INTC succeeds with their fabs they will join the 1T club. It is a high risk/reward investment.  MSFT, TSLA, AMZN, AAPL, NVDA, GOOG, etc. have no chance of 10x from here.  INTC does. But it will take years to materialize.  At least if you buy today then the earnings will be taxed as long term capital gains.\n\nThe PC market sucks right now. Over the next year things will improve. Windows 10 end of life Oct 2025. Major corporations will have to upgrade all their PCs.  But this won't show up on Intel's bottom line until 2Q 2025.",
