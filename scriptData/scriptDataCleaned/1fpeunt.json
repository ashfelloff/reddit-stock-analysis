It was at that moment I realized this guy was completely full of shit and is just really good at finding common ground with people.  He had a whole system of keeping track of personal details about folks as well so it seemed like he cared, but then again maybe he keeps track because he does care, but it's still so forced and fake lol.  \n\nIt's a skill, though, and a necessary one.
