Still think they have a shot at $11-$12 if the earnings call isn't too rough, and I'm good with the shares and LEAPS that have time.\n\nBut probably wouldn't have rode that dip all the way down with calls if I thought they were going to miss everything. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4275)\n\nI've got 14, 12, 10, and 8 at different shortish timeframes. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267) ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)\n\nMore upset that it seems someone knew they were going to miss. It's been a three week down swing with very little news outside of an interest rate drop and Tesla upswing. Those should have been a lift, and volumes have been high. So someone was getting out ahead of the adjusted deliveries.",

              "body": "Toyota, Honda, Volvo, have all operated profitable electric and hybrid programs.\n\nToyota sold 20 million electric and hybrid vehicles. I'm sure they lost money at some point, but they were some of the first to market. And for most of those they were profitable, or they would be cut. Volvo sells more electric vehicles in a month than Rivian does in a half and they aren't even known for them yet.\n\nHistory has literally hundreds of awesome car companies that never figured out how to sell their amazing products at a profit. People don't buy cars unless they think they'll be able to get service and parts for them in 5 years. That's why Rivian does all the other things around charging and brand and making sure people can see them in the market, they want people to feel like they're going to be there in 5 years and they won't be stuck with a aging car no one wants and you can't get parts for.\n\nThere's only going to be one Tesla story, just like you wouldn't build a car company today based on Henry Ford's success. Rivian has two years of money, and plans for the next 6 or 7 years. The long term plans will not matter if people start thinking they won't be around in 5 years, or even giving that a 50/50 chance. They do not have a high-profile billionaire to smooth out the early lumps.\n\nCar companies go out of business because they can't sell cars for a profit or because they build up too much debt. Rivian is on the wrong side of both of those equations right now. I thought they knew that and were acting accordingly. If they can only sell 10,000 cars a quarter, fine, but don't spend time and energy building capacity for 400,000 then.\n\nI love the cars, I love the company, they've done a great job at getting the word out and building an enviable brand. I can appreciate how hard that was. But building cars at a profit should be the #1 job of everyone there from this point until they turn a quarter without burning money, and they aren't doing that very well.\n\nThe moment non-enthusiasts start questioning if they'll be around in 5 years is the moment they go from a Tesla competitor to someone's version of [AC Propulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_Propulsion). Maybe VW, maybe someone else, but it won't work out for Rivian as anything more than a niche.",

That's how we get better at this stuff.\n\nHybrid has become the preferred option for people in the US. Car makers are actually moving their EV plans to hybrid now. Will it change again? Maybe, but dismissing hybrid cars in 2024 doesn't make sense and I'm not worried about it hurting my credibility in terms of business decisions or evaluating companies.\n\nFrom Washington Post - [Why you're more likely to buy a hybrid now than an EV](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2024/05/27/hybrid-electric-vehicle/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hrtc0v4087td1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=b09052e293bfee1a08c85a233f8d39dead2aa02b\n\nBest of luck in your YOLO. I'm on the same side and hope Rivian turns things around, but believe they'll need to trim their aspirations temporarily. That's not personal.",
