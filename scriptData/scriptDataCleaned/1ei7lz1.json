  "selftext": "Nintendo on Friday reported revenue and profit that plunged in the company’s fiscal first quarter, as sales of the ageing Switch console decline.\n\nHere’s how Nintendo did in its fiscal first quarter ended June 30. versus LSEG estimates:\n\nRevenue:  246.6 billion Japanese yen ($1.65 billion) versus 289.61 billion yen expected.\n\nNet profit:  80.9 billion Japanese yen versus 70.73 billion yen expected.\n\nNet sales lost 46.5% year-on-year, while net profit fell 55.3%.\n\nNintendo sold 2.1 million units of its flagship Switch consoles, down 46% on the year.\n\nInvestors are looking out for news surrounding a successor to the Nintendo Switch console to reinvigorate its gaming business. The company previously said that the next-in-line device will be announced in the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2025.\n\nNintendo also previously said that it expects to sell 13.5 million units of the existing Switch console model in this period. The company stuck to that forecast on Friday.\n\nThe Switch is now more than seven years old and is the company’s second-most successful console by unit sales, after the Nintendo DS. Throughout its lifetime, Nintendo has revamped the Switch with a better display and ridden the wave of popularity of games featuring well-known characters like Mario and Zelda, which helped sustain sales in the long term.\n\nThat effect appears to have faded. Nintendo did not release any blockbuster games in the June quarter, while the company’s software sales fell 41% year-on-year to 30.64 million units.\n\nThe Japanese gaming giant has announced a string of games due out in the coming months, featuring well-known characters like Mario and Donkey Kong.\n\nIn the face of slowing console sales, Nintendo has also been trying to license out its intellectual property for use everywhere from movies to theme parks. The company is working on an animated Super Mario movie, which will be produced by Illumination and is scheduled for release in 2026. Nintendo hopes this will continue to attract users to its video games.\n\nDespite this push, sales from the mobile and intellectual property-related part of the business fell 54% year-on-year to 14.7 billion yen.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/nintendo-profit-plunges-55percent-as-sales-of-its-ageing-switch-console-fall.html",

      "body": "I have a steam deck. But nothing beats playing Mario cart with the wife and the 7 year old son. The switch has a “family” vibe to it with all the age appropriate Mario games they have. When the brother in law upgraded to oled, he gave his old switch away to us, so the son has a switch and I have mine. He loves playing pal patrol and sponge bob on it.\n\nPlus I know all y’all remember the 64. I’ll always have a place in the heart for Nintendo even with other consoles and handheld systems coming to market.  \n\nYeah stock price has bounced between 10-15 for the past 5 years. But look at the all time chart. 2014 to now doesn’t look bad. Its a decent swing play. Get in at 10-11, sell at 14-15, assuming it goes up. Even if you swing a dollar in each direction. That’s still 15-20% gain. Anything >10% gain is a decent roi in my book.",
