  "selftext": "You have to feel at least a little sorry for bears on this one. Misses earnings by a lot . Not like a couple million but a couple BILLION . 52c eps expected vs 45c eps reported. Its largest drop in demand since covid when supply was cut in half. Free cash flow  -2.5B vs -600m expectation. Tesla bottomed at $100 last year on much better earnings than this.  \nBut yet stock absolutely moons because why? They’re making a shitty value car ? Maybe possibly by the end of the year ? \nEarnings literally couldn’t have came in any better for bears but it does the complete opposite. What a wild market. ",

But if something is seemingly guaranteed, it's already priced in, and people don't understand the price function. which is why it'll fluctuate upwards occasionally even when the financial reports are weak. There is nobody manipulating it, it's working just like the market should work when people are emotional and jumpy.",
