      "body": "They have flattering jeans with a variety of size options. They have curve love which is for people with smaller waists and bigger hips who usually have to size up or wear stretchier pants. In addition, they have extra short, short, regular, long, and extra long inseams. A lot of retailers don’t even sell long lengths or only make long lengths starting at higher waist sizes which doesn’t work for the tall people with small waists. I just bought tall 34” inseam pants from Levi’s and they were actually 32” when I measured and not long enough for pants that aren’t skinny jeans. Had to return. Skinny jeans are less popular so baggy/flare pants make inseam length more important. There are very few retailers that do this and are actually flattering/trendy. In addition, they make tall length mini dresses which is also harder to find. There’s more going into it, but as a taller woman (5’9” - so not even very tall) that’s my take. Also the back pockets are nice, which I can’t say the same for American eagle. So for jeans right now, imo, they have little competition for people with specific body types and are trendy for regular ones too.",
