  "selftext": "there is a distinction from legitimate market crashes vs illegitimate market crashes. **Note these terms are just placeholders for a better term which may be used to describe them**\n\n# 'Legitimate':\n\nA market crash that is legitimate is a response to overvalued stocks. Such as a bubble with overvalued stocks:\n\nlike stock A,B,C,D,... is trading at $1000,$800,$600,$900,...\n\nwhen they are fair-valued worth $400, $700, $200, $700,....\n\nIe, they are overpriced. Since their true fair value is *indeterminate*, yet we know its **overvalued**, it causes a long term market crash while the market *tries to figure out the actual values.* So it goes crashes for a long time, making a volatile bear market. This is as opposed to a transient 1-day correction\n\nThis type of market crash is legitimate: it is in response to wrongly valued assets that should not be that value. It was good, and should have happened.\n\nDecision: SELL. The crash is reflective of an actual problem in the overall market. Will be long term volatile bear market.\n\n# 'Illegitimate':\n\nA market crash that is illegitimate is caused by for example:\n\n-one single pension fund going bust, selling off their entire portfolio.\n\nIn the case of a pension fund going bust and selling everything, this will drive down prices of the stocks they are selling.\n\nHowever, this loss in value of those stocks **is not representative of those stocks being wrongfully valued or overvalued**. If the pension fund owned Cheese Semiconductor and dumped their entire portfolio then Cheese Semiconductor stock dropping does ***not mean that Cheese Semiconductor makes a bad or defective product***. IE, the crash is transient, and you should buy on these types of crashes, as they are *not corrections on the fair value of the overall market. EVEN THOUGH the entire market will crash during these events*  \nDecision: buy, the crash is not reflective of some kind of actual problem in the overall market. Will be transient.\n\n# BOJ:\n\n# >>>>The question is, what category above would this BOJ crash be placed in? Signaling a REAL legitimate problem in the market (meaning a long term bear market is ahead). OR, just a transient event that will blow over?<<<<",

SO, I was thinking that if a head fund manager sees a big red number, they would try and figure out if the negative was short term or long term and may investigate fundamentals like PE ratios. If they do this they might see that a lot of stocks are overvalued at the moment. SO, my conclusion is that fat corpos will think that they cant just sit and watch numbers go up forever and that the market might actually move to a point of fair value causing them to sell.",
