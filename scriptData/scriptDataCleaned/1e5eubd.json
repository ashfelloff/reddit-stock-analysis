There is a short sighted bump because people \"feel\" like they will be good for the economy and the tax cuts are going to help everyone...then you get the 2008 recession or the COVID recession etc...\n\nThe last five recessions all started while a Republican was in the White House (Reagan. G.H.W. Bush, G.W. Bush twice, and Trump)\n\nA remarkable 9 of the last 10 recessions have started when a Republican was president. \n\nSo sure, you can maybe take advantage of a short term bump the first few months, and then the likelihood that the entire worldwide economy goes to shit is high.\n\nSo small gains and then big losses. It's characteristic really of Republican policies, really short sighted economic policies that sound good, but do jack shit for people in the medium-long term.",
