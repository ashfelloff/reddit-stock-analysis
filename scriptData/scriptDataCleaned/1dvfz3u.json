Good investment?\n\n(Reuters) -BlackRock has launched a 'buffer' exchange-traded fund that seeks to offer a 100% downside hedge to risk-shy investors looking to tap the equity markets, the world's largest asset manager said on Monday.\n\nSo-called buffer or risk-managed ETFs help maximize returns from an asset for investors and simultaneously provide downside protection over a specific period.\n\nThe novel product will likely appeal to investors who are hoping to ride a rally in the stock markets as they continue to trade near record highs, but are concerned that a slowing economy and higher-for-longer interest rates can together hurt sentiment going forward.\n\nBuffer ETFs also typically see lower redemption requests during times of heavy market volatility.\n\n\nThe iShares Large Cap Max Buffer Jun ETF started trading on Monday under the ticker symbol 'MAXJ'.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-launches-stock-etf-100-144057919.html",

      "body": "It's not a great trade although it sounds good.\n\nIf you buy $100 of this ETF and the market goes down, in 1 year you should still have $100 (actually $99.50 due to management fee).\n\nBut currently you can lock in 5% yield risk free if you invest in treasuries. So if you had invested that $100 in treasuries then you'd have $105 in 1 year from now. So you missed out on 5% gain.\n\nThe way they fund the downside hedge is by selling a call that caps your gain at ~10% (and also using the 5% interest that your money generated). So in 1 year you could make anywhere from 0-10%. Which isn't really that exciting given that you could guarantee a 5% return risk free investing in Treasuries.\n\nIf you're worried about the market going down then just buy Treasuries and lock in 5%. If you think it's going to go up then just buy stocks. If you're in the middle then just do a mix. This product would only make sense if you specifically think the market will be up, but only between 5-10%.\n\nI worked in the option market for 10yrs and I am simplifying things, but that is the gist of this product.",

You'd have to sell a closer call option to finance the hedge, since there isn't as much interest to help pay for it. Basically the main reason they're able to offer this product and make it look semi attractive is because of rates not being zero. Having spent most of my career in a zero rates world even I was initially tempted before remembering that rates are 5%.\n\n> I guess it could be for people who want to gamble a bit to get more money but really want to make sure that they don't lose their original amount. \n\nYeah, for people who are really against any loss of their principal it can be an optically attractive strategy. But if the risk free rate is 5% and they earn 0%, they should consider that as a 5% loss. I know that's not how most people's brains work though.",
