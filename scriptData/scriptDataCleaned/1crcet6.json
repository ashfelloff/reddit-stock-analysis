If we think of these dating apps as ads for ourselves and we want click-through rates and such that’s a horrific rate. My actual right-swipe rate is at least 60% it seems as well which is the stat that really matters to keep people paying because you want women (the other side of the market) to stay as well.\n\nAdditionally, my self esteem took a bit of a hit directly due to these apps’ distortions when I’m not doing very well in that department. Some really awesome women I met and trust to be brutally honest with me are pretty shocked I’m not drowning in likes just like them (2k+ is typical for them per app).\n\nLastly, the science of dating / attraction really isn’t supported by the recommendation engine style approach of these because successful relationships and attraction tends to be around complements, not just similarities. It would be better if we could only list major deal breakers similar to what’s allowed by employment law and paid for different common preferences / optionality such as race, age, height, dietary preferences, job sector, astrological signs, etc. and we’d see more sustainable user dynamics and therefore business.",

The algorithm is all fucked, all the apps are basically the same now because the Tinder swipe concept has become the core for all apps, and users are so jaded that engagement is low. \n\nDating apps are a terrible business if you want to have high customer lifetime value because if you have a good app that works your CLV is low and if you have a bad app that keeps users stuck on for longer than your CLV is low because your app doesn’t work so users leave. This isn’t a big deal if you’re a private company, realistic growth can be sustained. But if you’re a public company like Match group or Bumble then you’re in a constant struggle to make the app just good enough to keep users on and paying, but not so good that it actually works and they leave the app and stop paying.",
