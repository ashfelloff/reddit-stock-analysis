My actual right-swipe rate is at least 60% it seems as well which is the stat that really matters to keep people paying because you want women (the other side of the market) to stay as well.\n\nAdditionally, my self esteem took a bit of a hit directly due to these apps‚Äô distortions when I‚Äôm not doing very well in that department.

It would be better if we could only list major deal breakers similar to what‚Äôs allowed by employment law and paid for different common preferences / optionality such as race, age, height, dietary preferences, job sector, astrological signs, etc. and we‚Äôd see more sustainable user dynamics and therefore business.",
