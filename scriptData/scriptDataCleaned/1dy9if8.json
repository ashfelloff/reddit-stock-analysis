  "selftext": "# DELTA DAL Stock Fundamental Analysis\n\nRATING: BUY\n\nPRICE TARGET: $50.63\n\nUPSIDE: 10.0%\n\nThe US Economy continues to demonstrate resilience. A leisure stock like Carnival Cruise Line posted great Q2 results and guidance with ‚Äústrong booking momentum, with record volumes for 2025 sailing.‚Äù ([Carnival Stock Breaks Out As '25 Bookings Already Top Full Year '24 | Investor's Business Daily (investors.com)](https://www.investors.com/news/carnival-cruise-q2-earnings/)) What's another stock for leisure? Airlines.\n\n# Why did CCL Stock Rise After Q2 Earnings?\n\n1. Record Financial Performance:\n\nRecord Revenues: Carnival reported record second-quarter revenues of $5.8 billion.\n\nOperating Income: Achieved record operating income of $560 million, nearly five times the 2023 levels.\n\nNet Income: Significant improvement in net income, nearly $500 million higher than 2023, with adjusted net income outperforming March guidance by nearly $170 million.\n\n2. Increased Guidance:\n\nFull Year 2024 Guidance Raised: Carnival raised its full-year net yield guidance to approximately 10.25% and increased full-year adjusted net income guidance by approximately $275 million due to continued strong demand.\n\nPositive Outlook for 2025: Early bookings for 2025 were even higher than 2024 in both price and occupancy, indicating strong future demand.\n\n3. Strong Demand and Bookings:\n\nRecord Customer Deposits: Customer deposits reached an all-time high of $8.3 billion, surpassing the previous record by $1.1 billion.\n\nHigh Occupancy and Prices: The cumulative booked position for the remainder of 2024 was the best on record, with occupancy and prices significantly higher than the previous year.\n\n4. Operational Efficiency and Strategic Moves:\n\nCost Management: Adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per available lower berth day (ALBD) were better than prior year and March guidance due to cost savings and timing of expenses.\n\nStrategic Portfolio Optimization: The decision to sunset the P&O Cruises (Australia) brand and fold its operations into Carnival Cruise Line, along with other strategic reallocations, aimed to optimize the company's brand portfolio and enhance performance.\n\n5. Capital Management and Refinancing:\n\nDebt Management: Carnival continued its efforts to manage its debt profile by prepaying $1.6 billion of its senior secured term loans and repricing other loan facilities. These actions are expected to save significant interest expenses over time and reduce net interest expense by $55 million in 2024.\n\nStrong Liquidity: The company ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of liquidity.\n\nThese positive financial results, along with the raised guidance and strong future outlook, likely contributed to the surge in Carnival's stock price.\n\n# What Happened in DAL Q1 2024\n\n**Positive News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**\n\n1. Strong Operational Performance: Delta achieved industry-leading operational performance with record March quarter completion factors and on-time performance.\n2. Financial Metrics:\n\nRecord Revenue: Operating revenue of $13.7 billion and adjusted operating revenue of $12.6 billion, up 6% from Q1 2023.\n\nEarnings and Cash Flow: Adjusted EPS of $0.45 and operating cash flow of $2.5 billion.\n\nPositive Outlook: Strong guidance for Q2 2024 with expected record revenue, operating margin of 14-15%, and EPS of $2.20 to $2.50.\n\nFull-Year 2024 Guidance: Expected EPS of $6 to $7 and free cash flow of $3 to $4 billion.\n\n3. Corporate and Domestic Travel Demand:\n\nCorporate sales grew by 14% year-over-year, driven by the return of large corporate accounts.\n\nDomestic unit revenues were a record for the March quarter, with a 3% year-over-year growth.\n\n4. International Travel:\n\nInternational passenger revenue was 12% higher than Q1 2023.\n\n5. Revenue Diversification:\n\nDiversified revenue streams, including loyalty programs and premium services, continued to grow.\n\n6. Employee Engagement:\n\n$1.4 billion in profit-sharing payouts, celebrating Delta employees' contributions to operational excellence.\n\n¬†\n\n**Negative News from Delta Airlines' Q1 2024 Earnings Report**\n\n1. Cost Performance:\n\nOperating expense of $13.1 billion and adjusted operating expense of $11.9 billion.\n\nAdjusted non-fuel costs increased by 1.5% year-over-year.\n\n2. Debt Levels:\n\nTotal debt and finance lease obligations were $19.4 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nAdjusted net debt of $20.2 billion at the end of the quarter, though reduced from the previous year.\n\n3. Mixed Revenue Environment:\n\nTotal unit revenue (TRASM) was down 0.7% year-over-year.\n\nHeadwinds from Cargo and MRO impacted revenue growth.\n\n4. Non-fuel Cost Increases:\n\nNon-fuel unit costs are expected to increase by approximately 2% in Q2 2024 and remain at low single-digit growth for the full year.\n\nThe stock's initial jump could be attributed to the strong revenue, operational performance, and positive outlook. The subsequent drop might have been influenced by concerns over rising costs, debt levels, and mixed revenue environment. The stock's rebound in the following month likely reflects investor confidence in Delta's long-term guidance and operational improvements.\n\n**Delta Guidance in Q1 2024 Report**\n\n**For Q2 2024:**\n\nTotal Revenue YoY: Up 5% - 7%\n\nOperating Margin: 14% - 15%\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $2.20 - $2.50\n\n**For FY 2024:**\n\nEarnings Per Share (EPS): $6 - $7\n\nFree Cash Flow: $3 - $4 billion\n\nAdjusted Debt to EBITDAR: 2x - 3x.\n\n# Here‚Äôs Where Its Interesting\n\nFree cash flow is king. The FCF in 2019 was 3.4B. Delta‚Äôs guidance for FCF for 2024 is 3B to 4B. However, the market cap back in 2019 was $37.6B while the current market cap is around 30B. That means Delta still has 7B room for growth in this apples-to-apples scenario.\n\nLet‚Äôs assume the lower end of the FCF guidance at 3B. Using the market cap of 2019 as a reference point, the expected market cap in 2024 would be 32.4B which means DAL could go to $50.63 which is an upside of 10% or a gain of $4.61 per share.\n\n# Market Cap and Free Cash Flow\n\n|DATE|12/31/2019|12/31/2024|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|FCF|3.489B|3B|\n|Mkt Cap|37,681B|30,142B|\n|P/FCF|10.80|10.05|\n\n# Price Prediction Using FCF Guidance\n\n|If 2024 FCF is|3B|\n|:-|:-|\n|Then the expected Mkt Cap is|$32.4B|\n|Therefore, the expected DAL Stock Price is|$50.63|\n|DAL Current Price|$46.02|\n|**Upside $**|**+$4.61**|\n|**Upside $**|**10.0%**|\n\n**Potential Risks**\n\n1. Comparing Delta's 2019 market cap and FCF to today 2024 may not be appropriate. Crude oil was cheaper, and interest rates were lower back in 2019. Crude Oil per barrel was around $59 compared to today at $82. Highest Fed Funds rate in 2019 was 2.42% compared to 5.33% today.\n2. The Free Cash Flow guidance is currently $3B - $4B for 2024. Guidance may need to be upgraded in Q2 earnings to continue the stock momentum. Travel trends could be underwhelming [DAL 46.02 ‚ñº ‚àí2.89% Unnamed (tradingview.com)](https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20240705004989:0/)\n3.
