Now if you’re a more morally flexible seller, like most businesses basically HAVE to operate, to perform for shareholders, the seller could leave out certain items that are BIG problems they know about. That’s kinda where this example falls short. \n\nIf you’re buying a used car you can have an inspection done by whoever you want and look at anything, while selling & buying companies are legally obligated to only show certain things and amounts to each other. (This is done partially so large companies can’t go around saying they are interested in buying others, when in fact they had no intention of buying, but wanted to fact find on their competitors to get an edge). Basically it’s like if the BUYER for a used car had stringent rules for them to only allow them to inspect certain things on the car.\n\nI hope that helps a bit.",

This was their smelting and refining process which took a stupid amount of work to make viable steel at all, and the fact that through it, they split their steel into two grades/types: one hard/brittle and better for edges, wrapped around a core made of steel that was more pliable and flexible. The only thing that made the steel passable, was that the only other steel it needed to compete with, was other Japanese steel. If you put Japanese steel against European weapons and armor, it would lose every time. This is also why the Japanese didn’t really wear steel armor, there just wasn’t enough of it to dedicate to anything other than weapons. If you tried to swing a katana against steel armor, it would just break. The shit was useless outside of Japan.\n\nEdit: Just to add on to make my point, traditional Japanese architecture doesn’t even use nails. That’s how little iron there was to go around.",

Quite a few farmers seemed happier to get a government subsidy vs produce a product\n\nI found this [https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CHN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/Food](https://wits.worldbank.org/CountryProfile/en/Country/CHN/Year/LTST/TradeFlow/Import/Partner/by-country/Product/Food)\n\nLooks like China almost double their imported value of USA food from 2020 ->2021 (2020 and 2019 are pretty consistent for Chinese imports of USA food).  Im curious if the trend continues in 2022/23/24.\n\nOne of my Chinese friends asked me to help her find a \"pork processor\" in the USA as they wanted to buy containers of pork products. It was amazing how challenging it was to find/get in contact. Furthermore, China has a short list of approved pork producers in the USA, and apparently, the list for USA approved is shrinking while places (like you mentioned) like Brazil have seen a drastic uptick.",

How much inflation are you willing to accept for American goods? 100% inflation? 200% I'm not joking. Try to have an American make a flat screen TV. I've spent 10+ hours looking for bolt manufacturers in the USA that make \"generic\" machine screws (I wanted to buy 1000lbs+ of nuts and bolts). I think I found 2 companies total. They don't like to post pricing, and instead focus upon custom hardware, or hardware that requires extreme traceability (thats how a single bolt can be $80 instead of $0.50 at ace hardware)  \n  \n  \nAre you okay paying double, triple, 5x, 10x the price you are accustomed to paying? This is not unrealistic, there are items I can import that are 10X cheaper than a domestic alternative. Sometimes its even more drastic, I had some equipment get quoted at close to 20x the Chinese price . . FYI, I own a small manufacturing biz in the USA, we buy lots of odds and ends from China because USA not have a robust supply chain of small parts, injection molding, etc. A mold that costs $20k in the USA, cost under $10k in Vietnam, and $1k in China. \n\n\n\nFactories don't tend to make all of the parts they are using on an assembly. They may only make a few key parts, or they may specialize in just the assembly. They still need to get parts from somewhere. There is no cut-out in Trumps tariffs for American manufacturers that purchase small parts from China. No cut outs for purchasing manufacturing/fabrication equipment from China to enable Americans  to replace Chinese items from the market.  \n  \nTrumps tariffs were for national security for high tech items, yet affect items like plastic bottles, cardboard boxes, ancient electronic/pcb technology (from 20+ years), gloves, food items, furniture etc. \n\n  \nIt's not just American wages. Its American EPA laws. It's American property tax lax. It's Federal Tax policy (depreciate the equipment you bought, not expense it!) It's OSHA. It's American labor laws. It's the people protesting factories for being \"dirty\" and claiming its demeaning work. It's the workers mentality(boss makes a dollar, I make a dime..thats why I poop on company time) and work ethic.",
