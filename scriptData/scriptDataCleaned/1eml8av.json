Its gone up big time due to an exclusive contract with MSFT to connect their new AI Data Centers...that from my understanding are going to power their AI product (Copilot). We also secured several contracts connecting other data centers for companies. Supposedly the value of these contracts is in the billions...and our CEO has a very good relationship with MSFT, since she is a former senior employee from there. So it didn't shoot up for no reason, it shot up because of a fat contract getting signed that will pave the way for good earnings in the future. Just giving the background on the spike, I am not telling you to invest in it.",

Morningstar has a target price of 1.50 based on the current financials with a target of 5 dollars with the potential contracts announced. Iâ€™m still apprehensive about it though because those that have been with the company a while saw it fall to 1 dollar a share from 30-40 a share.

There is a soft cap of 200 hours of PTO, so not really \"unlimited\"...but it's a lot. If there is any kind of situation where you would have to take time off, then it is really helpful. For example, my wife is expecting and is taking FMLA for the appointment and things like that.
