  "title": "$ULTA is a solid buy before the earnings",
  "score": 39,
  "selftext": "TL;DR: $ULTA unjustly sold off to low $380 but I'm loading up ahead of earnings next week (I did start buying at $420). Expecting a bounce and break out of the penalty box after what should be solid results. Secular growth story still very much intact for $ULTA\n\n$ULTA got clobbered, after their CEO put his foot in his mouth, dropping from around $570 to the low $380. The CEO made some comments about the worsening economic environment, which let's be honest we can see around us. The sell-off seems like a major overreaction in my opinion, especially with earnings right around the corner next Thursday.  Sure we were expensive at 550 plus, but 380?  \n\nWe just saw $ELF jump over 20% on their earnings beat, demonstrating that the beauty sector is still holding up well despite economic concerns. $ULTA is a best-in-class operator and I expect them to deliver solid results and guidance, sending the stock back higher.\n\nThis dip presents an attractive buying opportunity for long-term investors. The market has put $ULTA in the penalty box, but I'm loading up ahead of earnings because I think they exit that box in a big way with next week's report.\n\nAt these levels around $480, the stock is trading at a reasonable forward earnings with a strong balance sheet and strong earnings still expected going forward. The secular growth story for $ULTA remains very much intact in my view.\n\nI've been adding to my position aggressively in past 4 week and will look to buy more if we somehow see further weakness heading into earnings. But I expect we'll see a sharp reversal higher once the company reassures the Street that beauty demand remains intact.\n\n  \nBuy buy buy!",
