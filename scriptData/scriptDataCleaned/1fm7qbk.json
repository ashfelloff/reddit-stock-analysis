I like the company, I like the stock, and COST is about 1% of my liquid NW so it won't make a difference.\n\nMy holdings are up 90% (purchased in 2021/2022) which is double the leeway I'd like to take a risk on holding. I would not buy the company today but I am more than happy to hold onto my shares. I wouldn't sell them unless the underlying business changed dramatically. Since I'm up 90% I can wait the 8 years and if they're flat I'll probably only barely have lost to my index funds.\n\nI understand they are priced for perfection and that is inherently risky, but their moat (branding) is well taken care of and some grand openings are requiring a police response. That's pretty crazy.\n\nThere are a few legitimate bear points, but my primary concern is the fact that it is a perfectly run company‚Äì eventually somebody foolish may be appointed CEO or board of directors and damage their moat and branding. There are easy ways they could monetize better and double the stock price‚Äì at the cost of their brand. Growth may be slower, but I'm OK with that‚Äì I have index funds that I hope deliver returns. I hope COST beats them (doubt it, but we'll see).\n\nIt's also cool to show up to your favorite store and see every cart filled with $500 of crap when you're a shareholder. Makes me feel like a big shot doing due diligence when all I do is buy index funds. It's fun to think about that sort of thing and would be boring if you didn't own shares.\n\nLastly, they are one of the few companies that display an old-school sentiment about how to run a company. They are one of the last few holdouts against true unchecked corporate greed. I like how they (usually) promote from within (cough, Kroger guy) and treat their employees.... okay (but great for retail). I expect that to change a bit with the Kroger guy, which is unfortunate. \n\nTLDR: I like COST and I'm OK if it doesn't perform. My original comment was more of an irony because of the historical returns and Costco's reputation rather than a thoughtless expectation of continued returns.",
