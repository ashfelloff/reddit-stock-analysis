There was extreme pressure to get the deal done because they would get a huge bonus for getting the deal signed by  a certain date. They of course didn’t tell anyone— not even the VP of Finance about the deal until the last possible minute because they were very secretive— I couldn’t even get a funds flow ex post facto in order to get a transaction cost analysis done— because they paid themselves so much.\n\nThey got the deal signed, and for my work, they gave me 7k.\n\nThey gave themselves 30k per month retention bonuses, 6 figure deal bonuses (and I got 7k) and of course, they got millions for their stock (which is fairly normal and was gonna happen anyway.)

Thats my understanding for how they are counting \"job openings\" and to add to that fugaze, more companies are doing this nowadays where they post the single job to multiple cities. so thats amplifying the fugaze way they count job openings.\n\nFake job openings/postings are also much more prevalent than they were in the past. In that same podcast they explained that companies will post lots of job openings to make it seem like they are in a growth phase and so it looks good for investors.....but theres no actual job openings or hirings happening. Then the traditional fake job posts where companies post to \"keep their options open\" or \"scout talent\" still happen....and they aren't doing any hiring either.\n\nSo yea....in a nutshell the jobs numbers seem very fugaze.",
