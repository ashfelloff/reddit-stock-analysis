  "score": 916,
  "selftext": "Nvidia shares closed at a record on Monday as Wall Street gears up for earnings season and updates from all of the chipmaker’s top customers on their planned spending on artificial intelligence infrastructure.\n\nThe stock climbed 2.4% to close at $138.07, topping its prior high of $135.58 on June 18. The shares are now up almost 180% for the year and have soared more than nine-fold since the beginning of 2023.\n\nNvidia, widely viewed as the company selling the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, has been the biggest beneficiary of the generative AI boom, which started with the public release of OpenAI’s ChatGPT in November 2022. Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) are used to create and deploy advanced AI models that power ChatGPT and similar applications.\n\nCompanies including Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon are purchasing Nvidia GPUs in large quantities to build increasingly large clusters of computers for their advanced AI work. Those companies are all slated to report quarterly results by the end of October.\n\nOf the billions of dollars the top tech companies are spending annually on their AI buildouts, an outsized amount is going to Nvidia, which controls about 95% of the market for AI training and inference chips, according to analysts at Mizuho.\n\nNvidia’s revenue has more than doubled in each of the past five quarters, and at least tripled in three of those periods. Growth is expected to modestly slow the rest of the year, with analysts projecting expansion of about 82% to $32.9 billion in the quarter ending in October, according to LSEG.\n\nNvidia recently said that demand for its next-generation AI GPU called Blackwell is “insane” and it expects billions of dollars in revenue from the new product in the fourth quarter.\n\nWith a market cap of $3.4 trillion, Nvidia is the second most valuable publicly traded U.S. company, behind Apple at about $3.55 trillion.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/14/nvidia-shares-hit-a-record-as-chipmaker-market-cap-tops-3point4-trillion.html",

I know dotcom bubble companies still exist today, but not all of them are good. So who's gonna be there in the future? \n\nI am not sure Instagram will be there, as well as Facebook. I don't want smart glasses. CEO still young, so there's less conservative control and new tech can be explored. \n\nI know Microsoft is going full on AI spy with their windows. So probably I will use Mac. \n\nApple phones are competitive, but OS is the only thing I am interested in rn. Very impressive customer loyalty. \n\nTesla is hot garbage. Leaking, rusting, and potentially chopping people's fingers. Remotely controlled robots sold as autonomous? Marketing catastrophe. They might be around, but I am surely not putting my money into these products. Design wise all their products are bad. Hyperloop is worse than subway. Neuralink is too invasive for every day consumer. Non invasive brain scanners with AI assistance are far superior in terms of consumer adoption, input accuracy can be improved on, but Neuralink accuracy achieved through invasiveness is a dead end medical technology. Just like Hyperloop. CEO is making bad decisions on all fronts except aerospace and it's a small industry.  \n\nGoogle, outside of YouTube is replaceable by other competitors. Apple in particular. I am using Google just because I like it's open mindset. They are the only company holding market from being taken over by apple. \n\nNvidia sells computing power for the next industrial revolution. Drones assisted by AI used in warfare already changed the landscape of war today. We will see robots, even remotely controlled ones, but mostly autonomous due to security in nursing homes, production lines, warehouses, battlefields, home assistance, etc.\nRobotics and AI will be future proof technology. \n\nRight now NVDA is the ONLY  company that has robot training simulations (powered by GPUs), is selling GPUs to other companies that will be competing in the field. Has a truly open AI model that can be modified and is integrated with hardware. Has funds to run it on an open licence long enough that people will trust them in the long haul to learn and become long term clients and users. Many AI companies will use NVDA AI just because it was all they were exposed to when they were starting out in their mother's basement. It is an ecosystem of its own. \n\nAnd their biggest competition in the GPU market is literally their cousin. \n\nJust because they are one of the biggest companies now doesn't mean there's no room for growth. \n\nIntel guy put his entire Nana's inheritance into a dying company with a praying CEO that produces x86 tech that is already being surpassed by ARM in user's numbers since everyone is using mobile devices, and apple is using ARM CPUs more and more. \n\nMicrosoft is still traded to this day. \n\nSo NVDA is ok to buy. Yeah there might be dips and depressions. But will they be in the future? Most likely yes",

When windows shoots itself with AI screen saving your monitor feature, there aren't many options left. Linus which have a reputation of being a nerdy platform, or Mac OS. There will be less people that choose Windows. Also I believe in ARM being superior CPU architecture in the future. \n\nMicrosoft has bad features, but it has OpenAI. But who knows what kind of product they make.  Selling AI picked ads? New tech researched by AI? They need consumers to sell their products. And to control their AI without going rogue. It's tough to decide whether they will crash and burn. Or make super products \n\nRobotics and AI have a future. They may be adopted by mag 7. But windows is doing it all wrong.
