  "selftext": "People will explain this away in various ways but the reality is that throughout history when the yield on the S&P 500 gets to relative extreme lows, forward returns are very poor. The bottom line is that the market is very expensive right now.\n\nThe yield can (and probably will) go a bit lower but there are professional analysts like Gene Munster and Dan Ives calling this a “1995 moment” and I’d like to say those analysts are highly regarded.",

However, in recent years, stock buybacks have become a more prominent method of returning cash to investors. Since yield does not reflect buybacks, this one metric can be misleading.",

It doesn't seem like anyone with any sense is actually predicting this market to continue for years. At best, they just accept that it *could* because the stock market is irrational bullshit based around outright fraud (e.g. legal stock pumping schemes).\n\n\nSo why isn't anyone pulling money out? Isn't the most likely scenario here that the market crashes because everyone starts pulling their money out in expectation of a crash? And what do institutional investors care if they caused it? Shouldn't they ASPIRE to crash it so they can buy back in at a much lower point?\n\n\nOr does my smooth brain just not understand how the market works? There's some complexity I'm missing?",
