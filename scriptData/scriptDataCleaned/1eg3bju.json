  "title": "Starbucks revenue misses estimates as same-store sales decline for second quarter ",
  "score": 150,
  "selftext": "Starbucks on Tuesday reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts’ expectations as both its U.S. and international cafes faced weaker demand.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 93 cents adjusted, meeting expectations\n\nRevenue: $9.11 billion vs. $9.24 billion expected\n\nThe coffee giant reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $1.05 billion, or 93 cents per share, down from $1.14 billion, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier.\n\nExcluding items, Starbucks earned 93 cents per share.\n\nNet sales dropped 1% to $9.11 billion. The company’s same-store sales fell 3% in the quarter, fueled by a 5% decline in transactions.\n\nTraffic to its U.S. stores fell again this quarter, dropping 6%. Domestic same-store sales fell 2%, boosted by an increase in average ticket. Last quarter, executives discussed plans to revive the lagging U.S. business that included leaning on discounts and new drinks to bring back customers who had abandoned the chain.\n\nOutside of North America, same-store sales slid 7%. In China, Starbucks’ second-largest market, same-store sales tumbled 14% as both average ticket and transactions shrank. Starbucks has faced stiffer competition in China from local coffee shops that undercut the coffee giant on price.\n\nStarbucks opened 526 net new stores in the fiscal quarter.\n\nThe company will discuss its outlook for fiscal 2024 on its upcoming conference call. Last quarter, Starbucks slashed its forecast, projecting revenue growth of a low single-digit percentage and earnings per share growth in a range of flat to a low single-digit percentage.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/starbucks-sbux-q3-2024-earnings.html",

Around $70, which is where you could have been buying Starbucks the past few weeks, that's a good deal for this company.

There's no statistical advantage on an entry or an exit. Like the liquidity zones and the exit levels are extremely clear on a daily and weekly basis with the security\n\nIf you were buying that 72 to 73 zone, you have a clear exit around 80-83. If that does not work you continue building the position down at the bottom end of the monthly range. If we break under that 72 floor which has been in play for the past couple years your eyes are at 62 which is where you short an atm put and accumulate more shares, really simple. You also know the long-term guys are going to be waiting for new all-time highs, they have been accumulating this 72 to 75 region and they are looking at 125 plus, if you get numbers like that by 2026, 2027, that's an excellent return.
