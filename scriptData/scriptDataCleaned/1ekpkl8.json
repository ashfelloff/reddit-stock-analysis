Took the opportunity to prep these from doing analysis work and safe to say if this was real money I’d be swimming on crayons rn. Basically converted $300->$8000",

Just shares, no options, and I wanna say I made like 30%+ in the 3 months of the semester. In like 2014, when the market wasn't even fully regarded. \n\nBut can I do that with real money? Fuuuuck no, I barely break even. (Can't even blame options, my options trades are slightly in the green)",
