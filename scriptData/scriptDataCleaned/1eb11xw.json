The problem they have is they are reporting base rates of DiDi rides starting at 18 yuan, which is not true. Their base rate is actually about 6 yuan, only 50% more rather than the nearly 400% more reported in the article.\n\nIf you want to use the same numbers, you'd end up applying a 35% decrease in base fares in the US or other countries, which really isn't much considering you don't have to pay a driver.",

Not all cars are electric, though they do make up a larger proportion of cars there. The biggest difference is of course labor which is very cheap.
