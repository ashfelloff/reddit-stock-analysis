When LULU sold off during its Q3 report last December in AH, it recovered during the next trading day and most of the move was within the first 3 hours. We‚Äôve already had some of the move. I‚Äôm hoping for a peak at 10%, which would be around 285, about 5.5% from where it currently trades. \n\nThe stock is either going red at the open or pumping an additional 5-10%. A lot of it may depend on whether or not analysts downgrade the stock or maintain price targets. I think it‚Äôll be mixed reactions, but few if any price target increases.",
