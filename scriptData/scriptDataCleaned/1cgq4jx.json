I am aware it’s taxed as regular income. And here is the tax brackets for regular income. Like I said 11% between income of $11,000-$44,000. It’s not rocket science and I’m showing proof. Also to the one that said 46%, there’s no such thing as 46% since the highest would be 37% and that’s if you make between 578k and up….",
