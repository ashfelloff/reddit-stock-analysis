  "score": 77,
  "selftext": "I'm very conflicted on this one. Microsoft has been very good to me over the years. Nadella is one of the most effective capitalists of all time. Since I started buying stocks, I've been good at picking great companies but I'm struggling with figuring out if the market wants to overpay me for them. \n\nI like an effective company and I'm willing to pay a high price for it,  but a 34 forward PE is significant. I think the price is hinged too much on AI which to be honest, in terms of development, I think it's not far from a local maxima. It's time to evaluate the capabilities that actually exist as of now, and how much money can they actually potentially bring in for Microsoft. Because right now, in terms of big tech, I'm seeing better value in Google and Amazon.\n\nEDIT: literally all of you think hold (even buy more?) which means top is in. I've gone with the usual inverse Reddit strategy and trimmed a little bit. Thanks guys 😁",

Even with GOOG and AMZN, two of MSFTs biggest competitors who's stock prices also factor AI, I see better value there. Both have way more sane valuations and a huge amount of operating leverage. If AI didn't exist, I think these companies would fall far less than Microsoft.  \n\n\n> new technological industrial revolution  \n\n\nMy thesis is that development of Gen AI has already plateaued, at least for now. I think we'll see slow incremental improvement. Everyone is factoring in exponential growth but that's not usually how things develop especially if you look at the history of AI. ",

They only reason why the AI revenue was 7% was due to supply constraints. I can attest to this being true. Meaning, when you are building on their AI models the throughput is constrained so you can't achieve any real throughput for a production application. 3.5 is great but you wouldn't really want to build on that. GPT 4o is much better and thus their margins and throughput will start to really kick in through 2025 and 2026.\n\nTrust me, there is a reason why this is a great investment and the bedrock of my portfolio.\n\np.s. you don't have to downvote me every time lol i am just talking to you man",
