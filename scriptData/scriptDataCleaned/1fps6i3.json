  "score": 304,
  "selftext": "Ubisoft Entertainment SA shares fell to their lowest in more than a decade after the French video game company cut its outlook on weaker-than-expected sales and delayed the hotly anticipated Assassin’s Creed Shadows.\n\nShares fell 19% to €9.25 at 10:27 a.m. in Paris on Thursday, the lowest since November 2013.\n\nWhile Assassin’s Creed Shadows is “feature complete,” it will now debut Feb. 14 2025, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The game was initially planned for November. The company said it needed more time to improve the game after its recent Star Wars release had underperformed.\n\nUbisoft has over the past couple of years struggled to recover from a pandemic-era production crunch that resulted in delays in the release of new games and canceled titles. Pushing back the latest Assassin’s Creed title means it skips the lucrative holiday period.\n\nUbisoft said it now expects bookings of €1.95 billion ($2.2 billion) in fiscal 2025, which ends in March. Analysts were expecting €2.42 billion, on average, according to a Bloomberg survey.\n\nNet bookings in the fiscal second quarter are now projected to be €350 million to €370 million, the company said. It previously forecast about €550 million.\n\nThe revised targets are mainly a reflection of decisions taken for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and the softer-than-expected launch for Star Wars Outlaws,” Ubisoft said.\n\nStar Wars received middling reviews after its August launch. Ubisoft said it would strive to avoid similar mistakes with Assassin’s Creed Shadows ahead of the holiday season.\n\n“This will enable the biggest entry in the franchise to fully deliver on its ambition,” according to Ubisoft. Unlike prior entries in the Assassin’s Creed series, the upcoming title will not include a Season Pass, which supplied new content in exchange for an added fee.\n\nThe latest guidance miss is Ubisoft’s fifth in six years, said analysts Doug Creutz and Mei Lun Quach from TD Cowen. The board has not held management accountable for “repeated failures in a way that serves the interest of external shareholders,” they added.\n\n“Ubisoft has both high-quality game IP and talented developers; despite that, the last six years have been an almost non-stop parade of game delays, followed by game launches that are still undercooked, as well as misallocation of capital to games that probably never should have been green-lit in the first place,” they said.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/ubisoft-shares-sink-decade-low-083010524.html\n\n",

A bold move, cotton, let's see how it plays out for them\n\nYou're quite naive to how things work. Hypothetical example:\n\nLet's say quality is a set standard. You have a goal to hit a quality level acceptable in 2024. But you encounter so many delays that, to do this, you can only release in 2030\n\nDo you stick to the original scope and release something 6 years out of date by the time it's ready? Your customers hate it anyway - assuming you avoided bankruptcy from no revenue for years\n\nOr do you cut some things out so you can at least get something out earlier, with a hit to reputation but at least you survive? Your customers might dislike it - but less than the first option\n\nObviously, best case scenario is always deliver projects on time, to quality and under budget. But you're very, very laughably naive if you think that happens all the time\n\nTime / cost / quality sacrifices are made all the time - it doesn't mean companies hate their customers.

There's only so many knobs you can turn at once before you just have to test and tune some more.\n\nIf there's only 100 variable values that control the physics system, hiring 300 devs and 500 testers to get it right isn't going to do you much good.

You can pick it out of a lineup of voices 1000/1000 times.  It's obnoxious.  It has no emotion.  It doesn't understand how to pause for drama, how to use inflection properly to emphasize things.\n\nThe same is true for visual art.  If you ask AI to draw you 100 character sprites, you're going to get like 70 different art styles that don't look cohesive together.  Sure....you can try to reign it in with parameters.  You can give it a color palette.  You can train it on a data set that is all of a similar style that it will try to replicate.  But you've removed the human element and made everything cold and \"samey.\"  REAL artists know when they can \"break\" the rules (like using something outside of the standard palette for artistic effect.)  When you remove the artist, you remove all the complexity that makes people *feel* something when they look at it.\n\nThe same is true for code.  You can go to school and learn \"best practices\" all you want.  But there are times in code when it absolutely makes sense to do things that are \"anti-pattern.\"  Things that go against the grain of common sense.  But an AI trained on nothing but textbooks that say \"DO NOT EVER DO THIS\" is never going to reach that unique solution.\n\nPeople who are not software engineers are not qualified to tell me (a degree holding engineer) when or if AI is going to take my job.  You have absolutely NO concept of what it can/can't do in terms of code, you don't have the skills to analyze it appropriately.  You can tell it to write you a bunch of code, and it will spit out a bunch of complex looking stuff. And you, as a non-coder, will look at it and be like \"wow that's wild.\"  But you don't know if it gave you anything useful because you aren't qualified in this field to judge it.\n\nJust like I can give ChatGPT a list of medical symptoms and it will spit out a bunch of medical jargon that looks really smart.  But I am not a doctor.  I am absolutely not qualified to determine whether or not ChatGPT made up a bunch of shit that isn't true.  I don't have the skills or knowledge to make that determination.\n\nThe type of people who think AI is going to take over have a very tenuous grasp of how it even works.  It shouldn't even be called \"intelligence\" because it isn't doing ANYTHING smart.  It works EXACTLY the same way as the predictive text on your phone keyboard.  It takes its best guess as to what the next word in the sentence is.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.  It isn't capable of reasoning (and we aren't anywhere near making a breakthrough to change that.)  AI also isn't capable of understanding the nuances that make people feel *emotional* over *artistic* content.  And it never will.\n\nAt best it is a tool to let existing engineers speed up certain parts of their workflow.  I'm not losing my job to AI.  Not in one decade, or two.

It was such a breath of fresh air to have competitive online Tetris matches back then and the controls were super fluid.\n\nFast forward to Xbox one days. Ubisoft takes over Tetris. Game is complete dog water. Controls are spotty and inconsistent....game modes are awful. No one in multiplayer. They had completely ruined the most basic of games. \n\nSwore I'd never buy a game from them again. It's worked out since then.",
