Australia and Canada, over the last two decades, show that housing to income can get aggressively high in a moderate inflation environment.

Only a few workers can afford the prices, and idiosyncratic regulatory environments prevent productivity improvements in the construction sector.",

The establishment survey shows robust gains in nonfarm payrolls — yet the unemployment rate rose to 4.0%. We believe the latter currently offers a closer approximation of reality than payrolls, as BLS’ model for estimating business births and deaths – which added 231,000 jobs to the nonfarm-payrolls print in May – is lagging the reality of surging establishment closures and falling business formation. We think the underlying pace of current job gains is likely less than 100,000 per month.”",
