It's even worse for gold. If for some reason investing or jewelry becomes unpopular for those metals the price would drop like a rock. You totally ignore the new supply that gets produced each year with this little comparison. If all silver would disappear tomorrow they could produce enough that our world would exist like it did before without silver forks and rings.\n\n[https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/](https://www.silverinstitute.org/silver-supply-demand/)\n\nNon productive assets are inherently volatile because their value can change at a moment's notice with changing markets. Gold had value in the past because it was non corrosive but nowadays it's only value is being shiny shown by it's investment and jewelry usage being a far higher percentage than industrial usage. This whole physical asset thing is an illusion of safety because a changing world is scary for a lot of people.",

It's gonna be literally painful for you to open your brokerage. Your gonna check it less and less because opening it hurts. If you have the balls to hold, you're gonna shut those feelings down. Your gonna stop caring about what's left of your petty investment, and probably lose.\n\nNVDA is more than likely gonna spark a 1.5 month rally and SPY $580. After the 1.5 months, market will probably crash down to todays levels or $540, but it ain't going to $520.",
