The entire reason why Intel's valuation is so depressed is because there is so much uncertainty about their future. If it was a \"good\" company with strong future prospects the valuation wouldn't be in the shitter. \n\nIt's easy to look at companies like Microsoft or AMD with the benefit of hindsight but it wasn't that long ago that people thought those companies were terrible investments.",

Sabotaging AMD and becoming favorites with everyone were great moves from Intel in retrospect, sitting on their laurels for 10 - 15 years was absolute dogshit.\n\nIf you think AMD wouldn't done the same first chance they get, you will one day be very disappointed.\n\n[https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/11/23867991/starfield-pc-performance-amd-nvidia-intel-digital-foundry-analysis](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/11/23867991/starfield-pc-performance-amd-nvidia-intel-digital-foundry-analysis)\n\nAMD and Nvidia also receive a lot of criticism for sitting on their laurels, not progressing enough and pricing everything as high as they possibly can, which in turn gives Intel and Apple openings in the space if they can grab it, which Apple once did with their absolutely insane M1 chip.\n\nDon't get stuck on one thing, especially when investing, there are still people angry at AMD for burning down their PCs and for they were angry for a good reason, they used to be laughing stock and dangerous purchase for a a long time, but now they fail to see all the progress they made, when investing keep your eyes open to changes, its a very fierce competition.''",

With Chinese tensions always high and Taiwan always under threat of China it eases a lot of nerves to know we can shift production to domestic areas where there are no threats or disruptions.\n\nPair that with tax incentives and grants to get started, as well as countless billions in government/military contracting and Intel will be doing fine. Do I expect a 100x? No. But Intel to become very profitable and establishing a large market share of all chip fabrication is not an unreasonable endpoint.
