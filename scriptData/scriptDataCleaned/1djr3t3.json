  "selftext": "There is a massive bull case for AMD this year. Xilinx acquisition is going to help them hone their software to catch up to Cuda. Lisa is all hands on deck right now to catch up. They copied nvidia’s roadmap and are releasing GPU’s yearly to match Nvidia release schedule. She keeps saying we’ll keep you updated as the year goes on about guidance updates for AI revenue, right now it’s at 4 billion, already revised upwards by 0.5 billion at last earnings. High chance it gets revised up again at the next one in July. She said they have supply to deliver “significantly” more than 4 billion if demand is there. Meta and msft are already confirmed buyers. Msft ceo has hyped the shit out of mi300. stock is going back up to 200 by end of year but you guys ignore this and keep trying to chase nvidia to 4 trillion",

I used to be bullish on AMD winning AI given they have a solid server business, but the AI demand quickly shifted to graphics chips and AMD is just behind there. NVDA is only solidifying their lead with their software advantage, so even if AMD catches up, they are going to be up against NVDA inertia. \n\nThat said, I think AMD is undervalued here. They don't need to be number 1 to have massive earnings potential. Their hardware is good and they have locked in supply from TSM in a shortage market. They are also going to benefit from the upcoming consumer cycle. Their dominance over Intel is going to yield additional revenue there as well. I've got some debit spreads for November betting on a surge back to 200+ in the second half of the year.",

In explaining (1), account for how or why companies will be interested in switching from CUDA to ROCm, under what circumstances, and whether you think companies will switch outright or merely have some projects on ROCm while keeping a majority of their work on CUDA.\n\n3. Meta and MSFT buying AMD offerings is compatible with keeping a majority stake in Nvidia hardware and CUDA, thus, you'll need to explain the mere fact that Meta and Msft are buying is a bullish indicator as opposed to neutral.\n\n4.

          "score": 28,
          "body": "Your skepticism is understandable, but let’s delve deeper into why AMD’s position is more promising than it might initially appear.\n\n1. Xilinx Acquisition and Catching Up to CUDA\n\nThe acquisition of Xilinx is a strategic move that goes beyond simply bolstering AMD’s hardware portfolio. Xilinx specializes in adaptive computing solutions, particularly FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), which are known for their flexibility and efficiency in processing parallel workloads. Integrating Xilinx’s technology allows AMD to enhance its software capabilities, particularly with its ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) platform.\n\nCatching Up to CUDA: CUDA, developed by Nvidia, has been the gold standard for GPU computing in AI and high-performance computing (HPC). CUDA’s strength lies in its robust ecosystem and mature software stack, which includes libraries, compilers, and tools optimized for Nvidia hardware. By leveraging Xilinx’s expertise, AMD aims to refine ROCm to offer similar levels of performance and ease of use, thus providing a compelling alternative to CUDA.\n\n2. Switching from CUDA to ROCm\n\nWhy Companies Might Switch:\n\n\t•\tCost-Effectiveness: AMD’s GPUs typically offer competitive performance at a lower price point compared to Nvidia. For businesses looking to optimize costs without sacrificing performance, this is a significant incentive.\n\t•\tOpen-Source Advantage: ROCm is open-source, which means companies can customize it to their specific needs, fostering innovation and flexibility that is harder to achieve with CUDA’s closed ecosystem.\n\t•\tIntegration with Existing Systems: The inclusion of Xilinx’s adaptable hardware makes it easier for companies to integrate AMD solutions into their existing infrastructure, providing a seamless transition from CUDA to ROCm.\n\nPartial Adoption: It’s likely that companies will initially adopt a hybrid approach, using ROCm for specific projects while continuing to rely on CUDA for established workflows. Over time, as ROCm matures and demonstrates its capabilities, a more substantial shift could occur.\n\n3. Meta and Microsoft Buying AMD\n\nBullish Indicator: When industry giants like Meta and Microsoft invest in AMD’s offerings, it signals confidence in AMD’s technological advancements. These companies are leaders in AI and cloud computing, and their adoption of AMD solutions can drive broader market acceptance. It’s not just about diversifying their hardware portfolio; it’s about recognizing the potential of AMD’s technology to meet future demands.\n\nStrategic Investment: Even if Meta and Microsoft continue to use Nvidia hardware, their significant investments in AMD indicate a strategic move to balance their dependencies and foster competition. This can stimulate further innovation and lower costs, benefiting the entire industry.\n\n4. Nvidia’s Countermoves\n\nProduct Strategy: Nvidia is likely to continue advancing its CUDA platform and hardware offerings, possibly introducing new features or optimizing performance. However, AMD’s combination of competitive pricing, open-source flexibility, and enhanced software capabilities through Xilinx provides a strong counterbalance.\n\nBusiness Strategy: Nvidia might adopt aggressive pricing strategies or exclusive partnerships to retain market share. Yet, the industry’s move towards open standards and cost efficiency plays into AMD’s strengths, potentially mitigating Nvidia’s defensive measures.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe bullish case for AMD hinges on its strategic acquisitions, technological advancements, and growing acceptance by major industry players. While Nvidia remains a formidable competitor, AMD’s unique value propositions position it well for substantial growth and increased market share in the coming years.",

For AMD with such a small starting market share, this is significant.\n\n\n> Attend to how Nvidia might counter these moves in product or business strategy\n\n\nReduce their margins.

Not just due to P/E but due to a lot of new uncertain products. Yes they exist, but have no real life benchmarks. I leave the big gains for people who like to gamble, if the benchmarks are decent, there's still plenty of uncertainty in the market. Will AI hold the index after election ? Or will everything go boom ? So many questions people can't answer. It's nice to be positive and of course in general market will always be more bullish than bearish in longer term, but in 1 year many things can happen. Intel has also promising GPUs and CPUs which could lead to win over some market as well, which would lead to AMDs stock fall too. In all honesty I'd rather be bullish on Intel now due to the sheer fact that lastly it won over 3% of the market from AMD again. It's not much, but it's something.",

And I don't care that AMD is not first etc. What I mean by that is, even if the product is decent but everyone bets on reliability/being sure of the performance of NVidia, AMD will suffer losses. NVidia closes a lot of deals to help boost chip production which could be another nail in the coffing if they will have enough of their chips in the market. \n\n\nWhile I do believe AMD knows what they are doing now since they were on a brink of bankruptcy before they released Ryzen CPUs, everything can happen and if odds are against I'd rather go with momentum to take small profit than gamble out and have achance to lose a lot bigger number ",

Maybe 3 years for software and another 7 years for adoption. Sorry but if AI and the parallel computing is still popular in the next 5 years there is no competition for Nvidia.\n\nWhy do you think nobody is using Intel's Open-API? It's great, easy to learn and actually can run several platforms including Nvidia.  But it can't beat CUDA on Nvidia and companies don't see point in using a flexible tool for development when they know they can set requirements to a Nvidia GPU and people are still going to buy their software and hardware products. Example? See Zed camera, and almost any of AI inspection software that exists in the market. Nobody bats an eye when they announce support for FPGA because buying a Nvidia card is cheaper and easier to setup than FPGA. Well, Just my two cents.",
