However, it seems they don‚Äôt realize that their efforts to empower women through various agendas have fallen on deaf ears. For the time being, the silent majority is still in power. They aren‚Äôt having the children to keep that power though. I speculate that Bernie probably could have beaten him, maybe not the first time, but this time. Yeah, he checked boxes. He's white, male, and more intelligent than the opposition. Thats all it took to beat him last time. There is enough Latino males that are going to go traditional. It will be interesting to see what happens in the market over the next few months. Will the market continue strong or are bloody waters awaiting? Both are highly profitable depending on how you play it.",
