Beyond the childish fascination with the products and experiences many of us had, it seemed like the other gaming companies and companies within the gaming space who have dramatically increased valuation or present good sales like Microsoft and Activision, Google, Sony, etc.\n\nThings about Nintendo to consider right now are:\n\n• Saudi investment has watered down the Japanese cultural control which was integral to the relaunching of this card company as a video game leader.\n\n• Banjo Yamauchi is notably not involved, and a lot of the gaming masters who created the IP the world knows and loves are at retirement age or elder, which is cause for concern in terms of their dominance in making games.\n\n• Their online store is saturated with sub-par games which is weakening their brand.\n\n• They've never been a stock intended on making huge gains, with lacking options played on them.\n\n• They haven't yet regained the stock value they had prior to the financial crisis, which shows some kind of peg to the American economy, which may hinder their growth.\n\n• The Yen carry trade is still a risk for all Japanese companies such as Nintendo.\n\n• Universal's film relationship may steer them in a direction that takes them away from their core competency.\n\nIn my opinion the company needs a bold strategy that positions them to defeat competitors and/or grow dramatically. Their dividend isn't much, either.\n\nGood luck with it, but I think you might be disappointed.",

Pokémon is hit a rocky road recently and with the announcement of palworld which was getting so much media attention and it was just in a beta to the point they was paying streamers not to talk about palworld. And one of the reasons why they decided to take a new approach was that game now the issue with that is they're not releasing no information on it so that people can critique it. Which everyone is excited for it because of the legends game everyone is a bit cautious because they know that pokémon has a rocky thing with ruining something good \n\nOn top of that the Nintendo has a problem with people having emulators for the switch even if the new switch comes out there will be an emulator that will be able to play all of those games That's a loss and revenue because there's no reason to buy a game if you know how to get the emulator. \n\nNot to mention the new Nintendo switch really seems like to be new hardware and most likely what they're going to do is they're going to charge extra $100 which will draw people away from the new Nintendo switch if all it is is a few extra features and a bigger screen because most people play the switch dock  anyway \n\nI can go on and on about how bad Nintendo is going to be for next year I mean it's not going to be god-awful but it's also not going to be game-changing and them actually taking the market with the release of the Xbox and PlayStation games that people have been awaiting and then you have Nintendo really not putting out much they're off to a very big Rocky start.",

Issue is that Nintendo has been achieving that since Switch 1 launched.\n\nMaybe the other play is increased margins on Switch 2 but I suspect they will protect their software sales and keep the same pricing with their console being higher cost but mainly that is Nintendo passing on extra costs.\n\nOP posting like they know what Nintendo was announcing before Switch One came out.",

Just a lot of wishful thinking from the looks of it. Nostalgia and good feelings will only get you so far. We saw how the WiiU did (spoiler: not great). Even as a gamer, I'm going to have to see some incredibly crazy things to convince me to go out of my way to spend $300+ on something similar to something I already own, and I'm sure most everyone out there has similar feelings. As much as we love entertainment, it would really have to be something drastically different for us to consider it worthwhile\n\nNintendo hates its customers in a very unique way. They refuse to put popular first-party titles on sale even years after their initial release date. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was released in April 2017 and it's still going for $60 on their online store. Smash Ultimate released in October 2018 and it's also still $60. TOTK released in May of last year and is still going for $70. Imagine how much money they miss out on when they refuse to lower the prices. Several people, myself included, purchase used games as a result--that's money that could've gone to Nintendo had they simply reduced their prices over time.\n\nThere's also the problem with Nintendo's refusal to create ways to play their older titles. They refuse to port popular games to their newer consoles, but throw lawsuits at anyone who dares to make it possible to relive their childhood. So players are left with the decision to either pay an arm and a leg to play things the \"right\" way or resort to emulating. I don't know much about game developing, but I can't imagine it would be that difficult to put ports out and sell it for a reduced price relative to how time has passed since the original release",

No idea how the Saudis will influence this long term.\n\n-Universal/illumination partnership. Nintendo has to micromanage their IPs used by universal or they will go to shit. The Mario movie was only a success because of Nintendos heavy involvement, they need to continue to micromanage.\n\n-quality control: their switch joy can was an absolute disaster. They repair like every second joy con controller due to stick drift and they didn’t manage to solve this issue since 2017. that is ridiculous. If they can’t get a hold on this long term it will seriously damage their reputation.",

You'd be dumb to pick the Switch over a similarly priced steam deck with far far far superior performance, a far superior game library. I think Nintendo has peaked as a company. They really can't possibly do better than the switch than re-releasing the switch with improved tech, but again, why buy it when I can buy a steam deck instead? I can play switch games on a steam deck. I can play gamecube games on the steam deck. I can play PC games in the steam deck. Why bother with Nintendo now if all they're going to release is another portable console?",

The mobile space is flooded and people have less interest in a console that is as limited in scope of games as a Nintendo one would be. They are better off leaving the hardware market or paring up with other manufacturers. We haven’t seen much innovation in the mobile space in recent years because it’s just playing catch up to modern pc hardware. \n\nI’m not sure what Nintendo can innovate on here if anything this time around but they have had 10 years to think about it.
