Eventually I sat down and locked in, strictly sticking to my plan (for the most part) and staying much more conservative than I was over the course of last month. Mostly stuck to SPY/QQQ calls w/ far out exp. dates\n\nI could've held given my calls were ITM, but with next week I didn't want to risk it going into the weekend.\n\nConscious is telling me to put a chunk into ETFs and maybe play with 1k or so w/ the same strat to see what happens. Next week could be fun",

If you make good money and can save 9k in a few months then please up the size of your bets and you win (and loose) more. But I mean if you thought you’d be loosing you wouldn’t be doing this shit. So go try and get it. \n\nIf you’re poor as fuk then take the 9k as a head start invest it safely and never touch options again.",
