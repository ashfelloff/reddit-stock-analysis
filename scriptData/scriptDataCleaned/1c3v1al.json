The hard part is the golden rule, never use more than 1-10% of your account on a trade. Alot of people dont understand this. The class i took kept saying, non of this technical stuff matters if you dont understand the account management part. \n\nSo i get it, this meme is true, but just because it doesnt work for you, doesnt mean in doesnt work for others. Im not tryna brag, but lets just say, i never have to work a 9-5 EVER in my life. best 200$ I ever spent.",
