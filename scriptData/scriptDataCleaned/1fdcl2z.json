However, we need governments to organise infrastructure, services like firemen, hospitals, electricity, water and that requires way more then 5% tax.\n\nTaxes are high in the Scandics also but business is run very capitalistic. We have seen time and time again that if business are left to their own devices they will put the money away and exploit domestic and international countries. \n\nThere are many small business' continually opening and creating jobs in all economic types. \n\nI bet you think America is capitalist too but it is far from the original definition of Capitalism.

The sandwich is an ownership chain, where the profit is taken from the company located in the country with the lowest tax rate... from there it is then transferred to the holding that finally owns everything.

              "body": "So, I guess if the goal of every country is to watch out for the world over their own citizens, then this makes sense, but it is clear as day that importing high pay jobs, which generate net positive tax revenue even after giving a company a discount on one specific tax is a net positive for the country importing said jobs. Assuming they are looking out for their own citizens over the citizens of other nations then the sort of deal made here makes sense.\n\nNow, to be clear, it 100% makes sense that the EU would oppose this as they don't care about Irish citizens more than the citizens of other EU countries. They shut this down because they didn't want business heading to Ireland over other EU countries, directly harming Ireland and it's citizens for the benefit of other EU nations.\n\nThis is clear as day the EQ stomping on a member nation (at the time) for its own gain. Maybe you think that is a good idea, and fine otf that is the case, that doesn't change the fact that the EU shat on the sovereignty of Ireland with his move.",
