I understand there's a common assumption that they are dual sourcing with TSMC. At this point they have only announced they *will* be using 20A for the compute tile and have *not* announced any TSMC alternate. So some of the unofficial information floating around certainly isn't lining up and it will be quite interesting to Intel explain away how their first 6 months of production will be all-TSMC when they still haven't even announced dual sourcing.\n\nI do appreciate that they're at least *trying* to do a turnaround rather than just managing it into eventual bankruptcy. I wouldn't want to own or short INTC at this valuation but it's definitely on my wait and see list.",

No Intel node can currently support the new chips, which is changing, and considering just how many fabs Intel is building in the coming years, along with their investments into ASML's new High NV machines(Owning 5-6 of them by end of 2024, while TSMC and Samsung own none) it looks like Intel won't be at a disadvantage for long, but rather a major ADVANTAGE over TSMC\n\n-Nvidia has already committed to using Intel fabs, and they would never expect AMD to use their fabs. They're getting a lot of enterprise customers like Microsoft, and should pull more clientele in the future. Again, Gaudi has the same scenario as consumer chips, and once 18A opens they'll be made by Intel\n\n-The employee argument is dumb. Intel has more segments than any other chip company, including manufacturing, CPUs, Embedded, wireless 5g and networking, automotive, graphics, and many others. They have so many employees because they support more of the chip industry than you could even begin to imagine. \n\n-How are they meant to plan around a war? They thought it would be nothing, plenty of other chipmakers have offices and fabs in Israel, and Intel has had a long standing relationship with Israel. They plan on holding the commitment to build it in the future, and right now it was mainly just expansions to existing plants\n\n-Fabs get delayed all the time. TSMC has had their fab get delayed even more than Intel. When you're building the most advanced factory in the world, yeah, you're gonna run into a few hiccups.\n\nNow that I've addressed each of your points, I really want to point out just how little credit you're giving Intel management. Pat was basically given the company equivalent of the 2008 Detroit Lions to run. It was a complete mess. They hadn't been innovating for decades, instead pumping out the same crap. Fabs hadn't been built or upgraded, and while TSMC was cracking their new nodes, Intel was still stuck on 14nm(BTW, 10nm for Intel is the same as 5nm for TSMC, ignore the difference, it's just how they do things). Pat immediately got to work and has done a great job positioning the company in the new chip ecosystem. The fact that 18A isn't even up and corporations are already excited to use it says something. Intel has also done a great job of competing on the server and consumer side, and their new consumer and enterprise chips should blow all of us away.

Nvidia chooses Intel because they're stateside, TSMC is already packed, Intel 18A is THE most advanced node in the world, and Nvidia wants to spark competition to drive TSMC prices down. You're ignoring why Intel chose to use TSMC, and it isn't because they wanted to, it's because they HAD to. They physically didn't have the fab space or advancement to make chips for some of their most recent chips, most notably the Ai and GPU based. This is because of years of underinvestment, alongside the fact that Intel fabs are not suited for the high count, smaller cores that GPUs and Ai accelerators use. Once 18A is finished, it'll all change.",

Nvidia has plenty of reasons to use Intel fabs other than price, and Nvidia doesn't consider Intel to really compete. Nvidia just needs space, and Samsung isn't caught up to the same level as TSMC and Intel. That's also just ignoring the stateside manufacturing, which is a huge bonus for Nvidia.
