Is this justified?\n\nTheir partnership with Microsoft and integration with Copilot sounded like a good opportunity to increase their customer base. A step in the right direction it seemed!\n\nWondering whether there is a value play here at this price and if there is a likely chance of a rebound. Or is it a falling knife? ",
