  "selftext": "How will OpenAI going to a for-profit from non-profit impact Microsoft stock price? Does this open the door to some larger partnership between the two?\n\nAltman is quoted as previously saying, the company’s non-profit ownership structure protects the company from the short-term interests of shareholders. The non-profit ownership structure also ensures that the benefits accrued from artificial intelligence (AI) would be distributed broadly, AI systems’ safety would be assured, and OpenAI would work to serve the “best interests of humanity.”\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-remove-non-profit-201413475.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-openai-remove-non-profit-201413475.html)",

Make a chat bot glorified enough to be as competent as a human, and you have revolutionary technology that the US government owns.\n\n> why should we fund these \"AI\" projects\n\nAI is cool in the sense that you need to own the supercomputers and neural programming itself to operate it. If the US government is to get and maintain the most powerful AI on earth, they have a huge advantage if it ever turns out to be a valuable technology. In the same way that many industrial/technological innovations the government has created is kept secret and contained, to give our country a competitive edge. In my opinion, it's going to be a very valuable recourse, you may disagree",
