  "selftext": "Stock down more than 50% today.\n\nLink to the original report: [https://fuzzypandaresearch.com/globe-life-american-income-life-david-zophin-steve-greer/](https://fuzzypandaresearch.com/globe-life-american-income-life-david-zophin-steve-greer/)\n\nLink to Reuters too: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/globe-life-shares-plummet-after-fuzzy-panda-discloses-short-position-2024-04-11/\n\n\"Globe Life (GL) is \\[was lol\\] an $10 billion Life and Health Insurance Company that sells policies through multiple subsidiaries. The biggest subsidiary is American Income Life (AIL), which accounts for 39% of total premiums; and 50% of total underwriting profits.  We uncovered extensive allegations of insurance fraud ignored by management despite being obvious and reported hundreds of times\" including \"policies written for dead and fictitious people\".\n\nThe entire report is fucking hilarious, enjoy the read. Among multiple claims of widespread fraud, we also have:\n\n* Sales agents portray themselves as the new “Wolves of Wall Street” – and behave accordingly\n   * Drug use is rampant at some agencies. \n   * Multiple lawsuits describe a culture of sexual harassment where bosses:\n      * RAPE female subordinates, \n      * Masturbate in front of female subordinates, \n      * Demand oral sex in exchange for promotions and good sales leads\n      * And even give the date-rape drug to those who won’t play along. \n      * Women that report the behavior are retaliated against and their complaints are ignored. \n      * Toxic Culture Has Even Spawned a website: [American Income Life Victims](https://ailvictims.com/)\n* Warren Buffett Dumped the Stock\n\n&#x200B;",

Globe Life expressed their intention to explore legal avenues, reflecting their confidence in facing these allegations but this is WSB where logic gets trumped by irrational thought processes. \n\nLike I said, let's see what happens.
