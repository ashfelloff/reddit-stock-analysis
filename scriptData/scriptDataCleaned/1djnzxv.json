  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "Company Overview and History:\n\nFluence Energy, Inc. is a global leader in the energy storage industry, providing a comprehensive ecosystem of products, services, and optimization software to drive the clean energy transition. The company was formed in 2017 as a joint venture between Siemens Industry, Inc. and AES Grid Stability, LLC, two industry heavyweights, and commenced operations in 2018.\n\nIn November 2021, Fluence Energy, Inc. completed its initial public offering, raising $935.8 million in net proceeds, which it used to repay outstanding debt and fund its growth initiatives. Since then, the company has continued to expand its global footprint, with a presence in 47 markets worldwide as of March 31, 2024.\n\nBusiness Overview:\n\nFluence's core offerings can be divided into three main categories:\n\n1. Energy Storage Products and Solutions: The company provides a range of modular, scalable energy storage products, including Gridstack Pro, Sunstack, Edgestack, and Ultrastack, designed to meet the diverse needs of utility companies, developers, and commercial/industrial customers.\n2. Services: Fluence offers a comprehensive suite of operational services, including maintenance, monitoring, and augmentation, to support the lifecycle of its energy storage solutions.\n3. Digital Applications: The company's Fluence IQ platform includes AI-powered software-as-a-service (SaaS) products, such as Fluence Mosaic and Fluence Nispera, which enable customers to optimize the performance and value of their renewable energy and storage assets.\n\nFluence's innovative technology, strong market position, and diverse product and service offerings have positioned the company as a key player in the rapidly growing energy storage market.\n\nFinancial Performance and Ratios:\n\nFluence has experienced significant revenue growth in recent years, with total revenue increasing from $680.8 million in fiscal year 2021 to $1,198.6 million in fiscal year 2022, and $2,218.0 million in fiscal year 2023. This growth has been driven by the increasing demand for energy storage solutions, as well as the company's ability to expand its customer base and geographic reach.\n\nHowever, the company has also incurred net losses in each of the past three fiscal years, with a net loss of $104.8 million in fiscal year 2023. This is primarily due to the company's ongoing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses to support its growth initiatives.\n\nKey financial ratios for Fluence as of March 31, 2024, include:\n\n* Gross Profit Margin: 10.2%\n* Operating Margin: -4.2%\n* Current Ratio: 1.36\n* Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 0.12\n\nThese ratios indicate that Fluence is still in the early stages of its growth, with a focus on expanding its market share and product offerings rather than immediate profitability.\n\nRisks and Challenges:\n\nFluence faces several risks and challenges that could impact its future performance:\n\n1. Supply Chain Disruptions: The company relies on a limited number of suppliers for key components, such as batteries and inverters. Disruptions in the supply chain could lead to delays in project completion and increased costs.\n2. Competitive Landscape: The energy storage market is highly competitive, with both established players and new entrants vying for market share. Fluence's ability to maintain its competitive edge will be crucial to its long-term success.\n3. Regulatory and Policy Changes: Fluence's business is heavily influenced by government policies, regulations, and incentives related to renewable energy and energy storage. Changes in these areas could positively or negatively impact the company's operations and financial performance.\n4. Technological Advancements: The energy storage industry is rapidly evolving, and Fluence must continue to innovate and develop new products and services to stay ahead of the competition.\n5. Execution Risks: As Fluence continues to grow, it must effectively manage its expansion, manufacturing capabilities, and project delivery to ensure timely and successful project completion.\n\nGuidance and Outlook:\n\nFluence has provided the following guidance for fiscal year 2024:\n\n* Total revenue in the range of $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion\n* Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $(50) million to $(80) million\n\nThe company's guidance reflects its continued focus on growth and market share expansion, as well as its ongoing investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and infrastructure to support its long-term success.\n\nConclusion:\n\nFluence Energy, Inc. is a promising player in the rapidly growing energy storage market, with a comprehensive ecosystem of products, services, and software solutions that are well-positioned to capitalize on the global transition to renewable energy. While the company has faced some challenges in achieving profitability, its strong market position, innovative technology, and experienced management team suggest that it is well-equipped to navigate the evolving industry landscape and deliver long-term value for its shareholders.",

      "body": "My big bet is FLNC. BESS investment is expected to grow 30-40percent every year until 2030. It has to cuz of climate targets. FLNC have the biggest pipeline&backlog among all bess integrators. They are asset light and does not produce battery cells, so they are risk free from china battery price and wont have to compete against catl for battery.\n\nFY2024 & FY2025 are going to be great for them. Their bess system is now eligible for ira credits, which lowers client's project cost by 50 percent. Their only problem in FY2023 was gross margin, but in FY2025 it will be around 12~15percent (now around 11) with 4 billion in revenue. They are at the profitability inflection point now and price is so attractice. My price target for FY2025 is 31.\n\nCons would be that bess integrators all have low moat, which FLNC is developing with their software system on top of bess. Another is that FLNC has two customers that acxount for 40 percent of revenue, naturally as they are a joint venture of the said companies. Lastly trump being elected would cause a small dent probably (management doesnt seem to think so).\n\n+ their FY2024 rev is 80percent contracted backlog. 20percent super late stage.",
