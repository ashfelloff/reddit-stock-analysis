Reddit's updates are as exciting as watching paint dry, while other platforms are popping out features like rabbits on Viagra*\n\nInnovation ain't always a good thing and most of the time new updates make things worse. Every single time YouTube \"innovates\" it always enshittifies and makes the site worse. The new spotify UI sucks. Meta rebranding is a fucking joke. The Metaverse was a massive dogshit flop. The most recent Metabook update is worse than it was in 2010\n\nReddit is also innovating... for the worse. If you haven't tried the new UI they're forcefully rolling out (and will delete the old. UI), holy god click this right now ---> [https://sh.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/](https://sh.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) If you haven't had the new UI forcefully rolled out for you yet, count yourself lucky.",
