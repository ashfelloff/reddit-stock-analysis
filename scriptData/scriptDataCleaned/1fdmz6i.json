Think Mark Cuban's eponymously named CostPlus pharmacy which sells drugs at acquisition cost plus a 15% markup. Model works well for generic drugs (which are cheap AF) but fails with expensive specialty drugs. \n\n-Subscription model. Amazon Prime and Walmart+ have done this. Pay $5/month to get access to a set list of medications. Again, drugs are usually limited to cheaper generics\n\n- Give pharmacists healthcare provider status (akin to nurses and PAs). Higher margins if pharmacists can treat patients. This has been pushed for at least a decade now and it hasn't advanced much. \n\n- Direct-to-consumer: Example LLY offers Zepbound D2C.  Big pharma doesn't have logistics to pull this off so I only see this for very limited meds. \n\n  \nVertical integration is most likely the future. In theory you can come up on top if you own the stack from the insurance company, to the doctors, the PBM, and down to the pharmacy. \n\nI see physical retail pharmacy continue to decline and mail-order (which PBMs own) will rise until we reach some equilibrium.",
