Some people paid less, a lot of people have paid a lot more for the same class. Here‚Äôs the cliff-notes:¬†\n\n- What we do here on wsb isn‚Äôt investing, it‚Äôs gambling, and Rule number 1 of gambling is *you never walk into the casino with more money than you‚Äôre comfortable with losing.*\n- *Your first and foremost capital assets are you, your health, your ability to work, and time.* Losing 18G‚Äôs sucks, but you‚Äôre 22 and it‚Äôs 18 grand. It‚Äôs not much in the scope of a career and you‚Äôre right at the start of it.¬†\n-¬†You should not be playing stocks with money you need. For¬†money you do need, you need to be doing diversified investing, not playing individual stocks. Things like Vanguard etfs are great for achieving big diversity with little effort. VTI might be boring, but it‚Äôs a reliable win.¬†\n- Don‚Äôt expect to get rich playing the stock market. Expect to build wealth slowly, or come to play the game. ¬†I‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt play the game. I love the game. *But if you come to play the game, expect to lose.* I play because beating the candles is the most infuriating, most unpredictable game I‚Äôve played, and no system I‚Äôve found can reliably win except one: buy VTI (or similar) and just hold it.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôve paid your tuition, but it‚Äôs up to you not to take the class again. There‚Äôs a guy on the front page right now who‚Äôs in the hole for over a million and it sounds like he‚Äôs filling out the course registration again.¬†\n\nYou‚Äôll be okay, OP. Go do some boring, smart investing and come back with *disposable* income. We want you to come lose money with us, just not money you need.¬†",
