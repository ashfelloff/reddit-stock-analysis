It’s not the end of the world. But remember this feeling. What you need to do next is write yourself a letter describing how horrible you feel, which you’ll pull out and read back when you’re ever tempted to play options again. \n \n…because make no mistake, *you’re done with options.* permanently. All gambling, actually. For the entire rest of your life, until the day you die, you’re not going to buy even a single scratch ticket from the gas station. this is really important. \n \nIn 15 years you’ll be 38, which is still really young! And hopefully, if all goes well, you’ll look back on this $60k loss and laugh, because it was a valuable lesson that allowed you to earn a fortune (through your doctorate field, somehow, whatever that is) without gambling it away. You’ll tell the story to your kids and grandkids, and laugh about it — but also use it as a cautionary tale. \n \nThis is far from the worst thing you could have done. It feels bad, but you’ve recognized your addiction, and you never had to resort to criminality to support it. \n \nAgain: **just think about it as a big hospital bill for an insidious mental illness.** \n \nBecause really, you know what happened? You just went to a very expensive rehab program called “the options failure school of hard knocks.” As long as you never do it again, this failure might just be the single most responsible thing that’s ever happened to you.",

You can come back from this. But what I would suggest is take a few months off. Get your head back on right and then come back with a plan.
