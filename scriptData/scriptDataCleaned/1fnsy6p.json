  "score": 524,
  "selftext": ">Boeing on Monday sweetened its contract offer and said it was its “best and final” proposal for its more than 30,000 machinists as their strike, which has halted most of the aerospace giant’s aircraft production, entered its second week.  \n>  \n>The new offer raised pay, reinstated annual bonuses and increased a bonus that would be given upon the contract’s ratification, among other changes, Boeing said on its website.  \n>  \n>The company’s new offer would boost general wages by 30% over four years, up from a previously proposed 25%. It also doubled the ratification bonus to $6,000, reinstated an annual machinist bonus and raised the company’s 401(k) match.  \n>  \n>The labor union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, didn’t immediately comment on the offer. Boeing said the offer is contingent upon ratification by Friday at 11:59 p.m. PT.  \n>  \n>Bank of America analyst Ron Epstein estimated the strike is costing Boeing $50 million a day, and ratings agencies have said the company risks a downgrade the longer the strike lasts.\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/23/boeing-labor-proposal-best-and-final-offer-strike.html)\n\n&#x200B;",

Ratification bonuses are a tactic used to get ratification votes from people who are not planning on staying long term. \n\nBasically, if I'm planning on job hopping, retiring, or changing careers in the next year or so, $6k now is better than a wage increase or other benefit that doesn't kick in until well after I'm gone or takes years to reap the full benefit. \n\nLogically it fails on a multitude of levels because better pay at one large manufacturer often has the effect of raising wages elsewhere because other companies have go compete for workers. So if you're going to be in the same field, in the long run it helps wages for everyone indirectly and could reap well more than $6k equivalent. But many people don't think that way or long term and will take the $6k now. \n\nIt works in Boeing's favour though because it's a onetime ~~bribe~~ payment instead of something they have to pay year after year or build upon next contract cycle.",

With pensions, you're stuck at your job even if you don't like it because you don't want to lose unvested benefits, whereas with a 401k, you generally vest much faster, so they are much more portable. Worse yet, you can get laid off and lose your pension.\n\n2. 401ks are much more flexible because you can access your money when you need it.\n\n3. Pensions are not immune from risk to the employee, because they can fail and be cut if the company underfunds them and goes bankrupt. It's not some magic guaranteed income stream.\n\n4. If you want a fixed income safe from market risk, there are annuity products you can purchase using your 401k funds that provide a lifetime income stream the same way that a pension does.",

Defined benefit pensions are a much better deal from a financial perspective. \n\nThere's a number of reasons for this. 401ks have higher management fees, for one. For another, workers with a 401k must save enough and withdraw at a low enough rate to stretch their savings until they die, whereas pension funds only need to save enough for the average worker's lifespan.\n\nFinally, pension funds can have an optimal asset allocation at all times, whereas individual accounts must be shifted from high-return stocks to low-return bonds to avoid the risk of a market crash. Thus, you have a high rate of return when you are young (and have virtually no money in the account), and a low rate of return when you are old (and you have a lot of money in the account), which cuts the potential returns massively.",
