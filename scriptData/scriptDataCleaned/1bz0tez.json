If you listen to Elon he really thinks that there is no need for people to drive themselves anywhere and that everyone will just use robo taxis once they become available. Most likely they will announce this vehicle, but they will say it has no ability to be driven by individuals it's not for sale to anyone. He will say that Tesla will be producing and running the robo taxi network themselves, and there is no need for a mass market car because \"why would you drive when you can use a robo taxi?\"\n\nThis will cause massive disappointment and a huge crash in the stock. Not everyone wants to sit in a fucking taxi... people like to drive... and that doesn't seem to be understood at all by Elon.",

                  "body": "Rueters posted an article yesterday that Tesla had canceled the \"Model 2\"/Small car project. TSLA immediately crashed and people were all over twitter asking WTF is going on... Although Elon posted a tweet about 40 min later saying \"Rueters is lying again\", he did not actually say what they were lying about, and he did not say that the Model 2/Small car project was not canceled... and shortly after that Tesla announced the date for the Robotaxi unveil. \n\nIf Reuters was lying and the Model 2 wasn't cancelled they would be liable for false statements... but they still haven't removed the article! See here: \nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-scraps-low-cost-car-plans-amid-fierce-chinese-ev-competition-2024-04-05/\n\n \nIf the Model 2 project wasn't cancelled then why didn't Elon outright deny Reuters statement? All it would take is \"The model 2/small car isn't cancelled\". Instead we got this obviously rushed announcement of the \"robotaxi\"... almost as if they made the announcement to stop people from dumping their TSLA stock.\n\nWhat if Reuters got info from a source at Tesla that the \"Model 2\" project had been changed because of recent progress on FSD and would no longer be a consumer vehicle, but instead would be a Robotaxi?\n\nThat would mean Reuters would have legal cover for their article, while Elon would be unable to outright deny their premise that the Model 2 was cancelled. It would also line up with all Elons recent conference calls where he dismisses the idea of creating new Tesla models and instead claims robo-taxis are the future and that Tesla's valuation is based on autonomy, not producing lots of cheap new EVs\n\nI hope I am wrong but I am very very familiar with both the company and Elon... and building an efficient small car to compete with China would be considered \"boring\" by Elon. He has constantly dismissed the whole concept of cheap EVs \n\nIt has been a decade since the Model 3 came out... if they really wanted to design and build a small car, they probably could have done it 5 times over by now. Instead they have focused on AI and autonomy... which is obviously important, but won't necessarily transition the world to electric vehicles.",
