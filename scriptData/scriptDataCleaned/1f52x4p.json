The high-school sweetheart's mom doesn't want OP to marry her daughter, so she makes up a story to make OP believe his love rejected him.\n\n4. Depressed, OP goes back to his friend, who is a likeable \\[insert minority\\] who tells OP about a new company called Apple. OP decides to put his $300 there.\n\n5.

While going through his mail filled with invoices and Past Due notices, he finds the envelope with his forgotten ROTH IRA.\n\n7. OP buys the country club, saves a dog park from being demolished by the son of the evil real-estate mogul just before it's turned into a skyscraper, and reconnects with his sweetheart, buying the same $300 engagement ring.

Dad just turned 70 and mom is 67. \n\nThey were recounting the days where you’d call a broker on the phone and ask them to sell/buy at such and such a price. Then the broker would call you back and say “yep, did that/couldn’t do that, here are the details.” \n\nThen *every quarter* you’d get a statement for your portfolio and you’d track performance largely that way aside from a standard *yearly* review with your portfolio manager.\n\nThey said now it’s like you check every day, multiple times a day- but their strategy remains the same. Buy something solid/that you believe in its potential, sit on it for a year or two, reassess, and the majority of the time- continue to hold. Have a steady income job otherwise.\n\nLong term buying & holding for multiple years usually outperforms intraday, interday, intermonth.\n\nDad worked and was successful in corporate finance all his life. Said he never dealt with options, puts, calls- too derivative and complex for him.\n\nBuy it and forget about it. \n\nI know nothing.",

My dad was trying to get rich as well so he bought me a subscription to the Wall Street Journal and helped me set up a TD account with some of my college fund and I ran $10K up into $300K just trading the meme stocks of the day while still in high school.\n\nIt was all sweet until 2000 when Microstrategy collapsed on bookkeeping errors and I lost almost everything. Had like $4K left out of the initial ten. Gave up on stonks and went to college, didn't think about it again until 2003 when my old computer broke and I got an Apple macbook and one of the first iPods. I was like \"hmm, this shit is amazing\" so I bought the stock for myself with what was left of the $4K, and opened said IRA above.\n\nHad to sell most of the shares in my stock over the years to buy a house and stuff, this IRA flew under my radar or I would have sold it too probably. Obviously the best financial call of my life, based on a real life product interaction. \n\nI put my Dad into Apple in a big way in 2006. He hasn't sold a single share.
