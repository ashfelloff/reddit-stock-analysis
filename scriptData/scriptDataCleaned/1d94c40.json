  "selftext": "Bought these around $304 this AM and thought I was doomed as it continued to tank to $301. Held like a true regard and managed to end slightly up. Obviously pleased with the AH $330-$340 price movement. These are at least doubling cone morning. Now I have to decide do I hold until expiration or sell tomorrow. Who feels LULU keeps moving up over the next two weeks?",
