  "score": 83,
  "selftext": "Hi all! I’m kind of stuck in a dilemma of whether I should hold Tesla stock and hope that it will return to my purchase price, or sell all and reinvest into ETFs. I don’t really have any goals in the long term or short term so I don’t really mind individual stocks or ETFs. I just hate seeing a downward trend for the past year and not sure if my money would be better in the SP500. I also don’t want to preemptively sell and have it skyrocket past my purchase price. All opinions would be appreciated!\n\nFor context:\n\nShares: 53\nInitial purchase price: $279.41\nCurrent price: $177.50\n\nWould probably invest into VOO, VTI, VXUS if I were to reinvest into ETFs.\n",

And this project seems likely to work.\n* FSD - Even if it only kinda works, and is only deployed on specific routes for Tesla Semis, it's meaningful.  And if he can ever make it really work everywhere.... well... that's too speculative and dreaming about that probably counts as more gambling.\n* Optimus - Sure, the walking humanoid is totally a PR stunt and technology exercise and maybe patent farm that won't pay off for a decade --- but if he even gets 1 optimus arm and 1 optimus eyeball working on his assembly line this year, it could reduce costs.\n* His cheap car - Well, BYD's $10k car's already here, so I think he missed that boat (unless both Unboxed and Optimius exceed expectations and he can get in that price range too)\n\nIt's certainly not a guaranteed sure thing like VT or VTI.\n\nBut it's kinda like a pharm company with an interesting pipeline -- no guarantees, but multiple projects with significant potential.",

      "body": "I'd dump Tesla and eat that 5.3k dollar loss. \n\nYou can make up that loss faster in another stock than you will waiting for Tesla to climb back up. \n\nThe best you could really hope for is it crawling back up over several months to 280 - give you a 1% gain. And then you'd probably think it's going to climb higher only to be in the fall again. \n\nBetter off dropping that money into Google / Gato Silver / or SCCO Copper and recuperating that 5.4k into 2.8 this year - because the bets on these companies are to grow well this year.",
