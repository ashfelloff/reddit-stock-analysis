This isn't fucking r/CaptainObviousEconomics but r/wallstreetBETS . \n\nPlus most midwits already knew that inflation wasn't transitory when you print trillions of free money like that and that inflation coming down doesn't mean PRICES will go back to 2019. If that was the fucking case then I'd still have $0.29 McHambuger Tuesdays like I did as a kid and ordered 10 burgers just to see if I could eat them all and met my match at like 8 (BIDEN STOLE THIS FROM US^(But not Clinton x2, Bush x2, Obama, and Trump. Just Sleepy Joe.)).\n\nMarkets aren't even following inflation much anymore. Markets and CNBC are covering GDP, unemployment, and payroll numbers because they already know high inflation is mostly slayed and largely priced into the markets already. So even the midwits at CNBC and myself are looking at unemployment numbers since yield curve has been inverted for so long with no recession. Meanwhile, another long used signal of recession would be unemployment going above 5%. That's why there are so many articles covering unemployment finally ticking up to 4%.\n\nAnyways, OP lame af. Didn't even give us a bet. If they wanted to be a üåàüêª and call the crash or be a doomer bear and spread FUD so others lose money like them then just SAY IT and make a bet. Don't use some passive-ass pussy-ass shit-chart to sow doubt in such a half-ass bitch-ass way [from your 3 month burner account created to meme political crap](https://old.reddit.com/user/Careless-Funny9031/submitted/)^(pls at least tell me you're at least getting paid by Russia, China, or some superfund instead of just doing this for free).",

If the Fed lowers rates while core PCE is still above 2%, then we can infer that similar real world stress would produce similar decisions at higher inflation in the future.",

I already knew some inflation is nessecary, but I never bothered to find out how much is enough or how does it correlates with the optimal interest rate. Well we can argue that the 2% figure back in the 80s and 90s if it made sense, then the 2% we had during the 2010s was actually quite high and should have been revised down? But it wasn't, and turns out that a ZIRP still kept inflation at 2%, which gives that figure at least some credibility. Of course QE provided some additional stimulus akin to a negative interest rate, but it makes sense that 2% is a good number because 0-1% risks recession and higher than 2% would have been a bit chaotic during the pre-2000s growth phase where rates had to be lower. Technology has contributed to some of the deflationary impacts we seen on the natural inflation rate for sure, and without it you can argue ZIRP would be too low.\n\nIn conclusion, I do think 2% is a good enough buffer above the 0% mark, higher and lower probably don't make sense to anchor.",

              "body": "So, lots to unpack here:\n\nFirst, the 2% target is relatively new, or at least having an explicit goal of 2%, as per this St. Louis Fed article, didn‚Äôt arrive until 2012:\n\nhttps://www.stlouisfed.org/open-vault/2019/january/fed-inflation-target-2-percent\n\nStating in pertinent:\n\n‚ÄúAlthough the FOMC didn‚Äôt explicitly name an inflation target until 2012, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard has argued that the U.S. had ‚Äúan implicit inflation target of 2 percent after 1995.‚Äù (See Bullard‚Äôs presentation from Sept. 12, 2018. In that presentation, he also noted that 2 percent became an international standard in the inflation targeting era that began in the 1990s.)‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe article is interesting bc they kind of implicitly say, it‚Äôs a random number:\n\nWhy not zero? Or a negative number? \n\nDavid Wheelock, a St. Louis Fed group vice president and deputy director of research, addressed these questions in a 2017 podcast. He acknowledged that there isn‚Äôt a general agreement among economists, but he laid out three arguments that people make for having a positive inflation target‚Ä¶\n\n\nHe basically goes onto state that having 0% inflation doesn‚Äôt stimulate growth and that having some level of inflation gives the fed room to pivot, cut, whatever.\n\n\nSo, it‚Äôs not as if 2% makes no sense at all, it‚Äôs just that there has to be some inflation, but not too much, and 2% is a decent middle ground\n\nLikewise the article discusses the obvious fact that 2% isn‚Äôt a constant goal, it‚Äôs a longer term goal. Having inflation above 2%, or below 2%, it‚Äôs not a big deal, it‚Äôs on a longer term timeframe that they shoot for 2%.\n\n\n\nNow, as far as the remainder, I personally subscribe to the theory that technology, by its very nature, is disinflationary.\n\nI don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs a debatable point.\n\nAs we become more technologically advanced, having some baseline level of inflation is probably necessary because we are perpetually disinflationary via technological advancement\n\nOf course, someone will come along and talk about printing money, and other inflationary issues, but I‚Äôm speaking in the general sense.\n\nZIRP policies, and the efficacy of those policies:  \n\nthat conversation inevitably leads into ‚Äúmodern monetary theory‚Äù, a topic which is fairly controversial, and itself engenders political biases and other issues that are non-financial.\n\nIts a heavily debated topic with no clear answer imo",

But I can see an argument where 2.5% or 3% might also be the correct number to use (technological disinflation is a key opposing evidence to that however), but maybe the right thing to do is as long as inflation is sufficiently statistically significant as in you cannot say that inflation =0%, then the other indicators to look at is measures of corporate health, financial leverage, bankruptcies, unemployment rate, real wage growth. Inflation at this point would not be a metric to watch for anymore as long as its above ~1-2%.",
