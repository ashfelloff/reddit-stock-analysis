      "body": "A few notes: \n\n* premarket trades of $BMBL are being internalized and then batched at whatever time is most convenient for the market maker (typically at the top of the hour). Last week, orders of 1 and 2 were not being batched, but as of today, they have started to batch them. \n* Price paid initially reads 0.00 through my brokerage for roughly a minute. Unsure why this might be the case, but it seems to be unique to $BMBL and not the other companies I am investing in.\n* The option chain for $BMBL is so dry that I have to 2.5x the ask to hit, and it is filled at half the ask, even for miniscule orders.\n* $GRND has had some truly 10/10 memes lately. Love the creativity.",
