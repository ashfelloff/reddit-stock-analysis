  "selftext": "South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics said it expects worse-than-expected profit for the third quarter.\n\nIn guidance released Tuesday, the world’s top memory chip maker said operating profit for the quarter ending September is projected to be around 9.10 trillion won, marking a surge from last year’s 2.43 trillion Korean won.\n\nAnalysts polled by LSEG expected an operating profit of 11.456 trillion Korean won ($7.7 billion) for the quarter ended Sept. 30. Samsung’s revenue for the quarter was expected to hit 81.96 trillion won ($61 billion), according to LSEG estimates.\n\nSamsung is the leading manufacturer of memory chips, which are utilized in devices like laptops and servers. It is also the world’s second largest player in the smartphone market.\n\n“The company needs to remain flexible about its memory supply control, since the downfall of conventional DRAM will likely hurt Samsung more than its smaller rivals,” Macquarie Equity Research analysts said in a recent note. DRAM refers to dynamic random access memory chips that are often used in laptops, workstations and PCs.\n\nSamsung had instructed its subsidiaries around the world to reduce 30% of staff in some divisions, Reuters reported in September, citing two sources with knowledge of the matter.\n\nShares of Samsung Electronics listed in South Korea’s stock exchange have seen a 22% decrease year-to-date, LSEG data showed. The company is set to release detailed third-quarter results later this month.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/08/samsung-posts-worse-than-expected-guidance-for-third-quarter.html",
