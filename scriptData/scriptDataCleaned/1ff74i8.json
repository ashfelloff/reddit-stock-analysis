  "title": "What do you guys think about Micron before their Sept earnings?",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Their stock has dropped considerably since the highs. This despite that earnings results were not that bad.\n\nTheir (1yr) Forward P/E ratio is now absolute rock bottom.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s706gocmmeod1.png?width=2298&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc1feafac3c75c116bd98c7198c4c71411be1bca\n\nThe bear case for them is that they are investing too much in production capacity. This is odd considering how backed up they are in terms of supplying DRAMs. \n\nAn additional bear case is that their profit margins were low \\~11%.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MU/micron-technology/profit-margins)\n\nBut this seems to be cyclic (they have always been). Their traditional profit margins have averaged around 40%, which is a pretty decent number. The fact that they invested in manufacturing capacity to meet the demand, kind of explains the lower margins in the last quarter.\n\nGiven all this, why is Micron not a solid buy before the Sept 27th earnings? What am I missing?\n\nDisclosure: I do have a small position (\\~200 stocks, which is down 30%). But I wonder, why this is not a time to load up on some options?\n\nEdit: Removed reference to market share. Looks like they only have 9-11% HBM DRAM market share.",

Rince and repeat for 20 years (since 2002 at least).\n\nThey oversupplied in 2022, in 2023 prices dropped, then they started to climb up in Dec 2023. They reached max prices in June (when stock price hit $145) and kept them slighly below for a few month.\n\nNow they ramp up the production to sell of at the current prices, good chance we will see a good revenue growth throughout 1H2025.\n\nIt'll be a downhill from then on, for about a year.",
