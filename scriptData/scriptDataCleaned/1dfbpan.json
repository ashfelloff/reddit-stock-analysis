All the money and hype is precisely because credible scientists are increasingly leaning towards AGI and the singularity being feasible in our lifetime, and everyone can already see the value AI/algorithms have. Just because current AI is limited doesn't mean we can't keep pushing the envelope and improving every aspect to continuously upgrade. We're already beginning to enter the vertical part of the slope of exponential gains with AI being used to improve its own designs. We are theoretically smart enough to do anything with enough time and effort. We aren't just going to hit some limit or plateau that stumps us for the rest of our lives, the amount of resources being poured into this goal is enough alone to ensure it will happen, even if it wasn't already human nature to keep making breakthroughs and progress through novel methods and insights. Someone will figure out how to keep up progress, and whoever does will probably need Nvidia chips. AGI might be the end of us if not guided and built properly, but it holds more potential than anything so the world can't ignore that and is racing towards the bottom.",

Most fields get tiny advancements and improvements all the time. But to go from current LLMs to actual AGI that doesn't depend on humans for training data, is a colossally monumental step. Einstein came up with his breakthrough relativity stuff hundreds of years after Newton did. So we CAN plateau for a long time.\n\nNow is that a good or bad thing? No, neither. It's just a function of doing science. It's not like if we don't get to AGI in our lifetimes we lose the galactic war or something. It's either going to happen or not going to happen, not a guarantee either. Funneling more money into something doesn't necessarily guarantee someone will come up with breakthroughs, though it does help motivate people.",
