  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm currently exploring the possibility of Rumble taking over TikTok's operations in the United States, and I'd like to gather some insights on potential risks associated with this move. Here are some areas I'm particularly interested in:\n\n1. Legal Risks: What are the potential legal hurdles Rumble might face in acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations?\n\n2. Financial Risks: Are there any financial risks that could arise from this acquisition, such as unexpected costs or operational challenges?\n\n3. Technological Risks: What technological challenges could Rumble encounter during the integration process?\n\n4. Reputation Risks: How might this acquisition impact Rumble's reputation and brand value?\n\n5. Competition Risks: What competitive challenges could Rumble face in the social media landscape?\n\n6. Regulatory Risks: What regulatory uncertainties or changes should Rumble be prepared to address?\n\nAs i am newer here; i would greatly appreciate any insights, opinions, or experiences you can share on these topics. Your input will be invaluable as I assess the feasibility of this potential acquisition. Thank you in advance for your contributions.",

You could buy SPCE because you think TSLA might buy them for their rockets and use that company to go to Mars.
