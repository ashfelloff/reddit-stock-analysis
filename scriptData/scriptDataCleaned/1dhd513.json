Not only that they ruined it with numerous other idiot circle jerk plot points with zero payoffs, and also ruined Luke’s character. The whole movie was like someone made a bad spinoff and literally did nothing for the main plot. Not to mention they did it in a way that they ruined the overall story built up in 7 that should have been across all three movies. Killing the hidden villain, making Rey’s backstory supposedly mean nothing. Nothing less than a horrible joke. 9 could do nothing but damage control and they couldn’t recover from the mistakes made.

Tellurian is a company that has had some delays on construction of infrastructure, but if you look who the TOP shareholders are, you will see that they won’t lose.  It’s only a matter of time for them to finish construction now.  It’s an AMERICAN Liquified Natural Gas company.   Too much to say here, but worth looking into it.  They aren’t profitable at all and that’s why the stock went from 20 dollars to now 70 Cents.   It will go to 50 Dollars.  It’s definitely a company that will trade at a 30 to 50 B market cap.  It’s at 700 M right now.  It’s like buying invídia 7 years ago and holding until now.    I recommend you guys look into it.  Even if they sell the company for infrastructure scraps, it’s worth already 2 to 3Billion at least just in infrastructure , not to mention the permits they were the last ones to get, and ever since Biden took office, no competition has even got close to consider jumping in the market.  They have only 2 others to compete for the LNG in the US .  They are working on a deal to partner up with the Saudis.  If that happens and American realizes it needs to go back to energy independence and export of LNG , TELLURIAN will jump like no other stock.  For real look into it , you won’t regret.   I bought 900 K worth of this stock back in December at 0.65.    I won’t sell it until it hits 20 dollars at least.   Worth your time.  This is the last chance to get in this stock bellow 1 dollar.  Predictions are crazy high  for the next 7 years.",
