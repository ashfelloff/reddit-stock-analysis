                  "body": "the \"rush to cover\" is only apparent in a single price spike that happens once the news is announced. after that there is absolutely no need to get out as fast as possible since their max loss is defined by the buyout price and hence  there can't be a \"squeeze\" because there is no way it's going to infinity. Also, why do you think that the price can't stick above $16 despite having 2-3 offers this year? the board isn't going to simply take the highest price offered - it has to take into account the legitimacy of the buyer's offer before actually accepting it. Stop labelling everything as a \"short squeeze\" when it's clearly not applicable lol.",
