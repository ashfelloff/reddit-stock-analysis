Gourds have multiple uses, all which drive the demand and price up. \n\nCoronavirus being over isn't the catalyst, thr emerging recovery of the economy is the catalyst. Given the market is forward looking, I am expecting Gourd prices to skyrocket starting in May in preparation for the summer just in time for rattle season, and then carry on into November for holiday decorations.\n\nThe play is to submit a massive order for Gourds and then try to find new recipients before November. \n\nTldr: 1million order of Gourds",
