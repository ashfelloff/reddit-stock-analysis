Got the little break/cooldown/consolidation/spinach dip ‚Äî whatever other horoscopic shit you wanna call it, Thursday and Friday. \n\nThe selloff was prompted by no bad news, and now we‚Äôve received bullish news before the week even starts ‚Äî I imagine Jensen will hype Blackwell up with a cool update or two during the iNvEsToR‚ÄôS meeting (regards) as well. Plus there‚Äôs MU earnings and PCE data this week.\n\nMust‚Äôve forgotten there‚Äôs an election in 4 months. Ban-shpan, who cares.\n\n_Positions: fuck ton of leaps that I didn‚Äôt even consider selling last week, and will add to even if it pulls back more_\n ",
