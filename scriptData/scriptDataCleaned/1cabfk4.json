We got a much smaller counter-rally to around $507 and proceeded to continue lower.  \nWe filled the gap at $497 4 days later on Friday.  \nFriday is likely a near-term bottom and a larger relief rally is coming to around $513.  \nThis is due to a pattern around the 16-week moving average that's been well defined for the last 3 years or so.  \nI couldn't post more images in the opening post so I posted the details in a comment here ->https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cabfk4/comment/l0qr0id/\n\nAfter the relief rally is over, I expect the market to continue to sell off in May, down to $480 or lower.  \nI called the 2022 summer correction to the dollar two years ago ->  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0gm15/back\\_after\\_2\\_year\\_hiatus\\_demanding\\_proceeds\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0gm15/back_after_2_year_hiatus_demanding_proceeds_on/)\n\nStay safe regards.\n\nEDIT: Typos.",

Meaning more and more stocks inside the S&P 500 are beginning to recover.  \n  \n2- The VIX closed with a lower high last Friday, despite the market closing with a lower low. This is a key bullish divergence. That indicates sellers are getting exhausted and demand for puts is dying down.  \n  \n3- The market is down almost exactly 5.7% from its peak.
