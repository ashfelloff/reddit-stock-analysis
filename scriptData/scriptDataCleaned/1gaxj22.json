Tesla managed to make more profits even with all their problems at the giga factory in Berlin, the black out caused by radical leftists that stopped their production for multiple weeks and cost them multiple millions and their supply issues caused by the middle eastern conflict. On top of that, there is extremely low consumer interest in China, low consumer interest in Europe and I would've expected in the USA as well since they've had higher inflation for a longer period of time than us europeans. Here in Germany it is now at 1.6% and yet people are still rarely buying new cars... How is it even possible for Tesla to keep making profits in circumstances like that, without even releasing a cheaper car??\n\nI shortet Tesla and put a Stop Loss at 20% below my entry. However, the stock fell in the after hours so my position went down almost 60% before it sold... Can someone also tell me how to prevent that?",
