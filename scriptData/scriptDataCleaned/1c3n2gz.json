They allow futures to exist because they are for “hedging” and “price discovery”, which in theory is beneficial to the economy. \n\nWhat is the fair price for oil? No one knows. But futures allow us to know because the market is open for everyone to participate. If you think oil price too low? Buy. If you think it is to high? Sell. Do your own dd and make your own decision and find your own information. We won’t know what is the fair price until y’all start to “have a say” in the market and the aggregated decisions create the “right” price, even your wrong decision matters to the market. Because in order for you to be wrong, the opposite trader must be right. He won’t be right, if you are not wrong, get it? Futures contracts are zero-sum in theory. That’s why the typical insider information law does not apply. It needs to punish the less informed/risk-takers otherwise the right information would not matter because it won’t reflect on the price.\n\nSo in practice, if you are a soybean farmer, yes you will have more info than regular folks. So what? There are other soy bean farmers. And people can become soy bean farmers. And you might think soy beans are not worth the current price, but the consumers might do. They might be right. If you short the market too hard, your competitors might want to pick up the price, so in reality, you are not able to make infinite amount of money just because.
