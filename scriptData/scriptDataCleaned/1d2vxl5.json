WSB wisdom is that after fed eases rates there is a high chance of a crash. It can be a month or a year. \n\nI strongly believe that this time with higher for.longer policy, there will be a correction this year. Velocity of M2 is plateauing before it reaches pre-covid level. \n\nThis is my 2 cents, food for thought if you will. \n\n\nI will show my smooth brain out now",

Stop looking at CPI when Powell has already said they target PCE.\n\nThe bar for the Fed to cut is AT MOST, core PCE MoM of 0.17% to 0.2% (2-2.4% annualized), for 3 months. MAYBE if unemployment goes up to 4.2%+ (Powell said in FOMC that unemployment has to go up several tenths of a percent for him to cut, and that was when unemployment was at 3.9%), and core PCE MoM hits <0.25% (3% annualized) for 6 months, they MIGHT consider a cut (December)\n\ncore PCE MoM is estimated to be around 0.25% MoM this week, according to Fed Waller.\n\nThat means if every month from now on core PCE comes in perfect, you might get a September cut. If you get 1 month of bumpy print, most likely December cut. If several months of bumpy prints, most likely 2025 cut.",

Expect QE next year as we are cutting into a recession - all the data is total bs and you know it by having a life and paying your bills. They can't crash the market as it would be detrimental to Bidet's campaign but after the elections - all bets are off. Remember, The Fed makes money with only one tool - DEBT and they need to justify the helicopter. At this point there are no more economy cycles, only fed cycles. With debt levels these cycles will get more and more violent. Reverse repo shows they have stopped draining for the time being. They have other forms of easing which they will use to get by November. My bet is on making new highs in the market 10-15% from here before you will see a big drop but it is coming that is almost a certainty",

Without a correction, prices will continue to rise astronomically to the point where a bag of m&m or a bar of candy will be 5bucks fairly quickly.  And a t 5 bucks there are enought people with enough money to keep prices going higher as demand will still be there.  \n\nOf course a correction is going to hit everyone and it needs to.  There is too much money out there and too many people have it to where the only thing that can fix it is a major event.  The Fed as crafted, at the expense of middle class and pople, a policy that protected the rich.  The poor and moddle class will suffer regardless but a reset needs to happen and money evaporate in the market",
