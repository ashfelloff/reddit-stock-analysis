  "selftext": "If you're bullish on AI as I am, please consider the current value of energy in relation to that sector.  The talk around AI is always centered on the chips, the chip infrastructure, and the datacenters. But its energy running through all those things and I believe they are going to need lots of it. I got in before the rally and have no intentions of even taking profit. I have so much love for FSLR right now and I just feel it will be a long and lasting love.\n\nIf you're bearish on AI I would still not advise going short on energy unless you are also short on EV. In this case may god have mercy on your soul.",
