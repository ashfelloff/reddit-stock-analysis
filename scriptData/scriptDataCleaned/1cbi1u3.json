              "body": "Institutions holding Tesla stock for many billions at a leverage cannot dump their stock without the price tanking a lot during the dumping. This can cause the sale that starts above the breakeven point to result in a loss. So, they will want to start selling at a higher price.\n\nSo, they will want to make the price go up, but the problem si then that oif they buy then the price will go up but their breakeven point will also move up. So, what they do is they buy during premarket trading when the volume of the trading is very low. The price can then move up without them requiring to buy a lot. Then when the market opens, they hope that the higher price will draw in lots of retail buyers so that they can unload their stocks at a higher price.\n\nYou can also think of this in terms of this trading being pretty much a zero-sum game. Whatever the inflows from the Tesla company to the market will be, will materialize over a very long time period. If you want to make a larger profit than what you could get from the current market conditions, then that extra profit can only come out the pockets of other investors.\n\n  \n[See also here](https://youtu.be/CWQj0CKeUMM?t=289).",
