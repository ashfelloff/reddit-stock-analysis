  "selftext": "It's very common for people to call day traders \"gamblers\", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. \n\nIt only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). \n\nSo, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet, place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. The more hands a gambler plays, the more likely they are to walk out with financial losses (bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49... = CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DRUNK AS SHIT AND YOUR MONEY IS ALL GONE!). \n\nThe stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. \n\nSay a strategy gives 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). A trader would likely never have such excessive drawdown in their account that they'd be out of the game, and moreso as the percent of risk per their account shrinks. \n\nFor instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. \n\nSometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. Say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. \n\nWhat about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and buy a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move past the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).\n\nOf course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. \n\nJust a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. \n\nTrading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. \n\nIt's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner. \n\nAnyways, to those who read this far -- toodles! And good luck! 👍 Share your personal favorite strategy/setup that works best for you if you will. ",

      "body": "First off this “play a lot of hands bc the odds are greater than 50%” only works if every time the odds are greater than 50%\n\nThis is how actually professional gamblers make money btw, they do not do like you said put huge bets on single outcomes \n\nThey play lots of above 50% odds and scalp small profits over long periods of time, generally \n\nBc any one outcome could wipe them out otherwise and they understand there’s a large degree of risk and uncertainty.\n\nYou guys do not get better than 50% odds consistently. You may think you do, but you don’t. You probably don’t even buy options with better than 50% delta, which itself would be a kinda shitty way to gauge odds to profit. \n\nSecondly if we look at the stats for day traders we get the story. More trades = less likelihood you’re a profitable day trader\n\nSomewhere between 13-20% of day traders are profitable first six months to a year and then that number drops the further out in time we go. At 5 years it’s like sub 5% with some studies showing 1% of day traders are profitable 5 years out\n\nSo no, it just doesn’t work champ. \n\nThis goes for retail “investors” as well. Somewhere between 70-90% of retail who buy individual stocks lose money. \n\nThis actually goes for hedgefunds also. Only about 25% of hedgefunds beat the market in 2019 for instance. And these places pay six figure salaries to highly educated people to trade. Still can’t beat a passive investment into a broad index 3 out of 4 times.\n\nYou guys want a fast track. A lot of you are poor and desperate, you’re also dumb, and you see idiots here turn 2k into 150k and you think well I want to do that too\n\nBut reality is the odds are much more likely you just lose the 2k and end up worse off than you make life changing money.\n\nIt’s kind of human nature to ignore potential downsides and a lot of you guys are either too dumb or too wrapped up in this shit to realize that the guy who makes 150k off 2k had like a 99% chance of losing the 2k. That’s why it paid off so well, because the risk was so fucking high of losing the money. He just happened to hit and you’re getting a kind of bias bc the guy who hits that is much more likely to post about it than the guy who loses it. \n\nIf you are already wealthy and want to make options gambles for like fun and maybe hit big enough to make it worth it then go for it\n\nThe average person is actually harming themselves by trying to do options or day trading or even individual stock buying. They are wasting their time, losing money, and under performing a passive approach.\n\nEnd of story. This is not controversial, it’s been well documented and anyone who tells you otherwise is an actual moron.",

Doesn't mean the other 10% are just statistical luck. Stats mask what other 10% have done differently. They could have followed a better strategy. I agree 2K to 150K is pure luck. But making money from options is an art. Emotional control and risk management will definitely pay off. Many people lack the emotional control to sustain for so long and blow up their accounts. But this is also true for any business you start (lacking persistence).",

Had you been born in a sub Saharan African country you might be more willing to understand the vast importance of luck.\n\nIt’s funny that people love to cope that if they could just control their emotions they’d win at options. As if the only thing making this insanely risky was your  poor emotional regulation. \n\nHere’s a video series about evaluating a company by an actual professor and author in the financial space. It is insanely dry, long, boring, and full of accounting terms regular people will not be able to follow. \n\nI would say if you can’t even follow this series, which itself is massively condensed since it is quite literally from “the little book of valuation” to learn how to properly value a company then you likely have no business trading options\n\nI’d also wager 99% of you can’t be fucked to even bother to listen to a few hours of this boring shit and half the ones that could listen can’t follow what’s being said bc they lack the base knowledge. \n\nAnd this is like the basement level of what you’re competing against. It gets so much worse. Like you could look into the Barclays strategy where they realized retail buy shitty options outside normal volatility in the market so they built and entire hedged strategy to sell you those options and profit off your loss.\n\nSo no I don’t think it’s just your emotions and practice that are holding you back, but hey maybe I’m wrong. Can you show us your 5 years of consistent gains trading options? I’d love to see it :) \n\nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUkh9m2Borql51x9Lj8S-bHUq3V6kuix-&si=LzFE_kFqMKqaeHS-",
