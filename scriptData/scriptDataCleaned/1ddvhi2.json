Technically, it’s Apple being philanthropic. Truthfully, it’s Apple getting kids hooked on their ecosystem/product early on.\n\nWhat I’m trying to say is that, if that could happen 4 years ago, in a relatively poor school district located south of Chicago, it’s not impossible that something similar can happen more frequently today. The fact of the matter is that, as tech evolves, education eventually evolves to utilize them in a controlled manner.",

After he got discharged, he manage to land a job in Retail Engagement and Marketing department. I was talking about how Apple was earning all the philanthropy cookie points with the generous gifting of Apple product to schools, he laughed and said it's bs. The goal is to get them used to the products early so they'll subconsciously opt for Apple products because they don't know how to use alternatives nor do they want to learn about them. It's the same shit Microsoft did in the 90s and 00s with their free construction of computer lab programs. There's a reason US have the most iPhone user by percentage compared to other countries. That's why psychologists always end up in MNCs spread across several sectors.",

Our school district handled it a little better by starting the program in middle school and using that as a way to “test” how well everyone could integrate the tech into lessons and maintain security.\n\nFor the kids and the teachers, they loved the inclusion of the iPad. Personally, I feel like it helped immensely with projects and built a lot of experience with tablets and apple products (insert joke about apples idiot proof ui) that lends useful secondary skills when searching for a job. Personally know a handful of times where I had to do basic IT for my office because no one wants to learn these systems, so as a way to build skills for kids I definitely support it.\n\nHowever, again, the hell we inflicted on our IT guys…",
