  "selftext": "Gonna keep this short and sweet for you regards. I wish I had more liquidity to dump into this play because my conviction is really high but this is really all I can afford. Yes, I am a DFV fanboy and following this post as a rubric: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwqln4/how\\_udeepfuckingvalue\\_crushed\\_the\\_markets\\_in/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uwqln4/how_udeepfuckingvalue_crushed_the_markets_in/)\n\nDFV before he got famous would have this stock at the top of his watchlist.\n\n* **$VSTS (Vestis) went down almost 50% on May 3 due to shitty earnings**. It's bounced back a bit since then but there is still a lot of upside here.\n* **Insiders started buying. HEAVILY. Grouped cluster buys.** Insiders only buy when they believe the stock is going up, and they know more than anyone outside of the company.\n\n[Cluster buying](https://preview.redd.it/r1uu2ihxbl3d1.png?width=1235&format=png&auto=webp&s=573b8c390f00c68c2f734e1f83810eb173d2de28)\n\n* **This is paired with Activist Investor Keith Meister (Corvex Management LP) buying in heavily.** take a look at the cluster buying screenshot. He used to be Carl Icahn's right hand man.\n* **Positive FCF -** Current FCF levels are higher than the period when the stock was 52 week high.\n* **Price to Sales (0.54) is extremely attractive.** A P/S ratio below 1 suggests that the stock is undervalued relative to its revenue, especially compared to its peers. Competitiors - CTAS P/S is 7.2 and UNF is 1.28. \n\nMy bet:  \n1x 10c 11/15  \n6x 12.5c 11/15  \n5x 15c 11/15  \n\n\n",
