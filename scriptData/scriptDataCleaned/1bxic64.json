  "selftext": "Been seeing some posts the past two days talking about an acquisition. Bob Iger purportedly said he looks forward to welcoming Vail into the Disney family. These are two corps that print money as it is. \n\nWhat are peoples thoughts on plays? Does one go up and one go down? Both gain market share? I'm a simple regard so please help me figure out how I can use this info to move out of the Wendy's dumpster!! ",
