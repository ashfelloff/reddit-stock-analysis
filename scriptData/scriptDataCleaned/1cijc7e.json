Ok fine, but we can’t see what’s been submitted. \n\nSecondly they already got denied by NRC and are now re-attempting to secure a license and won’t know until roughly in a year or more and even then the whole thing is hinged on this approval (that was already denied before). \n\nTheir only confidence in this is hiring ex employees from the NRC to help “explain” to the NRC why their uphill battle to get licensing should be approved  when no one ever has for this type of reactor before, ever. \n\nSo a company that doesn’t have a license to build or do anything, no access to public records to review the plan, and the odds stacked against them that they will ever even get the proper license. \n\nEssentially this company does nothing and won’t for some time and may never do anything. \n\nI find it very irresponsible for this to even be going public and preying on shareholders based on Sam’s name, (he is only on the board of Oklo btw).\n\n\nThought I’d just add, you can look no further than SMR (Nuscale) for Spac stock comparison (different tech, less innovative approach so they already have a license and contracts to build)",

When the market breaks, there will be room for everybody.  Oklo is less likely to get lost, simply because of the company it keeps, so I think their tech will have lifespan.
