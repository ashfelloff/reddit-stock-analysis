Unlimited free money hack.\n\nSurprise Pikachu face, the Yen depreciates because of the free Yen paper they printed. \n\nYen depreciating makes Japanese energy imports very expensive. Public struggles to purchase things. BOJ under pressure from a very unpopular politicians--hoping to win elections in September--raises rate to strengthen the Yen, just 0.25%. The Yen appreciates in response.\n\nNow all those Yen debt many borrowed are now very expensive. THEY MUST SELL SHIT TO COVER THEMSELVES.\n\nAlas we have a meltdown.\n\nEnjoy Monday everyone.",

                  "body": "Serious answer:\n\nThe Bank of Japan only lends at those sweet zero interest rates to big Japanese banks. Big banks borrow freely and use that to buy safe assets with positive yields, like low risk Japanese bonds or U.S. Treasurys, because hey, free money! But they need to, because banks in Japan have been carrying bad loans on their books since *(checks notes)* ***the early 1990s*** *(double checks notes - yep, that's correct.)* So they need the free money hack just to stay afloat.\n\nBut they will lend some of that money on, maybe not at zero interest, but at very low interest rates. So non-Japanese banks and hedge funds will borrow at not-quite-zero-but-close rates. But they'll get charged some fees and a higher interest rate for it. That's the \"spread\".\n\nBut it isn't the spread that's the big problem for the carry trade. It's the exchange rate. If you borrow in yen, you need to repay in yen. But if the asset you bought is in dollars, you have to change those dollars back to yen. If the yen is dropping, great, even more money for your free(ish) money hack, since you need fewer dollars to repay those yen, and so can keep more dollars for yourself. But if the yen goes up against the dollar, you're going to lose a lot of money when you change those dollars back to yen to repay your loan.\n\nOf course, you can try hedging out the currency appreciation. But currency traders weren't born yesterday, they know perfectly well that everyone is trying to do the carry trade, so USD vs JPY currency hedges are often priced just high enough to wipe out the expected gains from the trade. No free money for you. So a lot of carry traders do it unhedged, or only partially hedged.\n\nSo basically, the carry trade is a gigantic trade that consistently works well for Japanese banks, but only *mostly* well for everyone else, until the yen rises, at which point a whole bunch of non-Japanese banks and hedge funds get crushed.

Everyone's pointing at this Japanese thing as if it's the harbinger of 2008 2.0, but the 2008 crash was underpinned by a housing market that like half of home-owners in the country we were bought into. You couldn't throw a rock and NOT hit a house with a sub-prime mortgage.\n\nMeanwhile, based on the comments on this sub, NOBODY knew about the free money machine that was the BOJ and these Yen trades - because if they did you KNOW WSB would've been all over them trying to find ways to get in on it. \n\nSo I'm left wondering how much money is actually in this... and I'm going to speculate that it's not going to have that much of an impact on American markets, though it might blow up Japanese markets.",

Here is what it spit out:\n\n\nFree Money: When the Bank of Japan (BOJ) set interest rates to 0% or even negative, it meant that borrowing money from the bank cost almost nothing. It's like being able to take out a loan without paying any interest.\n\n\nBorrowing Spree: Because borrowing was so cheap, companies and people in Japan borrowed lots of money. They then converted this money into other currencies (like US dollars) and invested it in things like US stocks and other foreign investments to make profits.\n\n\nYen Value Drops: With so much Japanese money being turned into other currencies, the value of the Yen (Japanese currency) dropped. Imagine if everyone traded their Yen for dollars, making Yen less valuable.\n\n\nExpensive Imports: As the Yen lost value, importing goods, especially energy, became very expensive for Japan. This made it harder for people to afford things they need.\n\n\nPolitical Pressure: With upcoming elections and public dissatisfaction due to high costs, politicians pressured the BOJ to increase interest rates a little (to 0.25%) to make the Yen stronger.\n\n\nDebt Becomes Costly: When the Yen got stronger, the money that was borrowed in Yen now became more expensive to pay back. Think of it as taking out a loan when money was cheap and now needing to repay it when money is more expensive.\n\n\nSelling Assets: To repay their expensive loans, companies and investors had to sell their investments, causing a massive sell-off in the markets.\n\n\nMarket Collapse: This large-scale selling led to a big drop in market prices, causing a market collapse.\n\n\nIn essence, the long period of almost free borrowing created a bubble that burst when the cost of borrowing increased, leading to a widespread financial meltdown.",
