  "selftext": "I've been trading Intuitive Machines since mid 2023 and after the IM1 pullback consolidated my whole portfolio into Jan LUNR call options. The price is down today after spiking to $9 post NSN contract announcement. I look for a culmination of factors - not the least of which is a solid, cohesive, and inspired core team - when making such a bet, and I am supremely confident this stock will hit at least $12 by end of year with the potential, of course, to run much higher. This is how I anticipate it playing out.\n\nThe recent 4.8B NSN contract win is mind blowing. The market, in my view, has not yet come to terms with the implications of this contract as we see the price today pulling back to the low 7s. As we make our way to Nov earnings we should expect a gradual increase and a solid earnings beat, which will propel the stock higher leading up to the second moon landing mission (IM2) currently on track for early 2025. Exact date has yet to be announced. IM1 ralled the stock to $13 before it came back to earth. IM2 may not have the same hype, but the company is in a radically different position than it was a year prior.\n\nBuying this stock today is a steal and if I had more to invest I'd pull the trigger without hesitation. NFA, DYOR, etc.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fhtu6gj1brtd1.png?width=2864&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3694de63240c329b8e5da4036f93a4bb76371a\n\nPS. I have RKLB as a close second in terms of value. I'd be in RKLB too if I didn't put everything in LUNR. I may diversify into RKLB at some point in Q1. Once these calls are realized I'll likely just buy and hold the stock long term.\n\nEdit: PSS I bought the dip this morning with that remaining $682 ;) ",

                      "body": "I can give a hypothetical example, because I love doing this strategy. You can't 'lose' you just cap how much you can win if the stock shoots up quickly.  \n  \nLet's say you own 100 shares of stock at $100 per share. You could then SELL a call option at say the $110 strike for let's say $200 dollars (actual amount you receive will depend on how volatile the stock is) that expires in say 30 days. At the time you sell the call option, you receive that $200. From there a few things can happen:\n\n1. If the price of the stock is below $110 at the end of the 30 days, you keep the $200 and nothing else changes. At that point you could choose to sell a new call contract to make more money off of it if you want.\n\n2. If the price of the stock is above $110 you will be forced to sell your 100 shares for $110. This is the \"worst\" case scenario, and in this case you profited $10 per share \\* 100 shares = $1000 + $200 for selling the option = $1200 profit. At that point you could buy another 100 shares, wait for the dip, or move on to another stock.\n\n3. If at any point before the option expires you want to buy back the option you can do that. If the stock has dropped in price (say to $95) and some time has passed, you may be able to buy back the option for $100 in which case you profit $200 for selling - $100 for buying it back = $100 profit. If the stock price went up quickly to say $110, your option might cost $500 to buy back and you're better off just holding on for scenario #2 above.\n\nNo such thing as free money, so here is the downside. If you bought a stock for $100 per share and sold a call at $110, the most you can make is $10 per share (until the call option expires). Even if the stock shot up to $200 you'd still be forced to sell at $110 per share. So you can't lose money, you just have a cap on how much you can make. So depending on how you're feeling about a stock and how long you want to hold it, this may or may not be a strategy you want to do for a specific position.",

Just kidding, I think as the current 5 new satellites unfurl and come online and another round is ready to launch, you'll see $40 in the not too distant future. Might leap past that, but probably find support around there after. This has always been a long stock. Two years is about the timeline for commercial customers. Private and government customers before that, so you will see revenue possibly before the commercial launch ",

B Rily upped but their credibility is shot right now. Perhaps it was anticipated but present forward earnings are very reasonable considering the size of the contract backlog. I still think it's possible that we have some raised PTs by end of year. And while it may be apples to oranges, RKLB forward earnings are higher, as are ASTS, etc. IM's fundamentals are strong and they have little debt. The shorts are playing around while it's low tide but sooner than later someone's going to get caught holding the hot potato. Personally I think $15+ by EoY may still be conservative, but for now I'm just parroting the longstanding PTs that have been there. There are various analysis out there that go into more depth.",
