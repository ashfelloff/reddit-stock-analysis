  "selftext": "**TLDR**; I’m done doing my due dilligence on IonQ and hold LEAPS that I bought a few months ago during the lows. The price has gone up by 40% since then, and I think this is only the beginning. I expect to see an ASTS-like move within a few weeks to six months for this stock. There are multiple catalysts, primarily technological, as the company produces quantum computing hardware. The technology faces skepticism. I'm not even discussing the SI as I don't care; I’m focused on the fundamental thesis of IonQ being able to commercialize this technology the fastest, and with superior tech. IonQ has doubled their revenues every year since inception in '21. Went public via SPAC, and is being discounted by Wall Street.\n\n**TL;DR of TL;DR:** $IONQ ATM LEAPS. The company will hold an earnings call next month. Sales are increasing, and they will share their first quantum application. The CEO is good at hyping things in the media and appears to be a great salesman who knows a thing or two about software.\n\n**Why I Think IonQ is Worth a Gamble**\n\nThe last time I posted was on September 29th, when IonQ's price was at $8. Since then, the price has increased by 30% to $10.50 today. Some might say, “Why didn’t you share this before it went up?” Well, I’ll be hearing that every month from now on.\n\nTo clarify, my previous post wasn’t sponsored by IonQ, although I wish it had been. I’ve done my due diligence and am just waiting for the share price to appreciate as we head into 2025.\n\nQuick points on competitive edge: The company has a substantial number of patents stacked up. If you Google a picture of their office, you’ll see a wall full of patents. There’s significant revenue potential by building a strong base now. IonQ is currently commercializing its technology and claims to have built out a factory that produces these computers in an assembly line manner.\n\nThere are multiple short-term use cases for quantum computing. Contrary to popular belief that quantum will only be \"better\" than conventional computing in 20 years, we already see practical applications today. For example, quantum technology is already impacting cryptography.\n\n**Cryptography:** Organizations like the NSA, NIST, and the EU are urging others to transition to post-quantum encryption. Quantum computers can compromise data security across tablets, phones, servers, protocols, and more. The estimated cost of data protection is about 5% of the total value, and the total amount of data doubles every year. While quantum can exploit these vulnerabilities, it can also secure them.\n\nAnother critical point is **energy savings** for AI and computing. Forbes recently published an article on how quantum technology could address the energy demand issue for AI, which I found insightful.\n\nMy research was primarily from watching company presentations at the Quantum World Congress, earnings calls, and various interviews. Peter Chapman, the CEO of IonQ, previously led the creation of Amazon's 2-day shipping and has been actively discussing quantum machine learning and its applications. He’s been kind off hyping it up, which is great for the stock. Despite what some skeptics say, this is not all hype, quantum technology is real and is being commercialized now.\n\nI’d love to dive into more detailed arguments, but that would be a long and potentially boring read. Instead, I recommend checking posts about $IONQ on X from about six months ago, when most of the research began circulating online.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, I can say that the TTM indicator looks bullish on the 6-day and 8-day charts, showing red dots that signal incoming momentum. The stock had been in a downtrend for a year but has now climbed back to its IPO price.\n\nI’m sharing this because I’m done accumulating. My current positions are January 2026 $10 and $15 LEAPS, both bought below 40 deltas and now at 70 for the $10 options and 45 for the $15. I don’t see the point in risking short-term options, as it would likely lead to wealth destruction. Shares seem like a safer bet for those looking to invest.\n\nQuantum stocks have faced ridicule, being labeled as scams by academics and former insiders who now make a living from YouTube videos and blogs. But to me, this skepticism is reminiscent of people in the 90s saying the internet wouldn’t take off. From all the quantum stocks I only long IonQ, and avoid the rest.\n\n**Short-term (< 6 months) catalysts:**\n\n* **November 11th Earnings Call:** Expected announcement of the first quantum application running on IonQ's new hardware, which the CEO claims could generate billions in revenue on its own. Still to be proven.\n* **Launch of Forte Enterprise:** A data center-ready quantum computer that doesn’t require ultra-low temperatures. This means it can be placed alongside regular servers without needing a giant freezer for cooling.\n* **December 5th, Quantum Basel:** Their European partner will be launching its most powerful system in Switzerland.\n* **2025 – The Year of Quantum:** The UN, along with smaller partners, will promote quantum computing through media initiatives, highlighting its alignment with sustainable and humanitarian goals. I expect the media narrative to shift from AI to quantum computing, as news outlets look for fresh topics.\n* **Prototype Quantum AI Chip:** This development aims to reduce energy consumption, making it more efficient. I remember ARM’s stock surge when they announced plans for their AI chips, driven by similar excitement.\n\nThat’s it for now. I’m planning to hold onto my LEAPS until they reach a delta of 1, then switch to shares and ride this investment into 2030, when workloads are expected to shift to NVIDIA GPUs and quantum computing to tackle problems beyond the capabilities of conventional systems, and companies like Oracle, Google, and Tesla are showing interest in this technology.\n\nI know I may sound a bit crazy, but in a few months, I believe I’ll see large returns. It’s all part of being early, and I enjoy sharing the information I’ve gathered over the past few months.\n\n  \n**Edit:** Oh, and I almost forgot the most important part; Cramer said that IonQ would never make money.",

I haven’t worked with their engineering team (I’m in algorithms) but I do know some people in the company and I’ve heard since Chris left people have been unsatisfied with the direction of the company. Take from that what you will.\n\nBased on some of Peter’s recent comments and their recent publication on optimization, it is clear that IonQ still has a foot in the NISQ route, which frankly is never going to work. Whatever they’re doing in ML is probably the same variational circuit training that everyone has been doing.(Responding to your other comment) proprietary knowledge can only get you so far, and the idea that someone has a super secret quantum ML algorithm that can be run on NISQ devices for genuine quantum advantage is frankly laughable. \n\nI’ve been in the field for a bit, I’ve met people on most of the major teams. The next few years is really put up or shut up time for a lot of these hardware players. If IonQ can get QEC working and can demonstrate scaling, very cool I am rooting for an alternative to superconducting. But all of the movement of the stock, talk of near term quantum advantage, it’s all a distraction from the long term imperative. ",

I would not idolize this industry if I were you; I’ve learned more in my two years out of private industry than my time in it.

(1) ML is inherently a big data problem, something QC is bad at because you’d need to load in and read out data. Part of the reason factoring is such a good problem for QC is because it is relatively easy to load a 2048 bit integer. Whereas in ML you’d probably have to load your training data, which would be expensive if you have a lot. (2) maybe you’d be looking at solving some optimization problem related to training, at best that would have a Grover sqrt type speedup which would quickly get eaten by error correction overhead rendering it practically useless (3) current methods use variational quantum circuits and classically optimize them, which have no fundamental speedup and people can only point to heuristic improvements. These are on toy problems essentially. For large scale ML this would probably not work at all \n\nI mean you’re free to consider this a larp and invest in this company with your current knowledge.

The company secured $63.5 million in bookings, including a significant $54.5 million contract with the United States Air Force Research Lab. IonQ raised its full-year revenue guidance to between $38.5 million and $42.5 million. Additionally, IonQ entered into several strategic partnerships, including a $9 million deal with the University of Maryland and agreements with AstraZeneca and Ansys. The company also announced the acquisition of Qubitekk to enhance its quantum networking capabilities. Despite these achievements, IonQ reported a net loss of $52.5 million and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $23.7 million for the quarter.\n\n\nIt's exactly as I said. Making a loss and only use cases being ones that are not really market based. Gov and University research. This is the kind of business and tech that only exists with subsidies. So sure, if you have confidence in those continuing and then finding some market for their product where it provides economic value go for it..  but swings of the stock price don't mean anything. It's speculative money losing company ",
