Because right now, for me, it is just a car company with hopium. \n\nWhat I've seen from the FSD of Tesla so far is underwhelming. Mercedes' full suite of assisting systems can literally do 80% of that stuff, too. Yet no tech-valuation. \n\nAlso I would not call 19,9% of BEV sales globally in 2023 \"lion's share\".",

I'm no TSLA fanboi, but i grow tired of the \"this stock is worth $5\" crowd based on personal feelings around Elon.\n\nI personally don't think the 37 it's sitting at right now is high given the potential. I've historically always thought it's overvalued. IF they deliver on the promises, then I think it's undervalued, but clearly the price reflects nobody has confidence in them, which is valid. I could see it hitting $120 and somewhere in 18 months going to $300 if they deliver on the new car and get the factories sorted out. One thing is certain, it's going to be interesting",

It was worse than Hyundai‚Äôs adaptive cruise with steering assist at dealing with highway and stop and go traffic. Really not impressed at all. What really drove me nuts is how far behind a car it would stop. It leaves a dump truck worth of space between me and the car ahead, allowing people to jump in front of me left and right.",
