Shorts covering could push the stock around $30.\n\nAs for the launch, if it's successful I don't see that much selling off, at realitve to buy-in. That would be insane. The launch of the first 5 com merci sats would be the biggest company milestone to date. Their most bullish event to date. Analysts would quickly revise their price targets. It's crazy to think the share price would dump from such an event. \n\nAs for cost it's not even a area of concern. The business is very capital intensive (sat last 7-10 years) but with little OPEX (mainly R&D and depreciation). That's why it's projected to make insane FCF. A cash printing business if everything goes right. \n\nI am not saying I can predict the future but 2024/2025 looks incredible for the company and I firmly believe the current trend up will only intensify as more stats are launched and revenue from service starts coming in.",

Share price has blown up and short are getting burned right know.\n\nAt full constellation they will have around 250 sats in service, making over $5B in revenue with over 80% gross margins. I don't see how transponders maintenance costs could make that kind of business unprofitable",

That puts Lockheed out of business in space.  You can see why I am doubtful on management projections. \n\n\nIt is sketchy when they don't talk about transponder costs. Management needs the stock above a certain price and hold it so their options activate and they can make money. I am not looking to be exit liquidity \n\n\nSo I did buy 19 and under and I got to sell at 20 today. I am just trading the range. Because it looks choppy for now. \n\n\nWhen the warrants activate that will be fun for traders because the marketcap shoots up and float and probably some downside as a result. ",
