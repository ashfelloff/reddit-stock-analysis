(And yes, those years saw many people actually having to cover financial droughts due to shutdowns, which pose risks, but also a temporary change in spending habits which simply made using those offers massively more likely).\n\nIn addition we have seen major banks in the last years, being critisized for being to strict with consumers. There was a phenomenon, where large numbers of consumers complained for having their credit limit substantially cut, despite never having run into trouble paying back. The reason was simply banks enforcing the standards, they had originally set.\n\nAgain: Don¬¥t get me wrong, there is some debt risk in the economy given it¬¥s been on a wild ride, and greedy shadowbanks will run into trouble now and then.
