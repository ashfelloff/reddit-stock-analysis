          "body": "This makes sense. Underrated comment imo.\n\nThat said, there is an argument for the fed cutting rates even if things are not bad. That is, the fed thinks in terms of real interest rates. So, if conditions are tightening, they may cut a little to maintain their target level of restriction without overtightening. I don't necessity agree with this, but it is a point made by Joseph Wang, who understands the way the fed thinks pretty well.\n\nI suppose the difference would be how fast and deep the fed cuts. If the fed cuts 25 basis points and the data remains fairly consistent, that's different than the fed cutting by 25, 50, 50, 75 as the economy deteriorates. The first case is the fed maintaining the target level of restriction. The second case is the fed trying to rescue the economy.",
