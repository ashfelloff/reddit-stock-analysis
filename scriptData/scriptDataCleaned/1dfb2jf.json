Here's my DD\n\nTitle: Assessing the Overvaluation of NVIDIA Stock\n\n\n\nNVIDIA Corporation, a leading technology company renowned for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI-driven innovations, has garnered significant attention from investors in recent years. However, there is a growing concern among some analysts that NVIDIA's stock may be overvalued. This essay aims to explore several key factors contributing to this perspective.\n\n\n\nFirstly, the rapid growth in NVIDIA's stock price has outpaced its underlying fundamentals. While NVIDIA has indeed demonstrated impressive revenue and earnings growth, particularly fueled by its dominance in the gaming and data center markets, the current stock price may not fully reflect the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead. The company faces increasing competition from rivals in both its core markets and emerging segments such as autonomous vehicles and AI.\n\n\n\nSecondly, the dependency on cyclical markets poses a risk to NVIDIA's long-term growth prospects. Historically, NVIDIA's fortunes have been closely tied to the gaming industry's cyclical nature, with demand fluctuating based on product cycles and consumer preferences. Additionally, the data center segment, which has been a significant growth driver, is subject to economic cycles and potential shifts in cloud infrastructure spending by major tech companies.\n\n\n\nThirdly, regulatory concerns and geopolitical tensions could impede NVIDIA's expansion plans and affect its revenue streams. The technology sector is increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny globally, particularly regarding antitrust issues and data privacy concerns. Moreover, geopolitical tensions and trade disputes may disrupt NVIDIA's supply chain and market access, leading to potential revenue headwinds and increased operational costs.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the lofty valuation metrics relative to historical averages raise questions about the sustainability of NVIDIA's current stock price. Despite its strong growth trajectory, NVIDIA's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio are significantly higher than their historical averages, indicating a potential disconnect between the stock price and the company's intrinsic value. This valuation gap may leave the stock vulnerable to market corrections or investor sentiment shifts.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, while NVIDIA remains a formidable player in the technology industry with compelling growth prospects, the concerns surrounding its overvaluation cannot be ignored. Investors should carefully assess the risks associated with NVIDIA's business model, competitive landscape, regulatory environment, and valuation metrics before making investment decisions. Ultimately, a balanced and informed approach is crucial for navigating the uncertainties inherent in the stock market.",

Their software is the foundational pillar that modern machine learning training frameworks stand on, and they sell the hardware to go with that software. They publicly release a ton of their in-house IRAD under \"the Nvidia license\" and it is some kickass software. They do their own AI research too, and I'd bet their deep into the weeds on moonshot research that's looking forward for novel compute architectures. No one is catching up unless they blunder really hard.",

The reason it can do so is bc someone, thousands of people, have wrote them and they‚Äôre available online. So the algorithm gathers all those available examples and spits out a script, based on the knowledge from those existing scripts. If no one had never wrote one before and you asked ai to do it, it wouldn‚Äôt be able to bc it has no examples to go off of.\n\n2) If something is ‚Äúartificial‚Äù, it can‚Äôt be intelligent. And if something is ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù it can‚Äôt be artificial.\n\nTake a real, living and intelligent dog, for example. It‚Äôs real. It pisses, shits, eats, sleeps, bleeds, fucks up furniture, etc. Now what about a robotic (or artificial) dog? Sure it can do a lot of the same things a real dog does, but no matter how hard it tries it‚Äôs not a real dog, it‚Äôs artificial. (Best off the top of my head for an example). If it doesn‚Äôt listen, it‚Äôs not bc it doesn‚Äôt want to, it‚Äôs bc a component is broke, no intellect behind it at all.\n\n3) Now, does that mean all these ai companies should or are going to go up in smoke? No. Are their values bloated? Absolutely.\n\nI read a good post earlier that made the comparison to the telecom boom. I think that is a great example of where we‚Äôre at.

You could clone the absolute most gifted screenwriter in cinema history, but raise them without ever letting them watch a single Western movie and they wouldn't be able to write one either.\n\nAI will never be able to write something original in a genre without context or examples to learn from, but it likely will be able to write original material all the same, and perhaps new genres will emerge from the themes and motifs present in that material.\n\nMachine learning isn't so different to how humans learn when you get down to it, trial and error, learning from prior iterations and existing examples as training data.\n\nGuess we'll just see what it ends up capable of, only time will tell.\n\nYou're second point is dogshit, intelligence is not the same as sentience/sapience and exists as a concept independently from biological aliveness.
