  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "According to the Financial Times, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is polling market participants on the possibility of trading stocks around the clock, as regulators examine an application for the first 24/7 bourse. The survey highlights growing interest in extended trading hours, particularly among retail investors, who are already able to trade cryptocurrencies and some stocks outside regular hours.\n\nThe idea of a 24/7 exchange has gained traction in recent years, driven by the rise of retail investor activity and the availability of other markets, such as US Treasuries and currencies, for trading around the clock. However, institutional interest has been muted due to concerns around liquidity and settlement risk. Some retail brokers already offer 24-hour weekday access to US stocks, but an overnight exchange would require heavy regulatory oversight and approval.\n\nA start-up, 24 Exchange, is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange, with the survey coming ahead of a potential decision. The proposal has sparked debate, with some arguing that extended trading hours would benefit investors, while others raise concerns around staffing, settlement, and market stability. As the SEC scrutinizes the plans, the outcome will determine whether the US stock market will follow the lead of other global markets and cryptocurrencies in offering 24/7 trading.\n\nSource:\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/31c3a55b-9af9-4158-8a49-4397540571bf](https://www.ft.com/content/31c3a55b-9af9-4158-8a49-4397540571bf)",
