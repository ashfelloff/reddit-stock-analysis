Assuming as you said you got in and had your stock offering measured for coincidentally their ATL of $21 in 2020, then you claim your sold for stock for 80 but bought back in at 60. Uber only hit 80 dollars in Feb 2024 so assuming you sold then, you'd have only bought back into uber at the start of August of this year which would be basically saying you got in at their atl, sold at their ath, then got in again at their lowest point this year which lasted less than 2 weeks, and sold again at their new ath.\n\nSounds a liiiiittle sussy.",

Plus, there are not many consumers in the EU or places like Japan that can afford US car prices. Tesla went in to the European market at a right time when the income difference between Northern Europe and US was low and governments were ready to cover some of the price for electric cars. Today things are very different, and every new manufacturer coming in to Europe will have much harder time. Probably, it’s best for Rivian and other high-end car brands to figure out their production, support, sales etc in the US market first.\n\nBut who knows? VW injected some money into them.

Gasoline prices are no longer stimulating EV dreams.  After geometric growth, this year’s production plan was for an anemic 57,000 vehicles.  Then the previously reliable CEO neglected to warn the cash/cost crunch was much worse, so they had to bail out of a needed factory just to plug the cash burn hole.  They got a surprise capital backstop from VW.  But then the previously reliable CEO neglected to warn that they were going to blow even the modest low production plan by a lot.  And the excuse of a part shortage just raised more questions.  \n\nThey are undoubtedly the number two pure EV name, with the above pro’s but they need to start delivering positive surprises, not negative ones.  They need to do something to create bigger numbers than 57,000 or 45,000 units.  Even if it means having an economy car line.  Just to show they are going up not down.  \n\nCritics mistakenly think they only win if they become an Everyman vehicle maker with millions of units.  Not so.  The best performing automaker stock is Ferrari, which has a very small market.  There is a world in which Rivian does well selling to mostly affluent customers.
