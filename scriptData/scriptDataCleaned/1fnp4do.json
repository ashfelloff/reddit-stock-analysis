You saw a trend, bet with it, and it paid off. That said, I have been watching Compass. (COMP) just trying to see if there's a same pattern. If the pattern holds, it should break out for the next 2-4 days. (this is day 1) Then slowly consolidate down. Could go in for a quick uptick for 2-4 day then exit. Or, do a call followed by a put. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbsgnwpuqtqd1.png?width=1583&format=png&auto=webp&s=e228924eaef554238a87fa171918337d7f7cbedd",
