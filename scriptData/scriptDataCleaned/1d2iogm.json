He probably doesn‚Äôt care about keeping his money at risk for massive upside if MSFT comes out as a winner as much as he cares about protecting the fortune should they not.

Obviously the MSFT, Meta, Google, etc type companies are in the drivers seat but that‚Äôs far from a guarantee that your investment in one of them is secure.
