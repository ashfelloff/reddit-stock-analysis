  "selftext": "I've been following SiriusXM, ticker SIRI, for years. Recently, the stock has been shorted to new all-time lows. Currently, about 25% of the stock is shorted, with the majority of shares unavailable to trade due to John Malone and Liberty Media owning 81% of the shares. Shorts also need 5.46 days on average to cover their positions based on recent trading volumes. \n\nSiriusXM consistently generates significant free cash flow and profits each year. However, hedge funds continue to short the stock due to them being a legacy player. Much of the negative news has already been priced in, such as SIRI's removal from the Nasdaq 100. Post-merger with Liberty, the company will be eligible to join the S&P 500 due to not having a controlling shareholder anymore, presenting a major buying catalyst. \n\nThe cherry on top is that Warren Buffett has been heavily buying SIRI and Liberty shares over the past year. He continues to believe the company is undervalued, adhering to his strategy of buying when others are fearful. There has also been increased volume in the past couple weeks showcasing potential major whale buying. \n\nThe stock has been hammered from $6 to $3 in a matter of months, despite no significant changes in the company's operating dynamics. Naked shorting is at an all-time high, with clear signs of market manipulation.\n\n**TLDR:** Ticker SIRI presents one of the best asymmetric short squeeze opportunities in the market",

Spotify, apple, you name it. It was a long time coming for the platforms to get their costs under control. SXM gave back dividends and had cash flow, and was actually profitable. One way they get away with low music costs is they are classified as 'radio' so on a station in 20M+ cars, one taylor swift song playing is counted as just one play. If 20M people listen to T swift on spotify, that's 20 million plays/royalty payments. Now that other music services are profitable, SXM isn't the only one in town\n\n  \nMarket - their biggest market is middle America, truck owning, over 40 customers. \n\n-car sales are down. In a high interest environment, new truck costs, plus a new subscription opt in when you buy are less attractive\n\n-over 40's are aging out\n\n-Avg age of a car keeps getting older i.e. people are keeping their cars\n\n-Apple car play/android auto. self explanatory \n\n-SiriusXM refused to go international. America is the most lucrative market, but they are constrained\n\n-Their acquisition of Pandora was awful. They are generating cashflow through advertising, but almost no subscription bundles, content bundles, or cross over has occurred in the 5+ years since they bought it\n\n-Howard stern - overpaid and won't be around forever. \n\n  \nDo I need to say more?",

Scanning for these, they are rare patterns now.  Almost no major stocks show the hockey-stick now.  It looks as though $SIRI has stared a hockey-stick pattern.  The general stock market still leans bullish for now, too, so on Thursday I'll consider buying some Sirius stock.  (I know little about the company or its services.)",
