  "selftext": "We all know NVDA is gonna crush the earnings beating all the expectations purely by looking at other M7 and tech companies expenditure on AI. But the real question is, how much surprise are we expecting? How much of a revenue boost are we talking here? \n\nAlso I wouldn’t be surprised if NVDA falls <5% on the day of earnings call even after crushing the numbers. At this point, we have seen so many Stocks fall on earnings day despite great numbers, citing bullshit reasons. But right next day after earnings call, Good potential stock always shoot up. So what are aiming to load up? NVDA puts or calls? ",
