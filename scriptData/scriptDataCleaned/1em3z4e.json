And while Google and Apple might be working their own chips, they haven’t been successful in anything AI. \n\nGoogle should see a price decline as AI rewrites search engine profitability. Unless they can get AI to assign the random ads. But Google’s search engine has gone to crap due to all of the model training. Google and Apple were caught flat footed.\n\nI’d take Apple over Google because Apple is just licensing AI and slowly bringing it into the fold instead of trying to put out their own products while it becomes cheaper and other companies spend the R&D money. Google will be in the crosshairs when you see the increase in energy consumption… for Gemini?\n\nBut thanks for the clarification. I looked up Tensor Processors and they are apples and oranges from NVDA’s gpus. Tensors are pretty good at speeding up neural networks for training. The GPU’s are for the heavy arithmetic and parallel processing. All of the other 3 need to buy NVDAs products for their own purposes- Microsoft, Apple, and Google and the devices that will need resources to run anything locally. I’m for NVDA because they have that lead in parallel processing and the boost you get for arithmetic. Benchmarks are benchmarks.\n\nThe only thing on the horizon to challenge NVDA in gpus is AMD, the second place CPU producer. And I hope NVDA will use the lead in GPUs to grow the other branches of their company.

And have been laser focus on developing this very sector since. It raise from underdog to number 1 is due to everything US isn’t from 1980 to now. Their extreme work ethic, the readiness and willingness to pivot and the fact that the founder of these respective company are still at the helm and still heavily invested in the company. None of these are true for any of the possible American/other contender. Look at what a train wreck INTC has been after throwing ridiculous amount of money at them. \n\nAs much as China wants a piece of this action, they can’t simply bomb Taiwan and take over their foundry. They know this. It will just set everyone back several decades including themselves. The best they can do right now is to poach talents. SMCI, Hua Hong, and Huawei have all been poach c level and engineers from Taiwan. Given the language and cultural familiarity they do have a somewhat of an advantage vs USA/everyone else. \n\nBut if you know the politic and culture behind China and Taiwan. The feverish loyalist (which is all of the Taiwanese chip CEO) won’t be tempted. China also has a reputation of “disappearing” top talent and capitalist. Jensen Huang host industry gathering every so often. Check the photos you see every decade. It started out with bunch of mainland/taiwan top dog of the industry.
