However, If they are inflating thier numbers by 50 to 75% that would be bad for the evaluation of the entire AI server market.  \n\nDell\n\nGemini AI:... In the first QUARTER of 2024, Dell Technologies' AI-optimized server orders increased to $2.6 billion, and shipments increased more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion...\n\nHPE\n\nGemini AI:...While HPE (HPE) saw its total server revenue jump 18% in its fiscal second QUARTER to $3.86 billion...\n\nYes, I know there are other companies out there that make AI HW like Lenovo. I'm just saying that the sales that these trendy companies are receiving from AI HW specifically is about on par with what SMCI is claiming on thier reports related to AI. \n\nPositions : 22 calls on uvxy expiring this week. \n(When the VIX spiked to 60 in a day that really gutted my previous positions so I'm poor again) ",
