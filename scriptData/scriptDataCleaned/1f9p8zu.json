In fact both Apple and Google don't use Nvidia's GPUs but Google's Tensor Cores for their tasks\n* the amount of money spent by these large players cannot grow forever. At some point they can't spend money they don't have/make. In Meta Zuck has the final word about everything and can't be kicked out. But other companies can change their CEO when they don't like what they're seeing. If AI keeps making little to no revenue, they will want answers when the hype cools down.\n* the sector is cyclical. Now there's an arms race in getting out the best models. At some point there will need to be a correlation with revenue or the investments will drop significantly\n* the margins Nvidia have are out of this world, but won't last for the aforementioned reasons. At some point it's more economical to shell a billion to rewrite the entire stack to work on different hardware than keeping to give 30B/year to Nvidia with 20B of those being profit. This moment is not now obviously. Because having products is the focus. But it will come.\n* Nvidia has to insanely beat expectations to match its market value earning after earning. In fact, for Nvidia to have 2.5T of market cap, you are betting that it will have 250B of free cash flow in 10 years (rough number pulled out of my ass where you sum the FCF of a decade, but don't discount it nor expect it instantly because you assume they will keep growing even after a decade). They are at 40B something. Growing it 6x might be possible if several factors align (them dominating the software/hardware stack and AI products booming in revenue from chatbots to videos to robotis), but it's still no easy task.",
