  "selftext": "\nHey WSB,\n\nIt's Sunday night, and things are looking rough. The news is bad, markets are red, and it feels like the sky is falling. I know a lot of us are feeling the pressure right now—whether it's your stocks, options, or crypto portfolio taking a beating. It's easy to get caught up in the chaos and panic, but I want to remind everyone of something important:\n\n**It's just money.**\n\nI get it, the losses suck. We've all felt that pit in our stomach when we see our gains evaporate or our accounts in the red. But at the end of the day, money is just a tool, not the whole of our lives. It's not worth sacrificing your mental health, your relationships, or your well-being over it.\n\n**Take a step back. Breathe.**\n\nNo matter how bad it gets, remember that we’ve all got something more valuable than a green portfolio: our health, our families, our friends, and our futures. Markets go up, and they go down—this too shall pass.\n\n**If you need to, step away from the screens tonight.** \n\nTalk to someone you trust, get some rest, or do something that takes your mind off the numbers. We’ll all be here tomorrow, and the markets will be too. \n\nRemember, it's just money. Protect what really matters.\n\nStay safe, apes. We’ve been through rough times before, and we’ll get through this too.",
