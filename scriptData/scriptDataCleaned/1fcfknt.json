  "selftext": "This is not intended to provide advice on a particular sector or stock, but I am merely providing information from an analysis I performed. I analyzed every S&P 100 stock for how it's performed in the last 10 years for September through the end of the year through a number of metrics - absolute change, standard deviation, current performance compared to prior years, etc. This post is focused on September, but it may help spur some ideas for you to look into for the rest of the year. Here's what I found:\n\n\n\n# Sector Seasonality\n\n* SPY expectations are as follows:\n   * -2.60% in September\n   * +1.73% in October\n   * +4.01% in November\n   * -0.19% in December\n* Real estate sector typically has the worst September (-5.79%)\n* Financial sector typically has a very strong November (+5.84%)\n\n\n\n# Stock Seasonality\n\n* From a percentage change perspective, the seasonally top 5 worst stocks for September in order are:\n   * AMD (-6.17%)\n   * AMT (-6.08%)\n   * ADBE (-5.02%)\n   * CHTR (-4.05%)\n   * META (-3.98%)\n* From a percentage change perspective, the seasonally top 5 best stocks for September in order are:\n   * COP (+2.98%)\n   * BIIB (+1.67%)\n   * INTC (+0.75%)\n   * LLY (+0.61%)\n   * ABBV (+0.38%)\n* When compared to other months for how much they typically move, the seasonally worst 5 stocks for September are:\n   * PYPL\n   * MDT\n   * AMT\n   * CHTR\n   * PM\n* When compared to other months for how much they typically move, the seasonally best 5 stocks for September are:\n   * COP\n   * BIIB\n   * INTC\n   * LLY\n   * MET\n\n\n\n# 2024 September MTD Sector Seasonality compared to Typical\n\n* Tech and energy sectors are having an uncharacteristically bad September\n* Real estate sector is performing uncharacteristically well\n\n\n\n# 2024 September MTD S&P100 Stock Seasonality compared to Typical\n\n* Stocks performing well\n   * AMT (+5.4%)\n   * MDLZ (+4.87%)\n   * T (+5.38%)\n   * SBUX (+3.62%)\n   * PM (+2.04%)\n* Stocks performing poorly\n   * INTC (-14.29% - sorry grandma)\n   * AVGO (-15.86%)\n   * NVDA (-13.86%)\n   * COP (-6.83%)\n   * TXN (-7.88%)\n\n  \nThis is not financial advice, especially since no advice was given here. Do with this what you will, but figure some might benefit from this analysis. Every year is different, and this year certainly has a lot of domestic and international political activity along with Fed activity.\n\n  \nIf you have questions about a particular stock in the S&P100, feel free to ask!",
