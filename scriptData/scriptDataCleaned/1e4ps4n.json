  "selftext": "The fires were a terrible thing, but feelings aside... There's money to be made! I'm not sure why this stock isn't getting any attention, especially on this thread.  \n-position in comments\n\nI see potential for a 100+% gain here from \\~$10. The stock alone is up \\~30% in the few days, which means all the shorts are getting smoked, making this an appealing short squeeze stock as well. (\\~24% short interest).\n\nHE is essentially a monopoly over electricity supply in Hawaii, as well as one of the biggest banks in the state of Hawaii. The company has a very low debt to equity ratio and attractive valuation.\n\nThe litigations over the wildfires caused this stock to tank. Now, my guess is that this settlement they are working on is soon to be finished and hopefully the company's liability is not too high. But this is basically a binary option play... If HE's liability is negligible or not as high as expected, then the stock will rip... and it's already moving and can move even more based on the potential short squeeze.\n\n\\*\\*Reposting with MODs permission\\*\\* - originally taken down for wrong flair.",

          "body": "Just some info from someone working with a group of lawyers trying the wildfire case: HECO will ABSOLUTELY be found liable for the Lahaina fires along with landowners Alexander & Baldwin and mostly likely Hawaiian telecom. HECO failed to maintain its infrastructure resulting in multiple downed power lines (many poles are 30+ years old and full of termites) during the high wind event on August 8th. When one of those lines fell in lahaina, it tripped a breaker which de-energized that line. Instead of going and repairing that line, HECO re-energized the line while it was still down causing the overgrown evasive grass on the A&B land it fell on to catch fire, burning down 2300 structures in lahaina. Multiple lawyer groups have been working in Maui for almost a year gathering info on victim's cases and preparing to go to trial. Cases will be tried individually (no class actions) and there will be hundreds if not thousands of victims, most with complete loss of homes, businesses, landscaping, emotional distress, etc. Total damages from the fire are estimated around 5.5 billion, the majority of which HECO will be on the hook for. Settlements will most likely be reached before the cases go to trial but the first trials will start in November if agreements are not reached. I'm not in this play so idk whether to buy or sell, do what you will with this info.",

      "body": "Ok.  So now we know what the liability is.  It is more or less a math problem now.   There are ~$2B of losses but you have to exclude the $70mm already paid into a fund.  The payout is over the next few years.   So discount some off of the $1.93B give or take.  Call it $1.5B to $1.7B.   As far as I’m concerned, the equity value before the loss is the benchmark of the value before the fire and back out the liability from losses.  \n\nNot saying this is the approach but it’s a rough approximation.   Pull up the 10-Q and the cover page says 110MM shares outstanding.  Stock before the fires was about $43/sh.   $4.7B equity value minus $1.6B of liability is roughly $3B of equity value.   Now the press release said that HE is working with advisors to use combination of debt and equity to pay that $1.9B plus they do have over $2B of cash on balance sheet.  So reality is that the equity value may not absorb all the losses.  Remember Modigliani says the only way capital structure creates value is the tax shield if they partially use debt to pay that liability.  So again, reality is equity value likely higher than $3B.  \n\nSo divide that by the 110MM shares and you’re getting a stock price around $28-31/sh.   Oh and don’t forget the stock is 25% short.  So Hawaiian electric could really run with a short squeeze of epic proportions.  \n\nInteresting opportunity and not much debate given that the liability has been capped.  Just how does company come up with the $1.9B over I think four years and whether financing strategies include use of debt and that helps “create value” through tax shields.   \n\nThoughts.  And please use numbers to argue.   I don’t care how you feel.   Liability capping pretty much makes the range of valuation defined.  This is going to be a squeeze of epic proportions I say again!",

Even if they are awarded funds for infrastructure improvements you would expect at least half of the funds to be misappropriated. There is no guarantee that with unlimited money HECO is even capable of maintaining or updating their infrastructure.\n\nThat last sentence is important. Anywhere else in the contiguous United States you expect utilities and government entities to at least be capable of fulfilling their purpose - even if it involves cost overruns or general corruption. That is genuinely not the case here, and we have repeated recent examples of brand new government and utility infrastructure failing entirely, needing to be fully rebuilt, usually overseen by a US mainland company or leader. \n\nIn the case of the Maui wildfires, HECO was repeatedly given money and resources allocated to updating their infrastructure including Lahaina. They just simply didn’t do it.\n\nPersonally, and not based on any strict evidence, I think that Hawaiian electric has been overwhelmed by the aging infrastructure and on its way to failure for a long time. I wouldn’t be surprised if the executives have been aware of this for a while and have just decided to line their pockets as much as possible on the way down.",

As the Hawaii electrical grid was developed so rapidly, it is also all aging simultaneously. I’m not sure how HECO would provide demonstrable progress other than “the grid isn’t broken so what we did was effective” \n\nThat also might be where the corruption here comes into play,  there is corruption everywhere but in Hawaii it is very bad, only recently has the fed started taking action about it, starting with the FBI raid of the DPP. \n\nBut recently the grid as a whole here has actually just been not functioning properly. Maybe it is in part because of the pressure the Maui wildfires caused, but in 2024 alone we have had multiple transfer stations explode, large scale blackouts (downtown Honolulu near Chinatown without power for over a week, hundreds of millions in lost revenue), and now repeating scheduled rolling blackouts in some areas for the foreseeable future. \n\nOf course I’m not claiming to know everything going on, but I can say that things work differently in Hawaii than other states.
