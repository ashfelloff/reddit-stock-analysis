Wallstreet, exchanges, market makers and brokers of course want this cuz they want to make money with commissions and wider spread and casino like volume/spreads. Bad idea for the consumer ie retail, big institutions like hedge, pension funds and family offices, great for the industry as it will become casino spreads. The other thing is, institutions that have algos are at advantage as they can process information not needing sleep. \n\n\nPS: there will still be people staying up late whenever the \"daily\" candle finishes.
