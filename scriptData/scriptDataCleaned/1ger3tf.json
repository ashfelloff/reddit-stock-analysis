  "score": 41,
  "selftext": "AMD will release its Q3 earnings report on October 29th, after the U.S. markets close. Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year.\n\nThis report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. \n\nAlthough AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttdpcfwd7oxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac44262179cb380f1b671b1403562c5d615e51f\n\n**Data Center Growth is Key**\n\nAnalysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. \n\nEarlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains. AMD's x86 server CPU market share rose to 34% by Q2 2024 from less than 20% in early 2022, and Goldman Sachs expects AMD's next-generation server CPUs could further extend its edge over Intel Corp.",

This report is crucial for gauging AI demand, especially as AMD competes with Nvidia in the GPU market.\n\nKey highlights include expectations of record data center revenue at $3.52 billion, bolstered by demand for AMD's Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. The recent launch of the Instinct MI325X AI chip adds further interest. Goldman Sachs notes sustained growth in AI infrastructure spending and a significant rise in AMD's server CPU market share, now at 34%. This could be an opportunity for AMD to close the gap with Nvidia, especially if their results align with market expectations also if you're looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation",
