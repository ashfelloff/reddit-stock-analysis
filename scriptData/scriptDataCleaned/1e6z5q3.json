Crowdstrike wined and dined their customers paid resellers huge margins and spent a ton of money on marketing.   BlackBerry just kept on building the Cylance AI engine and putting BlackBerrys security DNA and OS knowledge into Cylance.\n\nCrowdstrike realized that they were selling to the IT guys and they needed bells and whistles to validate their existence so they added lots of end user programs to view the attacks etc.  Cylance (BlackBerry) didn't understand this as they thought why bother we stop the attacks before they happen.\n\nObviously we all know what happened Crowdstrike gained a valuation 100x of  Blackberry.\n\nBlackBerry has changed they understand now what else is needed and have worked hard to add what was missing to Cylance and they are now working hard to regain the resellers.\n\nCrowdstrike has now been caught out and recognized as being what it is - an amazing sales and marketing company.",
