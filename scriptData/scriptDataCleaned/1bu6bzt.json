  "score": 143,
  "selftext": "With Apple Inc.’s stock coming off its poorest quarterly performance relative to the S&P 500 Index in over a decade, traders are looking for signs that the worst may be over.\n\nThe 12% drop since the start of the year paid off for short sellers, giving them an incentive to unwind their bets. Technical analysts say the stock is flirting with levels where dip-buyers are likely to swoop in. And the lagging run may make Apple look cheap compared with the other big tech companies.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-flirts-support-levels-worst-100001839.html",

Tho I agree that breakthrough catalyst seem a little meager right now, I’d argue that we’re entering a new iPhone supercycle in September as well as what’s anticipated to be a major launch for Apple Watch 10. Also, I have to believe that developers conference in June will bring some very positive news, or at least guidance to developers on what they can be doing for Apple Vision Pro, which, obviously, is just getting started. As a long-term apple investor, I’m taking all of this as just the natural rhythms of the company. This happens about every 10 years or so where the obituaries are written, and the company is left for dead, which is hilarious in hindsight. But I guess that’s where we are.",

Discretionary income indeed is dropping and luxury shopping is off -- but tech purchases have historically been pretty immune to larger consumer spending cycles (for the most part). There's buzz about iOS 18 being a large update that might bring in more AI-infused functionality that of course will be optimized for new hardware. Agree on AVP at the minute but I think holding Apple to task for not proving its value AFTER 3 MONTHS on the market is a bit premature.",

Building your own chip infrastructure that beats amd and intel handily in many metrics is kinda insane.

If little Joe the nobody has the clear \"opportunity\" to buy AAPL under $170, then it's no opportunity at all and the stock price is heading lower. Proper opportunities belong to sophisticated traders, or to the very lucky ones. In this case, everyone would be the lucky one if $170 was the bottom. When it seems that everyone has the chance to buy low, then it's no opportunity at all and you are just catching a falling knife.",

If you can have everything the other phones have, why not fold too since it only adds functionality to hardware that already exists.\n\nI'd bet my entire portfolio that most phones will be able to fold in the next 20 years and it's only a matter of time before Apple releases their own.",
