I would enter an order as soon as I saw a crossover but it would repaint immediately after and I would either sell to early or bag hold for a significant loss It‚Äôs gonna take me a month to recover from this with my current day job paychecks. This is the worst financial decision I‚Äôve ever made. I oversimplified the complexity of options and got completely obliterated. The emptiness I feel in my chest hurts so much. Don‚Äôt be like me.",

      "body": "MACD is a lagging indicator. You have to anticipate the cross, not use it as a a signal. As soon as it crosses, lots of people sell.\n\nShortening the length won't help you, it just gives more false positives.\n\nThe only way I ever reliably made money on MACD was on daily chart swing trades, and even then, only about 50/50 success rate if I took each signal. Instead, I only jump in when there's a major catalyst and/or huge volume spikes.\n\nIt won't work on short timeframes.\nBy the time you notice the setup, you already missed your opportunity.",
