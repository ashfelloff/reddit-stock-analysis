Big dogs sell first and lock out small retail investors with \"app problems\"\n3. When market drops, big dogs buy.\n4. Big dogs tell everyone to BUY THE DIP today, Kramer, Schwab, it's all over the financial news.  Just buy that dip and you will be rich.\n5. When you buy the dip and move the market the big dogs are going to sell tomorrow and leave you holding the bag.\n\nWe have not seen the full correction and have not hit bottom.\n\nAnother 30,000 layoffs announced today in white collar world (people who sit at desk, go to meetings and make $100k or more a year).\n\nThis economy is either in recession or teetering on recession.\n\nWhen VOO is close to $400/share this is the time to buy the dip.\n\nThis is not the big dipper.",

People might actually front-run this because the economy contrary to internet opinion is actually doing alright. You have the potential to blow past and turn prior resistance into support around 4,800. Getting below that requires recessionary scenarios and a continuing cranking up of the unemployment rate. If we start seeing 5% or something like that by next year then yeah 4,300 could be in play. There's no scenario I can think of short of a financial crisis type event that's going to take us down to 4000 or anywhere in that neighborhood. Possible but you always trade on probabilities and that is very much in the tail risk category. I think the most likely event is the test of 5,000 to 5100 and that's as low as it goes",
