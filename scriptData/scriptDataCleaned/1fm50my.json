      "body": "The only reason why SPY calls are ever a bad trade is because regards get too short expirations. Some pullback is to be expected after an ATH pop like that. It will most likely correct and go higher in the coming weeks. A 2 month expiration is usually ok. 6 month is better. Remember just because your expiration is that far it doesn't mean you have to hold them until then, ideally you're selling by the halfway point or earlier. It's to combat theta decay.",
