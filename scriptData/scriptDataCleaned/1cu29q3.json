The poors have run out of money,  both McD and Taco Bell lowered expectations, which means less KO sales.  \n\nPersonally,  I stopped buying Coke when it hit $9 a 12 pack.  That's some bull shit, even though its dropped to $8 now.  And don't tell me it was supply chain problems. The generic soda Shasta never exceeded $4.50 a 12 pack and that's what I drink now.  \n\nThe rich don't consume enough soda to offset cash strapped poors.  When eating out, I never buy soda because it's $4 or some shit.  Fuck - does this mean I'm a poor?!?!?",

Following the constant layoffs, most of their staff is slowly becoming all contractors and they have it even worse. People designing your apple maps, the digital structures themselves, route optimization and such living off of $60k per annum..in California. This was someone I met a few years ago. Married and having a child at the time. How are they surviving? Got lucky with generational wealth so they accepted a job that lowers the average for everyone who didn't have an easy start.",
