I thought about selling to diversify my portfolio, but decided to wait until after the split. Then, I got an ulcer watching that investment drop to under $500k as the stock dropped to the low 80's. I got really lucky, because it came back, but I am not risking that large of a position again. I recently sold 3,000 shares @ $185 and put that in VOO. I'm going to sell another 2,000 shares soon, and also put the proceeds in VOO, and maybe keep 1,000 shares for a while. My point is that 30,000% gains is good enough, and even the giants can fall. I strongly urge you to at least diversify so that you don't put yourself at risk for catastrophic unrecoverable losses. I won this time, but I would never again put that large of a position into one stock.",

In an era of technology, information, etc. it is an advantage to be a large company already. \n\nPeople say it's not possible to beat the index which I think is BS. You can easily pick 5-10 stocks that are on their way out of the S&P 500 and just buy all the other stocks and beat the index. But you won't beat it by much. Even only picking 30 stocks, you are diversified enough that it makes no difference; you might as well just index. You probably need to concentrate on 10-15 stocks to materially beat the index. But that becomes much more volatile and investors are more susceptible to deviating from the formula. \n\nSo at the end of the day it's typically just easier to robotically invest in the S&P 500 or you can choose a more concentrated index like the Nasdaq. You still get exposure to the top companies but you don't have to think about whether you should trim or buy more or swap out a company. The time spent thinking about investments goes to zero.

And yet they have fallen a long ways while others have replaced them.\n\nPrices for companies on the stock market take into account that people feel similar to you: that these are essential companies not likely to go out of fashion.  Accordingly, those companies tend to be very expensive compared to their expected earnings and compared to other similar companies in the same industry because you are paying a premium for the expectation that they will continue to do well in the future.  The problem is that if those expectations turn out to be too optimistic, the high valuation of the company may lead to a big drop in the stock price even if that company still seems to be doing well.\n\nNvidia could be the most profitable company in the world for the next 3 years and *still* have their stock drop 25% because the expectations were even higher than that.\n\nFund managers know more about these companies and industries than probably almost all retail investors, and yet those fund managers *still* tend almost always underperform the entire market long-term.
