That doesn’t really correlate with the stock price anyhow.\n\nI think with NVDA there’s a lot of uncertainty about what the earnings look like and where this is going.

The options are so expensive, one would need a dramatic move for the play to really pay off. \n\nAll that being said, the smartest (not necessarily most profitable) play would be buying shares and selling covered calls (assuming you have the capital)\n\n- That way if the shares rise only a small amount you collect Call premium and keep shares\n\n- If the shares moon - you sell shares for a gain and collect premium and lose out on a bit of upside.\n\n- If the shares drop, you pocket the premium, keep shares, and have a good long-term investment.

People who believed that the sun had set for Microsoft missed out on 64% of returns as of today.\n\nThis analysis does not suggest that NVDA will be worth 2000 USD per share or that it will be worth 500. It is simply here to show that the envy of \"it is impossible that a company grows so much while I had the opportunity to buy shares early\" is irrelevant. Whatever the price of NVDA will be in the future, it has nothing to do with the fact that most of us missed the last train to riches, and we should also ignore the FOMO that the next train is leaving next week. It is simply not the correct parameter for company valuation.\n\nTrust me, I envy people who are holding NVDA and MSFT since 2022 and BTC from 2019 at least as strong you are.
