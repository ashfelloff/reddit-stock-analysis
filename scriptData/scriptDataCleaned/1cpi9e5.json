Sky is the limit with options, yeah you can lose a ton..like with anything else, highly volatile etc, but you can get it back, and because the way gamma acts on delta, with long calls and puts, you can get it back quickly if you figure out a good system, which seems like you finally found something that is working for you. Hopefully you can keep it going.",
