I think the halving and a BTC drop was priced in and now it's not looking like that will happen.  $30 sell target is totally reasonable unless you think BTC is going to explode, which I do.  I'm not selling until maybe $100.  Short borrow rate is a good indicator of peaks because at the price peak, margin interest is off the charts.  Overall, like you, I am often wrong.  LOL",
