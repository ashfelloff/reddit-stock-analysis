So far, it just seems like greed compounding on greed.\n\nTo answer your question, not quite, but we all have our share of zealots. My best friend who introduced me to this stock has nearly 50K shares, and he's not selling. Unlike the zealots though, he's acutely aware of the potential pitfalls. He's a high income professional, and he's just been apportioning his \"play/single stock money\" so a crash or even bankruptcy won't fundamentally change his life. He's already up over a million at this point just on shares let alone call options.\n\nI've also been DCA'ing since 2021 and do have at least a medium degree of conviction that the company will be extraordinarily successful but my timeline range is quite a bit longer from 2027-2030. It's absolutely not a meme stock but I think it's almost impossible for me to believe the damn near 20x run-up from a low  of $2.13 just 4 months ago in mid-April to sub $40 now is warranted... to put it lightly.\n\nI know nearly all of the arguments for and against. I've probably read 90%+ of all threads in r/ASTSpaceMobile, I've read the nearly 200 pg. DD by the Kook Report a few times, I even have their hoodie ffs.\n\nHaving said that, I sold 75% of my stake at approx. $400K. at the $35 mark. It's slightly higher than that now, but $400K is $400K. This is obviously the best single stock play in my life so far with avg. profit % nearing 1000%. I'd hate myself if it absolutely mooned from here on out as I am looking for a re-entry point (regretting selling a bit instead of covered calls), but I'd probably hate myself a lot more for not taking the gargantuan profit.\n\nI'm almost certain the vast majority of long term holders are either: 1) This was always just play money that got in early and I won't sell unless I can retire super comfortably\" group; 2) zealots with relatively low liquidity that NEED this stock to somehow rise even higher after a near 20x run in 4 months.\n\nOP is somehow claiming in this very thread that the stock should \"easily\" go to a $100 by next year, and get a sizable bump after the launch in Sept. Space X has a 99%+ launch success rate... that was never really a concern, so why is he characterizing it as a major milestone that would somehow propel the share price even higher?",
