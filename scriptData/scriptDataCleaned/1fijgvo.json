That's also why Intel just crossed their arms and watched AMD inch closer and closer to bankruptcy until Sony's PS4 deal saved the company, since Intel could just become the sole licensee of x86 without fear of being accused of causing AMD's failure(because it's widely agree it was AMD management that ran it to the ground until Lisa Su took over as CEO). Intel pissed off a lot of people during their borderline monopoly days so now they're eating their karma just like AMD did. If it wasn't for the fact that they're too important exactly because they own the x86 license, government would have pushed GlobalFoundries instead of dog shit Intel.",

Effectively \\*every\\* metric is higher cost for INTC vs. TSMC....and INTC has to charge less per wafer to get any interest.  It ends up being like \"when was the best time to plant a tree?  15 years ago.\"  You need older cheap nodes to fund the newer ones, but Intel doesn't really have any.
