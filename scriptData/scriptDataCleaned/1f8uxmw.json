Are you just spouting things you randomly heard? \n\nWhile it would be great to know what causes it (or if there is one), the cause is not something that we need to know to understand correlation.

The key thing is all of these problems are related to the fundamental changes in the economy brought about by the pandemic. \n\nSpecifically fewer office workers and more WFH. All those buildings not being used to capacity is a big deal, but a bigger deal is all those commuters no longer commuting along those highways. All those people frequently stopped and made purchases or ate at a restaurant near their workplace. Fewer commuters, fewer transactions for those specific locations. All of that has impacts that are negative, but on the flip side a lot more activity potentially near the home. That is likely great in the long term, but in the short to mid term it will be a painful rotation. \n\nIf the rotation is smooth enough it not be a recession, but if the rotation is problematic for a few quarters we could see a recession. \n\nThe great news is that once we finish this rotation we are likely looking at a large amount of potential upside. I expect we will see a huge amount of positive activity once the worries subside and interest rates drop just enough to encourage home owners to consider moving. All that movement will generate a lot of economic activity. \n\nIf we do see a serious recession it will likely not originate here in the US. It will likely be something rolling out of China in some form or fashion. On that aspect I have no real idea how things will play out over there. The system they use to make decisions is incredibly opaque, but its likely they will act in their own self interest and that likely means they will put a serious amount of effort in supporting their economy as needed.",

They can get food near home, someone near the route, or perhaps quite close to the office. All are somewhat convenient. \n\nNow that person is WFH. Would they want door dash from a restaurant near that office? How about some place that was a long that route? Sure they might like the food, but it could easily be outside the delivery radius. I suspect that they simply get door dash from a restaurant much closer to home.\n\nRetail purchase is another matter. They likely go for the same brands but does that matter for the employees at the brick and mortar location? At what point does that brick and mortar location not make sense? Retail is a tough business and many of those locations will almost certainly be facing tough choices.  The consumer will still get the things they want more or less, but the means in which they do will have a big impact.\n\nAgain I think things will be fine when all is said and done, but this rotation will be painful. This isn't the first time and it won't be the last where the economy has a big change.

The Fed was communicating way less at the time (this is a trend that started with Greenspan, so fairly recently if you look at several decades in the past), which might have an impact on how market participants react to the news, and how this flows through to stock prices etc.\n\nIt could be that we only see movement in 2025 or even 2026 as you rightly point out, and it might come from something we cannot foresee (like Covid, which also happened post yield curve reversal). Might make sense to keep an allocation to non equity assets (bonds, commo, managed futures, real estate etc) so you can rebalance if there is a reversal.",
