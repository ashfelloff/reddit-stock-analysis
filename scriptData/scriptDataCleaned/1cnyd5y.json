  "selftext": "Might just be in need of a shower, but Peloton produce results showing $200m+ burn a quarter, CEO steps down, lay off to reduce operating costs and then suddenly the rumour mill and syndicated news sites start shouting about 'potential private equity buyout'. Something is smelling off.   \n  \nThe news of someone looking over the books isn't new, they talked about it in the previous quarters call (or maybe an interim update - I can't remember) and is starting to feel like them trying to push good news out there in order to make it seem everything is fine.\n\nI'm expecting them to announce a dilution event in the near future \"we have faith in achieving value for shareholders beyond what PE are discovering and will use this to power growth...\", when really it's to stop them running out of cash.\n\nSmall 3month put position at $2 strike as a result.",

Peloton makes a stationary workout bike.   They have subscriptions and coaches ect.  Sure it was cool when it was new but in the end like most people who join a gym in January it just doesn’t last.  You have a core group but most people won’t keep it up for a year.  \n\nYou could pay for a real gym membership for the same price as a monthly peloton subscription and have access to weights, treadmills, bikes, possibly basketball courts, tracks ect.   This was never going to be sustainable with how wildly successful it was when it first appeared.   It was always always going to come back down to earth and reality.
