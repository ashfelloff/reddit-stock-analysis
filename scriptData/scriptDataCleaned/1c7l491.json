Now that it's an overgrown baby, it's parents have a hard time controlling it.\n\nPalestinians are being reshaped and erased from history, while our governments keep calling for the bulky to be allowed to defend itself by wiping all the kids out... Literally.\n\nPathetic... My favorite now a days is when governments show 'concern', like its an actual reaction 😂😂\n\nWorlds going to hell, theres a genocide on TV happening right now. And some channels choose to only show what Israel provides and dictates.\n\nCan we also have Russia prosecute its own crimes, provide content for all and unbiased info? Thought not. But IL can because our countries were hyper racist about 60-80 years ago.\n\nNow Palestinians are eating it for that.",
