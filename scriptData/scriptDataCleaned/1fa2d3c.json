  "title": "LLY is beating out TSLA to become a Trillion Dollar company",
  "score": 244,
  "selftext": "LLY is set to become the 1st trillion dollar health-care stock. Eli Lilly has been having major wins since their earnings. Their drugs are no longer in shortage, Zepound was found to have cardiovascular benefits, and their once a week insulin is showing equal results to daily insulin injections.\n\nThe cardiovascular benefits from zepound is huge because patient insurances are more likely to cover drugs like this, without patients having to try other medications since it‚Äôs an actual benefit that no other fat loss meds have and it help lower the risk of their patients being in the hospital, which will save insurance companies more money at the end.\n\nThe weekly insulin is HUGE. The biggest complaints patients have is the amount of times they have to inject themselves throughout the day. The benefit this will have, is that both type 1 and type 2 diabetics can use this and there is a smaller risk of hypoglycemia/lower blood sugar since there‚Äôs no defined peak with the insulin.\n\nhttps://www.biopharmadive.com/news/lilly-weekly-insulin-efsitora-phase-3-data-lantus-tresiba/726155/\n\nI‚Äôve been a diabetic pharmacist for the last 10 years and I‚Äôve been lucky to be making over 40k on LLY options.(see my previous posts)\n\nI feel like this is the lowest LLY will get before it shoots up, tomorrow would be a perfect time to get in IMO with shares, not options (wait till Monday). Thank you for attending my TED talk. Thank me later. ",

But it won‚Äôt go generic for another 15 years. \n\nThere‚Äôs a class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors that are fairly new, within the last 10 years, it was originally produced as a very beneficial diabetes drug, and then they found out it reduces heart failure hospitalization rates/deaths and it‚Äôs a standard treatment for heart failure patients now, with or without diabetes. Insurance companies would lobby against the FDA if these benefits weren‚Äôt true, because they‚Äôre paying a higher cost for their patients, reducing their profits. \n\nOverpromising is definitely a business concept but you can‚Äôt do it when people‚Äôs health is on the line. Safety concerns will definitely shut down a company and get them sued for everything, just look up the company Theranos for example.\n\nIf you want to believe that everyone in the world is out to screw you over, that sucks and i wish you can change your view cause it‚Äôll make you happier. I just think this is a company that will continue to grow and that‚Äôs my opinion.\n\nAnd I apologize for going only at you, it‚Äôs just because you spewed out garbage about health related stuff and that‚Äôs my craft.
