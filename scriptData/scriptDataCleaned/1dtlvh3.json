  "selftext": "Tesla just posted its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries numbers for 2024.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nTotal deliveries Q2 2024: 443,956 vehicles\n\nTotal production Q2 2024: 410,831 vehicles\n\nTesla’s numbers beat Wall Street estimates. Analysts expected Tesla deliveries to hit 439,000 in the three months ending June 30, according to a consensus of estimates compiled by FactSet Street Account. The total number of deliveries in the second quarter was down 4.8% from 466,140 a year earlier.\n\nTroy Teslike, an independent researcher widely followed by Tesla fans, predicted deliveries of 423,000 for the quarter.\n\nDeliveries are the closest approximation of sales disclosed by the electric vehicle maker. Tesla groups deliveries into two categories — Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, and all other vehicles — but doesn’t report numbers for individual models or specific regions.\n\nTesla’s current lineup includes its popular Model Y crossover utility vehicles, Model 3 sedans and the new Cybertruck pickups, as well as the Model X SUV and flagship Model S sedan.\n\nIn April, Tesla reported a drop of 8.5% in first-quarter deliveries to 386,810, the first annual decline since 2020. Weeks later the company reported 13% decline in year-over-year revenue for the quarter, “primarily due to lower average selling price.”\n\nSluggish sales were in part the result of temporary factory shut downs initiated in response to an alleged arson attack at Tesla’s factory in Germany, as well as shipping delays following Red Sea conflicts, Tesla said.\n\nBut the sales drop also correlated with Tesla’s aging lineup of vehicles, increased competition from other EV makers especially in China, and brand erosion that one recent survey attributed partly to CEO Elon Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.”\n\nTesla shares are down 16% in 2024 even after rallying 6% on Monday.\n\nTesla has offered a range of discounts and other incentives this year to try spur sales.\n\nIn China, Tesla is currently offering a zero-interest loan as an incentive to get customers to buy a Model 3 or Model Y by July 31. According to its 2023 annual filing, Tesla generated about $21.75 billion of its overall revenue from China, representing 22.5% of total sales.\n\nColin Langan, an analyst at Wells Fargo, issued a report on Monday, saying the firm sees “declining delivery growth driven by lower demand & diminished return on price cuts.” He recommends selling Tesla shares.\n\nWells Fargo expects automotive gross margins at Tesla, not including environmental credits, to fall given the “likelihood of more price cuts & lower volumes” as the year continues.\n\nInvestor focus will now shift to Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report later this month, and a separate marketing event planned for August, when the company intends to reveal its design for a dedicated robotaxi or “CyberCab.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/02/tesla-tsla-q2-2024-vehicle-delivery-and-production-numbers.html",

                      "body": "I am not home right know to do the research for you. But here is Morgan Stanley’s take on the numbers:\n\n“1st Positive Surprise of the Year\n\nTesla started its Independence Day celebration early with a positive 2Q delivery beat, 33k lower inventory and a large storage beat to remind investors it's not just an auto company.\n\n1. Deliveries beat, but... 2Q deliveries came to 443,956 units vs. MS at\n427,303 and cons at 437,812. While this is one of the first and only positive auto surprises of the year for Tesla, we still believe matching last year's delivery number would be difficult to achieve. Tesla would have to grow 2H deliveries by around 6% YoY to hold volume flat.\n\n2. Inventory reduction, a $1.5b boost to working capital. Tesla delivered\n33k units more than it produced in 20, driving a 7-day reduction in days' supply of inventory (on a full calendar day basis) in the quarter. The 2Q inventory reduction substantially (but not fully) offsets the increase in inventory seen in 1Q (see chart). At an ATP of $45k/unit this, by itself, drives a $1.5bn working capital inflow during the quarter - higher than the $600mm tailwind we have expected. Our 2Q forecast for $0.9b FCF burn looks incrementally more conservative following this print.\n\n3. Energy storage deployments. A 'show stealer' from today's update is the all-time record high stationary storage number (9.4 GWh) for 2Q which is nearly 2x our forecast. As Gen Al acceleration spurs a multigenerational increase in energy demand, electricity generation, and data center investment, we believe investors will begin to pay more attention to Tesla Energy which we value at $36 per Tesla share ($130bn) as the business uniquely positioned to benefit from investment in the US electric grid accelerated by the Al boom.\nTesla getting its mojo back? Little more than 2 weeks ago our clients were preparing for shareholders to reject Elon Musk's 2018 comp package potentially setting up a change of management and strategy, compounding many months of negative newsflow. Fast forward to today, clients are beginning to ask us about positive catalysts into 2Q results and beyond. We're getting asked for our proprietary Tesla Energy model and even our Humanoid robot TAM model. “",

If that's your stance, so be it. But to question innovation is hilarious. Amazon didn't take 5 years to be successful. Apple wasn't worth anything much until the iPhone was released - taking many decades. Tesla ONLY started mass manufacturing 6 years ago. Six years ago, how many of you even heard of Tesla? Probably none. The growth in those six years has been nothing but extraordinary.\n\nAll I can say is I plan on making a lot of money on Tesla stock. I already have.

Maybe they should ask why investors do not trust Ford and GM. Ford was worth double what it was today 25 years ago. That means the past 25 years, you lost half your money investing in Ford. But hey, at least you got some dividends on that. There's a reason people aren't buying Ford/GM. It's because they have zero innovation. And not a single person here believes Ford/GM will out innovate Tesla. No one. And I don't have to get into GM. Went bankrupt, was bailed out, and somehow I'm going to trust this company?\n\nThey call anyone a Tesla investor a cult fanatic. This is just ad-hominem attacks. Speak of the product, innovation, operations, profitability, etc., so we can have a proper stock discussion. It seems many of them are lost and just come from r/politics and bring that gibberish into here. At the end of the day, we invest in stocks to make money.

      "body": "This thread is basically just I hate Elon people saying \"But why is the stock going up? I hate Elon. Because of that, it should go down.\"\n\nThe people with money don't give a shit what ya'll think about Elon.\n\nThey care about opportunity in the market.\n\nThis report is all about Tesla showing resilience in a tough EV market. IDK if you guys have been paying attention or not but EV's aren't exactly a hot commodity as much as ICE vehicles in the North American market. Tesla has had to do price cuts and offer many incentives to push sales. Again, this is a strategy shift by Tesla that shows resilience because they operate at a profit. Do you think Ford/VW and other automakers can drop EV prices the way Tesla can when they are already burning billions of $? Another issue is China competition. China's whirlwind economy and no shortage of EV competitors were expected to eat away at Tesla's sales but Tesla just had their best June in China and is keeping up with vehicle deliveries for the year.\n\nComing into this year, Elon had already stated that sales would be roughly the same as year 2023. Again, tough EV market. ICE and Hybrid vehicles are just easier to sell in this environment. People aren't going to want to try something new when their bank account isn't looking as disposable. \n\nYou hear people talking about Tesla selling fake shit to pump the stock. Look, I'm not a fan of Elon overpromising and underdelivering on new products/services. And you'd have a point if Tesla was the only company he runs. But an even more successful (based on engineering feat) company he runs is SpaceX. SpaceX recently launched the largest space rocket into outer space in human history. Oh, and it's reusable. So all of you guys saying Tesla is selling something fake, just explain to me if SpaceX is also fake. NASA pays SpaceX for transport to space. They sign billion dollar contracts to SpaceX all the time. Not because SpaceX is another pump-and-dump scheme but because no other company can do what SpaceX does. Starlink went from $1 billion in revenue in 2022 and is expected to do $6-7 billion in 2024. They're securing massive contracts with cruise/airline/transporting companies.\n\nAgain, you'd have a point about Elon being a scammer if SpaceX didn't exist. Unfortunately, SpaceX does exist. It's also the most valuable private company in the world right now with no shortage of investors looking to purchase a stake. Worth over $200 billion. Half of Elon's networth is actually from SpaceX. So the guy is clearly doing something right.\n\nNot a single sane person is investing into Tesla because it's just a car business. That's what YOU are treating it as. That's like saying people invested into Amazon in 2017 because of their e-commerce store. No, what people were investing into was Amazon collecting the data and now becoming an advertising giant and their AWS cloud - two things investors in 2015 probably never expected. A significant part of investing in tech companies is to allow the innovation to grow and materialize. That can take many years. \n\nI sure as hell would not invest in Tesla if all they did was did and plan on doing was to sell vehicles. The auto business is low growth, low margin, and very capital-intensive. It seems like Elon realized this very early on and shifted his focus. That's why Tesla went from Tesla Motors to Tesla - because Elon didn't want Tesla to just be an auto company.\n\nLastly, I'll just say this, way smarter people than any of us are tasked with evaluating Tesla for their firm and fund. I guarantee you these people are NOT evaluating Tesla solely as a car company. They are betting on Tesla and they have billons of $ on the line. They are doing their due diligence. The only people who are treating Tesla as a car company are the very same people who would have never invested in Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Meta, etc., in the earlier days before they became behemoths and are now saying these are the absolute best investments to make in the market. And then there are people who dislike Elon politically and that basically means they will never support an Elon-product. If that's you, I completely understand. But we're here to make money so don't let your emotions cloud reality and make logical-based arguments.",
