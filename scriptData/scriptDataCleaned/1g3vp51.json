If you just owned the eth you would be up more, but because of the dividends causing erosion on the price every month, it eventually tallies up the last 12 months of dividends added up versus the stock price. These things are mid tier on bullish outlook on stock. Because as you get your monthly dividend, unless maybe if you drip it, it will not proportionally follow the underlying stock/crypto/options the price is being based on. Although it will trend majority on the underlying price direction. \n\nIt is a good stock in bullish medium term outlook, because it cannot be directly shorted into losing stock price, only the underlying and subsequent dividends can cause price changes, so you are safe from shady traditional market behaviors. \n\nBasically on these stock, if you are mostly bullish on the stock/crypto, then it is lower reward but lower risk, as you get the dividend to partially recover your initial cost basis, going up it gives less increase, going down, you have the dividend already at that price it was at.\n\nTo go further, look at annual dividend history and the ticker for these stocks, and you will see for this one, its lost a majority of its previous price by pouring it into dividends, then atm its the price divided by most recent 12 months of dividends.",

But at the risk of barking up the wrong tree, total return is all that really matters - or some variation of it: risk-adjusted total returns, after-tax total returns, etc. \n\nYou're foregoing 6% total return so far this year to generate income, all of which is going to hit at your 41% marginal rate. You could generate higher total returns, and much higher after-tax returns by owning the cheaper and simpler spot ETFs that have no exposure to futures curve roll costs. \n\nBut as long as you understand that and are ok with it, then carry on. The one potential benefit of BITO is the monthly automatic de-risking of receiving those distributions and not reinvesting them. It's sort of an automatic reverse DCA, which may provide some behavioral benefit to you and others.",
