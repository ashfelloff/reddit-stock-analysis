So if the ESPP buys shares every 30th or 31st of the month, that is the day you sell near market close prices.\n\nTherefore you always sell at a price that you buy.\n\nThat does mean it is possible you are bagholding one month or a couple months worth of shares but that is a much smaller risk than trying to arbitrarily time it every month and getting boned.",

But putting all your money into one company, even if it’s a big bank, can be risky. Index funds, on the other hand, offer more diversification and tend to be a safer, long-term bet. Honestly, a mix of both could be solid—use the ESPP for some quick gains but keep the bulk in index funds for stability.",

So you can think of it as a way to pay a lower tax rate on part of your income.\n\nThere can be other benefits: for example, sometimes you can buy the stock at the price it was at the beginning of some period (e.g., every 6 months) which is an insane deal if the stock goes up. If the stock goes down, you usually buy at the lower of the two prices.\n\nIn general, ESPPs are a great deal, unless you think your company's stock is going to go down.\n\nUsually there is a cap on how much you can put into an ESPP. Unless that cap is very high, I would probably max it out.",
