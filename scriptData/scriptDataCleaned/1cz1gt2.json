As the story goes, Joseph was walking around when he decided to sit down for a shoeshine. While polishing his shoes, the young worker gave Joseph some of his favorite stock picks. When Joseph heard the shoeshine boy giving out stock tips, he figured the party was about to end, and it was time to get out of the market. Joseph proceeded to exit his positions in the market and bought short positions that bet on the market going down.\n\n> Shortly after that, the stock market entered a free fall. On Monday, October 28, 1929, the market dropped about 13%. The next day it fell another 12%. These became better known as Black Monday and Black Tuesday, and ushered the United States into The Great Depression.\n\nI remember back when I had some friends who'd just graduated high school and knew nothing about money how rich they were just flipping houses. Not that they were investing in them, they'd just buy, mark it up then immediately sell them. That's when I knew the housing market was going to crash. And it did.
