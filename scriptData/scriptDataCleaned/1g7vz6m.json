  "selftext": "I am not an employee of the company. But according to some concerning information I’ve gathered from the Chinese internet, this company may be facing the risk of a liquidity crisis, where rapid withdrawals by its users and clients could lead to a same result as the Silicon Valley Bank\n\nAccording to the information I have gotten, the timeline should be like below:\n\n1. JD.com hired a highly controversial talkshow actress as a brand spokesperson.\n2. This led to dissatisfaction among its mainstream e-commerce users, who began initiating mass refunds, leaving negative reviews of the goods, canceling memberships, and requesting invoices (it's a China featured practice because typically the companies do tax evasion by not issueing the invoice but requesting invoices will force the company to pay taxes, which will make the net income of the company decline). Some users also started withdrawing their deposits from the company’s financial products.\n3. It seems that JD.com’s financial products have restricted users' withdrawals; I saw screenshots online showing users facing withdrawal limitations and some withdrawal requests were rejected or failed.\n4. JD.com’s financial products published a statement, denying that they were facing a bank run, but some users noticed that when transferring money from the JD finance app to other apps, the source of funds had been changed to a Bank in China instead of the JD finance product, and I have seen screenshots confirming this. Others claimed there were multiple banks involved, but I haven't seen screenshots of that. So far I have only seen one bank.\n5. [JD.com](http://jd.com/) issued an official apology on Weibo (China's twitter), but users thought it insincere and continued to request refunds, leave negative reviews, and withdraw funds...\n6. JD Finance sent text messages to all users, telling them that the company was not facing a bank run, but this action inadvertently made more people aware of the potential risks.\n7. Some users shared chat logs showing that JD.com’s customer service representatives were intentionally delaying refunds and even mocking and insulting customers; I even saw a representative cursing at a customer’s mother.\n\nAnyway I don't know if the company will bankrupt as soon as the SVB (in 48 hours), after all this company is not a pure financial company and it generetes cash flow from its e-commerce biz. But I am sure even even if the company can manage to survive this bank run, it is destined to lose a significant number of loyal users. After all, if you were insulted and cursed by a customer service representative of an e-commerce company, would you continue to use it?",

                  "body": "There are two major business segments for [JD.com](http://jd.com/): one is the retail business, and the other is fintech. The problem originated from the Retail BU but severely impacted the Fintech BU. It is believed that there might be a cash flow crisis due to a high volume of fund redemptions. Currently, evidence has shown that at least five banks' cash lending credit lines for [JD.com](http://jd.com/) have been depleted.\n\nIt's true that the Chinese gov. won't let the crisis happen. Furthermore, the five banks are relatively small ones (CIB, Jang Su Bank, Shengjing Bank, etc.). No evidence has shown that major banks like ICBC, CCB, or BOC are involved. Also, considering the event happened this weekend, the situation will be alleviated on Monday since the interbank lending market will open for business.\n\nIn short, there will be an impact on the Fintech business in the short term. However, even if [JD.com](http://jd.com/) successfully pulls through this challenge, there will be a much bigger impact on the Retail business in the long term - huge loss of brand influence, a large number of customers closing their accounts, boycott movements, etc.",
