      "body": "Hi,\n\nI would add the 2 physical uranium funds (U.UN and YCA).\n\nChina is building a lot of reactors on time (\\~6 years) and close to budget. India also increasing their construction pace, while other countries like Russia, Turkey, Egypt, ... are also building reactors.\n\nIn the meantime USA, Canada, UK, France, ..., South Korea, Japan, ... (Yes Japan too) are extending the operational licence of a dozens of existing reactors and looking to start a new massive construction of new reactors.\n\nJapan for instance is restarting more and more reactors and also looking at replacing old reactors by new reactors at existing plants. By only replacing the reactor and not building an entire new plant, they significantly reduce the construction time.\n\nSouth Korea did a U-turn in favour of nuclear energy and their reactor design is very succesful on construction level. They have build 4 reactors in UAE (Unit 1 of the country's first nuclear power plant was connected to the grid in August 2020, followed by unit 2 in September 2021, unit 3 in October 2022, and unit 4 in March 2024)\n\nIn the meantime:\n\nKazatomprom announced \\~17% cut in the previously hoped uranium production 2025 from Kazakhstan and hinting on additional cuts for 2026 and beyond, because they announced they would ask the government to reduce existing subsoil use agreements of a couple existing uranium mines, meaning reducing the annual production range of those mines.\n\nBut Kazakhstan is the Saudi Arabia of uranium. Kazakhstan produces around 45% of world uranium today. So a cut of 17% is huge. Actually when comparing with the oil sector, Kazakhstan is more like Saudi Arabia, Russia and USA combined, because Saudi Arabia produced 11% of world oil production in 2023, Russia also 11% and USA 22%.\n\nAnd the previously hoped production of 2025-2028 was already fully allocated to clients! Meaning that clients will get less than was agreed upon or Kazatomprom & JV partners will have to buy uranium from others through the spotmarket. But from whom exactly?\n\nAll the major uranium producers and a couple smaller uranium producers are selling more uranium to clients than they produce (They are all short uranium). Cause: Many utilities have been flexing up uranium supply through existing LT contracts that had that option integrated in the contract, forcing producers to supply more uranium. But those uranium producers aren't able increase their production that way.\n\nWhile the biggest uranium supplier of uranium for the spotmarket is Uranium One. And 100% of uranium of Uranium One comes from? ... well from Kazakhstan!\n\nImportant to know here is that uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\nConclusion:\n\nKazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nBefore the announcement of Kazakhstan on Friday, the global uranium supply problem already looked like this\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gt13ui1a86md1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d52408a5467bdfb44cc3a88d54d8bc1198e6bc9\n\nSource of this picture: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of the 2 global consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in the world\n\nThis isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing\n\nCheers",

                              "body": "As you can see on the graph on page 46 solar plus battery (4hr) is already much more competitive than nuclear. Now 4 hr storage obviously isn’t baseload but the cost differential is substantial enough that you can likely triple the storage component to 12 hrs and still be at/below nuclear as of today on 2024. At this point you are quasi baseload in terms of capacity factor. As of now gas is still more competitive which means for the next few years the best option would be PV + battery for 60-80% of the load and natural gas for the remainder until the batteries have improved their pricing by another 2-3X at which point you can scale up to 95%+ PV+BESS and just keep the natural gas for backup / emergency. \n\nHowever the economics, the key issue with nuclear is the level of complexity and timelines involved - even if you by some miracle get a site fully permitted tomorrow (in reality it’ll take 5-10 years) you won’t generate electricity before 2035 just because the timeline involved in building the thing. On the other hand, I’m quite confident that you can get multi GW scale solar plus battery developed, financed and built within 3-4 years still on time for corporate RE100 by 2030 targets.  \n\nI get the appeal of nuclear and I’m not one of these anti nuclear zealots (in fact we should have built more nuclear and less coal over the past decades) but there is an inherent learning curve logic to solar and batteries that has crossed the threshold where it has become clear that no other form of electricity generation will be able to compete until we can get to fusion which will be another game changer and enable us to push cost of energy towards zero at any time of the day while solar is now pushing it to zero during sunshine hours only..",

I talked to my friend who runs a data centre company, and he said that effectively, there's degrading of efficiency based on how long you want to store. You'd typically want 12 hours of storage to handle base load, which is not 3x as much capacity as 4 hours, but about 8x - because time under storage also matters.\n\nIn large countries, like the US and Australia, there's about three and a half hours of extra solar coverage coast to coast, so you could possibly get away with 7 in summer and 10 in winter, as long as you can transmit that much power cross continent.",
