Tariffs are supposed to \"help\" domestic companies that can't compete on price with the international competition by artificially raising the price of those international companies. The argument is that you preserve jobs and/or domestic production in specific sectors, even though it's more expensive to do here. Tariffs will never directly make prices lower because they are literally just increasing the price that you pay on the components that you need.\n\nThey could indirectly make prices lower in the medium to long run if production for the things with tariffs on them is brought stateside, but this takes time- you can't just magically make a steel or microchip manufactory appear in a year. Probably not even by the end of the presidential term. It takes years and years to ramp up production, and prices take time to respond to that change in production. If you imagine a graph with a line of prices vs. time, prices will spike when tariffs are put in place, then very slowly come down as new companies enter the domestic market. \n\nBut there is no guarantee that prices will end up lower with the tariff in place than what can be done by international companies abroad. If one of the primary reasons for higher domestic prices for a good is labor, and our labor is much more expensive than the international companies, then we can't magically make that labor cheaper unless you go heavy on automation- which defeats the \"job-saving\" argument for tariffs.",

Manufacturing has died off in the US because foreign manufacturers can produce goods at prices domestic manufacturers can’t match, because foreign manufacturing can use cheap labor, cheap materials, and minimal quality control. Similar to when China started dumping cheap, dirty steel on the US market. So imposing tariffs shapes market conditions, allowing domestic manufacturing to be able to compete and will force foreign companies to build manufacturing plants in the United States that do pay better wages and follow manufacturing regulations. So yes, it would increase prices by eliminating most of the cheap, China-produced garbage that has flooded the market.\n\nBeyond that, they are a negotiating tool. Why should we allow 10% tariffs by Europe and Japan on US manufactured vehicles with no tariffs in response? Impose a similar 10% tariff on their vehicles, and they will have to negotiate. Either that, or consumers will turn to domestically produced vehicles, again creating more jobs domestically and expanding the domestic manufacturing base. \n\nSo the situation is either make money off tariffs while simultaneously creating a space in the market for domestically-produced goods the be able to compete again, or force foreign companies to move their manufacturing into the US to avoid tariffs (which again, their home countries typically have imposed against our exports).",

It think its very rare that the government can be directly credited or blamed for a recovery or crash. In my view they either mitigate a recession or encourage a boom they're never the sole reason for how the economy is doing since the economy is largely operated by private captial.",

So these tariffs—even if applied perfectly without loopholes and other fuckery—is that it will raise prices because the American-made version of things will be higher anyway. \n\nThis means that some companies might move their production to America…but most will choose to just keep manufacturing overseas and pass the tariff cost onto the consumer. \n\nNo troubles with switching production lines, building facilities, hiring and training American workers, just an additional cost passed to the consumer.",
