It's a dumpster fire that's making a nose dive into the Marianna's trench.",

              "body": "Ehhhhhh.  Dune  movie rights are owned by Legendary Pictures (who recently decided to give a big fuck you to WB and have signed a deal with Sony for future distribution) -- not WB.  and I believe WBD has a primary lease agreement to distribute Dune which means fixed fee instead of profit sharing. Most of the Box Office (after Theaters, etc get their cut) will go toward Legendary Pictures and co., not WBD.\n\nBarbie movie is done by Mattel Films and IP is still owned by Mattel, they could take their movie to Sony or Disney or Universal as distributors instead -- which they very well might do that. Not sure on the distribution agreement between Mattel and WB but I'd guess it might be mostly fixed fee with maybe very small profit-sharing as well.\n\nHarry Potter as an IP is dying. The Fantastic Beasts series flopped so hard they stopped making them. Their new remakes are probably going to do poorly and even all the Harry Potter tumblr mega-fans I know aren't interested considering it wasn't even that long ago that the series was made.\n\nBest case for WBD imo is Zaslav continues to run it into the ground until it's smoldering ruins and Disney buys it out for peanuts, though I'm not sure even Disney would be interested?\n\nWith movies, you gotta be really careful because it's a complex quagmire. Disney is smart in that they own a ton of production companies inhouse so they get to eat all the juicy box office profits. Other ones like Universal and Sony also have their own production studios but also distribute other production companies films. You gotta look into how the IPs are actually owned, produced, and distributed. \n\nMost of these you listed (except HP) are owned by the production studios themselves with most money going to the production companies, not the distributor.",
