  "score": 215,
  "selftext": "Bought $SPY 555C on 5/28 $23,598 cost (avg $.68 per contract, 347 contracts) \nSold 7/16 total $266,786 (avg $7.69 per contract)\n\nTL;DR I put 40% of my net worth in a desperate plea to feel something and recover losses. I sold all for $266k total profits and now SBF can suck my balls.\n\nBasically I had a few deaths close to me and I was so numb to the world, I needed something to make me feel alive again. I watched a YouTube video and the guy did a good job convincing me that the market was going up 10%+ in the next 2 months so I thought “no better way to feel alive.”\n\nI had about $23,600 in my account (another 40 in savings so it wasn’t everything) and I was gonna risk 11k worth…. I ended up averaging down over the next week or two until I had all 23,600 in. Balls deep or balls home.\n\nThen it started going up, about 3 weeks after I bought I was up a good 50k but still holding, it reached $555 (my strike) and I took a cut to pay for my vacation and secure profits ($38k) when it was up around $100k… Then Nvdia took a shit and it dipped during my vacation, down as much as 60k while I was out. But I wasn’t gonna sell while down cuz that’s what losers do!\n\nWhen we got back it went straight up and blew past my strike, it was up $120k but I wanted MORE!! So I waited until 2 weeks before expiration and here things get wild.\n\nLast Tuesday was a normal +20k or so day, but Wednesday I saw my trade up $105k intraday ending 94 up. Thursday, I was down $99k intraday, ended $89k down BUT I WONT SELL! Friday I’m up $115k intraday and I cut 18k of profits, but it dropped to +57k so I couldn’t sell it all, cuz selling while down is how you lose.\n\nNow I’m thinking it’s expiration week and I need to maximize profits. Monday we’re up a good chunk in the morning and J POW is about to speak, so I cut 100 contracts ($101,250) and then J POW opens his mouth and we tank, but it’s ok, I’ve still got 4 days no big deal.\n\nThen yesterday I had a feeling that we were gonna break ath in EOD run up, and there’s gonna be a shit storm the next day. So I set my sells 130 contracts at 10.18 and damn if it didn’t sell 5 minutes after I set it. $266k in profit and my $20k ftx loss is no longer important.\n\nToday I’d be down $200k if I didn’t sell so whoever tells you that you can’t time the market should gamble more.",
