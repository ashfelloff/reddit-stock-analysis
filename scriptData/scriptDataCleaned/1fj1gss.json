Your purchase of Intel shares shortly before the price drop a few months ago attracted significant attention on Reddit, and we reported on it as well.\n\nAt that time, you mentioned in your post that your parents were unaware of your investment. I am now interested to know if you have since discussed it with them, and if so, how they reacted.\n\nI am also interested in the following:\n\nHow do you assess the development of Intel's stock price since your purchase?\n\nHave you followed the release of the new Arrow Lake CPUs (Core Ultra 200), and if so, what is your evaluation of it?\n\nI would be very grateful if you could provide me with some information on these topics, but of course, I fully understand if you prefer not to.\n\nEither way, I wish you all the best and hope that the Intel stock price recovers sooner or later.\n\nBest regards\n\nNils",
