The S&P 500 finished the month with a decline of about 3.4%, as the market was beginning to react to the emerging financial crisis.\n* **September 2019**: The Fed cut rates by 25 basis points on September 18, 2019.

Granted, idk what version you're on, but sometimes, when I'm asking the poor-people version questions, about options specifically, it’s backward. And then when I question/correct it, it's like, \"You're right! I'm sorry.\" \n\nLike, that's it? What if I were some regard that never traded options before and was trying to learn the shit I just asked about? It would've told me the exact opposite of what I needed to happen, and I would've lost money. \n\nI mean, I am some regard, and I lose money anyway, but still, at least I'm mostly aware of why I'm losing it as I lose it.",
