      "body": "Maybe you should look at themes over the next 10 years and invest into etf’s based on that. Investment across a decade limits one’s perspective and possible investment theses.\n\nSo, electrification across sectors will continue to be a thing - from grid upgrades, solar and wind power, heat pumps, electric cars, batteries and induction stoves that drive consumer and commercial electric component upgrades and so forth. So TSLA has significant exposure to that, but not the only one, and only some parts of that. So GRID ETF, BATT, QCLN and many others capture parts is that. Also into utilities, as they will likely make more and sell more power and pay a good dividend for years to come. I like RIVN, take risks in Chinese EV providers, XLU and maybe other specific utilities, maybe a well oversold charging network, trying to find a way into Eaton and some of the other grid and electric component providers like them.\n\nOngoing AI …. but that may play out to a bubble this year, with NVDA being a clear recipient of capex spend from a slew of other companies. Maybe more spend in PLTR by various gov and others, but unclear how many folks will truly monetize AI. Could be self driving with Mobileye and Tesla or one of the chinese like XPEV or NIO, maybe Google. Could be one of the humanoid robot efforts or existing industrial robotics, like Funac, Kuka, or TSLA, but NVDA is a major parts supplier for the efforts that are not publicly traded. Could be AAPL with their pragmatic consumer focused strategy with stuff that announced at WWDC, but likely AMZN, MSFT, and Google also respond, and also provide cloud AI infrastructure for both consumers and businesses.\n\nBiotech has often been well oversold, but as usual, a wild west of dreams and charlatans, with investors being bipolar over prospects and hard to tell the diff between stuff that will work or not until stuff works. I do have some ARKG due to exposure to CRSPR stuff, and some RCUS for anti-TIGIT, but very speculative.\n\nInterest rates are likely to pivot coming up which could mean a slew of things. I think the housing market gets better, so mortgage writers and some real estate plays do better, so got into UWMC, Zillow, etc. Fed may have a soft landing, or cause a recession. Lots of various interest rate plays with companies beaten down in valuation due to high borrowing costs. Solar has been affected in a big way due to that due to high borrowing costs for project funding to at affects ROI and the recent surge in FSLR is due to folks recognizing that AI used a crap ton of electricity and so commercial and utility grade solar is huge. But that story has politics and tariffs that buffet it. Also interesting to me are synthetic dividend generating index following like QQQY, QYLD, NUSI, and so forth. Be wary - some are not intended to be held for long periods of time. See how they do in down and up markets to see if they make sense for what you want. For me, indexes doing lots of sideways choppy action is high in my mind so very high dividends that limit upside is fine for a segment of my portfolio, and I use that cash for highly speculative plays.\n\nYou can certainly look at the components of theme based ETFs and construct your own by picking choosing from them. For a decade, likely a slightly broader exposure will be better served, but be wary of over concentration of a theme that doesn’t work out. For example, you might have chosen a basket of EV related stocks in late 2021 and now some are bankrupt, many are 75-95+% down. But some are now so beaten up and the narrative has gotten way overhyped to the downside that their upside is huge. But one of the problems with looking across a decade is that a boom can come and go within 1-3 years.. upside is huge, and then the world moves on, and that could very well be any number of biotech stories, or stuff like 420 and 3D printing stocks. Again, some of the stuff that is most out of favor can come roaring back.. crypto for example.\n\nGood luck!",

I don’t think a $$$ amount can be put on adding say 5-10 years to one’s life.\n\nI like the portfolio you laid out. Maybe not a huge fan of msft but it’s not terrible. I would maybe add a sap 500 etf or something along those lines to get coverage of all companies and sectors.\n\nOther stocks I like- stuff like Raytheon and Lockheed Martin.
