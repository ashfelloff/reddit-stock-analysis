The best part is most of the future revenue could be in royalties for using their QNX SW or from Cyber security with increasing cyber threats. Their QNX RTOS (real time operating system) is almost as fast as native linux. This should help me further adoption where you want to run your ADAS SW in the same HPC as your interior lighting but want to protect your ADAS SW in the event that part of the SW running on the SOC is crashing/buggy and isnt allowed to take any bandwidth away from ADAS systems... This ability to separate and run mixed criticality systems on the same chip will and should help BB. I also see a massive boost when we have connected vehicles and vehicles connected to the grid.

This is purely from my thoughts on the TA of BB. All the blue lines drawn is where I think algos were driving the price. All the lines are copies of just one line.
