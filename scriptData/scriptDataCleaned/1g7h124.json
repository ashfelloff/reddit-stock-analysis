      "body": "This isn't an inherently \"stupid\" idea. But you should consider carefully whether the strategy fits your circumstances, otherwise you might end up with sub-par performance.\n\nThis strategy involves more active involvement than the purely passive approach of \"buying the index.\" You'll need to do more research up front to get comfortable with allocating a sum of money to each individual stock, and you'll need to track these companies on an ongoing basis to see if your initial thesis still holds. That's fine if you have the aptitude, interest, and time for this sort of work, but it'll feel like a drag if you don't.\n\nThis effort also exacts an emotional toll. If you're going to be biting your nails and tearing your hair out every time there's a huge drawdown - and over 20 years, there will probably be one (or more) - you should ask yourself if it's worth the stress.\n\nYes, I know, there are drawdowns on the S&P 500 too but, from my experience, the stress you feel from a huge drawdown on a passive investment is an order of magnitude less than what you'd feel on an active one. In the latter case, you'd be wondering if **you** screwed up, whereas in the former, you'd have a lot more confidence that the market will recover (given enough time).",

I.e if there is an AI type dot-com crash, or Google gets split, or something happens to Amazon. Obviously the whole market will turn if any of these things happen, but the market is more resilient. And the other side is that you will need to be more active in your investment, I.e keeping up with the companies you are invested in, instead of being completely hands off with a safe ETF. But as other commenters pointed out, the stocks you’re looking into make up a lot of VTO anyways, you’ll just have higher risk and potentially higher return, and will need to be more active in your investments.",
