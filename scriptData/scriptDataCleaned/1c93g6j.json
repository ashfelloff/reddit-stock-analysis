The only thing that might save the FED in the short term is the EU is looking like it might cut its rates - If that happens, lots of money will shift out of Europe and gobble up the 5% yield on US paper.\n\nBut considering we are adding $1 Trillion in new debt every 100 days - it's just a matter of time.",

In order to protect against that, our central bank will have to lower rates which will lower our dollar vs USD. So, since it's almost certain that the USD will get stronger against the CAD, lots of money is flowing into US markets from here as a hedge. They don't need or want to buy stocks so instead they buy treasuries.\n\nCanada is small potatoes but the same thing is happening in Europe and China. They will want a secure investment in the US.\n\nThe risk of course is that the US also lowers rates. How would you hedge against that? Buy treasuries. If US rates go down, the value of the bonds already issued will go up. \n\nBasically, I think there should be strong demand for long term US treasuries which will keep it deflated. However, I also think that the reason is because the US economy is STRONG so I wouldn't worry about a major crash.\n\nThen again, I lose money on everything I touch so if I bought treasuries the US would probably collapse as a country.",

It's the landlords and eventually, the banks.  \n\nThe operators who own office space can consolidate move offices, rent them etc.  \n\nBut landlords are fucked. \n\nCommercial Real Estate loans work on a 25 amortization, but a 10 year call. So the loan payments are set up for 300 months, but in 10 years you have to refi. That way the bank makes the most interest since you pay that upfront. \n\nA ton of landlords have low interest rate Commercial Real Estate loans, but are now being forced to refi. \n\nSo let's say you own a small office building that you have a $4 million dollar loan on. CRE loans have higher than average interest rates, so at 4% that's a loan payment around 20k. But at 9% that's a loan payment of $32,000 a month. \n\n\nNow, normally you could pass these costs via rent. But if an office tenant is on a 10 year lease you can't. In addition, because of an oversupply of office space due to so many companies still doing work from home as well as too many offices being built, landlords likely *won't* be able to increase rents. Tenants will just relocate. \n\nSo a whole fuckton of landlords are gonna get wrecked as month by month more and more are being forced to refi as rates stay high\n\nNow as more and more of these landlords go bankrupt banks will suffer. Which is why we're seeing stories like this: \n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-regional-banks-seen-booking-more-commercial-property-losses-loan-sales-2024-04-17/\n\nI know WSB is all about gains and diamond hands or some stupid shit like that, I have my econ degree so I'm only here for the loss porn. \n\nBut believe me when I tell you: This alone will devastate the market and the economy.

It therefore seems that monetary policy is made up on the fly, rather than having a model that works for all time.
