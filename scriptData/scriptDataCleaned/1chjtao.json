And now he raised interest rates getting people laid off, and increasing problems for the people who are not millionaires. Rich still stays rich, getting richer for free from interest payments to their capital. They just park their money into t-bills now and get paid thousands of USD per day from interest payments from the central bank. He killed 3 birds in a row. He is very smart\n\nHe is smart also, because he thinks they will not find out what he is trying to do, even though he looks scared in interviews. In one interview, he is literally sweating. The whole government and system is on his side. Somehow I feel though he is gonna lose big in the end. In one recent interview, he was asked what is he afraid of the most (except inflation), he tried to evade this question by saying inflation and skipping the question. Obviously he is afraid of being caught and tried. A big punishment might be at the end of this (a life sentence). This is an abuse of monetary policy of global magnitude. This is the biggest financial crime in history. Something big is going to happen. Eventually US will lose to China and power will shift. This will happen because of people like him (or his masters)",
