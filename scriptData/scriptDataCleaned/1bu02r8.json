They have the best talent acquisition in the world, and I was legitimately inspired by everyone that I met on campus. Absolutely incredible organization. When I worked there you could spend 10% of your paycheck on Apple Stock and you would get said stock at a 15% discount. Plus they would literally just give you shares for any reason they could think up. I was able to accumulate a lot of shares. And to me it’s no different than VTI. It would take a decade or more of clear mismanagement to bring Apple down. So if you think they are underperforming right now, buy more, they’ve always got something in the lab they’re developing. They’re incredible at keeping secrets too. We had regular secrets training. One of the last Tim Cook led meetings I was a part of was regarding AR, back in 2016. I’d been waiting for Apple Vision to come out for almost decade after I left. I can almost guarantee they’ve got some massive AI news coming for WWDC, that they aren’t behind the curve, and that they are just waiting until they can disrupt.",
