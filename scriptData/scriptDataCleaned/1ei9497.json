  "title": "Sahm Rule Signalling Recession",
  "score": 94,
  "selftext": "# Background\n\nThe Sahm Rule is a recession indicator introduced by macroeconomist Claudia Sahm in 2019. It is designed to signal the early stages of a recession based on changes in the unemployment rate. Here are the key aspects of the Sahm Rule:\n\n1. Calculation: The rule compares the current three-month moving average of the U.S. unemployment rate to the lowest three-month moving average unemployment rate over the preceding 12 months.\n2. Threshold: A recession is signaled when the current three-month moving average unemployment rate exceeds the lowest three-month moving average of the past 12 months by 0.50 percentage points or more.\n3. Data source: The rule uses the unemployment rate (U3) data released monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n4. Smoothing effect: By using a three-month moving average, the rule aims to prevent overreacting to a single month's data.\n5. Historical accuracy: According to Sahm, the rule has never triggered outside of a recession since the 1970s.\n6. Real-time vs. current indicators: The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database provides both current and real-time Sahm Rule recession indicators.\n7. Origin: Sahm introduced this indicator in a policy proposal for The Hamilton Project, suggesting automatic stimulus payments to individuals when the rule signals a recession.\n8. Purpose: The rule is designed to identify the onset of a recession quickly, allowing for timely implementation of fiscal policies to combat economic downturns.\n9. Limitations: While historically accurate, the rule is an \"empirical regularity\" rather than a definitive proposition, and circumstances such as GDP growth and inflation levels could influence its effectiveness.\n\nThe Sahm Rule has gained recognition for its simplicity and effectiveness in identifying the early stages of recessions, making it a valuable tool for economists and policymakers\n\n# Current Sahm Rule\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7y17obwqx8gd1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=5909a14eb9ae79c6dcf59e3add07536a03746836\n\nWith unemployment raised to 4.3%, in today's job report we are pass the 0.50 threshold in the Sahm Rule",
