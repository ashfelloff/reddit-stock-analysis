The first thing that is happening is seeing accelerating computing. - (CPU GLUT and WHY INTEL IS HAVING SO MANY ISSUES)\n\n\\*\\*\\* 7:30 - If you use spark and accelerated it, it's not unusual to see a 20 to 1 speedup. You reduce the computing around 20 x's. But you get a 10x savings. And it's not unusual to see this kind of ROI for accelerating computing.\n\n8:06 - everything you can accelerate to accelerate and run it with GPU's. That's the instant ROI you get with acceleration.\n\n\\*\\*\\* 8:21 - now beyond that, generative AI conversation is in the 1st wave of GAI - the infrastructure in the cloud is used for models and the return is fantastic because the demand is so great that for every $1 they spend with Nvidia translates to $5 dollars worth of rentals.\n\n9:37 - the days of code every line being written by software engineers are over. 23k employees can go 100x because of digital assistants.\n\n10:40 - Nvidia's new GPU's are 35,000 parts, weighs 80 pounds. When you rack it up it weighs 3,000 pounds.\n\n11:23 - If you we have to shift to another fab we can do it. (disaster recovery)\n\n11:50 -TSMC is the world's best by an incredible margin\n\n12:07 - the fact that they can scale. Nvidia had a major hockey stick of revenue because of the supply chain of TSMC.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\* 12:29 - In just less than a year we've scaled up CoWos capacity tremendously and **we will have to scale it up more next year, and scale up even more the year after that**. We use TSM because they're great. - (this is really important for how long this will last).\n\n12:56 - what do you worry about? Our company works with every company in the world today. Enormous responsibility. We have a lot of people on our shoulders\n\n\\*\\*\\* 13:35 - everyone is counting on us because demand is so great that delivery of our components and our technology and our infrastructure and software is really emotional for people. Because it directly affects their revenues and it directly affects their competitiveness. We probably have more emotional customers today than ugh...  And deservedly so. We have a lot of responsibility on our shoulders. We're trying to do the best we can. It's really tense.\n\n**\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* 14:12 - and here we are RAMPING BLACKWELL - It's in FULL PRODUCTION - We'll ship in Q4 and scale into Q4.**\n\n\\*\\*\\* 14:40 - the intensity is really intense and so - The world is on our shoulders you know.",
