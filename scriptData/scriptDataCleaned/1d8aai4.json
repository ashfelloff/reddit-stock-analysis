  "selftext": "Is it finally the time to look at INTC closely and see what they can offer for the long term prospect? Up until now, I’ve been preaching that INTC is a dead company. Instead go buy NVDA and AMD if one is interested in investing in semiconductor. However, I am starting to think about INTC seriously because their price is way too low for the market share. Anyone monitoring this stock closely and think it has a chance to bounce if you are planning to hold for at least a year or more? Any thoughts? \n\nEdit: 7/19 INTC 28 put @.55 let’s see if it hits or not. This is the position I am comfortable if it hits.",

          "body": "The Apollo deal is reassuring. Seems that they are actually currently assembling leading edge fabs. Their recent plummet in price and the thesis behind the recent class action though was significant operating losses from their foundry segment which was confusing because I thought it wasn’t in operation. If the loss is due to the capital intensive startup then it seems like they’re finally making the mad dash.\n\nEdit: damn rereading that just makes my reasoning sound so speculative. Have done a good amount of research into the company and industry but have yet to really build out a model. The qualitative thesis is strong however. If intel successful becomes a domestic leading edge fab they will inevitably take TSMs 90+% market share out of need to stabilize supply chains. GPU’s or not, people forget data centers rely on intels CPU’s in conjunction with nvdas accelerators.",

Unbelievable to me more people aren’t jumping in on a company so critical to the likely most important industry of the next 20 years, not even considering the fact TSMC is at an every day direct threat of being invaded by China.\n\nReasons to buy Intel off the top of my head, with my expectation that the stock is near Microsoft levels by 2030:\n\n18A- 4 nodes in 5 years is on track.Gelsinger is quoted as saying, “I’ve bet the company on 18A.” 18A will be the first node to utilize backside power and give a 6% increase in processing speeds. That’s in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won’t have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.\n\nEUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML’s 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes. They will have, at minimum, a year head start on their rivals with how to best use this technology at a mass scale.\n\nChips act/subsidies: currently the largest beneficiary. Us government is heavily subsidizing their commercial fabs as well as one specific for national defense. Germany, Ireland and Israel are all giving massive subsidies to build their fabs.\n\nIFS: Intel's initiative to provide manufacturing services to other semiconductor companies. It leverages Intel's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to produce custom chips for clients. This move marks Intel's expansion beyond designing and producing its own chips to offering its manufacturing capabilities to external customers, competing with other foundries like TSMC and Samsung Foundry. Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries. They have billions in pre orders already for 18A technology with MSFT already.\n\nTSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Any disruption in the region could impact TSMC's supply chain and operations.\n\nMobileye- is an Israeli technology company specializing in the development of vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology. Mobileye's technology includes features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Intel sold of 1.5 billion worth and still own 88% of the company. The stock is up big this year.\n\nHealthcare: Intel has been involved in the healthcare sector for quite some time. Intel's technology is used in various healthcare applications, including medical devices, data analytics, and telehealth solutions\n\nFinancials: Intel's financials remain strong, with a solid balance sheet, consistent revenue growth, and healthy cash flow generation when not spending tens of billions on the most important fabrication plants in the world. Long history of returning value to shareholders.\n\nThe obvious benefits of being an American Semi Conductor company when national security in the industry is being looked at as paramount.\n\nI feel like I’m taking crazy pills that this stock is only 30$ while AMD hovers around 200$. Pat has done a great job with the roadmap and INTC should be back to technological parity by 2025.",

      "body": "Here's some info you should know. Intel is nowhere close to a dead company. To think that is a lack of understanding of what they do. Intel products have long lasting integrations in the enterprise space which is arguably the most important. Having something that just works in an enterprise is crucial. \n\nAMDs rise comes from a few key events. Bringing in skilled engineers is one but not as large as you think. They have TSMC making their chips now, which is key. Intel decided early into that process that they wanted to go back to creating their own chips. This process slowed during covid but continued. Their first fab went up in Israel about 2ish years ago I think. Many countries wanted to prevent the supply chain issues we saw and countries like the US have started trying to invite chip manufacturers to produce in their countries. To expand their fabs across the globe they cut their dividends pretty harshly to reinvest that money. \n\nAdditionally, creating your own fab has many growing pains. Couple that with and strengthen their position is what's making them look so good. And their chips are great I have the 3700x in my machine right now. But that doesn't mean Intel is \"a dead company\". If AMD could stay in business for 15 years before they shifted to a new platform, Intel won't die in 5. Besides who else makes CPUs for consumers (and most enterprises)? Besides for those 2, the only other CPU is RISC-V which is still in early testing, equal to performance of a 20-25 year old computer with no compatibility with common components, and Russian developed which you couldn't pay me to use. \n\nThey'll be back eventually, it's one you buy in pieces and hold. When it doubles or triples down the line (given the trends lately) you'll be happy you did, and you can earn dividends while you wait which will add more later as well. I personally see this as a great buying opportunity.",
