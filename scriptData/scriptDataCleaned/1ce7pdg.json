They will do things which are short term good to win people over and then when the economy goes down the shit hole due to hyper inflation, then they will blame the other side for the economy troubles they created.\n\nJust look at Latin American politics and this is how it works. The Peronistas in Argentina are masters at brainwashing people into believing the economy problems they created are someone else fault.  They are already blaming Milei for the hyper inflation they created.\n\nThanks God, there is a new generation of Argentines who are not falling for this crap.",

He gets to set the tone by choosing the fed chair and he can bully him directly privately as well as publicly. The fed is also concerned with trying to be seen as apolitical so go out of their way to avoid changing policy in the six months or so before major elections but not making a decision is of course a decision so this is actually a political act.\n\nFurthermore interest rates are hardly the sole determinant of inflation or driver of the economy and the government has plenty of direct power over both via fiscal policy (government spending and borrowing). In some ways the fed are really just picking up after the government as they can't influence fiscal policy so their monetary policy has to account for that. One reason rates are over 5% now and not falling is that Biden is spending like it's going out of fashion (he certainly is) and the fed are having to suppress the inflation he is causing.",
