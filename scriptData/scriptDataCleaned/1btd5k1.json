  "selftext": "Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), the parent company of Donald Trump's social media platform Truth Social, sank more than 22% in midday trading on Monday following its blockbuster debut last week.\n\nThe stock drop comes on the heels of an updated regulatory filing early Monday that showed the company taking on heavy losses and facing \"greater risks\" associated with the former president's ties to the platform.\n\nAccording to the filing, Trump Media reported sales of just over $4 million as net losses reached nearly $60 million for the full year ending Dec. 31. The company warned it expects losses to continue amid greater profitability challenges.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-media-stock-tanks-as-new-filing-reveals-heavy-losses-greater-risks-on-trumps-involvement-164313322.html",
