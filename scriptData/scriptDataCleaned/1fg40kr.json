      "body": "Momentum, swing, and day trading are all harder than they look.Â  My swing plays have been predominantly successful, basically I buy ASTS and TDOC calls when they drop sharply and puts when they rise sharply.Â  Even then I have moments that are scary and at the end of the day, you are risking 20000 or 10000 dollars theoretically to make 5-10% becauseÂ  timing it for max profit is very difficult, and my current stake is down bigly right now, so sweating it even though most likely I will profit by the end of next week. My advice to you is do research first stumble upon stocks whose average movements resonate with you, or have an exploitable pattern.Â  Don't be afraid to trade shares instead of options. For example trading TQQQ or ASTS shares makes you risk a lot less than options.Â  And if a play doesn't work, re-evaluate your thesis before re-attempting it",
