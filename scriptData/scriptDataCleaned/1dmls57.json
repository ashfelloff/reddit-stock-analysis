That means more tire changes, more rotations, and more alignments. Modern hybrids like my car go 10k+ miles between oil changes and tire rotations are typically included for free, on a Tesla, it's not. I'm at 180k miles and on my 3rd set of tires. If r/teslalounge polls are anything to go off of, under the very best case scenario, I'd be on my 6th set of tires in Tesla. \n\nNext issue, unless you have a house, which many don't, you have to travel to the nearest station to charge. Nearest charger to me is 10 miles away. That's 20 miles @ $.67/mile, so $13 in wear and tear. It costs me $30 to fill up my Insight for a 500 mile range. To get that same range in a Model 3, it would take 2 charges, $26 in wear and tear, charging costs and 3 hours of my time. \n\nNow factor in the god awful depreciation.",

So yes, it charges you even if there's 1 of 4 slots open. It costs 50 cents a minute, but imagine being stuck in a bathroom line, and 20-40 min passes by by the time you get back to your car. You can incur $10 in fees just from that. So, poop fast! No time for wiping, just take the roll with you.\n\nE: It's $1 a minute if all superchargers are in use.",
