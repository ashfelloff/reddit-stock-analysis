Their Q3 numbers [beat expectations with $430.1M revenue and $0.20 EPS](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cloudflare-net-q3-earnings-revenues-003510923.html). They're killing it with enterprise customers - [added 219 new $100k+ customers just this quarter](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/9a9a85d7-11a4-3b85-8e8a-5368f3632b8e/cloudflare-%28net%29-q3-2024.html).\n\nThe fundamentals are solid. [Their gross margins are consistently 77-78%](https://beyondspx.com/article/cloudflare-net-securing-and-accelerating-the-future-of-the-internet) - way better than most SaaS companies. Operating margin hit 14.8% this quarter. Free cash flow's strong at $45.3M.\n\nSales team rebuild is done. Their new enterprise focus makes total sense - that's where the money is. The pool of funds deals they're doing with big customers now will pay off big time later.\n\nThis dip is a gift. NET dominates CDN and edge computing. They're not going anywhere.",
