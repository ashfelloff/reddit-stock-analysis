  "score": 167,
  "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's (NYSE:TSM) first-quarter revenue rose 16.5% year-over-year, amid a boost in demand for artificial intelligence applications.\n\n\n\nTSM — which produces chips for some of the world's largest tech companies including Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) — saw first-quarter revenue of NT$592.64B (about $18.54B), compared to NT$508.63B ($16.72B) in the same period a year ago.\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, TSM had forecast revenue to be between $18B and $18.8B, the company had said during its fourth-quarter earnings in January. The Consensus Revenue Estimate for the first quarter is $18.06B.\n\n\n\nThe quarterly figures beat LSEG SmartEstimate of NT$581.45, according to a report from Reuters.\n\n\n\nTSM's revenue for March 2024 surged 34.3% year-over-year to NT$195.21B, while it grew 7.5% month-over-month (NT$181.65B in February).\n\n\n\nThe company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings on April 18.\n\nThis is good news considering Nvidia (NVDA) earnings is just over a month away, and we may expect to see a rally coming soon as Nvidia earnings approaches.

      "body": "These earnings are hardcore priced in, and I say this as a $TSM gigabull.\n\nTSMC writes manufacturing contracts 1 or 2 years in advance, so their revenue streams are very stable and predictable. And they report their earnings monthly, so by the time quarterly earnings roll around, we've already seen 2 check-in updates on that pretty steady earnings stream. The actual 90 day earnings numbers are no big deal.... they're basically just another monthly check-in.\n\nI suppose the guidance in earnings calls might matter, but TSMC also publishes their roadmap years in advance, and offer pretty regular updates to their customers about how their progress on future nodes is going. So there shouldn't be a lot of surprises there either.\n\nIn short, TSMC is a really steady ship, and it's a ship that's already locked in total leading-node semiconductor domination for the next 5 years even today. Their roadmap is just executing too well, and they aren't leaving any space for competitors to overtake them. They are just steaming ahead towards continued market monopoly with all the momentum and inevitability of an oil tanker. Buy and frickin' hold.",

IBM still owns that plant and it still runs,  but no longer makes any chips for consoles,  and the staff has been hugely cut.  The wafer plant they used to own in Burlington Vermont was sold off to another company,  I think the Bromont plant is all that is left of what was once a good business for them.  IBM really had everything going for them and they made bad choices.",

Like the 12% of our budget spent on military each year is almost half the deficit all on its own. You’d never take it to 0 but reducing that seems like a better start than TSM subsidies that are less than 1% the size of the military budget.",
