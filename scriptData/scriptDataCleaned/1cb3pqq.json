  "score": 472,
  "selftext": "IMO, the biggest question for Elon to answer during today’s earnings will be what is Tesla strategy to counter $20K BYD Chinese cars coming into US soon from Mexican factories?\n\nBYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). \n\nIf Elon’s plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that’s not a good working plan. As I understand, there’s a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!\n\nI have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I’m still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinese-carmaker-byd-launches-low-cost-dolphin-mini-ev-mexico-2024-02-28/#:~:text=BYD%20executives%20announced%20on%20Wednesday,in%20reach%20of%20Mexican%20consumers.\n\nDisclosure: I’m not a financial advisor and own no Tesla shares. It just hurts watching how things are spiralling down at an iconic company in front of our own eyes.",

Electronics industry was a precursor to this. US is now lagging China in electronics production capability after decades of offshoring.\n\n\nAnyway China is almost certain to dominate South America and Africa/Middle East sales.

No word on the upcoming model but probably will be a loss leader as well.\n\n\nTSLA is the only US brand where the sale price is sustainable.\n\n\nAll else being equal, Chinese brands will have the lowest cost. Some of the cheapest ICE models in the US are China manufactured already, more efficient to just cut out the middle man. Tariffs are the main thing stopping it from happening.",

You lose that, and you’re no better off than any legacy auto manufacturer, there is no secret Chinese sauce. \n\n2. If BYD produces cars in Mexico to sell them to the US, its competing with domestic manufacturers who are doing the same, making cars isn’t magic, they’ll likely have to either take a huge hit to profit in order to gain market share, or increase their prices to retain profitability. \n\n3. If the Chinese government helps subsidize losses to help them capture US market share and BYD Mexico cars start to take off, the US will implement a Tariff specifically targeting Chinese auto. Trump has already threatened to do this, it’s  why the tariffs exist in the first place, and the auto lobby is insanely powerful. \n\nCountries where auto manufacturing makes up a large part of their economy have a huge interest in protecting that sector. It’s why Aussies drive Chinese cars and we don’t. The US won’t sit on its hands and allow China to displace US auto, they won’t even let US auto fail under the weight of its own incompetence.",
