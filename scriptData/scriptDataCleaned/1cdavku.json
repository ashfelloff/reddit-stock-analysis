The others are just mostly reporting in this clip.\n\nInstagram wasn't so much as a genius strategic move like Bezos and AWS, it was a panic buy more akin to adobe buying Figma.  Zuck had money to burn and decided to scorch earth anything that could replace Facebook.  In retrospect it was a no-brainer, buy it and stop a potential competitor from eating their lunch, or let the money just sit in cash and just watch it happen.\n\nZuck really is a hapless idiot and maybe the luckiest guy on earth when it comes to being in the right place at exactly the right time though Mark Cuban could make a claim to that throne.",
