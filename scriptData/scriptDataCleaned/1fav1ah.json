      "body": "Banks hold bonds. When rates go up value or bond in secondary market decreases. Book value of said bonds decreases. Portfolio of banks shows unrealized losses. However, bonds, unlike stocks, when held to maturity recover all their value as the bond issuer returns all the capital originally invested and those unrealized losses disappear.\n\nTherefore if ( IF!!) banks are able to hold those bonds until they mature… this chart is a nothingburger. \n\nBut if there are any bank runs or other reasons the banks would need to liquidate those bonds in the secondary market… then those losses would become realized and then banks are fucked (see regional bank crisis from last year).",

Lot of talking heads saying to reenter, I don’t think that is wise.  I want to wait to see who the quality names shake out to be post-rate cuts.  If you mean the deposit side, as long as they’re under fdic insurance limits, take the best rates with the best products/services and localized management.  I wouldn’t worry about my deposits being affected by increased regulatory burden.\n\nOn the regulatory burden question, it’s always on the table, and more likely the larger the institution.  However, we have one of the strongest lobbying arms in the country, and they’ll do everything they can to minimize this (which is wrong and bad for the entire sector in my opinion).  SHOULD they?  Absolutely.  Will they?  Doubtful.  Not all regionals are OCC regulated banks, they’re fdic or fed member banks.  Unpopular opinion in my world, but banks should have higher capital requirements or stricter balance sheet management requirements.  Even more unpopular opinion that will absolutely never happen, get rid of FDIC insurance.  Force consumers and corporations to understand who is managing their deposits.  We’re one of (if not the) only industries that are required for even private banks to post their financials quarterly to the public.  But fdic insurance disincentivizes the average consumer/business to reward conservative stewardship of their money and rewards hot money undue risk taking,  SVB is a glaring example.\n\nI do think many banks have worked through the mismanagement of balance sheet issues and will improve with fed rate cuts, but some can’t.  The assumption is that deposit rates will go down faster than loan rates for banks, which in theory is true.  But in reality, they’re going to face borrower pressure to lower loan rates before maturity, which occurs with the most stable and quality borrowers first.  The borrowers they WANT to refinance or move because of loan quality issues can’t move, so they are either lowering rates too fast to keep their quality loans, or losing those loans and left with the garbage.\n\nWho cares if you’re making it worse for those banks?  They mismanaged their asset/liability structure, and they’ve made their bed.  They’ll have to look to unfavorable acquisition or forced into shrinking, or fdic assisted failure.  Do I think your clients should be looking to bonds outside of insured deposits?  Maybe, the returns are likely favorable in a falling rate environment.  CDs and money markets under the fdic insurance limit are obviously safer, but quality bonds are nearly as safe.\n\nIf the fed cuts at the pace you are proposing, and they might, I think they’re admitting we’re in a recession and a bumpy landing is ahead.

Deposits aren’t going to flow back into the sector, most of that money was government handouts during Covid era, and it’s gone and then some, into big corps and big banks.  They took those deposits, chased yields on longer term securities they shouldn’t have, and still have 4-6 years on their duration and zero fed effective rates aren’t coming back to bring those back to break even.  They have to eat the losses, or wait it out, and they can’t keep waiting it out as the liability side of their balance sheet is decreasing and/or under pressure.  Look for increasing interest bearing deposit balances (when they’re spewing stabilizing or slightly increasing overall deposits), increasing loan loss reserves and/or 90 day plus past dues, increasing non-performing assets, and banks not writing down the securities losses.

However the reason bond values go down is because interest rates went up because of INFLATION. Meaning 2020 dollars are worth much much less in 2040 than expected. And getting that value back in 2020 dollars  only helps them if their payment obligations in 2040 are also in 2020 dollars. Some of their obligations may be others may not be.\n\nSo let's say a bank \n- bought a 1000$ 2020 20 year bond at 1÷ interest expecting almost 0  inflation perhaps even deflation\n- they get 1200$ over the lifetime of the bond\n- in reality inflation went somewhere around 3% and 1200$ are now worth in goods and services 652$\n- so they effectively burned 1/3 of the money in value with that investment. \n- dollar amounts are just magic beans the question is the actual worth in goods or services\n- in case of a bank goods and services are salaries and the amount of 2040 loans they can support\n\nNow it becomes interesting what do they need to pay off with that money. Normally it is 10% or so of the outstanding loans at that time to cover defaults plus salaries etc. But most of their loan book in 2040 will be in 2040 dollars and therefore 1.33x the size so they would  need to reduce lending by 33%  or cut other costs like employees. Or wind down.\n\nThat's the stuff banking crisis and reduced lending over decades are made off ( cough japan cough )\n\nSo if inflation goes up and their investment doesn't keep track they are fucked in two ways either immediately if they need to stomach loan losses due to a recession in the meantime or longterm because they need to reduce their loanbook in line with inflation. They lost the value either way. The only time they would not be fucked is if the inflation actually drops down again for the next decades. But given we already lost 20÷ or so in these 4 years and the us government has a 7% deficit and boomers retire I eat my hat if this happens.",

Thus unless these banks end up having to sell these bonds off due to some other external factor they really do not have any losses at all.

              "body": "You probably know most of this but for people who don’t  the losses now are because the yield of bonds goes up as interest rates rise. Rates from 08 to 2020 were very very low, so bonds were yielding very little. As interest rates rise (like they did extremely rapidly in 2022) so do yields.  \n\nSo (with made up numbers) if you had a 2% yield bond you bought in 2015 and the government is issuing new bonds that yield 5% you’re not going to be able to sell your bond for whatever you bought it for because people are just going to go get more bang for their buck by buying new higher yield bonds. You might still be able to sell it but you’ll have to slash the price a lot to make it worth anyone’s time and you’ll probably lose money against what you bought it for originally. That’s what this chart is showing.\n\nIf your plan is to collect the interest yourself (hold to maturity) then it doesn’t matter, you’re not trying to sell it so you aren’t losing money. If you are planning to sell it then you’re underwater until rates go down dramatically. \n\nThe reason ‘08 is pretty insignificant on this chart is because rates were being slashed to combat the recession so a lot of bonds weren’t in the red (since if the rate the government is selling new bonds at is less than the rate your bonds are at you have a more appealing product and can sell it for more). Banks had massive losses on mortgages and from the falling stock market and on defaulted loans, but less on bonds.\n\nThis chart seems to only be showing unrealized losses on bonds over a timeframe with extraordinarily low rates. If it was showing all investment classes or including realized losses or went back to a point when rates weren’t 0 it would look very different.",

      "body": "I used to run a $5B investment portfolio at a bank so dealt with these concepts all of the time. Held to maturity (HTM) and Available for Sale (AFS) are two ways that companies record the value of those investments in their financial statements. There is also a third, Available for Trading (AFT).\n\nAny unrealized gain/losses on investments classified as AFS are recorded on the company’s balance sheet in ‘accumulated other comprehensive income.’ In other words, unrealized AFS losses hit your retained capital line on the balance sheet, but is not recorded as a reduction in earnings on the income statement.  \n\nInvestments that are classified as HTM, any unrealized losses are not recorded on either the income statement or balance sheet. In the banking world, no one likes to do that, if possible, because you then had zero flexibility in selling the investment later if the value recovered prior to maturity. Also, if you sold a bond from HTM prior to maturity, most auditors would consider the classification then ‘tainted’ and you’d need to reclassify all of your HTM items and record any gain or losses then. \n\nBanks like to keep most investments as AFS because then they have flexibility in the future to sell if needed. \n\nI now run two hedging programs at a bank and those instruments are classified as AFT with changes in value of both the assets and hedges flowing to the income statement with values offsetting if you’re doing it correctly. These are both short term asset classes. \n\nI hope that helps.",
