This collaboration aims to create an integrated supply chain network with AI-driven automated workflows, benefiting Wendyâ€™s operators by generating cost savings and efficiencies across over 6,400 restaurants in the U.S. and Canada. Initially, QSCC will implement Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform to enhance decision-making processes, followed by using the platform for supply chain management and waste prevention in the second phase. This partnership will leverage Palantirâ€™s AI capabilities to provide Wendyâ€™s with a competitive edge in the quick-service restaurant industry, aligning with Wendy's ongoing efforts to innovate using generative AI technology.\n\nFor those of you still sleeping on this stock you may be able to get a preview of the software at your day job...\n\n[https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/From-the-Farm-to-the-Frosty-Palantir-and-Wendys-Partner-on-AI-and-Supply-Chain-Digitalization/](https://investors.palantir.com/news-details/2024/From-the-Farm-to-the-Frosty-Palantir-and-Wendys-Partner-on-AI-and-Supply-Chain-Digitalization/)",
