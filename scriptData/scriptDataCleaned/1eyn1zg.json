If we assume that taking a long position at any given time of year has a 50% win rate, then instead take historical data into account and adjusting that long position entry based on historical data over the past 50 years, meaning instead of buying at the end of August you bought at the end of September. Over the last 50+ years your success rate would be significantly better than if you did the inverse.\nYou’ll still lose 40/100 times but better than losing 60/100 times.",
