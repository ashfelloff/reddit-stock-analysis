By the time Nvidia (or for that matter any semiconductor design company) rolls out a new generation, they've already started design validation (in simulation) of the next generation architecture. By the time 6-8 months pass after the release of the current generation, they will likely already have placed orders for test batches to get the architecture working properly and received physical validation units from TSMC to iron out any problems present in the hardware.\n\nAnother thing to note is the term _GP_ in GPGPU, which is what these cards were originally called. GP means general purpose, which means that the chips can be made to perform any kind of computable task thrown at them. So even if ML paradigms change, as long as parallel processing is mission critical to the new paradigms of machine learning, those GPUs will continue to stay relevant.",

Their products are in demand and they expect to sell about 210 billion of their new Blackwell architecture products this year. They have had blowout earnings for the past 1-2 years each quarter. Analysts cannot wrap their head around the demand for AI accelerators. They also have a hard time believing that Nvidia as a company could grow so fast, but they have the corner on the AI market. Nobody really putting up stiff competition yet. AMD is trying, and if their AI accelerators catch on then their stock will go up quite a bit, though I doubt to the same degree that Nvidia’s stock has.\n\nEdit: Nvidia was investing in AI before anyone gave any thought to it now they are reaping the rewards of that early investment while many other companies play catch up.",

For example cisco makes primarily network equipment, with the dotcom bubble it was assumed the internet would change everything (and it did) and that this would drive demand for needing more network equipment. \n\nThe reality is that competitors like TP Link or Unifi and others can also make cheap affordable network equipment, often without a lame subscription model that Cisco does so the competitors are able to disrupt that market. A big reason Cisco crashed and hasn't recovered from the dotcom bubble is because they don't do anything unique. Ai chips is a completely different story, requires way more specialization and is incredibly more advanced technology with is a larger barrier to entry for new challengers.\n\nWhile there have been some steady improvements in network technology over the years like for example gigabit internet, the demand for higher speeds is not reflective in most peoples usage and there is a plateau effect where only certain customers like large businesses need increased speeds but the average user only really needs 100mb/s and not 1gb/s. Meanwhile with Ai chips its a different story as there is a demand for the latest tech to increase rendering speeds and computation which improves productivity and demand is higher than the supply. There is a lot of demand and growth into the forseeable future, and realistic competition is years away.",

      "body": "Nvidia is going to keep causing confusion amongst investors until it stabilizes into its new spot in a new industry, which we most likely will not see for several years at this rate. You are generally right about earnings; however absolutely smashing them at a consistent rate is showing massive growth which is what grows valuations. \n\nThe honest to gods truth is no one knows what nvidia is going to do, but a million people will tell you it’s going to ten trillion, and a million people will tell you it’s overbought bullshit, and the only thing those two groups of people have in common is any lack of understanding of the business nvidia is in. What I can say with absolute certainty is that nvidia is the top dog when it comes to selling AI infrastructure and that is not possible to change for quite some time. I’m heavily invested because I see the writing on the wall and I understand that AI is going to fundamentally change business and life as we know it. It’s ease of life and cost cutting - the two things everyone in the world that can afford it will pour money into. All these companies increasing capex? Wait for nvidias earnings, if you follow the market and tech in particular you’d realize where that capex is going.\n\nI’m not going to go into why fundamentally nvidia is a monster because that’s debatable, however the benefits that their technology brings is undebatable. I’m not investing in nvidia as much as I am investing in the technology they are the only ones capable of bringing right now. I’m not going to rant about the magic of AI and all the ways a layman does not understand the benefits, you can google basic functions and use your imagination for the rest. \n\nI would be willing to bet my left testicle that 95% of the people online telling you nvidia isn’t a great investment, doesn’t deserve its valuation and is due for a correction never mind another run work in a field or have a job in particular that will be replaced with ai in the next decade. Simply because computers can now read, write, speak and listen and they can do all those things without requiring insurance bills, and pesky things like wages and lunch. Never mind that they will do it all faster, more efficiently and with more attention to detail. \n\nTLDR ai is bullish because it’s going to replace everyone that doesn’t make actual decisions. Which is like 99% of the population.",

      "body": "I do not know that “so many” people ARE confident that the stock goes up after August earnings. We all know that the actual earnings numbers will be great as always. But how does the stock price react? Last earnings, the stock split announcement made it moon when we had all thought it had already gone as high as it could go. So after the standard “great earnings report”…. What the stock price itself does I think depends on what the stock price is at the time of earnings. If it has dropped to $89 per share by then? Well then YES it will go up after earnings. If it is at $135 per share? The mkt is currently implying that it does not have much room to run from $135 per share. I am not touching NVDA until I see a FULL THREE BUSINESS DAYS of Jensen NOT selling off NVDA shares. He dumps $15M worth of every day. And has done so for almost 5 weeks straight now. Wtf is that? When he is done selling… I will start buying. And do not give me that “oh that is just a drop in the bucket” blah blah. BS. If he expected his own company’s stock to RIP upwards in the immediate future he would not “keep” selling and selling and selling. He has put Bezos to shame at this point. It is like he is admitting his own company is overpriced. BUT if NVDA goes sub $100 I will scoopy scoop. Still love the company.",
