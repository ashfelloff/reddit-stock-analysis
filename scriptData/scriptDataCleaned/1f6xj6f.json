And wanted to take a step back and appreciate the growth this year\n\nMy biggest trades that moved the needle:\n\n- Owning GBTC, CLSK, and ETHE since mid 2023. Sold them all right before their respective ETFs got approved.\n\n- Bought March monthly SMCI calls on Feb 27, sold March 4 after SMCI popped 20% when it was announced over the weekend that it was being added to S&P500. That put position went from $1.3k to $16k. This also marked the local top you see back in March. Proceeded to degen more on AI and got chopped up, leading to 5 month consolidation valley you see\n\n- shorted $62k worth of NVDA, AMD, and QQQ Aug 1, then Japan announced some scary nothing burger and I made $45k profit. Combo of puts and shares. This lead to the recent breakout\n\nCurrent positions: \n- 65% in cash looking for dip. \n\n- 35% in shares/options of TSLL, MSTR, IBIT, CXAI, SOUN, CHPT, INBX, VINC",

          "body": "I don‚Äôt believe any one strategy is better than another. I‚Äôll share my indicator stack and my favorite setups at the end but I first will share something I think is far more important: Home Court Advantage\n\nI only trade in market conditions where I have ‚Äúhome court advantage‚Äù. Everyone trades better in certain market conditions and worse in others. But MOST people don‚Äôt think about identifying which conditions they‚Äôre better in. So they‚Äôve been training to be professional snipers and don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre trading in a close-range gang shoot out.\n\nDon‚Äôt be someone who trades every week of the year and expects the market to stay the same or ‚Äúyou‚Äôre good enough‚Äù to consistently win in all conditions. Every successful professional trader I know specializes. Maybe it‚Äôs only day trading SPX first 30-60 minutes of the day, or only trading one sector, or only trading when VIX gets above a certain level. \n\nSo my main home court is pre-earnings season. About 1 month prior to the big tech earnings season. this means I only trade about 4-6 months a year. Sometimes I skip a season too. A perfect cadence for swing trading and trade/life balance.\n\nWhy this season for me? I find that earnings are the only medium term, consistent event in stocks we can count on happening at a regular cadence. That is a very rare characteristic to have when operating in a random market. Nothing in the markets are predictable, except we KNOW earnings will bring about high volatility and attention. And the month leading up to that is always going from lower vol to higher vol conditions. This is the sweet spot I‚Äôve found myself performing best in\n\nFind your home court. \n\nMy indicator stack is simple:\n\n- 20, 50, 200 SMA\n- TTM Squeeze indicator\n- Volume profile\n- RSI\n- MACD\n\nAgain, I believe every indicator is just a tool and one is not better than another. They‚Äôre just better for different conditions and trading styles\n\nSetups:\n\n- I like to enter trades during a time of sideways consolidation. This is identified by the Squeeze indicator. When a stock is ‚Äúsqueezing‚Äù sideways on multiple time frames, it‚Äôs even better. The longer the squeeze, the larger the subsequent move. The direction I take depends on my assessment of the trend and market conditions. During pre-earnings periods, it‚Äôs usually going long these days.\n\n- Fallen Angels. Finding Stocks in a LTF downward trend that for some reason gap DOWN again in total capitulation. I then wait for these to go sideways for months, and everyone has dumped in total panic and despair. They‚Äôve forgotten about it. And then wait for the SMA‚Äôs and volume to give me a trigger to enter near the bottom and set a stop loss below the All time low. Also monitor if insiders begin to buy. \n\n- short term, basic reversal trades at key resistance or support areas. For example if a stock or index hits its 50 month or 200 week moving averages with speed. That‚Äôs usually an easy put I can sell for a relatively quick win. (Not buying calls, I‚Äôd stick to selling puts for something like that)\n\nOr another example would be shorting stocks in the same sector where several tickets are all hitting SMA resistances like AMD and NVDA did August 1st. These are MEANT to be base hits. Sometimes it‚Äôs a home run outta no where like my Aug 1st NVDA trade but normally I just expect like a 10-20% gain\n\nThat‚Äôs about it. It‚Äôs pretty boring and simple with complexities due to my personal style. \n\nI mentor a few folks as a side gig (nothing extravagant) and usually when I try to teach them my style, it doesn‚Äôt work. But it at least gives them a framework to work off of. Long term, I‚Äôm just helping them get smaller, simpler, and more specialized in their trading. When you get more specialized, your volume of trades lowers but the quality of your trades sky rockets\n\nBest of luck!",

It helped me understand that the key to success in trading is ALL psychological. \n\nThe secret to success in trading is not having a trading plans, being smarter or working harder. It is in getting to a mental maturity level where you can actually follow your trading plan, and where you know when to take yourself out of the game in order to protect your portfolio from yourself\n\nI have been trading for 14 years and I haven‚Äôt been consistently profitable until after the 10 year mark.  I‚Äôm maybe a little more intelligent now than I used to be. The biggest difference is my maturity now compared to before.\n\nI have learned to identify when I‚Äôm not in the right mindset to trade well and make good decisions. I force myself to stop trading or lower my position sizes when I‚Äôm too excited, confident, regretful, or sad about buying a dip that keeps dipping. \n\nAnd I can also tell when I am in a good mindset to make big conviction bets. \n\nThese are all subtle things I had to learn about myself over 10,000 hours of failing/mediocrity/round tripping. It‚Äôs not something I can teach you bc every human reacts to external stress and their emotions differently\n\nI‚Äôm not saying we should be ‚Äúunemotional‚Äù either. That‚Äôs a fallacy. We are humans and we cannot just stop feeling things. We can only control our actions and change our environment so that we are in the best mental state for success. \n\nTLDR: Give the book a read.

Just out of curiosity, could you elaborate how you can tell you are in a good mindset to make big conviction bets?

Ideally the last several trades I made were small or insignificant\n\n3. If the setup which I want to take a big conviction bet on is one I‚Äôve been watching or keeping an eye out for a few weeks or months\n\n4.

I focus on the relationship bc that‚Äôs what matters more. \n\nBut this self-created rule maintains a balanced incentives system: \n\n- I wanna continue trading\n- So minimize arguments\n- In order to do that, I must learn to handle conflict better\n- In doing that - I must train myself to remain calm and controlled in my actions during times of stress and high emotions, \n- With that training, I also improve my ability to control actions trading\n- This usually leads to more profits",
