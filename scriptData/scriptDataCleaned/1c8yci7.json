You have two competing interests at odds with each other. You have your real customers for your product, and your investment customers for your stock. And the customers for your stock, your shareholders, will absolutely DESTROY your product if you do everything in service of them.\n\nFor Steam, they succeed because they're privately held. The money is almost a byproduct of the thing they like doing. And that's why they have a good long lasting product. \n\nMaybe at some point, senior brass at public companies will grow some balls and start telling their shareholders they're just coke heads with bank accounts.

I call him and we work through it. If our cyber security expert thinks a new software would increase our security posture, why can't he directly speak to the c-suite to argue his case and secure funding? Currently, if a new hire isn't fitting in or failing at his job, our manager isn't going to know, he's going to ask the people who work with him how he's doing.\n\nAgain, I think I'm part of a great team and understand there are plenty of people out there who won't get anything done without a manager breathing down their neck but there are other ways to go about your points if you build a team of well paid, well benefitted employees who care about their work, which would be easier to afford without middle management.",
