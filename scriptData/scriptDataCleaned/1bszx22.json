At closing day trade margin goes from 4x to 2x overnight margin so many positions are closed and big money moves again.\n\nThis makes it harder to leech more than a few pennies in the swing within acceptable risk tolerance and easier to manipulate retail by making false breakouts look like real breakouts.
