In an unsigned message, it said that “250 million people use X every day”, with 550 million visiting every month, and that “daily average time spent on platform” and “daily active user minutes” are both up year on year.\n\nThis is the ‘source’ on how they know twitter is losing users? 😂😂\n\nIt doesn’t know how many visitors by actually having access to the metrics, no no it knows how many vistors x has because a numbers of sources.\n\nLoad of bullshit nice try",
