People assume that since they've only seen prices go up in their lifetime, that it'll continue to go up forever. \n\nBut really, a stable inflationary trend has really only been a thing for a century, at most. Deflation could- and given global macroeconomic trends, most likely will- within 5 years, give or take, by my estimates- kick in and actually raise the value of static funds, even as stocks begin to fall.\n\nBelieve it or not, numbers can't go up forever.",

If you have a hundred bucks and lose 50 on a trade, you’ll have one of two basic (there are more but they’re not relevant here) outcomes depending on cash or margin account. \n\nCash account: you lost 50 bucks and now have $0 buying power because your account is cash settlement. Meaning you need Trade + 1 to settle. If you lost 50 on Monday, you’ll have 50 available to trade on Tuesday. Now assuming you made $50, you’d have $0 on the same day you sold, but you’ll have $150 the next day. \n\nMargin account: if you lose 50 and sell you immediately are given access to the 50 from the sale the same day (but it’s technically overnight margin). They don’t charge interest because the fees they collect or the losses you incur more than pay for it (this is not true for *usssssing margin.* this is only true for using your own cash in a margin account). If you made 50 you’d have 150 available as soon as you sell. \n\nOne important note: if the position was purchased and sold in the same day, you have used a day trade. Which I’m assuming you only have 3 of in a rolling 5 trading day period. A 4th will get you barred from it for life until you get over 25k however brokers apparently offer 1 time forgiveness. This is for margin accounts. \n\nAs for the cash accounts, you can day trade as often as you like. You just have to wait until the next day to trade again with the same dollars regardless of whether the position was sold for a gain or loss. \n\nAlso, the cash account scenario is for robinhood, which I’m also assuming you use. If you’re on some other brokers, you can buy an option on day (T-0)with your cash, hold it overnight, sell it the next day (T-1), and have the cash reflected as buying power. However it is not settled regardless of whether you can access it or not until the following day (in this case it’s T2, but it’s t+1 from sale date). \n\nYou can buy something, but you can’t sell it the same day or you incur a cash free riding violation or something like that. So you can’t do that and buy 0dtes the next time. If you do this on robinhood, overnight or not- they won’t give you position purchasing power until it settles t+1. \n\nGood luck regard.",
