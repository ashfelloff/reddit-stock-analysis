Copper oxidizes when exposed to the environment and things like human sweat. Items like this often have some kind of protective clearcoat. Thinking the copper market would tank because of this issue is like thinking the steel market would tank because a steel manufacturer left some iron out in the rain and thought the fact that it started rusting was some kind of abnormality. It's nonsensical and is conspiracy levels of thinking.",
