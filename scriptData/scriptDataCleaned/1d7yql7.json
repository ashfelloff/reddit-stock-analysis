The drop meant a more than 99% discount on the Warren Buffett-led company.\n\n> This means a trader who snapped up just $925 worth of the stock at the rock-bottom price would now see their investment worth over $3 million today.",

With a bank you deposit money and they agree to only make the principal plus a little bit of interest available to you.

So it's more along the lines of if I went into a jewelry store and saw a Rolex at a 99% discount and I was allowed to buy it. I understand it was probably an error and someone put the wrong price tag but the exchange and to a lesser degree seller should really make sure that they're selling things for the right price too. Especially since I now own the Rolex and they're going to force me to give it back.",
