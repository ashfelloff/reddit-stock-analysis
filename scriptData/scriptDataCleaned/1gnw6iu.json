  "selftext": "Kerrisdale Capital released a short report on the Co earlier this year in February. The report was impressively detailed, but the market shrugged it off. \n\nCan this be due to popularity? \n\nI’m not sure of everyone else, but I’m not very familiar with the name. It’s in my opinion that if Hindenburg were to have done the short report, there would have been legitimate consequences on the stock price. \n\nAnyways that’s beside the point. Carvana and its management continue to reap the benefits, selling their holdings.\n\nThere’s something going on underneath the hood. \n\nCarvana is a subprime predator lender and booking their only profits with the help of drivetime. Cars are being booked for well under their cost and loans are being sold for well above market value over to drive time, even though the 10k reports nothing of the sort. \n\nPerhaps because drivetime is a private company they can secretly fund this incredible growth.\n\nNate at hindenburg said that the Co is a “known”problem on X, but I would like their to be a thorough analysis.\n\nThat also brings into question do the popular Activist short seller funds touch each others research finds?

YOLO and the last 'O' was an unknown amount for awhile there.\n\n\\> Carvana is a subprime predator lender\n\nThey have a lending arm but that's not their only business model. They sell cars with a nationwide inventory. The loan arm is called Bridgecrest.\n\nThey are very much \"we'll finance everyone' and these regards sit on the toilet, finance a car at 23% to \"rebuild\" their credit full send. So they will lend you money but it will cost you. There's no predatory about it. Want the car? No one else will finance you? Come suckle the teet.\n\nThat's Carvana: I can take a dump and buy a car. Full stop.\n\nThese smooth brains pay that interest, Carvana's default-on-loan percentage is lower than the national average.\n\nLast earnings call they averaged something like 3800/unit in profit. Which is more than probably 85% of dealers nationwide.\n\nI bought at 3.80 in Dec 2022 and I am big time HODL. They continue to move inventory, and the stock price goes up. How long? No idea.

I had to track down a Ford Maverick for my son in law. Dealers in a 100 mile radius wouldn't meet me at Wendys for the 1-1 dumpster action. I said fuck it and pulled up the website.\n\nThere's no negotiation - Carvana is more like a 'car store'. But most models are priced competitively. I paid within $250 of listed models in the area.\n\nI was able to buy a car for my sister in law from my desk in California and have it delivered to her in Texas.\n\nThe thing that Carvana has is that you don't have to show up and be embarrassed about your dipshit life choices. Bad credit? Little credit? You'll pay for it but it's just you and the website to get the credit approved. No sitting in a windowless office in a dealer. No having a GM laugh in your face and tell you to fuck off with your 550 credit score.\n\nThere's something there.\n\nNo, I don't think it will last forever. I am sure a shoe will drop.  I'll pull the rip cord at some point.\n\nFor now, bullish on CVNA. I don't know when I'll cash out but \"somewhere before the bottom\". I am a traditional investor no options, puts or calls with CVNA. I come with the money and buy the stock.\n\nIf I could figure out some cat-related username I'd start making videos about how it is undervalued and I like the stock.",

I have my own issues with them, why I quit including being fucked over on promotions and pay. But them being over valued? Maybe, maybe not.
