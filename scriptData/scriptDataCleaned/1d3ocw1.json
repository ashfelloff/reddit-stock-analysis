  "selftext": "Today American Airlines (AAL) dropped 13% after lowering their guidance numbers.  Other airlines (UAL, DAL) did not drop. \n\nBut go do some research on flights from the USA to Europe.  The airfares are about 20% lower than last year. In some cases about 40% lower.   I have to fly over there in a month and was surprised by the fare decreases. \n\nThought I'd share - as Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) are trading near their post-Covid highs - and have room to go down.  Lower air fares indicate poor sales, which is what American Airlines just reported. ",
