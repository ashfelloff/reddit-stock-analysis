(Buy /hold/sell)…. like for example, institutional and professional traders use a Bloomberg terminal or the Reuters terminal.\n\nThere are so many paid unpaid blogs, and people randomly talking about stuff on forums/ Subs. \n\nWould love to hear how folks are managing this? \n\n",

              "body": "Investors Business Daily is a company/database created by William O'Neil to provide individual investors with information so they can do their own analyses in one place and so they can make their own decisions without  relying on others. Highly highly recommend reading How to Make Money in Stocks by O'Neil and Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets by Weinstein. Take what you learn from these 2 books together, and use the information from IBD, and I'm confident people won't need to rely on others for stock investments. They will answer your questions on when to buy, hold, sell. If you read them you won't need this sub and will be ahead of 95% of other people IMO.\n\nNote: you can get some info for free but the paid subscription is worth it imo. Especially if you do your homework. Read those 2 books first as your homework, starting with O'Neil. Then consider the IBD subscription. \n\nThis changed me for the better. Hope this helps.",

I have my mental model of investing mostly down by now so I can identify great opportunities but it took years to build and a lot of trial and error.
