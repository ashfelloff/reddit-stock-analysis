I am closer to a spot where I may sell covered calls down the road, but that is still a big if. \n\nI have also grabbed some great info for companies here. I have done well in small hits of SOFI and PLTR. I am big up on DKNG but that was more me because this sub was way off on that buy when it was in the low teens to single digits. ASTS is my most recent win here based on a post in the lest 2 months. I also only watch gamestop because of the first run from this sub and hit big on the run up this year. I have turned $45k into $130k in the last 3 years and that money is now mostly in DKNG and ASTS which I feel great about going forward. \n\nThis sub is a ton of help if you learn the cautionary tales of option trading and pick up on some of the interesting growth companies that get posted every few months.",

A) because bear markets are historically shorter than bull markets) B)Cuts down on risk for crazy short term moves . I personally can't afford any $50k losses .. Not saying there isn't risk , But quality names go up more than down over time in my experience . Now Covered calls you sell the contract which you must own 100 shares of the stock per contract to do  and collect the premium from the sale and i use a strike price high enough that I'm ok selling the stock at  + the premium .. example : we'll use Uber  because i own it and have a covered call  . I actually exercised  2 uber $20 leaps to get the shares we will be using ..Ok  selling a covered call i only go out 2-4 months because the stock could take off and the chance your shares getting  called away increases . i'm just trying to generate some gains in the short  to mid term on stock i own  ,, Alright ,a month or two ago I sold the 09/2/24 $77.50 call . I think I collected around $280 from the premium .. If I remember i bought some uber shares with that .. You can do whatever you want with the money . It looks like the call will expire worthless to whoever bought it .. UBER is $64.39 today  .. So it will vaporize and you keep the money and your shares .. Unless they want to buy 100 shares for $77.50 . Which I hope they do ,, but won't when they can get them for much cheaper , unless it skyrockets in a month   . SHWOOO   there's some footnotes    damn I hope this helps you learn . Start googling -)))",

I usually start gradually moving out of equities around 80, and watch the big macro news (CPI/PCE, GDP and retail sales, news of major banking/investment form issues like the Silicon Valley or Lehman, etc.) to get a sense of when the top might actually be in during those periods.",
