          "body": "One of the cybersecurity guys at my company was just getting ready to go to sleep at around midnight after being up and working a full day Thursday when he saw an article about the Crowdstrike issue. He hopped up and started setting the wheels in motion for our company to start addressing it ASAP from his house, and headed into the office at around 2am. He was still there working on it at 11am when I talked to him, and he looked fucking WIPED. I'm not sure when he left and was finally able to go to sleep, but I'm guessing he was up for at least 30 hours.\n\nCrowdstrike's fuck-up caused a bunch of mad scrambling and lost sleep for countless people all over the world, so I feel little sympathy for this CEO not getting any. That's why he gets paid the big bucks, right?",

They hired me right before the tech layoffs in. End of 2021 they basically begged me to join because they needed to grow fast and laid way too much for me giving me almost 20% more than other coworkers with more job responsibilities",

When code is being shipped that is going to crash millions of your user's machines, that's not just a staffing issue, it's a policy decision. It's the result of sidestepping processes in order to push shit into production without proper testing and risk assessment. While I'm pretty sure those decisions happened because of a lack of engineers, they could have had a single coder left and this still wouldn't have happened if not for those shitty policy decisions.

              "body": ">there was no proper development cycle, which would be a systematic failure over many years of management and technical leadership\n\nAll of my money is on this.\n\nYou'd be horrified to find out how many companies with >$1B market cap have engineering practices that would have been considered shoddy in the 90s, let alone today.\n\nSome of this comes from companies misusing the concept of \"Agile\". To them, \"Agile\" is anything which gets features out the door faster. QA can do nothing but slow feature delivery down. Therefore, getting rid of QA is \"Agile\". Or maybe the org chart is the issue - perhaps they do have dedicated QA, but the QA lead reports to the engineering lead who is on the hook for certain deadlines, and doesn't want to hear a damn thing from QA that would impact those deadlines.\n\nBut most of it comes from \"I'm a middle manager who needs to make a name for myself. I'm going to slash my labor budget by telling devs that they are responsible for their own testing. As long as I can make it a year or two before it comes back to bite me, I'll be promoted up, and the fallout from the inevitable disaster will be someone else's problem.\"\n\nAnd the CEO is too high up to understand the real risk of what's happening in his company. All his underlings are only reporting up rainbows and butterflies. \"Yes sir. Development and QA costs are down 60%. Delivery speed is up 37%. And we've maintained quality, as proved by the fact that we haven't had any major outages.\" They conveniently leave off the word \"yet\".",

Just to maintain the 'muscle memory' for the process and not fall back into a 1990's \"Push-N-Pray\" mentality.\n\nI specifically do consulting in the SRE space; developers should not be able to push to production \\*at all\\* and the release engineers should not have access to pre-release code.  As in, they can't even access the environments/networks where this stuff happens. \n\nAdditionally; deployments should indeed have automated checks in place to verify the files haven't been corrupted and are what they think they are; i.e. run a simple Unix 'file' command and verify a driver is actually, you know, a driver.  There should also be a change management process where the whole team + management sign off on deployments; so everyone is responsible if there is a problem.  Finally, phased rollouts w/automated verification will act as a final control in case a push is causing outages.   I.e.; if systems don't check in after a certain period of time after a deploy; put the brakes on it.\n\nWhat is really odd about this specific case is that AFAIK, Windows won't load an unsigned driver; so somehow Crowdstrike managed to deploy a driver that was not only all-zeroes; but digitally signed.  And then mass push to production instead of dev.\n\n> I will never hire a person that has crowdstrike on their resume in the future.\n\nThey are good guys, a small shop and primarily a security and not a systems/software company.   I'm familiar with how Microsoft operates internally, I would not be surprised if their \"Windows Update\" org. has more staff than all of Crowdstrike.   Doing safe release engineering at that scale is a non-trivial problem.",
