I never saw people my age invest in stocks, only businessmen.\n\n I don't really know what to do and I don't know where to start. No one takes me seriously, I wanna make money and work hard so I can go far and no one is literally educating anyone on financial lit and investing.\n\nI just need advice, that's all, any help would be appreciated.",

                      "body": "For your purposes, Robinhood may be fine,  but it has had issues with limiting people from locking down certain stocks and not allowing free trades to occur during volatile periods.   That's the last thing you need when you're holding a stock goes sideways, and you hit the sell button only to get a message that you can't do anything with it.  \n\nWatch out for non-traditional trade platforms.  In the world of money and banking, believe me, you don't want to be trying out the newest thing and hope it works.   You want a tried and true platform.    Remember, unlike bank accounts, you can lose money, sometimes all of it.  Find a platform with some depth and history.  \n\nFor young investors, I always say this: \n\nTrust no one.   Things may not be as they appear.  Someone who wants to be friendly isn't always your friend.  \n\nFir example, In spite of people like Roaring Kitty making a fortune, lining up behind such people may not yield the same results for you.   He needed everyone to gobble up the supply of stocks and hold them until HE reached a critical point where he sold.    Then the price dropped, and those who bought on the way up were suddenly holding less valuable stock.    It may be fun to participate in such things,  but they benefit very, very few people. \n\nDon't chase the stocks for a quick score.    Buy for long-term holding.   You'll never time it perfectly.  And that's okay because long-term holds absorb the fluctuations of not timing it perfectly.  \n\nAvoid trading options or shorting stocks until you are 1000% educated in it forwards and backward. Like educated enough so you can teach a college level class on it.  You can lose more than you have in your account.    \n\nGood luck.",

Use it to buy a stock or etf. \n\nChoosing a stock, etf or mutual fund is difficult at first because there is a wide selection of options and everyone has a preference. \n\nBuying an etf or mutual fund avoids some risks because it has several companies while one company like Microsoft might seem better but for example today it’ll go down for that outage. But if it’s inside an etf then the etf won’t go down if other tech companies are ok. \nOr maybe Microsoft goes up because everyone saw an opportunity… you never know with individual stocks unless you’ve been doing it for a while and know a Myriad of things. \n\nVanguard S&P index funds might be good also.

And every time you get a paycheck you buy a little more of that same one. \n\nDuring tax season they’ll give you a 1099 or tax document and you send that to your accountant. \nYou won’t pay taxes unless you sell and gained money. \n\nThat’s about it.

Time in the market is preferable to timing the market. Buy good stocks and hold for the long term. Buy stock you know and use. I prefer individual stocks but you might prefer an index fund which just buys a basket of stocks of an index.\n\nAnother option is STASH which offers a debit card that invests every time you spend money (like a cash back card) Buy a Big Mac invest in McDonalds. Buy a Wendy's Lemonade invest in Wendy's. Here is a link to get you started. https://get.stash.com/dick\\_f49b8b2. Full disclosure there is a fee for Stash but it is inexpensive $3.00/month",

      "body": "The smartest thing you can do is open a Roth IRA with Vanguard and invest in a mutual fund like VFFVX 2065 or whenever you’d like to retire. Mix that in with ETFs like VOO which is Vanguard’s version of SPY, following the S&P 500 and also VT which is a total world stocks ETF. Add close to the same amount every week to dollar cost average. If the market is up you can add a little less or down you can add a little more. So the Roth IRA max per year is $7,000. You add $134 per week in it more or less buying those mutual funds or ETFs. Doing the same thing in Fidelity is perfectly fine as well. Vanguard and Fidelity are the most reputable and reliable. \n\nAlso, when you get a full time job if they offer a 401K match, ALWAYS do that. It’s free money. It’s basically if you put in let’s say 4% of your income, they’ll match up to 4% of the same amount. 401Ks are taxed when you take them out when you retire whereas Roth IRAs aren’t taxed. Don’t take money out of either before you’re going to retire ever unless absolutely necessary because there are penalties and you’ll also screw up your time advantage with compound interest. \n\nA lot of people might tell you to day trade or invest in this company or that, but unless you’re one of the few who are really good at it you’re going to lose money. This comes from experience of trying and failing at it, luckily not losing too much. It’s akin to trying to bet against the house in a Casino. You might get some hits here and there, but in the long run you’ll be losing money. The truth is at the market itself will gain like 8-10% over your lifetime which doesn’t sound like much until you take compounding interest into account, which is why you want to invest in broad things like mutual funds and broad ETFs. If you do it consistently at your age you’ll have millions by the time you retire with minimal risk. It’s way less exciting but it’s so much smarter.",

      "body": "If you want to make a career out of investing, daytrading is a much easier path. It's a lot harder to learn how to daytrade, but the capital requirements are miniscule compared to the capital requirements for trading stocks. For trading stocks, you'll need at least $500k to make a living at it. And that's being optimistic. $1M is probably more realistic. For daytrading, a $25k account is more than sufficient to a make a decent living off of. \n\nHere is a link to a 400 page wiki that will teach you how to become a profitable daytrader. The guy who made it posts his entries and exits live on Twitter and has demonstrated an 80% win rate for years in bullish, bearish and sideways markets. He makes millions annually  and refuses to charge people for anything. There are a lot of bs gurus out there who are faking it, but Hari is most certainly the real deal. And he proves it day after day with his live trades. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealDayTrading/s/xe8cME7hN8\n\n This details  a trading strategy with a proven edge. And with about 2,000 hours of studying and practice paper trading (fake money accounted) you should be able to pull off a 75% win rate and be ready to make a living off of it.",

Use investopedia game, maybe just create Google sheet with \"portfolio\" Yu can create formulas to pull market data easily. \n\nWould also recommend watching finviz, especially stocks that are up and down the most, learned a lot by following few stock that dipped, not so much by stocks that jumped up.
