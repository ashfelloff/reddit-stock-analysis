Ceos/ executives for public companies like Huang need abide by these (Rule 10b5-1 agreement) to insure they’re not trading on insider information.

It needs to be done in advance, is generally seen as irrevocable, and you relinquish all control of the sales to create the safe harbor afforded by 10b5-1.

So one could assume he thought, hey this might be a good time to sell. Scheduling sells like this is a great way not to spook the market. While it’s insignificant relative to his total shares, it’s still a significant amount of money, more than a lot of CEOs sell ever in their companies; meaning, it may be all he NEEDS to sell. Even if shit hit the fan, he would never sell 25B worth of stock. At most probably a few hundred million, which is exactly what we are seeing.",
