                  "body": "Trying not to be that BBWI guy but the last few (amateur, public) races I ran I have seen vanishingly fewer Nikes. Ran a 10K last weekend in a major EC city and saw literally zero Nikes. Yes, the major marathon athletes are wearing the big foam speed pillows, but the brands that I have seen are about 50% Hokas and 50% New Balance, Altra, Newton, and other smaller brands. No Nikes.\n\n\nThe running division of Nike has spent the past decade creating the most advanced $350 marathon running shoe no one wants to buy. Truly an awesome product! But the casual runner segment is not trying to run a sub-2 marathon and is fine with a decent shoe for $100-$120 from a plethora of other brands.\n\n\nThey're also ignoring the growing professional and amateur trail running segment, which is now being served by upstart brands which are establishing themselves in that market. I follow a lot of trail running media and never once have I heard a pro in that field mention anything Nike.\n\n\nNike isn't all running, of course, but that's where they made their millions. I have no idea about their other segments, but if they follow the same trend, they're making hyper-engineered models, giving them to major athletes, and watching other brands gobble up the general market.",

          "body": "Feels a bit like cope, but I'm all for it. Let the NKE shareholders have their group counseling session. \n\nI hope NKE does well. Sold some cash covered puts at the $65 strike AFTER the -20% dip (lel for the folks that did before). Will sell more at the $60 strike if goes lower next week. I'll even start buying with my non-options cash and/or maybe sell my TPR (my apparel side bitch with LVMUY as my main) to swap into NKE. \n\nI think it's mostly a China weakness issue. The China stocks also fell the day and the day after NKE reported so clearly there is a link there. Whether China recovers or not, NKE has already planned and will eventually expand new markets (ala SEAsia and India). I hear some rumblings of competition but Lulu/Adidas/Reebok/UA aren't exactly soaring either. Asics looking like an AI stock tho. Also I hear some sneaker heads seem burnt out or upset with the shoe game but I think it's a cyclical thing? \n\nAnyways, the idea that NKE should be priced at 2018 levels is kind of off in my book but they call earnings season silly season for a reason. The NKE management downward revision for 2025 is bad but management isn't revising down to 2018 levels of sales/profits which it seems like wall street is pricing. $65 strike would mean the street thinks NKE in 2024 is worth less than in NKE 2015? I think that's wrong.\n\nAs for why I didn't just buy shares? Because I'm like 90% allocated into stocks already. That 10% or so in cash is netting a nice 5.5% + options premiums and for buying dips. NKE is a falling knife and I learned both the hard way (PARA/BABA/lowquality) as well as the safe way (PYPL/3xETFs/etcetc) how to play that game.",

It’s a permabear stock that has its worst case scenario factored in and any earnings beats will be treated as miracles.\n\nJust for perspective, it’s trading where it was in 2018 when they did $36B revenue and $1.8B profit. \n\nToday they’re doing $51B revenue and $5B profit. They’re calling for a mid single digit revenue decline next year, and profit to stay flat. That doesn’t warrant trading at 2018’s valuation imo, and so I see this as an excellent buying opportunity when rates inevitably drop and spending on Nike products and other discretionaries picks back up. \n\nUsing a fairly generous DCF model, this should be an $85 stock today and a market outperformer over the next few years.",

Nike is still Nike and it's really up to them on how they perform. \n\nIn the recent past, they prioritized direct to consumer sales which forced wholesale customers to push other brands. They acknowledged that it was a mistake and have focused on their wholesale customers so I expect them to regain presence in that area. Additionally they oversaturated their releases with many products and colors that no one wanted and in my opinion, burnt out many customers. \n\nI am a Nike customer and currently own > 50 pairs of Nikes/Jordans and definitely noticed the downtrend in the past 6 months hence the puts. The economy is not the greatest but one thing I've observed growing up is broke people still buy shoes, a lot of them. I think Nike just needs to do some minor tweaks in their approach and should be able to recover. I did buy a few calls expiring in January 2025 and believe they'll be able to turn it around.",
