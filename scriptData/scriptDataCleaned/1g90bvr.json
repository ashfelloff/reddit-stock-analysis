  "score": 77,
  "selftext": "U.S. Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan of Dallas, Dallas, delivered a written speech to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's annual meeting, once again called on the Federal Reserve to be careful about cutting interest rates, as the economic environment remains uncertain. Less restrictive monetary policy would help the Fed balance the risks in its twin missions of achieving inflation stability and maximizing employment. ‚ÄúIf the economy evolves as I currently expect, a strategy of gradually lowering policy rates to more normal or neutral levels will help manage risks and achieve our objectives. However, any shocks could affect the path to rate normalization, including how fast policy should advance and where rates should stabilize.‚Äù\n\nLogan said, ‚ÄúThe Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) needs to remain flexible and willing to make adjustments when appropriate.‚Äù\n\nLogan, who has served at the New York Fed for many years, also talked about the Fed's balance sheet and financing market dynamics.\n\nLogan said the market liquidity is still ‚Äúvery abundant‚Äù. While the use of the Fed's overnight reverse repo instrument has been declining over the past two years, current balances remain well above pre-epidemic levels. ‚ÄúFor the time being, overnight reverse repo instrument usage provides a cushion for additional excess liquidity, but over the longer term, these balances should be negligible.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the overnight reverse repo rate is not declining as repo rates approach the reserve rate and balances on the instrument do not decline, then the overnight reverse repo rate may be appropriate.‚Äù She also added that recent money market pressures appear to be temporary and that policymakers should tolerate these small pressures in order to achieve effective balance sheet size.",
