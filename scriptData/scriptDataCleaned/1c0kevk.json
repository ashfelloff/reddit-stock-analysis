The bank is willing to loan to me at 10% interest per year. So basically if I pay only interest I can buy a house worth $12,000 ($100 per month x 12 months is $1200, so if that represents 10% then the max house I can buy costs 12k).\n\nWhat if interest rates are 1%?  Same math applies but now I can afford a house that costs $120,000!!!\n\nSince the market is made up of buyers and sellers, the ability of buyers to service a mortgage directly impacts house prices.  Higher interest rates means lower house prices.\n\nThis is obviously all fake numbers and there are a bunch of assumptions in here and factors not considered (downpayment size, inflation, etc.), but you get the general idea.\n\nIf you want house prices to go down you want higher interest rates. If you don't believe me, just look at the interest rates from 2008 onwards and look at house prices.",

Using the most generous case where we take the lowest home price but the lower March 2024 mortgage rate, throw a ~7% interest rate on a 30yr mortgage, and a 20% down payment on a $400k house into a mortgage calculator and you get:\n\n\n\nPrice | Down Payment | Interest | Monthly Payment\n-----|------------|--------|---------------\n$400,000 | $80,000 | 3% | $1,349\n$372,800 | $74,560 | 7% | $1,984\n\nYou save 6.8% on the down payment ($5,440) and purchase price ($27,200). To get that, your monthly payment goes up 47% ($635).  \n\nIn the first year you pay 40% more than you saved on the down payment to service the monthly cost. \n\nYou save $27,200 on the purchase price, you pay that in the additional monthly payment in 3.6 years. Over the life of the loan the higher rate costs you $228k, 8.4x what you saved on the purchase price. \n\nThat said, its going to be super dependent on your local housing market. Some markets will see a huge dropoff in price making it cheaper. I'm in a city with an absurd housing market, rate hikes have done basically nothing to purchase prices but at one point had ~doubled the monthly payments.",

The government financed a bunch of deficit spending on the assumption that they'd be get fat tax raises in the future, then that extra income never actually arrived. Neoliberalism and Reaganomics told us \"don't worry how much the rich are making, your slice of the pie is growing too!\" But the pie hasn't really grown at all.\n\nThen after 2009, the US spent a WWII's worth of debt to \"stimulate growth\" and *got absolutely nothing for it*. The economy is actually slower now than before it got a $9T spur in the sides. Now the powers that be have put themselves in an even deeper hole.\n\nFurther economic growth in the West just doesn't appear like it can be created at this point, at any cost. Of course, The Limits To Growth predicted, timed, and explained this all back in 1972.",

          "body": "Inflation is calculated on the basis of the year before. Today we received 3.5 percent over the last 12 month. You have to do the math with all values of 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2024 (today) to derive your value compared to 2020. You can just multiply them to get the total inflation from 2020 until today...\n\nEdit: You also can just take the CPI-Value (not change) for march 2020, which was 258.1 and compare it to todays, which is 312.3 and compare them. This means an increase of approx 21%. That means, your 1$ of March 2020 is today 258.1/312.3 = 0.83$ worth.\n\n  \nSource: [https://www2.nhes.nh.gov/GraniteStats/SessionServlet?page=CPI.jsp&SID=5&country=000000&countryName=United%20States](https://www2.nhes.nh.gov/GraniteStats/SessionServlet?page=CPI.jsp&SID=5&country=000000&countryName=United%20States) + todays value.",
