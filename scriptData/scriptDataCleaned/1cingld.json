      "body": "You're taking a risk buying tomorrow, but I'm pretty sure there is going to be a wild swing one way or the other.  Positive swing if reports come out the skydance deal fell through, and/or the Sony offer doesn't include the assumption of debt in the total. The stock will dive if Shari extends the exclusive negotiation period with Skydance, or flat out announces they are moving ahead with the merger. We'll see where it opens tomorrow.",
