      "body": "TLDR: it’ll negatively affect Amazon stock eventually but not near term because the drivers aren’t unionizing only the warehouse workers who are paid much much less. \n\nUnionized UPS big rig driver here. The Teamsters, who are unionizing amazons warehouses, is a strong union. UPS drivers make $120,000-$200,000 with no college required, excellent pension and full medical benefits….\n\nPoint I’m trying to make is, the teamsters are unionizing the warehouse workers not the drivers. Amazon drivers are third party contractors. For example if you get hit and killed by an Amazon sprinter van or package car your family  won’t sue Amazon itself, you’d sue the third party contractor who was in charge of that driver. \n\nBecause there’s a disconnect between Amazon drivers and the division the teamsters are unionizing, I don’t believe the unionization push will be as damaging as some people think UNTIL this push includes drivers particularly the Class A (big rig) drivers.\n\nBy the time Amazon loses the battle to the IBT and has all its warehouse shops unionized, AI and its AWS services will far outstrip / outpace the damage done from unions.\n\nThere’s also different tiers of union - for example at UPS we get paid $45 an hour but often get overtime roughly 67 an hour. We pay very very little for full medical for our entire family and the medical insurance is insanely good. Copays are $0 or $5 for almost everything. \n\nPension? Work 10 years as a driver and get $3,000 a month. Work 30 years (average for a UPS driver) you’re looking at $9,000 a month until you die. (In addition to 401K / Social Security etc.)\n\nMcKesson is also part of our union right down the street from us. When I used to deliver there as a package car driver they’d tell me how their medical and pension was garbage. \n\nSo furthermore, just because the union and UPS has negotiated good benefits and pay it doesn’t mean doom and gloom for Amazon stockholders - there is a different caliber to which a company will be unionized.\n\nEven as a member of the union that’s attempting to bring Amazon into the fold, I am very bullish on Amazon.",

It’s gone from $1M limit to $2M limit to no limit on this contract.

It’s just a website that offers people to leave reviews on a product kind of like a form of social media.
