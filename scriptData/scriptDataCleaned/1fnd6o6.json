  "selftext": "\n\nAs the title saysâ€¦ \n\nWe saw a small spike in price on the SPY and QQQ when the rate cut was announced and then it when back down and traded about even for the day. I was like â€œhuh weird thought the market woulda loved that. Must be â€˜priced inâ€™ â€œ as the old folks say. \n\nBut no ts went up like 10$ overnight after trading closed and options were through the roof the next day. Why? How did I fuck this trade up.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

That opinions about the markets are like assholes, in that everyone has one and they usually stink\n2. That in the short term the market is a voting machine.\n\nThe thing that executes after close is all the mutual funds that people hold in their 401k. People rebalance during the day, and the mutual funds execute those orders after close. Mutual funds likely hedge with futures, which is likely why you saw a sudden movement in futures after close. \n\nIn other words, the dumb money got excited by the news, the smart money fully expected the rates cuts. \n\nAnother reason is that markets used to move mostly after hours. I think something crazy like 80% of all gains happened after hours during the dot com era when day traders were trying to make their money during the day.\n\nAnother reason is that sometimes good news is bad news. A rate cut is in theory a good sign for stocks, but it is also a sign of an upcoming recession, which is bad news for stocks. But sometimes good news is no news to the pros but good news to the dumb money.\n \nI was honestly expected a downward move immediately after the news, then the markets true reaction to be the Monday after. If you were expecting stocks to go up immediately after a 50 basis cut, you don't really understand the markets at all.
