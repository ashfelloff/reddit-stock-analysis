  "score": 518,
  "selftext": "Been watching global markets and noticed that the Tel Aviv 125 index in Israel has hit an all-time high, despite all the geopolitical tensions and the ongoing conflicts in the region. It seems a tad bit counterintuitive given the current situation, and I’m wondering if there’s something driving this surge that I’m missing.\n\n\n",

Their idea to give out subprime loans in the first place - housing lenders were perhaps seeing their numbers go down and said let’s pump up those numbers, those are rookie numbers.  Then, not looking around at external factors, they set up a ticking time bomb - the ever-rising housing market where the lendee can’t pay. \n\nA *lot* of money flowed out of the US during that war too.
