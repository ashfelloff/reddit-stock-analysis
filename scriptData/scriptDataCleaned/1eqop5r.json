          "body": "Or. It's funny I was reading about opening up a weed farm here in Florida. \n\nThere are 22 weed farm licenses. It's pretty close to impossible to get one.\n\nThe last weed farm license traded for either 4.3 million or 34 million I can't remember.\n\nHe who has the license probably will get first access distribution rights of cannabis if Florida legalizes. \n\nThere's a good chance, that you would not be allowed to import weed from other states if they legalized weed in Florida. This state is so screwed up that they might make that a state rule until they are taken to court. \n\nSo I'm thinking, that one of the hedge funds that they run, owns the farming license. Is making their money exporting cannabis. And the longer they have a proper working facility, that has money backing it, and that has no logistical or product issues, the higher the Goodwill value becomes. \n\nA good example is what happened in Colorado when there was a panic about four or five years ago. Cannabis prices went from 2200 2600, to about 1400 1600 per pound in less than a month. If you have the deep pockets, and the sophistication of knowing how to move the money around, then all you do, is ride out the storm. \n\nNow I imagine owning, one of the only forms available to grow cannabis and sell it retail. And you have some of the best cannabis in the industry. You're going to be profiting about 30 to 60 million dollars a month. Because you'll be the de beers of weed. Controlling your own supply, the quality of your supply, and the sellers of your supply. \n\nSide note for those who live in Florida. You want to buy your weed out of pompano. For whatever reason they got mad crazy Gen X and Boomers who know how to grow right. I picked up some bubble gum last year, I'm still feeling the effects üòÇüòÇüòÇ",
