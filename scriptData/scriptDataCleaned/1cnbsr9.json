INTC is the AAPL of Microchips: You can only go so far releasing the same product with a different name for 10 years.\n\n The only thing keeping this company alive is the deal they have with MSFT to release a \"new\" Windows every 3 years that forces companies to buy \"new\" HW for bullshit reasons like TPM. And even that is in jeopardy given how MSFT doesn't give a fuck about Desktop that much anymore. The only reason MSFT still has a desktop division is to pump up companies like Dell, HP and INTC that would completely crash and burn into Earth's core without the bullshit \"New Windows every 2 years where we changed the color of the task bar!\" release cycle that's been going on for the past 10 years.",

They had major problems prior to Pat with finishing nodes and with launching products on time.  No more.  Every major product on Pat's watch has been on time or early.  Every node has been on time or early.  He has all but acheived the 5 nodes in 4 years plan.  Intel 7, 4, 3 and 20A are done.  The last one of the five is Intel 18A which is variant of 20A and is actually several months ahead of the original schedule.   Now that Gaudi is ramping and that Falcon SHores AI chip will arrive next year, Intel will be hitting out of the park.  When the foundry gets rolling with the world's most advanced node, they will be more than hittign out of the park, it will be a completely different game.",
