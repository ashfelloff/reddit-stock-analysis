  "selftext": "Adobe Incorporated generates most of its revenue from what it calls the \"Adobe Creative Cloud\", which is things like Photoshop and Fresco in the form of an Adobe subscription. The majority of Creative Cloud revenue comes from professional artists who use Adobe because its software is supposedly best-in-class. But what happens when these artists don't have the money or the need to use Adobe anymore? Now that AI is here, corporations can hire any intern to generate a graphic for an ad or something using Midjourney or DALL-E without even touching Adobe. No one needs pro artists > no one needs Adobe.\n\nAnd even without the loss of revenue to AI, ADBE is still overvalued! Using exponentially smoothed revenue forecasts to fit Professor Damodaran's theory of the business life cycle, and plugging in estimated 2047 P/Ss of 20, 15, and 10 for my bull, base, and bear case terminal values, I get a discounted cash flow value of $381 neutral and $326 for my bear case, which means ADBE is overvalued as fuck! Earnings come out after market close today. I went all in, ADBE 14/Jun 400 puts. I either go big or I go home. Wish me luck fellow regards.\n\nTL;DR - ADBE overvalued. Short it.",

I work for a very large public agency and Adobe suddenly jacked up our Acrobat Pro VLM by like +50%, which is absurd, so in response we basically just instantly cut half our licenses and will just move to Bluebeam only in the future mostly eliminating all Acrobat subs entirely. We're also cutting out the few CS subscriptions we still have.\n\nI also just let my personal Illustrator+PS subscription expire and installed a pirated version instead. It was one thing when it was cheap enough that the hassle of pirating it wasn't worth it for some small chump change a year, but now that it's $$$ no bueno.",
