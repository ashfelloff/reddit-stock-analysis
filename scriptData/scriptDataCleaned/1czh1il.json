If you have the right connections - and enough money to buy a quantity/value worth discussing with a seller - you can buy into almost any company. With SpaceX specifically, the rumor is you generally need to know an employee who is looking to sell, and then there is some kind of authorization/private sale process that involves the company as well (i.e. the employee can't just sell it to you because they feel like it, SpaceX wants to vet who owns their shares). Alternately, SpaceX will sometimes do things like this, where they have a large buyer lined up, so they'll do a \"buy back\" of employee shares using this investor's money and the investor gets the shares.",
