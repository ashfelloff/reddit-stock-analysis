  "selftext": "Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up over 10% in the past week (30% in the past month) and China ETFs listed in NY have shadowed the performance. Meanwhile, the Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges in mainland China have been closed for the whole \"golden week\" holiday and missed the gains. Granted, a number of the billion people in mainland China will trade with brokerages outside the country. But what will happen when the mainland markets reopen on Monday? Will tens of millions of Chinese with FOMO rush in and push China stock prices up further, or will they cash out from gains their shares made while they were on holiday?",
