  "title": "Why I am short on NVIDIA",
  "score": 299,
  "selftext": "As someone with a background in data science, I‚Äôve been working with GPUs for the past 4-5 years, so I have a decent understanding of the space. Here's my thesis on why I'm shorting NVIDIA.\n\nAbout a year ago, the major tech companies were severely \"GPU poor.\" Getting a GPU instance on any cloud server was incredibly difficult. People, including the CTO of Hugging Face, even used the term \"GPU poor\" to describe the situation. However, things have changed.\n\nNVIDIA has fulfilled a significant number of orders, and now, securing a GPU instance on cloud servers is much easier.\n\nMost companies rely on Microsoft, Google, or AWS for their GPU needs. With the \"shovels\" (GPUs) already sold, the opportunity now lies with the \"gold diggers\" (companies using GPUs for innovation). At this point, I struggle to justify NVIDIA's $3.1 trillion market cap. The only way for them to continue standing out with such a high valuation is by innovating something even faster. But, in my opinion, that‚Äôs unlikely to happen at the pace the market expects.\n\nSo, that‚Äôs my thesis, and I'm ultra-short on NVIDIA now. I've been shorting it since the $100-$120 levels \\[before results\\], and I believe this position will pay off in the long run.",

That's why they have the  electric car market on lock. And why every country is putting near 100% tarrifs on electric imported cars from China.\n\nI agree these are not \"rare\" in their distribution....the point is China has a monopoly over the current supply. Pre sanctions China exported 28k kg of gallium\n\nThey also have the global supply of germanium and antimony which is still used chip production but more as by product. Its significance is in its use for weapon production.\nThe us doesn't just want a.i chips they want to keep making weapons. China knows that that's why its turning the screw on production just as hard as the US its limiting the supply of a.i chips to china\n\nEven if the industry decided overnight that they would give China the  üñï You can't just ramp up alternative production over night.\n\nAnother this big braining thinking for this sub\nI don't disagree nvidia is way over priced but the bug down turn will not be the release of Blackwell.
