  "selftext": "Do I need to link the montage of Elon promising self-driving cars by next year? If you're still glazing that fraud, this post isn't for you, imho betting on Tesla's competitors is the way to make real money on Robo Taxi day. \n\nHere are the facts: Google's Waymo is far more advanced than Tsla's FSD. Waymo has over 20+ million miles of real-world driving and 20+ billion miles in simulation to Tesla's 0 fucking miles. Google invested in Uber in 2013, so it's no surprise they partnered to embark on their self-driving ambitions. When Tesla fails to deliver, I believe we will see a spike in Uber as the market realizes that Tesla will not be a true competitor in autonomous driving.\n\nAnother potential winner of Tesla's RoboTaxi days is Mobileye (MBLY). They used to be a partner of Tesla until they cut their ties with Tesla based on Elon's lies about the current capabilities of Tesla's FSD. MBLY currently has several partnerships with car makers including NIO, BMW, and Volkswagen. \n\nIn 2021, Mobileye announced that the first robotaxi services would be deployed in Munich, Germany. This partnership is still active, with the goal of launching a scalable autonomous ride-hailing service in the coming years. \n\nTesla's failure on 10/10 I believe will open the door for the market to realize it isn't at true player in the space and will boost UBER and MBLY. \n\nI'm still building a position, but I have 10/18 MBLY 15 C\nand UBER  10/11 77 C and 10/18 80 C\n\nMBLY also has a very high SI, so if it goes, it will go. \n\nI've been pretty spot on of late, so let's see.\n\nEdit: Uber calls paid",

          "body": "I ride Waymo here in Phoenix now almost exclusively. It is so, so much better than 95% of Uber drives. No annoying talk, no weird smell, just you vibing in a car playing your music while the literal future drives you. Mind you, it’s not perfect, I’ve actually seen it have one or two “trolley car” issues where it’s in the right but the other driver or pedestrian is in the wrong and you can actively sense it trying to discern what to do , but I’ve seen my Uber drivers do the same shit. The only major fuck up I’ve ever seen is one failing to pull over to the right when a firefighting truck was trying to cross and intersection.  \n\nIt’s fucking mind blowing every time I take one. Whatever Tesla is promising is already being done by Waymo. It’s drives like your grandmother but in a good way, cautious but reasonable. \n\nThe issue in my mind for Waymo tho is I don’t know how feasible waymos will be in other cities in the east, with shit show transit grids and bad weather. Phoenix has little inclamate weather and operates on a grid, there’s a reason Waymo isn’t in Boston yet.",
