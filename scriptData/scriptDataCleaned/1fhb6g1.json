  "selftext": "We are officially halfway through the month of September, which has historically been a bearish month.\n\nAnd such was the case for the first week, until the market decided to recover almost to the exact same point it was when it left August.\n\nI missed out on an extremely valuable post showing market performance on 9/11 and even though I went with calls that morning they were decimated before the market did a big JUST KIDDING WATCH ME MOVE to reverse everything and go on a solid run to close the week.\n\nI will be buying puts from here until the end of the month, in smaller batches and DCAing when needed. Praying for some volatility and another reversal of the reversal of the reversal. First week was red, 2nd week green, major indices are showing a 4-6 day green run and I believe it will relinquish it back. RSI is picking up not into super overbought territory but we all know the market is not really showing how frail the economy is with regards to consumer spend/debt and stability.\n\nCurrent position 15x 9/20 exp $476p QQQ cb $2.92. QQQ closed August around this amount and is basically back to that level. \n\nEyeing things a little further out end of month QQQ $460p for under $3 feels pretty good or even $470p for around $5 for less risk. \n\nGood luck all!",

The rate cuts over the long term can be bearish but in the near term they are extremely bullish.\n\nIn fact look at what happened in Sep 2007. The interest rate was the exact same (5.25%), and the FOMC event was at the exact same day (Sep 18). They cut 50 bps and SPY rallied +3% that day and continued to rally until October 11th where it put a top and the bear market of 07/08 ensued. Not only that the prior local top that year happened on July 16th, the exact same day that the local top happened this year. Basically market right now is just starting to get into overbought territory so it can stay overbought for quite a while still. History doesn‚Äôt repeat itself but it often rhymes. Plus the market has been edging a new ATH for a month and a half. It already went down significantly 2 times, in Aug and Sep. Slingshot was pulled for a reason.
