  "selftext": "AST D2D 5G technology is ready to enhance the telecommunications industry. This will commence at the end of Sept when they launch 5 sats - BB1s. 5 sats which will provide 125 milly revs next year and already have AST EBIDTA break even purportedly. The plan is to produce 4 sats per month next year and beyond. Approx 100 sats are needed to be fully operational. \n\nAST has superior tech to any pretenders trying to get into the space and they will have no competitor for years. Their tech is patented and took them many years to establish. Starlink tend to be who people fear the most re competition. There is a misconception that Starlink are ahead of the game with anything to do with space based communication services. Starlink are largely in a diff lane - broadband and have yet to show that they will be a real competitor at all in the D2D 5G space. Even in their main area of focus, broadband, their tech is expensive and clunky - requiring a receiver for functionality. They’ve literally just announced in the last year or two that they’re going to get involved in the D2D space. How many years behind AST are they? Maybe 5? Maybe more?…\n\nAST have MOU’s with over 50 MNO’s including Vodafone and Rakuten. They have recently signed commercial agreements with AT&T and Verizon, as well as received strategic funding from both companies. This is what led to a recent share price surge as the sole remaining short thesis - funding risks/dilution - was invalidated. Furthermore, AST are set to dominate the US market with AT&T and Verizon on board. Imo it seems likely T-Mobile, who have a relationship with Starlink, will have to follow suit because Starlink have no service to offer them and won’t for many years, if ever. The scant short thesis has now evaporated and they have started to cover - as seen by a 30% or so reduction in short interest over the last month. AST have said there will be no more dilution this year. It seems there will be no more public offerings full stop going forward as AST have 50 MNO’s yet to formalise commercial agreements with - many of whom will provide strategic investment/funding via revenue prepayment and convertible loans. \n\nAT&T recently said that they surveyed their subscribers and 30-40% said they would sign up to AST’s service when available. AST have access to 2.8 billion users through existing agreements with MNO’s. If we assume even a pessimistic take up of 20% (not the 30-40% AT&T mentioned) then that would be 560 million yearly users of ASTS. This is not including users who are currently in dead zones of many parts of Asia, Africa, South America who currently have no phones (as there are no telecom poles/companies providing signal - a problem which AST will solve). It also doesn’t include governmental/DoD contracts or the use of day passes. \n\nSo to give you an idea of revenue potential: \n\nWe don’t know how much AST will charge users for the service. We do know it will be cheap and accessible. The cheapest possible it will be is $2 ($1 to Ast and 1$ to MNO). I believe it will be double that. However I want to show you revenue potential with the most pessimistic of uptake/price.\n\nSo pessimistically we will have 560 mill users (remember this doesn’t include dead zone users, governmental contracts, day passes and it is a pessimistic 20% uptake). AST will pessimistically be getting $1 dollar per month form each user or $12 yearly (I believe it will be at least 1.5 times more than that, maybe twice as much). So 560X12 = revenue of 6.7 billion with net profit of around 5 billion due to high margins. With a conservative 25 PE that with mean a market cap of 125 billion. Again, even allowing for a pessimistic 10% more dilution this would equate to a share price of 420 when fully operational. They should be fully operational by 2028. So doing the maths as pessimistically as possible I get a 420 share price. While this share price may sound crazy, considering ASTS is currently 11.50 per share or so, it’s really not. Transhumanica have a 500 PT by 2030 and Deutsche Bank have a PT of 676 by 2027. Have you ever seen a firm slap a 60x PT on a stock?\n\nIf you’re interested, a must read: the most comprehensive DD available, kindly shared by the Kookreport on Twitter - https://www.kookreport.com/post/ast-spacemobile-asts-the-mobile-satellite-cellular-network-monopoly-please-find-my-final-comp\n\nAlso, I’d recommend following Catse on Stocktwits/Twitter - he is ASTS’s Roaring Kitty equivalent \n\nFinally, join ASTSpacemobile on reddit.\n\nDisclosure: I’m all in with 20k shares and intend on HODLing all until 2027 at least. \nMy approach - retirement or bust. \n\n\nEdit: Re potential government contracts - first responders and the military have an obvious need to eliminate dead zones.\n\nAll DoD contracts go through Fairwinds Technology. Fairwinds Technology have tweeted about AST’s technology. \n\nFirst Net have 8 billion allocated and available to improve connectivity. First Net work with AT&T. First Net have also tweeted about AST. \n\nContracts with both First Net and Fairwinds are inevitable imo. ",

They announced recently that they wanted to get into the emerging D2C market that ASTS is pursuing. But ASTS is way ahead of competitors in terms of technology, patents, testing, partnerships...\n\nASTS is different than past satellite phone companies because they allow broadband D2C (Direct to Cellphone, no need for special satellite phone) connectivity. Their patented sat design/chips allow them to offer good data rates accurately from space, where previously companies like Globastar were only able to offer SOS /emergency texting.\n\nASTS business model is also pretty smart. By partnering with MNO worldwide, they don't have to spend money on customer acquisition, advertising, customer support etc. This means they can grow their subscribers insanely quickly once MNO start pushing the service in their plans (kind of like Globastar with Apple IPhone) and still get crazy gross margins. \n\nSo ASTS differ because they have the right tech, structure, and vision. Their project is ambitious and catching a lot of attention in the right circles (MNO's, Firstnet, Dod). So if they manage to fund it and build it right, a lot of people will regret having passed up on it",

I then extrapolated this lower uptake percentage across all subscribers to MNOs that AST have agreements/MOU’s with. \n\nYes, margins will be v high. Their only real expense will be renewal of the fleet of Satellites. A satellite all in, including launch, costs them 20 mill. It’s believed a satellite will have a lifespan of 7-10 years. Their only expense additional to this will be salaries, hence the massive margins. \n\nWrong, costs are not high. It’s a front loaded capital extensive business, but when up and running, costs are minimal as I’ve just explained. Don’t listen to me - Deutsche Bank foresee profit margins to be in the region of 85-95%. \n\nTAM is always questionable in an innovative company creating their own market. ARK (whom I know are questionable) foresee the D2D 5G market having a TAM of 50 billion by 2030. Given the MOU’s and agreements in place, as well as the lack of viable competition, it seems likely that AST will dominate this market. AST are certainly who the telecommunications MNO’s are betting on. \n\nAsk yourself, would you pay $2-4 monthly to remove signal issues with your existing server? To have signal no matter where you are? If not, how many people do you think would? As I said, AT&T surveyed their subscribers and they believe there will be a 30-40% uptake. That would be around 60-90 million users from AT&T alone. \n\nThe bear case of it going to 0 is essentially invalidated imo now that the tech is proven and funding issues are resolved. \n\nLarge companies are more than just hedging their bets. Vodafone, Rakuten and Google are all investors. Verizon and AT&T have already prepayed 25 million and they provided convertible loans, all of which they stand to lose if it goes to zero. Wait and watch as more MNO’s follow Verizon and AT&T’s lead.",

That’s assuming downtime and shifting concurrent users, so reality is more like 30,000 people having slow download speeds (3mbps), with download speed getting over 100mbps with less users.

Starlink has 3 millions customers for their service and is trying to get more. Starlink is around 70% of Space X valuation, so around $150B. \n\nASTS' main objective is mainly to allow MNOs to extend their coverage area for dirt cheap. ASTS does not target / manage end users directly and that's very important. If ASTS satellites can allow coverage for the entire US, MNOs would \"have\" to offer the service to their customers. ASTS then gets a cut off every subscription. If there are 50M subs and ASTS gets $2 per sub per month, that's already 50 x 12 x 2 = 1.2B in annual revenue. That's just the revenue from 50 US subs, not accounting other countries, Firstnet or DoD contracts.. \n\nNow with that being said, Starlink is trying to enter the D2C market (Satellite Direct 2 Cellphones). But their tech is years behind, and they are having regulatory problems that will be a pain in the ass to solve. So ASTS might be the only reliable provider available for quite some time. \n\nIn the US, ASTS has deals (pre-payments) with Verizon and AT&T. Starlink has a non exclusive partnership with T-Mobile. But word on the street is that T-Mobile will have to ditch Starlink, and partner with ASTS, so as to not be left behind once ASTS starts service. If that happens then the game is pretty much set.\n\nNow mind you ASTS is still a very risky investment, and hurdles are still there to overcome. But the company has a clear path to go from 3B current valuation to 100B+ in the next 3-5 years. Let's see if they pull out off and make us rich",

In March 2024, they announced that they had a measly 500k in revenue and a loss of 55 million.\n\nThey had delays in launching their test satellite, this is not representative of a failure of their business model it is just a delay getting to market, so your argument that they have failed as a business is baseless. \n\nFYI that measly 500k in revenue came from the DOD, because high ranking officials within the US defense community and Nato are investigating how to incorporate the company's assets into their defense strategy. NATO SatCom director Daniel Askew was talking about AST Spacemobile specifically at MilSatCom a few weeks ago. Have you heard about Nato?",
