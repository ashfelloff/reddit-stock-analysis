Like those regards quite literally plugged their ears and stuck their head in the sand until it was too late for them to even take a peek from their sand coffins.\n\nYahoo? They were big, but they also made one bad decision after another which ended with them being bought by fucking Verizon? This was also in an era where CEOs were chasing that trend of getting hired, gutting the company, and jumping ship with golden parachutes. \n\nBig Tech now actively swallows up any possible up and coming competitor or strike a deal like Microsoft has with OpenAI to strictly control their output and autonomy. The CEOs aren't bumbling idiots who actively try to rape the company and leave either. They stay, reap massive bonuses dwarfing anything Melissa Mayer ever got, and work diligently for the shareholders. They've also built themselves to be too big to fail, their valuations/market caps alone guarantee no one in their right minds would ever try to seriously tear them down.",
