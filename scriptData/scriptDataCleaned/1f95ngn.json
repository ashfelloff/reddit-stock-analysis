Unexpected development given Intel had shown an Intel 20A Arrowlake die on stage last year. 18A process is do or die for Intel's foundry business, with the failures/cancellation of 4/3/20A and financial uncertainty putting their 15A plan in flux.",

However, Intel‚Äôs 20A served as a vehicle for several new advances, like RibbonFet Gate-All-Around (GAA) technology, which is Intel‚Äôs first new transistor design since FinFET arrived in 2011. It also marked the debut of the company‚Äôs PowerVia backside power delivery tech, which routes power for the transistors through the backside of the processor die.   \n\nIntel says the learnings it gained from its 20A node have contributed to the success of its 18A node, which makes sense given that 18A is a tighter refinement of the technologies invented for 20A.\n\nIt appears that Intel will now leapfrog over its 20A process entirely and avoid the capital expenditures required to bring the node to full production.‚Äú",

Things haven‚Äôt been great, but expectations were never high to begin with. I‚Äôll think about selling around this time of the year, in 2026. Until then, Intel‚Äôs move has yet to be made\n\nI bought my first share in 2022 or so, starting at ~$25/share. The ride up to $50 was sweet.
