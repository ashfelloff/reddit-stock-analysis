IMO it’s more logical to risk pre tax funds than post tax funds you could use today. \n\nRetirement funds are long term and for me it’s much easier taking gambles in that bc whether I lose it or not won’t change my life immediately which allows me to be much more rational.\n\nIf you lose pretax money you actually lose less than if you had paid tax on that money\n\nAlso the max contribution “forces” us to not risk our whole net worth in one go. I blew out two IRA annual contributions when i first started and if I had done it in a brokerage I def woulda lost way more since I woulda deposited everything\n\nI attribute most investing and trading success to how well someone protects their money from themselves. And the retirement acct is the best vehicle for that. It’s just enough friction to incentivize us to not touch it, yet if we really needed it in life, we can still access it",

Or, you know, ANY money they ever spend or lose.\n\nThere is infinite opportunity cost for any dollar we make, spend, or invest in less performant assets. It’s just funny to me that the govt has so successfully brain washed everyone to put retirement funds on a pedestal simply because “tax savings in 4 decades if you live that long”. \n\nWhile subtly implying risking non retirement money is a smarter move. No, risking money you have today that you paid payroll taxes to get is NOT smarter. It’s actually more irresponsible and incurs the same 40 year compounding opportunity costs you laid out.",

If you do not have one then you open one and put some money into it from your bank account.  I would highly suggest going with Fidelity and also with a ROTH IRA.

You basically can lie about your experience and income to get approved lol.  And you probably will need to.\n\nThen it's just a matter of getting used to their interface and doing it.
