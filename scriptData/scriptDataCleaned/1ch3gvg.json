Before P.G., Intel lost the foundry edge and their product mix suffered as a result.\n\nEvery single process node is on track in their 5 nodes in 4 year strategy. This is huge. If they execute, which they have consistently under Pat in the technology space, they will be on par with or ahead of TSMC and soon. They also are the first company to buy and assemble the next gen ASML High NA EUV. They will have a multi-year lead on TSMC in this technology as well as PowerVia. This means they will once again make the best chips. By 2025 chips about the same or better and then outright better. \n\nThey have changed their accounting to their own detriment to show an honest representation of their new foundry business. This is pro-investor. It sucks and I have lost my ass, but it's for the best as we can share in their growth story.\n\nThey have released Gaudi3 and been very conservative in their sales projections. However, unlike AMD, they released actual benchmarks showing the competitiveness to H100. H100 is the modern 2024 product that everyone is using right now. Guadi3 is better according to the data presented.\n\nIntel has degraded in server market share because they have been competing on older process nodes against AMD and Nvidia on TSMC. They just announced that they were ramping large production of next gen server chips on Intel3. This coming generation should be very interesting.\n\nIf you believe that chips are going to keep growing, robotics are real, AI is real, etc, then you have to believe this story too. \n\nI like your options. You bought them long term, so let's see how things pan out. I'm relatively small shareholder 5000 shares, but I have been scouting options. Maybe I will buy yours :-)",
