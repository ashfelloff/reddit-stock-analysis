      "body": "Edit. I may have misread the filing that indicates the change in trump stake. I thought it was insider trading but reran the numbers and found it was from the earnout. This is likely what caused the giant drop. It may go back up? I cashed out on my bullish position for profit m and am still holding my puts for sept. \n\nGood luck y’all\n\n\n\nDJT Free Float and Short Interest?\n\nIn light of the SEC filing today it appears trump has bought about 13 million shares of the current float. That leaves about 27 million left. (57.6% to 65% ownership of the 176M shares)\n\nThe current short interest is on about 4.5 million shares with 0 shares left to short according to fintel giving about 17% of all shares shorted post trump purchase. \n\nAMC had about 20% of its available float shorted before it squeezed and went parabolic. Are we expecting something here with DJT?\n\nThe stock is worthless and should be $2-5 a share given the cash the company has on hand and its outstanding debts. However, if it got upward momentum it could pop beyond belief potentially to AMC levels (15x). \n\nI am starting to feel confident this will soar before the rugpull. Earnings are coming for the company and so are Trumps earnout shares. The former will obviously be negative and the earnout will take a 20% chunk off the share price with dilution. However, if this thing squeezes before then it could be glorious",
