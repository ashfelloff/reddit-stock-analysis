My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.\n\nThat is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We're doing Robotaxis, but for real this time\", and Cathy Woods of course was like \"fuck yeah! I'm gonna Yolo that shit! Here's a few billion Elon!\" \n\nAnd then all the Tesla shorts got cooked squeezing the stock even higher. But the bears didn't give up. They were like, \"We've heard this robotaxi shit fucking 10 years ago. Only an absolute idiot would buy this shit. Let's keep shorting. People will realize it's bullshit soon enough.\"\n\nThen they pass a massive hurdle to implement ROBOTAXIS in China and bears get squeezed again.\n\nI would say they're regarded for shorting Tesla...
