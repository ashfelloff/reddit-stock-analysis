      "body": "Assuming ETFs cannot sell at $15 due to holding requirements, that's 84 million shares of Class B (13.44%). This boosts the $15 buyout likelihood to around 60%. Given that some Class B holders won't sell, you might sell at least 70% of your shares at $15. With the current price at $11.50, selling 70% at $15 effectively makes your cost about $1 per new Paramount diluted share. This is promising, especially with the potential gains during an election year for CBS and Paramount Plus reducing losses.\n\nHowever, you'll likely need to hold for a year, giving short sellers time to create volatility as they can't exit at $15 like in a normal buyout. The \"go-shop\" period is a bonus, possibly leading to a quick buyout or a higher bid from Skydance. The downside risk is the deal collapsing or getting blocked, but with $30 billion in revenue, a clear path to profits, long-term debt maturity, and an $8 billion market cap with many assets, the margin of safety appears strong.",
