      "body": "I listened to Jensen GTC and found that the idea of accelerated computing started all the way back to video games rendering.\n\nWith the early momentum of internet, mobile, and cloud era, my only question is what AAPL used to accelerate their data processing all these while.\n\nI'm fascinated that Google's Gemini AI is now rivaling the first mover OpenAI, even claiming top spot once a while. It proves that the AI moat does rest upon computing power. \n\nNow the key observation: AGI is certainly a very important goal, so why did Google still extend the AI compute to AAPL? Does it mean Google's custom TPU is so good that it can accommodate more customers while staying close to OpenAI (and now more recently Anthropic AI)?\n\nBefore this news, the world usually associated AI training exclusively to NVDA, and very little extent AMD, even lesser to INTC. Apple's using Google's TPU suddenly opening up choices among AI startups which are very much cost constrained. Time wise, they do not want to wait for the next Blackwell shipment anymore.\n\nBoth AWS and Azure use NVDA hardware to offer accelerated computing solution. The current narrative is, the more GPU you have, the nearer you are to AGI. At least that's how Meta and OpenAI see it.\n\nBefore we see that reality, AI monetization will have a long way to catch up so the game is really between the big boys with deep pockets. I personally see deepening relationship for AAPL-GOOG and MSFT-NVDA in Gen AI era.\n\nAmazing to live in a time like these. I use Gemini free version regularly and its recent responses are really good.",

I am beginning to think whether GOOG is purposely playing catchup with OpenAI since GOOG was (and is) quite ahead in the AI race as early as Deepmind 2017, with all the accumulated AI research to date.",
