And Nvidia’s designs are just far ahead for AI if I understand correctly. Then there are foundries that make chips for others in their fabs mainly TSMC and Samsung. And then IDM’s like Intel and Micron do both design and make chips. I guess my biggest confusion is within the fabless companies, there seems to be a wide range and clearly Nvidia and AMD seem to be hyperfocused on chip design so they are a good comparison as competitors, while obviously Apple and Amazon do a bunch of other stuff. Where do qualcomm and broadcom fit into that spectrum?",

I even read from the Microsoft build transcript that Microsoft uses Nvlink on MI300x installations, if that wasn’t a mixup with Infinityfabric it would mean customers Can mix and match network equipment from nvidia with AMD GPUs. I find it to be an unlikely thing, but not sure its technically impossible atleast not from an interface point of view.\n\nWe’ll see.\n\nThe «bad» thing about AMD and Intel entering the server AI GPU Market is that They bring the TAM down since They have a much lower price point per unit, so the more revenue They Get from this market you Can essentially multiply that number by 4 to see what nvidia might have made of revenue from the same customers.
