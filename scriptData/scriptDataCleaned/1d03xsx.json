              "body": "It's not a pump and dump, but it is cyclical. Analogize it to the video card industry. At one point, essentially everyone had integrated graphics. The 3d gaming card boom was ATI/3DFX/NVDA selling add in cards. Eventually, though, most major systems started integrating those cards into their systems - margins compressed and the product became slightly more commoditized. Don't forget, NVDA almost went bankrupt. Twice.\n\nI'm rambling, but the point is that just like 3d video cards, once you have one, you don't upgrade every cycle (unless you have $ to burn or are a hardcore gamer). The more reasonable thing to do is upgrade every other or even 3rd cycle.\n\nThe same will happen with AI chips. Does anyone really think META is going to drop $40 billion every year on every new NVDA release? That's just silly. Once they have AI hardware fully deployed, they will upgrade in phases, swapping out their oldest cards for newer ones, and repeat that cycle every year. Hence the cyclicality. This has always been the way with semis.\n\nWhat is happening now is the equivalent of everyone upgrading their shitty integrated graphics (classic data centers) to 3d graphics (AI cards). As to how long it will last, who knows.",

Some of the orders are mind boggling Ex: META buying 350,000Â *Nvidia*Â H100 GPUs.\n\nAfter the big players/sovereigns' orders are filled, we will likely see the 2nd place players start to get theirs - also potentially at a discount compared to early adopters. These smaller players have no real choice but at least they get to see how early adopters best implement the GPUs to make/save $.\n\nThe reality is very few companies (other than NVDA and system builders) are actually making $ off of AI right now. I still believe that the true use cases are yet to be realized.\n\nAgain, I'm rambling but compare it to the cell phone. It was supposed to be a way to just make phone calls without wires from any location. In 2024, I use my phone for 1,000 things and the thing I potentially do the least is make actual phone calls.

      "body": "The market once again went into irrational euphoria unsupported by macroeconomic and financial backing - another market hysteria, 2.6 trillion Nvidia capitalization with fierce buying as if 6x growth since early 2023 and doubling early 2024 didn't happen.\n\nNvidia has created 1.2 trillion in capitalization since Dec. 23 (including May 23 pre-market) - more than the capitalization of all publicly traded companies in major countries around the world combined, and that's just capitalization gains. \n\nNvidia's importance (in terms of triggering value creation in the financial markets) dwarfs any macroeconomic report, any Fed statement, and even geopolitical events, overshadowing the media agenda with the hype around AI.\n\nThe fact is that Nvidia's annual revenue is 80 billion (potential 110 billion) with earnings of 42.5 billion (potential around 60 billion), i.e. a forward P/S of around 24 and a P/E of 42-45. At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart). Not because Nvidia is bad (best technology solutions on the market and great products), but because the market is crazy.",
