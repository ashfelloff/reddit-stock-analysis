  "selftext": "My broker charges me 0.25% per trade.\n\nYTD I have spent more than $800 on per trade comissions, I didn’t mind it because I am still profitable, but looking online it seems I am being somewhat scammed by my Broker? My account balance is around $25,000 and most of it is being traded in the market on various stocks that I usually hold for a month. I usually trade stocks with a share price less than $10. \n\nI don’t really have a good reference, is this too much? The only reason I feel hesitant to change to other brokers because I will be screwed by the exchange rates when converting to USD so I am using a local broker. So I am not really sure what to do. \n\nI guess my question would be - is 0.25% too high? Is it worth switching to another broker at this stage? ",

Assuming they keep charging the same rate and keep making the same gains, it would still be 3.2% at the end of the year.

Do keep in mind that the investment firm you are using may just be using another actual bank to store the money. If that is the case, (say schwab is actually holding the money at wells fargo) if schwab goes bankrupt or defaults then your cash wouldn't even be affected.\n\nStocks are assigned too you by name and account info so those would not be effected either since schwab doesn't actually own your shares, you do. They are just the middle man showing you the info on their platform.\n\nFor now, just keep a watch on their earnings calls and see if the company will recover this year. Remember a couple years back that one California bank went under and fdic payed back FAR MORE than the maximum of 250k, so the whole limit of FDIC insurance has been under question lately since they broke their own rule.\n\nNone of this is investment advice.",
