We plan to keep this up through Thursday, but may extend it based on how quickly election results are announced.**\n\nPlease keep any election related discussions in this thread, as all other posts will be removed and directed here. \n\nRemember to remain civil. Try to remain on topic as there are other places to talk about politics that don't relate to stocks.\n\nDue to expected volume we expect issues keeping up with moderation. \n\nPlease Report any personal attacks or harassment, inflammatory comments etc. as civility is our primary focus in moderating this thread.\n\nWe may at times lock the thread if it hits r/all and degrades away from stock discussion.\n\nYou can find the quarterly portfolio sticky here: https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1f6a2ze/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread/",

Think Nvidia and TSM, if it’s going to cost Nvidia more to import TSM chips, why would they not just move their production abroad and shift the tariff cost to the consumer. \nHopefully, trump won’t do much, as we’ve seen before.

Higher yields mean more reason to buy dollars to buy treasuries. \n\n\nTrump can't set interest rates nor influence the strength of the dollar. Almost all his stated policies will cause inflation and the expected fiscal loosening caused by tax cuts and giveaways will force the fed to raise rates, maybe sharply, which will also increase the strength of the dollar.\n\n\nIf he persists the deficit will balloon at the same time as borrowing costs (ie treasury yields) and the fed will be forced to turn to QE to fund it. This will cause even more inflation. In other countries this would prompt a collapse in the currency to balance things out but the dollar is the international reserve currency and USTs a safe haven and reflect far more than America's domestic economy. Money will flood into USTs as the rates climb and buy dollars to do it, dragging the dollar upward (somewhat mitigating inflation, not enough to dent it).\n\n\nThis is a positive feedback loop that will eventually result in hyperinflation and probably financial crisis and the loss of the dollar's reserve status. It could be stopped at any point by simply reducing the deficit (by cutting spending or raising taxes) but Double Down Donnie *always* Doubles Down.",
