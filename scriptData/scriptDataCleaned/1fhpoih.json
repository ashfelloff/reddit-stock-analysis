It's heartbreaking to see people posting losses amounting to years of savings, I was also seriously considering a YOLO on long SPY puts until I came across this concept because I'm feeling super sure about a pending recession. Read up on it and I am converted, I'll maybe make a sizeable bet of like 10% but I ain't going all in (at that point it's basically a hedge).\n\nThe gist is the best way to make money over time is to sensibly size your capital allocation to any bet you make, statistically you will come out better off. Even if a bet has a 99% chance of doubling your investment it doesn't make sense to bet your entire port because if you hit that 1% you're fucked. Think of it as playing Russian Roulette with a revolver with 100 barrels (YOLOing), vs.... I don't know, some equivalent situation but if the bet doesn't go your way you just get punched in the face really hard (sizeable allocation but not a YOLO). Not even accounting for the fact most of this shit has odds sub 10%, not to mention you probably don't understand options correctly and will lose even if what you think will happen to the underlying happens.\n\nIf you bet 10% on something that moons, you made great gains! Enviable gains even. Don't risk having to leave the table entirely and impacting your future because you FOMO your entire port on something.\n\nSeriously: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly\\_criterion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_criterion)\n\nRead it or weep.",
