  "selftext": "8 months of blood sweat and tears just to lose it all in under two months thanks to over-leveraging on calls and leveraged ETFs at the top. I was at $290k in June. I was convinced that unless I hit it big again from there, I’ll never be able to afford a house given today’s prices. Sad that $290k can’t buy you the average home these days. How was I supposed to know it was the top that would also be followed by an overnight crash. Cut my losses bc if I lose more holding the leveraged ETF, I’d be toast. If it goes back up, so be it. I’m sick to my stomach. Going to have to find a job in this shitty job market and put my money back to work for another decade or so to break even after shelling out for inflated cost of living.  I will always be average. No gf no home no mula. Back to hiding my depression in call of duty every day and searching for a  job (as if the job market is any better, I was fired in February and have applied to dozens of jobs since then, only job that responded was barista at Starbucks) fml!! At least I don’t owe capital gains taxes :D I will never be the same I am a broken man est. market crash of 2024 (mods can I have flair please)",

I had 2k at the beginning of the year that very quickly turned to 1300, to 4968 at its peak and then now I'm all the way down to 1300 again. I do very well when I play it safe-ish, not that options are truly ever safe unless you're specifically using them to hedge, but I'm too attracted to the idea of changing my whole financial situation over in a night. I get stuck in the whole \"Just $10k and I could simultaneously fix X, Y, and Z and start a real portfolio\" mentality and fear of missing out of today's volatile market conditions. As long as you still have money to play with, you haven't quite lost yet. I closed all of my positions and took a short break from options to remind myself that life is still enjoyable, even if you're just sitting around playing Call of Duty, lol. This might be gambler's brain talking, but it's also only been two months. If your portfolio drops that fast, it can come back. It may take a little longer than two months, but letting yourself get really depressed is not going to help you make trading decisions. Whether the bull market continues or we actually transition to an actual bear market or a recession, there will (barring WW3) be a huge opportunity to make returns over the next few years. I'm betting against WW3 for the simple fact that I'll probably have much bigger problems than stocks if that happens.",
