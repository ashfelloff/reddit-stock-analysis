  "selftext": "I don’t YOLO, I’m not quite regarded enough for that.\n\nI was working a slow shift at Wendy’s one day, when it hit me: buy low, sell high.\n\nBeen doing it ever since, I’m up 63% on the year. (With the help up RH’s 5% interest rate on uninvested cash.) I developed some rules for options trading, and I’ve stuck to them this whole year. (For the most part.)\n\nThis is pretty much all 90-120 DTE AAPL, SOXL, TECL, and TQQQ calls. I never let an expiration date get closer than say 70 days away. Tried puts a couple of times, it never worked. Plus I’m an optimist, I don’t like rooting for something negative to happen.\n\nHave I actually figured something out? Or am I just riding the wave of a bullish year, and I should apply for that assistant manager position after all?\n\nShould I consult with my wife’s boyfriend, too?",
