  "selftext": "ARTICLE TLDR: Amazon is investing a whopping $150 billion over 15 years to build data centers, anticipating a surge in demand for AI and digital services. This move aims to cement Amazon's lead in cloud services and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, Amazon is allocating over $1 billion this year to Nvidia's new Blackwell AI data center, further underlining its commitment to staying ahead in the tech race. With previous significant expenditures and strategic acquisitions, Amazon signals a bullish stance on profitability and market dominance. \n\nSOURCE:\n\n[https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/business/amazon-pours-150b-into-data-centers-to-handle-expected-ai-boom/](https://nypost.com/2024/03/28/business/amazon-pours-150b-into-data-centers-to-handle-expected-ai-boom/)",
