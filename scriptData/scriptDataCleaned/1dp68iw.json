Well at least I’m already up over 100% on my NVDA shares with whatever I was willing to invest at the time. Hopefully 5 years down the road I’ll be happy I didn’t start investing later",

Would be worth well over $100k had I held. So I bought a couple shares of NVDA 6 years ago. I’m up like 4000%, but I’d rather ride it all the way down than sell! Find the next NVDA. NVDA doesn’t have much father to go up, but it has a long way to go down.",
