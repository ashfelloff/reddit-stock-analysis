Selling now and trying to re-enter later rarely works. It may seem like a good idea if you sell today and it drops more tomorrow, but there is more risk than reward with that strategy. Stay the course and look for good deals in the coming days/weeks if you have cash. If you’re 10+ years away from retirement, don’t touch your 401k. Enjoy the ride. ",

          "body": "Its not even the panic sellers that are the issue. I did a tiny bit of digging last month and the Japanese carry trade has an estimated $20 trillion USD worth of assets involved. That trade is collapsing and being unwound. The markets worldwide are going down because that $20 trillion in assets is being sold. Maybe not all of it, but a lot of it. Other people with big piles of capital are doing all kinds of thing to take advantage of that situation.\n\nAfter the dust settles maybe the market will continue to slide, but I suspect it will bottom and go up from there. All the gloom and doom chatter is helping the short sellers who are likely trying to punish the carry traders and get the assets at even cheaper prices. One big thing that will cause the coming boom is that short sellers will have a lot of capital tied up in all that stuff they just bought. That will reduce the downward pressure on markets. I'm not saying it will boom in a few weeks or months, but it will be a positive for several years. \n\nThe tell is that the only thing going up in value even slightly is bonds and the market cap of bonds going up is far and away less than all the selling that is occurring. If it was a true major recession fear gold should be spiking as well as defensive stocks. Gold is actually dropping and the defensive stocks are just treading water as a group.",

I tried researching the Carey trade after reading your post (plus they’ve been talking about the yen constantly on Bloomberg and I never figured out the significance). \n\nSo if I have it right, the yen increasing in value means the people that have borrowed yen to purchase US equities will sell those equities?

Spent the dollars on something that generated an income and were highly leveraged. Now the Bank of Japan has increased rates, the currency has moved and as a result the expense to unwind the trade is growing rapidly. Remember this is highly leveraged so even the smallest increase in expense adds up real fast. \n\nTo unwind they have to sell the assets. Which is overwhelming buyers and driving prices down rapidly.\n\nThey then have to convert dollars back to yen which is painful due to the exchange rate moving so much. \n\nFinally they have to repay the debt in yen. \n\nImagine for a moment that this is profitable on because that interest rate was so incredibly low. Lets say they were making .1% after transaction fees. Not all that profitable until you realize they leveraged it up enormously. Now looking forward that .1% profit at an annual rate might be a loss of .15%. They made money on this because they have been doing it for quite a few years, but now exiting the trade is rapidly eating up the profits. \n\nI doubt they will sell it all, but the folks last in the door on that trade are likely selling everything. The others are probably pacing their selling due to the lack of buyers. This could take a long time to unwind. It could all happen rapidly. It probably will be a bit of both. The folks who have to exit now are exiting and paying a massive price as a result. The folks who can pace the selling will do it over a much longer period of time, but eventually most of this trade will be unwound. \n\nFor everyone not involved the issue is that they are selling massive amounts of everything under the sun. There aren't enough buyers to match that and the prices are dropping rapidly because of it. Personally I think everyone who isnt involved should just hold what they got and consider actually buying a bit here and there as this happens. A bottom will occur and it will likely be relatively soon (as in by November at the latest) and then we will see these low prices go away. On a serious note dont look at this as being the market is crashing. Look at this as improving the foundation on which your future buying will be built on. You want these guys to sell now and not in 5 more years. Once they clear out prices wont be artificially pushed up by them for quite awhile. Eventually they will set up another carry trade, but it wont distort the market again for years. \n\nBtw the last time they unwound was 2009. After the worst of the GFC was past us. Think about that. This may turn out to be the ultimate stop loss that had to be fished out of the market. If it plays out like last time this is really good for the market. I know its painful right to watch right now, but there is a high likelihood that this will be positive for returns within a few months.",
