  "selftext": "Some background, I used to lurk in here 2021 stopped trading after I got a decent job. End of 2022 I get laid off. Beginning of 2023 I start lurking again and trading. Right now I bartend and I‚Äôm in college. Through this subreddit I am able to make my life better and more affordable. Thank you to all my fellow regards who give me great advice on stocks like NVDA, ASTS, AAPL, RDDT and many more over the last year or so. I don‚Äôt do options but just flipping a couple hundred every week or so from the couple of grand I have in my portfolio has drastically improved my quality of life, I am have now saved up more money this last year from trading stocks and bartending then I did working a cushy corporate job. Again thank you fellow regards for everything you have taught me and to avoid options‚ù§Ô∏è",
