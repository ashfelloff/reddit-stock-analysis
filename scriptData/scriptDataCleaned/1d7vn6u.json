  "selftext": "\"Investors who purchased shares in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway yesterday at a huge discount will see their trades canceled following a technical issue on the stock exchange.\n\nOn June 3, a data glitch led the global conglomerate’s stock price to fall to $185 a share, having previously closed at over $620,000. The drop meant a more than 99% discount on the Warren Buffett-led company.\n\nThis means a trader who snapped up just $925 worth of the stock at the rock-bottom price would now see their investment worth over $3 million today.\n\nWhile it hasn’t been confirmed how many people purchased the Class A stock during the technical error—which lasted for around an hour and a half—the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has swiftly undone their trades.\n\nIn an update posted at 9 p.m. last night, NYSE said it would “bust” all the “erroneous” trades of Berkshire Hathaway stock at or below $603,718.30 a share.\n\nThe issue, the exchange added, is related to a problem at the Consolidated Tape Association (CTA), which provides real-time information about quotes and trades on the exchange. The CTA oversees part of the Securities Information Processor (SIP) which consolidates all protected bid/ask quotes and trades into a single data stream.\n\nThe CTA said it experienced problems with price banding which “may have been related to a new software release” on SIP. As a result the CTA has reverted to the previous version of the software. The CTA did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nDuring the blip, the NYSE placed halts on certain trades, and will seek to determine which are erroneous and thus eligible to be canceled. The technical issue has now been resolved, it added, with all tickers trading as normal.\n\nTraders who didn’t hop on a discounted Berkshire Hathaway stock but did buy heavily discounted shares in other brands will also be subject to having their trades struck off—with the ruling not eligible for appeal.\n\nOther tickers that were impacted include American restaurant chain Chipotle (CMG), mining company Barrack Gold Corporation (GOLD) and meme stock darling\" \\*redacted\\*. \n\n\\[Full Article\\](https://fortune.com/2024/06/04/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-discount-deals-canceled/)",
