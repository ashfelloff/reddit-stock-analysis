A lot of companies have shot up since then. Nvidia being one of the darlings. \n\nLet’s see if we can recreate another thread for speculation and fun for 2025\n\nI still think it is only a matter of time till Joby has its day. I am also bullish on Palantir long term.  Even holding since buying at $8 dollars.\n\nWhat companies do you think are in their infancy that may “pop? Let’s try to find the next 100 bagger!",

QXO… would I have loved to short the ever living shit out of this one except I wasn’t allowed to. I was laughing like hell when retail was crying on fintwit after being down 90% in 1 day when it was literally public information in their SEC filings. Anyway if you go long now, you’re likely to do well but watch out for another 50% dilution event. I’m personally not going long this but if you do, long term, you’ll likely multibag. \n\nOne of my future 100 baggers is COOP.
