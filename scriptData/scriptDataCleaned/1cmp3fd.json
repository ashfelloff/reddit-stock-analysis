  "score": 33,
  "selftext": "So as the title says, in the UK they still offer plenty of credit cards with c.£8k - £10k credit limits that have a 0% APR teaser period of 20-24 months. To avoid crashing my credit, I'll put every single expenditure I have on the credit card and funnel every penny of my wages to my S&P500 vanguard ETF account. Rinse and repeat this every month until I max out my credit card at which point I will apply for a new one and repeat the process.\n\nOnce I've maxed my credit limit I just wait until each credit card approaches the end of its teaser period at which point I will be unloading my ETF positions.\n\nIn a case of a down market, that's no problem either because at that point I can just apply for another credit card that offers an extended period on all balance transfers and I will just eat the c3% transfer fee because in the long-run, green arrow go up.\n\nIt's rather simplistic but I'm sure this has been successfully applied before here, so I'm asking for any tips from anyone's who's tried this sort of thing before.\n\nI'm aware this strategy ain't completely bomb proof but its either this or thinking of fun little ways of offing myself whilst I'm working in the office.\n\nCheers,\n\nBritBong\n\n  \n\\*EDIT grammar correction\\*",

The market can be down for longer than 2 years before it recovers. I know, crazy right? If that happens you have a bunch of cc debt that you need to pay off asap or your credit score plummets. That means you're living with mom and dad. \n\n2. Even if you do make money, the S&P only goes up about 10% a year on average. So if nothing goes wrong, you will only be up 20% after two years. The APR on a credit card is more than that. \n\n3. What if an emergency happens when you need money? You'll quite literally have no options if you get desperate.",
