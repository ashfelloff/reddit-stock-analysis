Since none of you guys seem to be saying this… this company is on the outs and I think it is beginning to come to form in their stock price. I believe that their attempts to branch out will just speed up their inevitable demise. I see brands like nike, adidas… hell even rebook and THE GAP have given consumers much more affordable cloths. Credit card debt is racking up and my wife’s boyfriend has started buying her… store brand. Makes her butt look just as awesome at 1/10 the price… that lucky duck. \nI’m holding not enough 295p for 6/7 exp… but enough to make me some monay! \nBut don’t listen to me I am 1/7 on ban bets and I placed a 3d 285 LULU bet \n\nEDIT: WOW. Your telling me this company has started making products and marketing them to heavy girls? I take back EVERYTHING. LONG on LULU baby. FAT CHICKS ARE IN. And they have to work, so they got that $$$ \nMay keep my pooters though ",
