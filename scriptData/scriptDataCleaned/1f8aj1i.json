  "score": 1403,
  "selftext": "The US Justice Department sent subpoenas to Nvidia Corp. and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant AI computing provider. \n\nThe DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide it with information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government probe a step closer to launching a formal complaint. \n\nAntitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don’t exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.",

So the only other way for competitors to get a chance is to lobby for regulators to do something while they try to find ways to catch up. Nobody has to win, Nvidia just has to lose. That was the same thing that happened when META, MSFT and GOOGL practically monopolized their fields initially, but look at where we are now.\n\nThe lawsuit will drag on for years to even decades(see DoJ+FTC v META lawsuit, DoJ v Google, DoJ v Microsoft, list goes on), maybe pay a few fines and then nobody's gonna care anymore. Any drop from such news are overreaction and people expecting an overreaction, then it'll recover once big players like the discount enough to re-enter then slap it on their quarterly report on how they made a quick sizable profit selling high, buying low, and selling high again.",

The first probe focuses on accusations of pushing customers to buy Nvidia products exclusively and potentially punishing those who have purchased products from competitors. The Department of Justice will also investigate Nvidia’s decision to charge higher prices to customers who also want to buy AI chips from rival companies.\n\n**The second investigation has to do with Nvidia’s acquisition of Israeli startup Run:ai. Nvidia purchased the AI workload orchestration company for $700 million in April 2024. Run:ai develops software that optimizes GPU usage by allowing multiple AI applications to run on the same GPU. This reduces the number of GPUs needed for AI projects, greatly reducing initial cost.**\n\nThe Department of Justice’s investigation is concerned that the acquisition would further entrench Nvidia’s dominant position and would bring about antitrust allegations. More specifically, the Department is investigating whether Nvidia acquired Run:ai to suppress a technology that could decrease demand for its GPUs.",
