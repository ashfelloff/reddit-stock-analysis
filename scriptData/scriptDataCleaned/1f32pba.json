  "selftext": "\n$30k in on this and August 27th’s press release makes me even more confident that NVIDIA is set to keep growing. If you missed it, check it out:\n\nhttps://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-global-partners-launch-nim-agent-blueprints-for-enterprises-to-make-their-own-ai\n\nHere’s why this might be relevant..\n\nNVIDIA’s earnings are out tomorrow, and this news is setting the stage. If these blueprints start catching on, NVDA could keep climbing. It’s a big deal if they play this right, we’re talking about a serious boost in demand for their hardware.\n\nThe easier NVIDIA makes it for businesses to jump into AI, the more we’ll see their revenue soar. It’s not just about the tech giants like GOOG and META; there are millions of other companies out there that, with the right tools, could go straight to NVIDIA and build their AI without needing to go through Azure or AWS.\n\nWhat’s your take? Anyone else bullish on NVDA?\n\nChime in if you want to discuss Aug 27th press release linked above more and broader NVIDIA Bull sentiment.",
