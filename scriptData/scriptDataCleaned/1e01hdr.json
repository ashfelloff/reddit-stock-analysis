  "selftext": "I bought Nvidia shares worth 100k in january 2021. Even back then, experts agreed that this stock had performed far too well. Since I like to play computergames and knew that Nvidia graphics cards were the absolute premium products, I thought that with Bitcoin mining and the digital transformation of the world, CPUs and GPUs would definitely be needed much more in the future than they were back then - so I bought the shares. In the meantime, I sold the shares before the penultimate quarterly results and bought the stock again right after - the taxes really hurt!\n\nIf I had listened to those experts back then, I wouldn't have bought the stock. I am glad to be surrounded by all those regarded people who don't give a f*ck about the opinion of experts - I love you!\n\nThank you, Jensen Huang, thank you WallStreetBets with all the regarded apes with diamond hands üöÄüíéüêí\n",

                          "body": "For individual investors yes. But it can be kind of a grey area. You pay 0% if you invest as a \"goede huisvader\". The problem with this term is that it‚Äôs really vague. \n\nThe capital gain on shares realized in the context of the normal management of private assets is generally not taxable(this is what they call goede huisvader princiepen). However, if the capital gain results from speculative transactions, it can be taxed at 33%. \n\nSo the problem sometimes can be to prove you didn‚Äôt buy a certain asset in a speculative matter. Lets say you buy a stock, with the intention of keeping it long term (normal asset management) and it moons the next week so you decide to sell. That means it‚Äôs taxable in the eyes of the government, even though you bought it with the intention to keep it long term, so if you don‚Äôt want to pay taxes on those gains you will have to trie to prove you bought it with the intention to keep it long term and didn‚Äôt speculate on short term gains.\n\n Crypto also falls in this grey area, because the government kind of sees those as speculative in itself, same with penny stocks, so you might have to explain that you make those investments in a non speculative matter.",
