I'm not even counting the fact that the 2023 NVDA historic revenue growth was coming off a very low 2022 base, and included all of the one-time AI chip purchases from every company joining the hype. The next additional revenue will be much harder to come by, because they must come from other companies that's not the megacap stocks, and those other companies have a lot less funds allocated for capex. NVDA is also a cyclical company highly dependent on capex investment cycles. You can see that in 2022 when every company was cutting cost and freezing capex, NVDA didn't fare so well.\n\nWhy you'd extrapolate that for the next 5-10 years I don't even know. Where exactly do you think the next 200-400 billions of ANNUAL revenues are coming from? Megacap companies make up about half of NVDA revenues. If these companies aren't growing in sales from AI, and very few of them are currently, eventually they slow down their capex on AI chips.\n\nThat's only assuming NVDA stock price and market cap stays the same. If it's going up 20% every quarter, like what you seem to assume, in a few years it's gonna dwarf all of the megacap companies market cap combined. How is it gonna do that, if its main customers are the megacap companies? It's easier to gain 20% when you're 500 billions market cap. Kinda harder now that you're worth almost 2500billions.",
