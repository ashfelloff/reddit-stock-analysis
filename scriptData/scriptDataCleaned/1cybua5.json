Trailing stops are smart but they should be based on something.  I personally like somewhere in the range of 10-15 percent trailing stop loss but sometimes use a hard stop loss and adjust as a stock rises and adjust based on points of support,  I also think it’s worth taking profits when a stock is way above the 200 day moving average (say around 100%). I also think it’s worth following the rsi at least to get a sense of the trend and if a new all time high is weaker than the last.  What I don’t think people should do is what I did when I sold my NVDA stock.  I got scared and sold based on really no reason.

It was trading $50 billion a day of stock for months. That’s about 8x the largest company in the world, Microsoft and peaked at over 100 million shares when it had a blow off top a few months ago. \n\nWill be interesting to see how this pans out.

      "body": "To be fair, Nvidia first got the whole crypto mining rush and now the AI rush. The only thing proprietary is CUDA. Don't get me wrong, this is a big thing. The lack of strong competition is intriguing. Guadi3 is the best alternative by far, but it's slow to get enough product into the channel. Still only AMD or Intel have a chance right now. AMD are only in second place because they have more available, but vastly inferior product. To put it another way, if Guadi3 was launched just 12 months ago, in quantity, there is a very good chance that Nvidia would be doing half as well. I'm not sure that there have been so many times in history where mere months separate winners from usurpers.",

From a risk perspective it's insane.  \nAs much as the CEO pushes Datacenter/AI/robot narrative, in the end they still only design chips, they do not make them.\n\nIt's not as easy to make AI semiconductor chips now as it was to smelt iron to make picks/shovels in 1850s or to make steel chassis/engines to compete with Ford in early 20th century.\n\nAny disruption to Taiwan's chip production capabilities (natural, political or military) will absolutely destroy Nvidia along with other fabless semiconductor manufacturers. That's why Warren Buffet sold all his stock in TSMC: the risk is too great.\n\nBut this warning really does not apply to r[/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), does it, NVDA to the moon I guess? :D",

And whether you describe the outputs of this technology as being the result of effective reasoning or not is an irrelevant (in the context of the market) philosophical position, in my opinion.\n\nThis intelligence has demonstrated the ability to be directed toward specific tasks, and it is able to solve those tasks better than the average human.\n\nAnd to be frank, the average human generally performs far below their actual potential.  So, an intelligence that doesn't require breaks, and whose outputs are comparable / better than the average person is a fundamental sea change for our species.\n\nI honestly feel bad for people like this, because not only are they going to lose a lot of money on these trades, but they are going to be blindsided by the inevitable societal changes that will result from this technology.\n\nOn one hand, I am making decent money from their ignorance.
