Never made an investment post before that. \n\nUnfortunately I don‚Äôt see any large leaps or improvements in hydrogen alternative for vehicles. If anyone else knows please let me know because I had a decent chunk in there but I let it go realizing there were a couple moderate companies working on research but it‚Äôs been a year and hybrids are taking the forefront right now, and people were coming onto the EV excitement too fast. Hydrogen fuel needs to be condensed with such a high level of energy and such strong containment and the transport it would be that much more difficult, first it would need some new improvement then it would need supporting infrastructure and companies lining up to get into ways of transporting and compressing and keeping it at the right temperature, and there‚Äôs just not enough car companies with good enough vehicles pushing the tech, and there‚Äôs already a continuously growing EV interest and fan base I just don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs room for it right now when you see all of the energy grid companies popping up, the investments in vast amounts of lithium and lithium mining, government funding and laws and regulations passing for electric vehicles/hybrid support with financial incentives. Making new waves is a bigger risk than jumping into an already excited field with all eyes on you.",
