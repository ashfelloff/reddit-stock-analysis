I'm really focusing on not being an idiot. So I try to buy it as soon as I can (or synthetic) so that as a result my OTMs are as cheap as possible. I do even hedge that off. \n\nI used to be a risk manager so that was my job. Where I could lose money (in the pay-out diagram) see downside exposure - and place trades there.\n\nSo straddle, (OTM put/call) - same goes for strangle and when it comes to earnings I add a calendar spread between the two earnings if the firm is in dire need of cash. But people generally don't like hearing that advice. Lol.",

              "body": "CDK is one of, if not the largest, software providers for car dealerships. They were hit with a ransomware attack at the end of q2 and totally shut down for two weeks or so. Some dealerships are completely reliant on their software, others only partially. It affected dealerships being able to calculate lease and loan deals, print documents, access leads and customer records, create repair estimates, register vehicles with the DMV. It was a nationwide impact and the top public traded dealer groups have cited it as a reason for lower earnings in q2.\n\nI think cars impact CPI. \n\nI’m a finance manager at a dealership, so I notice trends with the interest rates being offered by banks. BofA started offering rates about 1.5-2% lower than they had been a month prior, starting around the end of June. Chase caught on and started doing the same within a week of BofA, and then the smaller or more specialized lenders started to follow suit. These rates are being offered to super prime borrowers on well collateralized loans, basically risk free paper. This tells me that they all expect rates to drop significantly within the first 1/2 of the 5-6 year loan terms. It’s essentially a bond trade, and they’re trying to fatten up their portfolios and get a jump on the other banks. This isn’t too significant or unexpected, all the banks expect rates to drop. Side note- expect the rate being offered by dealers to consumers to lag what’s being offered at wholesale to the dealers by the lender. If the dealer suddenly has rates 1.5% lower than the month before, they will try to write the loan at the rates from the month before and make some extra profit.",
