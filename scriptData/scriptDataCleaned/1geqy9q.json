  "title": "How I loaned 40k CHF @ 0.6% APR",
  "score": 111,
  "selftext": "I just recently learned how to borrow money on margin with a box spread option strategy. However, I only saw discussions about borrowing USD through SPX options. So I wondered if I could do the same with a lower interest currency - CHF. Well, I did it!\n\nI used options on Swiss market index (SMI) expiring Sep 18 2025 (324 DTE) with strikes of 10000 and 14000. The exact strikes don't matter, what matters is the difference between them - 4000 points equaling 40k CHF.\n\nOn IBKR the order looks like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/du0mqkwb1oxd1.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=60c37e45bcff4841110831c550a2e9e874d8292a\n\nI wanted to see the best rate I can get, so I started with the price -4000, and gradually increased it. My order got quickly filled at -3980. That means I got +39,800 CHF in cash, and have to pay back 40,000 CHF at expiration. My total interest is fixed at 200 CHF - 0.5% to expiration or 0.6% annualised. Previously I was paying 2.363% margin interest on CHF to IBKR, so over the year I will save 1.763% or 700 CHF.\n\nImportant to keep in mind:\n\n1. This only works with European-style options (cannot be exercised early).\n2. Be careful about entering the price. One small mistake, like not adding a minus sign, can result in a huge loss.",
