  "score": 222,
  "selftext": "Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares tumbled Tuesday as the defense contractor missed revenue estimates on a drop in aerospace sales.\n\nThe company reported third-quarter revenue rose 1% year-over-year to $17.10 billion, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for $17.38 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) of $6.80 exceeded forecasts.\n\nLockheed's Aeronautics unit sales declined 3% to $6.49 billion, primarily because of delays in contractual authorization and funding for the F-35 fighter jet. Sales at its Space division were down less than 1% to $3.08 billion. Missiles and Fire Control segment revenue jumped 8% to $3.18 billion, and Rotary and Mission Systems unit revenue was 6% higher at $4.37 billion.\n\nThe company raised its full-year EPS outlook to $26.65 from a range of $26.10 to $26.60, and narrowed its revenue outlook to $71.25 billion from the previous $70.50 billion to $71.50 billion. \n\nShares of Lockheed Martin hit an all-time high yesterday, and even with today's roughly 5% declines they're up nearly 30% year-to-date.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/lockheed-martin-stock-sinks-as-f-35-sales-decline-weighs-on-revenue-8732059",

              "body": "True, but it may be a tough time to find any other opportunity to jump into this stock again. Earlier this year I was debating if i wanted to start a position at 450 but the stock was at 460 so i was hoping for a small dip. Then within a week it jumped up to 550 and rose steadily since then. I don’t know the next time this stock will dip again so this current dip has me curious again to start a position (still kicking myself for not entering at 460!). \n\nI doubt I’ll actually do it since this dip isn’t that big, but the “it was this price 3 weeks ago” holds little bearing in this market where there is a chance we never see this price again as it seems like LMT just continuously grows anytime there is any international conflict (which is a lot currently). In a normal market, sure, but we haven’t been living in a normal market for a while now and LMT seems to be growing nonstop",
