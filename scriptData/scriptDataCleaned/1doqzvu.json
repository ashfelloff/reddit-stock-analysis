  "selftext": "This sort of post/story isn’t new to most people in this sub, but here you go:\n\nStarted options trading approximately five years ago. I was watching my Roth, personal brokerage account, and 401k from work slowly go up. I got bored. So fucking bored. That’s kind of why we are all here, right? That and to get rich or whatever. Anyway.  Ended up blowing a few options accounts (luckily didn’t touch the 401k or Roth). Made some good money along the way, but not enough. Always wanted MOAR. Still do. \n\nAfter seeing my options gains slowly dwindle, and realizing that I was being too impulsive, I slowed down.\n\nIf you have a regular job that brings in income and aren’t relying on trading for your day-to-day expenses, this approach to options might help you to NOT LOSE money. If you’re looking to get rich quick and you’re unemployed - probs not for you.  \n\n1. Don’t put money in your options trading account unless it’s down to zero. You’ll just end up with less money. There’s always a play, even with fifty bucks. \n2. Always withdraw when you can, and put it in your savings account. Play with house money. Unless you really want to full-time day trade, you don’t need that 25k in there. You might make more mistakes (I do, at least) when you feel like you’re “up.”\n3. If you float around the ~5 to 10k amount, only buy one or two options contracts at a time. You’ll miss out on some huge gains, but you’ll not have huge losses. And along the way, in my experience, you can net $500 + a week. It seems so small compared to the gain porn posts on here, but when you withdraw that shit - nah. \n4. When you DO want to make a big play - have all your day trades available. \n5. If you can, pull some of the amounts you transfer from your brokerage to your bank out in CASH. There is something about it that helps you to remember that, yes - it is REAL money. \n6. Don’t tell anyone about it. \n7. Enjoy the casino with less stress, and more money in day-to-day life. \n\nDisclaimer: I only follow these rules about 50% of the time. My willpower can’t fully embrace them, especially if I’m intoxicated. But they do work. ",

But that doesn't mean you can't make reasonable assumptions and make money off them. NVDA the last week or so is a solid example. Everyone knew it was going to correct. Buying puts when it downturned from $140 would have been a solid bet.\n\nThe problem people have with options is they want their bags filled, so they hold onto shit way too long. There was a guy in here a week or so ago showing his losses. Thing is he was right numerous times, the chart made it crystal clear he made good plays, but he wanted that bag so he just held it while everyone else came and took the money out of it. ~$60k, or whatever it was, worth of losses later, he's got 500 and a dream. Instead of being up 30-40%, or however much it would have been.\n\nMuch like poker and blackjack, knowing when to pack it up and walk away with money is a big part of it. Can you beat the market? Maybe, maybe not. It's a mix of luck, having a good strategy, and being able to reasonably make predictions based on trends. But just like blackjack, sometimes the dealer pulls a 5 on 16 and you're just SoL.",

      "body": "Here are my tips:\n\n-If you don't want to watch the stock market at all, put some of your portfolio the s&p and some large low volatility tech stocks like Google and Microsoft. These should have a PE around 30 and around 10-30% annual growth.\n\n-If you want to trade riskier stocks with a relatively high PE for the sector, make sure they have a high growth rate and decent analyst estimates.\n\n-If you are bullish on AI like me and want to hedge against AI taking your job but semiconductors. I am strictly sticking to NVDA and TSM. While NVDA may be slightly overvalued, its competitors are far behind and a bubble could easily form, just be careful to sell when the bubble breaks (e.g. sell if it drops by 20%). \n\n-Do not trade emotionally or try to time the market because you missed an opportunity, the opportunity may still be worth it. Try to evaluate the investment objectively.\n\n-Do not buy random penny stocks  even if they have grown noticeably or someone says they know it will go up.\n\n-Only buy meme stocks like gamestop if you are confident and have a feel for the market. This is difficult to really explain but watch how a stock moves and you get an idea of resistance levels and when they are being broken and where to set your stop loss below resistance levels.\n\n-Do not mess with options unless you truly understand them and if you do, set a stop loss that is both conservative enough that you're not risking too much and liberal enough that the stock's typical volatility doesn't trigger it. This also applies to holding stock but on a longer term scale.\n\n-Try not to focus too much on the market and missed opportunities. Just be glad you are making money.\n\n-Stay away from shorts, the market can stay irrational for longer than you can stay solvent\n\n-Don't try to catch falling knives (stocks that have dropped 5% within a day). Just wait until the stock has recovered at least 3%.",

It’s indirect method to profit from theta - when premiums on puts drop, VXX drops + contango adds as additional gravity that pulls their prices down even more.\n\nVXX and UVXY have to do reverse stock splits almost every year because the prices of these ETN always drop. When UVXY hits $4 it will turn into $40. When VXX hits about $10 they’ll do a 4:1 reverse stock split and it will trade around $40.\n\nPS: for deltas, I start buying in VXX puts when it strays at least $0.50 above recent all time low. I sell them when it returns on the all time low. If it keeps rising - I buy contracts with each $0.50 rise above my prior buy point.

If I make a trade, I make it on margin and then immediately deposit the funds.   \n\nThe other thing I do is this, which I find really helps a lot.  I'm kinda like you all I guess, I want to get rich and boring returns are boring.  But I also don't want to get poor.  So I take around 90% of my total portfolio, taxable and not, and invest those in boring stuff.  My 401k is completely boring.  \n\nMost of the 10% that is available for speculative investing is invested in individual stocks.  That leaves me with maybe 1% to play around with options.  When I do buy options, I buy 1 or 2 contracts.  I haven't bought options in a while but lately I've been buying some calls on stocks I own that I might actually exercise instead of sell (assuming they end ITM).  \n\nIf you're only gambling with 1 or 2% you really can't have a 'guh' type of moment.",
