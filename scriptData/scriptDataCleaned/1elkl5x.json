Currently trying to post Pt 3 but running into issues that require mod attention. Regardless huge gains today and looking forward to earnings call tonight.\n\nRegarding my call options I sold those for 140% profit last week, and wish I held cause they would have been massive gains today. Regardless profit is profit looking forward to seeing these shares skyrocket more.",

They now have a family of lucrative partnerships, debt restructured, AI buzz, and could (fingers crossed) actually post a positive earnings tonight which would outpace my most aggressive estimates.  That 5 billion in AI partnerships announced yesterday has some of their microsoft stuff baked in, but I'm hopeful this is just the beginning.  The sell internet connectivity at the provider level.
