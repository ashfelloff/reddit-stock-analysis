Otherwise it wouldn’t be called Beta or attended. So for all intents and purposes it is level 2 autonomy. Because that’s all it can do reliably. Level 2 is adaptive cruise control. \n\nTesla is trying to do automation with almost none of the hardware that other automation providers discovered was necessary in their testing. \n\nThe cameras on current models of Tesla vehicles are not reliable enough to support level 4 or 5 autonomy. They can get blinded by glare, particulates, birds, etc. that is why other automation providers use LiDAR and Radar. Because you need redundancy to be safe and reliable.\n\nVision only is not going to happen anytime in the next 10 years. Probably not even the next 25 years. AI isn’t going to fix the problem of cameras being extremely unreliable in a multitude of everyday driving situations. Future cameras may be better, but not a single Tesla that exists today has cameras that can do level 5 autonomy safely in every common driving condition. So none of those will ever be robo-taxis. \n\nTesla has a long long way to go before they are approaching even level 4 autonomy.\n\nA high school robotics team can make a car drive itself with a camera.
