The next day you wake up with a pounding headache with only 30 minutes to be in a meeting you're 35 minutes away from. But it's not actually a meeting. It's just you sitting in a room with the lackies who took you out the night before. You just sit there and wait until one of them leaves and comes back with the bad news. The higher up you're suppose to meet is dealing with an urgent issue and he can't meet with you at the moment. And all of it's just a clever ruse to make a worse deal for your company.",
