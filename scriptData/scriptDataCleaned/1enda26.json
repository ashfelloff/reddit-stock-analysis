      "body": "We still don’t seem to have a truly objective definition. Closest is 2-consecutive quarters of GDP decline. That would mean that this current quarter is negative as is Q4. Q2 was 2.8% and Q3 estimate is 2.9%. Sure, might have softened and miss a bit. But very unlikely it swings negative.\n\nBtw… all that talk of recession couple years ago  and we actually did have 2 consecutive quarters of decline Q1 22 and Q2 22. But people were like… oh, but this doesn’t count as recession because unemployment is so low.\n\nIn my mind, we already had our recession in 2022 :)",
