  "selftext": "**TL/DR $ASTS is a volatile stock that popped and then dropped, and is likely to do that again.**\n\nüìàüìàüìâüîÇ\n\nFollowing a formal agreement with AT&T AST SpaceMobile shares rose rapidly with ~ +100% to then give back almost half.\n\n Short interest did not change much. From around 40.8 Mn shares shorted 05/17 to 37.4 shares shorted 05/23.\n\nThe agreement was significant news to the company and the reaction came with a record volume traded. Sharp increase of SP yet most shorts are still there.\n\nThere are a few more **catalysts** that are about the same size remaining:\n\n‚Ä¢ **First Net** formal agreement.\n\n‚Ä¢ Delivery of the first **5 satellites** to Space-X.\n\n‚Ä¢ **EXIM** financing\n\n‚Ä¢ Delivery & testing of **ASICs chips** from TSMC for the next gen sats.\n\n‚Ä¢ Regulatory clearance from the FCC for **US market access.**\n\n‚Ä¢ News of the test results through **Fairwinds DoD contract**.\n\n‚Ä¢ Converting some of the rest of the 49 MoUs with Mobile Network Operators into pre-paid **formal agreements** like the AT&T deal.\n\n‚Ä¢ Rural **5G fund** grant.\n\nIf some/any of these catalysts materialize the short interest is pretty much intact near record levels and a similar spike and cool-off is likely to occur again like the one we just saw.\n\nThere are also technological and businessmodel aspects to $ASTS worth discussing. But right now the market shys from that subject and focuses on funding and execution risks. And so I will not go into those aspects. I did some DD and they‚Äôre good, there, imo. üõ∞Ô∏è=üí∞\n\nThe main focus - and the shorts thesis - are on funding and execution risks at the moment.  And catalysts are stacking up to disprove those fears.\n\n**AT&T and Google** are the latest strategic investors. **American Tower**, **Vodafone** and **Bell Canada** are onboard since long. **Nokia** provides the cellular base-station.\n\nDisclosure: Holding 77,777 shares.\nNo options.\n\nI am just a **Cat** not a financial advisor.\n\nüêà‚Äç‚¨õ ‚â†üë®‚Äçüè´\n",

So the spectrum holdings of Verizon and AT&T are spatially complementary and solves a regulatory and a coverage issue.\n\nA win-win-win deal.\n\nAlso with First-Net spectrum, Verizon has adjacent spectrum there that is adjacent to AT&T spectrum and so this adds up to large continous chunks of lowband spectrum.\n\nThe way cellphones currently work they can‚Äôt carrier aggregate slivers of lowband but they can use single continous wide chunks of spectrum.\n\nAnd so this partnership will allow a much better user experience a better quality of service and true broadband speeds.\n\nNo one else comes close.\n\nIn a way it is yet another confirnation from a major player they belive in the tech.\n\nAnd then there is the funding risk / dillution fear that this deal obliterates. They bring USD 100 Mn to the table.\nThat buys a lot of very profitable satellites.\n\nIn the US American Towers will build the gateway sites for AST. AST will lease them. This terrestrial infrastructure needs not to be duplicated to serve both carriers. The only thing doubling is the revenue stream for AST. Not the costs.",

Company burns about 40M per quarter in operations and has no revenue in the last 15 months. \n\nThe 100M from Verizon is 65M in commercial prepayments (I am guessing this is revenue) and 35M in convertible notes (senior equity, both dilutive and ahead of common in liquidation). The partnership extends runway about 1.5 quarters. Without additional revenue, the company will keep issuing stock for cash, probably in a year to 18 months. \n\nVerizon contract is a good step for the company for sure. But in terms of long plays it's far from a sure thing. Keep in mind it was a SPAC, so maybe not the most ready for the public markets (i.e. too young) during its volatile early days. \n\nThis is venture investing, not a mature public company.

That scenario became a whole lot more likely today.\n\nI‚Äôm just a cat.\n\nI did help Kook do the math on Block2 throughput, though, check his X acc for the in depth DD threads.\nHe‚Äôs a finance guy, a pro, so he did the rest. I just added insights about utilisation rates, processing bandwidth and that sort of things.\n\nOnly valuation I ever did entirely myself was a Net Present Value sensitivity analysis (discounted cash flow) on the projected cash flow from original investor presentation.\n\nArrived at a current valuation of 18 Bn USD if they pulled of 10% of the projected free cash flow. Market cap is a bit above 1 Bn so.. it should at least 10x as it becomes derisked and 10% of customers sign up. Used a 12% rate to discount that.\n\nWe are fast approaching that. AST has around 3 Billion end customers under MoU With 48 MNOs on global basis. A couple of hundred million ARPU customers of AT&T and Verizon went from possible to secured customers. It is ‚Äùjust‚Äù at 2 out of 50 MNOs that turned their MoUs into binding agreements so far, so that is just 4% of the MNOs, but it is big MNOs with many subs and  it is US end users so I think they have secured close to 10% of market value at this point. Likely more.\n\nThe stock market just needs to realize that fact.\n\nDo the math.\n\nWith that net present value sensitivity analysis you can choose your own discount rate and your own percentage you find likely that they will pull of of their originally Investor presentation and the table will tell you the valuation / fair market cap.\n\nTakeway is that this stock will more than 10x easily upon derisking events that will do two things: make ppl use a lower rate when discounting the cash flows AND use a higher % of projected future cash flows when they do that. \n\nSo it has an explosive upside to it as it derisks.",
