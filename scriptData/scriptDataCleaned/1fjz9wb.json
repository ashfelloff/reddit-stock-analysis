Not enough home builders, supply chain crunches (yes, still), and a set of builders who are extremely risk adverse after watching.all of their friends go bankrupt in 08-10. Let's say you created a nationwide, 100k per new build housing incentive for anyone who builds a home (won't happen and would create a bunch of problems but bear with me). Even with a Goldilocks spree of homebuilding, it would take probably a decade or longer to get supply to a place where upward price pressure eased. The fed can't tank the whole economy with high interest rates waiting for builders to swing hammers. Thus, home prices will climb. ",

Here we have developers and builders who could bust out at any minute, but getting approval from the several levels of bureaucracy necessary to open up more land to housing is like pissing in the wind.\n\nAnd even if you get some place to build, the several levels of bureaucracy necessary to get individual builds approved, especially on spec when no individual owner cares enough to run around city hall, is enough of a hassle to ensure that only mini-mansions are worth the time investment.\n\nThis is a regulatory problem, not a market problem.
