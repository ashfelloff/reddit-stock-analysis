  "title": "Forget the Kelly Criterion: YOLO Everything",

  "selftext": "Who has time for caution? Why waste precious moonshot opportunities by only betting 10% of your portfolio when you can go all in and ride the rocket? Sure, the Kelly Criterion might give you some mathematical comfort, but let’s be real, this isn’t a spreadsheet simulation. This is the wild west of Wall Street, and you don’t get ahead by hedging bets and taking “sensible” risks.\n\n\n\nHonestly, if you’re only betting 10% on that once-in-a-lifetime trade, you might as well not even bother. The whole point is to make generational wealth, not crawl your way to modest gains. 10% gains? Enviable gains? Nah, we're talking about flipping entire portfolios here. You’re not in this for a “sensible capital allocation” you’re in this to YOLO it all and come out on top.\n\nAnd yeah, I hear the caution about that 1% scenario where you lose everything. Guess what? That’s the game. This isn’t some safety net strategy for the faint-hearted. Go big, or go home. If you’re gonna play Russian Roulette, don’t worry about how many barrels are in the revolver just pull the damn trigger. If you're worried about a \"pending recession,\" then you’re already losing.\n\n\n\nYou know what’s even worse than losing? Watching something moon while you sit on the sidelines clutching your Kelly Criterion spreadsheet, kicking yourself for not going all in. Because when your bets don’t land, you’ll be just as broke whether you risked 10% or 100%, so might as well swing for the fences.\n\nIf you’re really that scared of losing, you’re not built for this game. But if you’re here to make the history books, it’s time to put it all on the line. Don’t Google “Kelly Criterion.” Google “how to live like a legend.”\n\n",
