  "title": "UPDATE: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stock and rebalanced anytime a new stock took its place? PART 2",
  "score": 1315,
  "selftext": "Okay, so my last post got a good amount of comments.\n\n If I’m doing this right, from 1994 to 2023 this strategy averaged 22% in an extreme scenario in which you had to rebalance every year. \n\nHowever, as mentioned in the previous post, on average the rebalancing (selling 100% of the previous highest market cap stock and then buying with 100% of my portfolio the new highest market cap stock) occurred every 2.9 years. \n\nBut what if we were to extend the back test to more than just 30 years? Here’s part 2 of this strategy: 1981-1994. This is how far back I could go, I couldn’t find yearly returns of stocks listed in the previous years. \n\nAgain, this strategy will ONLY be applied to USA companies as so will the strategy. \n\nResults: from 1981 to half of 1988 the highest market cap was IBM. The returns during those years would have been: -16.19% in 1981; +69.22% in 1982; +26.75% in 1983; +0.92% in 1984; +26.30% in 1985; -22.83% in 1986; -2.89% in 1987 and +4.5% in half of 1988. \n\nThen XOM became the biggest market cap halfway through the year of 1988 and kept its dominance until the end of 1991. The returns would have been the following: +10% in half of 1988; +19.63% in 1989; +8.85% in 1990 and +23.30% in 1991. \n\nAt the very start of 1992, GE became the highest market cap stock and it held its dominance throughout 1994. The returns would have been: +15.10% in 1992; +26.04% in 1993 and +0.21% in 1994. \n\nThat leads us to an average pre tax return rate of 26.9%. With taxes, applied on the average of rebalancement during these years, which was 1 rebalancement every 2.14 years (in the calculations I considered every 2 years) we get an average after tax annual return rate of 21.27%. \n\n\nBut how was the market doing during these times? From 1988 to 1994 the s&p 500 averaged an annual return rate of 13.5%.  The total backtest (part 1 and part 2) proves this strategy would have on average returned twice as much as the s&p 500 over the course of the last 37 years. \n\n\nPLEASE ALSO NOTE THAT IM NOT CURRENTLY USING THIS STRATEGY AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU IF NOT PROPERLY STUDIED BY EXPERTS.\n\nPLEASE DONT JUST RANDOMLY START USING THIS STRATEGY ",

                      "body": "Arithmetic mean gives you the wrong answer. Geometric mean is what you want.\n\nImagine you have a year that gives you +100% (2x) followed by a year that gives you +200% (3x). Starting with $100, that means you had $200 by EOY 1 and $600 EOY2. Arithmetic mean gives you +150% (2.5x) on average, which implies you should have 100 * 2.5 * 2.5 = $625. Geometric mean gives you +145% (√(2 * 3) = 2.45x) per year, which implies you should have 100 * 2.45 * 2.45 = $600 (with some rounding error) at the end of the two years.\n\nUpdate: looking at the raw data given for 1981-1994, the total return for OP's strategy over those 14 years is +360.7% (4.607x). The geometric mean of that is 1.115x, or +11.5% per year, which is less than the post's stated +13.5% annual return for the S&P between 1988-1994. Not sure where that number came from, but if that's the stated number from some authoritative source, then the backtest shows that this strategy loses to the index. If OP calculated that number using arithmetic mean, then we'd need to know the actual yearly returns to make a reasonable comparison. Someone else can dig up that data and do that math though.",

              "body": "If top MC position is achieved not by stock B surpassing stock A gradually, but rather stock A gradually falling down from its top and going below it's competitor B. And if it repeats enough times , then you will lose all your gains every time due to buy high sell low and gradually diminish your capital too !! Eg let's say AAPL at 2T today  and NVDA at 1.9T. And you start your strategy today buying AAPL. . It goes to 2.1 T tomorrow. Good you gained on paper. And NVDA follows closely and grows to 2T. Good so far. On 3rd day AAPL falls down to 1.9 and NVDA stays at 2T. You sell AAPL and make a loss as 0.1T net loss (from day 1) in their MktCap would be a net drop in share price too and hence corresponding loss inyour investment. Now you buy NVDA on day 3 when it is at 2T MktCap. Day 4 it goes up to 2.1T, AAPL catches back to 2T. Day 5 NVDA drips to 1.9T.... you sell NVDA and buy AAPL again making loss.... Rinse and repeat.....you see where this is going.... You will end up buying high ... riding higher but not booking the profit... sliding lower and selling and booking loss. Doesn't have to be just these two tickets jostling for top 1 and 2. It can be any two and your strategy degrades to buy high..sell low !!! You are only accounting for the general scenario that top mkt cap gets created by someone always beating current topper and all toppers always moving up and up. That's not reality. Toppers rise and fall and their mkt cap is gobbled up by other rising large caps (and small caps).",
