The real exposure is only the net difference in PV of cash flows between the floating and fixed (except in the case of default, but even then you are not then required to keep making your side of the payments if the other party is in default)",

The \"market\" you talk about is the S&P 500 or any index. if the S&P 500 only goes up, it's because it kicks out companies when their cap is too low and takes in companies whose cap became big enough.  \nYou could say that if they manage to find new companies to get in it's because the economy is growing...maybe...or maybe not. PER average is currently quite high, sure the growing economy is a factor.\nSo people don't sell? Well they sell otherwise the price would not move because it's fixed by the demand. It's not the economy, it's the demand FOR THE STOCK that creates the pump. So now, you no longer need to actually build something, you need to create the demand for the stock while keeping the offer low. But sure the economy is growing. How could it not be growing when we invest so much in technology development? It's actually a pity how many companies fail completely because their product was shit.\nIn addition, maybe correct it for the inflation.\nIn addition, a long term trend of 50 years might be broken o'ce all the boomers die. Hopefully the market will open to new users...Because the population is also growing.\nAll in all, what I mean is that Indexes grow, but if you pick up stocks, they might all go to 0.\n\nOh, and I forgot.
