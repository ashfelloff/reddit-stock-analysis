  "score": 95,
  "selftext": "Occidental Petroleum Corporation (OXY) is currently trading near its 52 week low.  OXY is driven in large part by the broader softness in oil prices. Historically, the stock price of OXY has been highly correlated with fluctuations in the price of crude oil, and it appears the company is undervalued in relation to both its assets and potential future earnings.\n\nOver the past two years, every time the price of oil has approached $65 per barrel on the WTI Crude oil , it has marked a significant bottom for both crude oil prices and OXY's stock price. Given the cyclical nature of the oil market and the company's strong fundamentals, OXY's current valuation represents an attractive entry point, with considerable upside potential as the oil market stabilizes and eventually recovers.\n\n\nHistorically, OXY has seen strong price recoveries whenever oil prices have tested this level multiple times, and each time, prices rebounded as demand fundamentals improved or geopolitical factors led to tightening supply.\n\nCurrently, oil prices are once again nearing this critical $65 level, which suggests that the downside risk for OXY may be limited. With global demand for oil still robust, and supply potentially constrained by geopolitical tensions or production cuts from OPEC, there is a reasonable expectation that oil prices will stabilize or rise in the medium term. This would provide a tailwind for Occidental's stock price, as the company benefits directly from higher oil prices through increased revenues and profitability.\n\n**OXY is Undervalued**\n\nIn terms of valuation, OXY is currently trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio that is below its historical average and lower than many of its peers in the energy sector. This undervaluation is evident when comparing the company’s market capitalization to its assets and earnings potential. Occidental’s massive oil and gas reserves, along with its investments in sustainable energy technologies, make it one of the better-positioned companies to weather fluctuations in the energy market.\n\nMoreover, Occidental has significantly improved its financial position in recent years. The company’s aggressive debt reduction program has strengthened its balance sheet, making it less vulnerable to swings in oil prices. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway remains a major shareholder in OXY, having increased its stake in the company over the past two years. This signals strong institutional confidence in Occidental's long-term prospects, adding credibility to the view that the stock is currently\n\nOccidental is not just about oil production; it is about hedging against tech stock that are overvalued right now\n\nTo summarize :\n\nOccidental Petroleum is trading near its 52-week low, largely driven by oil price weakness. With oil approaching the $65 per barrel mark, historically a bottom for both crude prices and OXY stock, the current situation presents an opportunity for long-term investors. Given its undervaluation relative to earnings potential, strong balance sheet, and strategic positioning in both traditional oil production and sustainable energy technologies, OXY represents a strong buy at its current levels. The company’s operational resilience, coupled with the likelihood of oil price recovery, provides significant upside potential for investors looking for value in the energy sector.\n\nEdit : 82 contract of 15 November 2024 55 strike call\n\nWith 1610 share",
