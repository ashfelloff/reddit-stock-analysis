After hours trading is not on an exchange, this is strictly peer to peer trading...\n\n**How After-hours trading Works**\n\nAfter-hours trading in the U.S. stock market refers to the buying and selling of securities outside the standard trading hours of 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time. This trading occurs from 4:01 PM to 8:00 PM Eastern Time, and is conducted through **electronic communication networks (ECNs).**\n\n* **Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs):** Trades are executed through ECNs, which match buy and sell orders electronically.\n* Extended Hours: The after-hours session starts at 4:01 PM and can go until 8:00 PM, though activity typically decreases significantly after the first couple of hours.\n* Price Volatility: Prices can be more volatile due to lower trading volumes and fewer participants compared to regular trading hours.\n\n**Primary Participants:**\n\n* Institutional Investors: Large financial institutions often trade after hours to react to news or events that occur outside regular market hours.\n* Market Makers: These entities provide liquidity by being ready to buy and sell securities at any time, helping to facilitate smoother trading.\n\n**Reasons for Non-Execution:**\n\n* Order Restrictions: Most brokers have restrictions on which types of orders can be executed after hours. For example, they might not allow certain limit orders to be filled outside regular trading hours.\n* ECN Limitations: ECNs match buy and sell orders that occur after hours, only active participants in after-hours trading get their orders matched and filled. ECNs do not support all types of orders or securities during after-hours trading, which will prevent execution of open orders from nonparticipants during after-hours trading.\n\n¬†",
