Besides that, there are plenty of unfilled gap fills stemming all the way down to $43. These gap fills will drag down TSLA until they are closed. In addition, TSLA puts for October are seeing more interest than this week per earnings. Weekly puts reached a high of at most 25,000 per one contract. Oct 18 puts are at an astounding 45,000! Not to mention Elon is now making fun of the CCP. As Elon ingests more and more ketamine, he will begin making profound statements that will only hurt Tesla.
