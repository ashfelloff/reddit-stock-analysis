So I set a Trailing Stop Loss as a **-**.20 on price or **-**20 on steps. Then ride the trade. I can close on my own, or let it ride up, till it reverses to a negative 20 after appreciation. \n\nSo for instance that 538p I bought for 150 gets to 180, and drops -20 to 160, the trailing stop loss would fire and lock in 10 bucks of profit, if I let it take care of itself. Or lets say that the trade goes immediately against me the trailing stop loss would not have moved up with price, and goes to 130, I would have been out 20 bucks. Or you let it ride, and it never pulls back more than 20 bucks on it's way up, you could be looking at it getting to 250, and you can let it ride, it would pull back to 230 and close, locking in 80  bucks, or you can close manually at 250, and lock in 100.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
