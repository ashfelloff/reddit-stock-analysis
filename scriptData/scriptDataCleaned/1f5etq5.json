      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nr/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.\n\nTo keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.\n\nWe try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. \n\nThis is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:\n\n* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. \"What app should I use?\", \"What should I invest in?\". \n\n* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, \"inverse cramer\" joke again. \n\n* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. \n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

      "body": "You have to understand the saying \"The market can be irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\"  \nTechnically, if everyone plays until they can no longer play, then 100% would be bankrupt.  \nBut, if you stop playing at some point when you're up, then that's a point where you've technically won.\n\nIn a way, the 1\\~2% says that's the number of gamblers who walk away with profits given the number of times they tried to roll for a win. They keep rolling and rolling each time probability working against them (since you're more likely to bet wrong due to the Nth dimensionality of the problem space, you're constantly risking and fighting). If you never walk away, you WILL be destroyed at infinite time.\n\nI've been trading for 17 years now. That's quite a clock. On one hand, maybe I could have bought and hold and do just as well, but then what do I buy? I've been hugely up several times, and I was sitting on massive amounts of NVDA and other good stocks at one point. I just sold too early.\n\nIt's important to keep metrics. Right now, over 17 years, I'm outperforming the market, barely. But not this year. I often outperform the market a bit that year, and then I stop for the whole year, but this year, I decided that I was going to run some experiments, and that's been hugely unsuccessful. The reason that I decided to run new experiments this year is because I ran a set of experiments last year, and hit something really big, so my brain is stuck on winner's high and the endorphins are telling me that I can scale this. The data says that it didn't work, so I'm back to the drawing board. Which is why now that I'm down, I have to force myself to go back to slow playing.\n\nIf I keep going, I'm going to be destroyed, if I keep gambling the experiments all the time. Which is why I don't. I farm up, then set aside a portion that I can part with for experiments, then I run those experiments and burn the money. I have to be in a place in life where I can burn this kind of cash at a chance to jump that next step.\n\nWhy do I think that I can jump that next step?  \nWell, logically, we only stabilize at the level that our knowledge is meant to sustain that. Otherwise known as, \"A fool and his gold will soon part.\" I will only own as much asset as my foolishness allows me to sustain.\n\nI'm constantly experimenting in order to learn what is foolish and never touch or do that again.\n\nI'm constantly learning in order to produce more than I consume (in use and in losses to other people).\n\nI need to survive my learning.\n\nI need to learn before I get too old to know the difference and I have to cut myself off of my own ability to blow up my assets when I'm old and my brain isn't as fast as it is now and much more foolish.\n\nOne day, I suspect I will be susceptible to telemarketers and scammers, I hope that my money will be placed into trustworthy hands by that time.\n\n1\\~2% is actually kinda fortunate if you think about it.\n\nLife has 100% chance mortality rate.  \nIntelligent life in this galaxy seems like less than 0.00000000....1% (observable)\n\nEntropy is trying to kill us everyday.\n\nSome of us, live long enough to escape the dice rolls and pass something on before one dice gets us.  \n1\\~2% traders is actually smart enough to walk away with the money or come up with some system to sustain their constant foolishness.\n\nDiversification is your bulletproof armor, so maintain enough armor to survive months, years, then decades.",

Stop expecting to become a millionaire overnight by buying one option. Test your theory, try it out with insignificant numbers, and then trade those same percentages onward.  It's like buying a lottery ticket - if you happen to somehow \"read\" tomorrows numbers and miraculously wager bets perfectly you may see huge rewards.
