Most executions are usually pennies saved but it adds up over larger orders or frequent trading. In trade Fidelity does take a very small commission on some types of sell orders but more often than not the execution algo they use wins you and the house money. Robinhood and others very likely do the same method, but take the differences.",

      "body": "I thought the chart was interesting because my experience at least between RH and Fidelity have been very different.\n\nAlthough this doesn’t cover commissions I find the $0.03 fee from RH minor. In comparison a lot of my trades in Fidelity cost $6.50.\n\nWhat I have found is that Fidelity ALWAYS executes my stop loss lower than I set it. Which yeah volatility of the market whatever but I have tested this out. Say an option is $3.00, I set a stop loss for $2.75, then I go into RH and on my watchlist is the same option. I watch it go to $2.80, $2.79, $2.76, then as it turns to $2.75 I get an alert from Fidelity saying my contracts closed at….$2.72. $3 a fucking contract. While the whole time I never saw the value drop below $2.75 on Robinhood.\n\nI set up stop losses for profit taking and I find it consistently burns me no shock there. Even on RH it will have a tendency to sniff them out but seldomly do I see any deviation from my stop loss price. Very rarely will see the contract sale fill for my price on Fidelity.\n\nMaybe RH prices are worse than Fidelity but wouldn’t that be good for selling then too? \n\nPersonally I love the UI and how quickly it updates. Fidelity is super slow and its interface could really use some help. My own fault but even the color coding of green for call red for put on RH is super informative and yes I’ve bought the wrong one in Fidelity multiple times (ex: buying calls when I thought I was buying puts)",
