          "body": "I think some of it is macroeconomics. They had a push to $8 last summer and were holding $5+ for a while, but they’re a negative net income company with a large R&D budget so they’ve been affected by interest rates. Small caps are in rough shape generally. Plus, they have some delays with Neutron and issued a $300M senior convertible note. I don’t think there’s any terrible news, but they don’t deserve a premium until they get Neutron to the pad or report profitability. You have to be optimistic about their performance in the 2025-2027 timeframe to buy this stock.",

Short interest has jumped to 19% in latest report, up from 9% at FYE 23.\n\nOther than that, I dont see what anyone else sees if theyre shorting RKLB. The US govt is paying huge premiums to foster a relationship with RKLB. RKLB was invited to build their pads on Wallops, a very exclusive club. Former US military littered on the RKLB board. the US govt has the deepest pockets in the world.\n\nTheyre about to post a 100M quarter, which is like 70% more than their usual quarter revs. Theres a looming reaction wheels deal. Neutron is ever closer to development so the cost curve can start plateauing. Runoff funding secured at a nice rate (the 10yr is currently higher than their borrowing rate). They bought covered call protection on the convertible notes to dampen SH dilution impact. Watch out for a compounding effect of them recognizing backlog revenue for the 515 mil deal in 2026 and on, combined with Neutron costs falling off.",

They build and operate satellites.  Also, the government and big corporations like to have multiple suppliers.  It could prove unwise to be completely reliant on a single supplier who microdoses ketamine and believes every lunatic conspiracy theory he reads about.  So Rocket Lab likely continues to get a share of the launch services market.",
