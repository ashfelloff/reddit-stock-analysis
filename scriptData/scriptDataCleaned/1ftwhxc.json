  "selftext": "I hope to share my ‚Äúcome back‚Äù story to those who lost hope. It‚Äôs still a work in progress but trading has been fun. It tests us to the limit and builds character. \n\nI entered the stock market in Jan 2021. The first stock I bought was CCIV (now lucid) with options and it was the tail end of the spac-mania. Put in about 20k and life was good. I didn‚Äôt know making money was so easy. Waking up and find thousands of dollars in my account. In 1 month, I 4x the money. Surely I can do it again? \n\nFast forward, I lost it all. All 80k. No risk management, nothing. \n\nTook a 6 months break. But I came back, 100% on options. \n\nThis is not addiction. This is dedication. \n\nHonestly, I can‚Äôt remember what I bought when I returned. I only remember buying Chinese options when HSI (hong Kong index) went back to 1997 level. Gained lots but lost more and I swore to never touch Chinese stock again. But they become relevant again because of the stimulus. (More on that later)\n\nMy low point was 7k at the start of 2024 and I managed to 5x it with the AI boom. I‚Äôm fucking sure no one expected the market to recover late last year. AI carried the entire stock market. \n\nI‚Äôm lucky I was out before the implosion happened on late July - August. I was still down 20% but remember, it‚Äôs 100% options. It could be much worse. \n\nRight now I‚Äôm 60% in US stocks (30% in Tesla for the robo taxi) and 40% in Chinese stocks. \n\nWhat I‚Äôve learnt so far:\n-slow money is faster. Fast money is death. \n-price to dream ratio is the best when things are hyped and uncertain. (Hence Tesla and Chinese stock)\n- don‚Äôt earn the last dollar. Run when everyone is onboard. (Totally out of AI) \n-never concentrate more than 30% in 1 holding. \n-when you are not certain, Buy/Sell half of the intended position. \n- you only buy more/leverage more if you are in the green. Never the other way around. \n\n\nLooking ahead, I positioned more Chinese options. I think this is the moment I‚Äôve been waiting for. I can read Chinese and I find that English DD doesn‚Äôt go into the details of the stimulus. Particularly, 800b yuan swap facilities for collaterals (including stocks which makes even less supply) can ONLY be used to buy stocks. This is their equivalent of QE and their timing is impeccable. (They were waiting for fed to cut rates.) they probably also need the stock market to replace their currently dead real estate market. \n\n3 Reasons to buy\n1. Stocks can be used as collateral and be locked up (supply drops) and the money must go into the stock market. (Demand increase)\n2. It‚Äôs mentioned that there could be more rounds of the same size. \n3. They are cheap. Many stocks‚Äôs Forward PE is single digit. Vs high 20s in US. \n\n3 Reasons not to buy. \n1. It‚Äôs Chinese. \n2. It‚Äôs Chinese. \n3. It‚Äôs Chinese. \n\n\nTLDR. Got greedy + cocky and lost it all. But I‚Äôm glad I lost it all early rather than later. I made a comeback over the past 10 months. Betting on Chinese stocks now. Still 100% on options. ",

Thanks for your compliment and advice. üòâ\n\nSounds like you are someone who made it! \n\nIt‚Äôs interesting that you link every asset into a single entity. I.e business, stocks, property, career income into a single interchangeable account. I understand conventional wisdom is to pull everything and focus on one that brings the most return. But I actively remind myself each asset doesn‚Äôt cross into another. My property gains is x10 this portfolio but it will never cross into stocks or my online business. If I‚Äôm good, any of my asset should make me financially free eventually. Slow is faster! \n\nIn a way, the risk of blowing up and affecting my life is contained. But I have to thank you for reminding me!",

Trading for me now is just a bonus and not something I rely on for money, which was an important lesson. Sometimes it takes years of waiting out the market to make money, which is difficult without a separate revenue stream.\n\nI blew up my account again recently when I dove hard into options and am leveraging a similar approach as you are. I'm a ways from returning to where I was, but learning strategic options plays rather than just YOLOing on 0DTE and earnings are much more valuable in the long term. I've caught stuff like puts on SMCI the day of their crash by looking at technicals I'd have previously ignored.\n\nAgain, congrats and glad for your success!",

It should not be so short lived. \n\nIf it turns to shit with such a good set up, run. \n\nThe rsi is overbought. So I would give myself a few chance to enter.

      "body": "China was one of the largest holders of US Treasuries,Bonds and Notes but seeing what happened to Russia,Iraq,Iran,Libya,Afghanistan,Lebanon,and others money in the US they decided that that they had to sell as their money was not safe and bring it back home.When it went back home they figured they would do what the FED did in America and BOJ did in Japan which was to put it into their markets to prop up local economy. The difference though is the US and Japan were printing money to do so. By doing this China can pretty much do what the US and Japan did. Manipulate GDP numbers,put money into people‚Äôs pockets which would then increase spending from profits made from stock market rally. When the Chinese make money, the first thing they do is go out and buy cars and houses. This would resolve quite a bit of the housing glitch market issues in China. This would also increase spending, which would change a lot of the numbers in China. It would also raise funds for manufacturers in China that are competing with the US and the chip industry. With all this money coming back from the US into China‚Äôs market, it would make China‚Äôs market more stable and by doing so many countries would view China‚Äôs market and economy as being stable just like they did of that of the US in Japan, which then led to money coming in from other countries The same what happened in China. The Chinese are actually quite smart. They figured if Japan and the US could do it. We could do it as well. The Chinese stock, market and indexes pretty much rallied over 35% in under 10 days trading. What took US index nine months to gain they did and just under 10 days so imagine the buying power in China compared to that of the US. The same applies to Japan. I don‚Äôt think any index or market around the world was able to gain 35% or more and under 10 days. That is what you call a bull market. In the US, the money from QE was the equivalent of $100 billion per month but recently overtime has dropped to around 80 billion per month. When you do the numbers that is roughly $4 billion per day that they have at their disposal to inject into the market at any time. It‚Äôs pretty much pure manipulation and they were able to manipulate the market and index for the Dow to go from 20,000 to 40,000 just over double And the same applies for NASDAQ and the S&P 500. China never really did this. They use their money to prop up their infrastructure and their country. They did not use their money to prop up the stock markets. Now that they‚Äôre infrastructure is way ahead of out of the US. They can start propping some of their money into the markets as well when Covid hit the US put out stimulus packages and gave the people money. China did not do so and many of their people were not happy many businesses shut down many people lost money. Many people are unemployed, and this is where the problems started for the Chinese and China. China has now realize this and wanted to put some money into the pockets of their people so the money that they sold from US treasury notes and bond, which came back to China pretty much got directly injected back into their markets and will continue to do so.  I speak some Mandarin as well myself.",
