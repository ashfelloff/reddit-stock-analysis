  "title": "AST SpaceMobile: Bridging the Connectivity Gap with Ambitious Space-Based Cellular Network",
  "score": 31,
  "selftext": "**Overview**\n\nAST SpaceMobile, Inc. (NASDAQ: ASTS) is building the first and only global cellular broadband network in space to operate directly with standard, unmodified mobile devices. The company’s mission is to eliminate the connectivity gaps faced by today’s five billion mobile subscribers and bring broadband to the billions who remain unconnected. With its extensive IP and patent portfolio, AST SpaceMobile is poised to transform the telecommunications industry by delivering cost-effective, high-speed cellular broadband services to end-users worldwide.\n\n**Business Overview**\n\nAST SpaceMobile was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in Midland, Texas. The company operates 185,000 square feet of satellite assembly, integration, and testing (AIT) facilities, as well as engineering and development centers in the United States, India, Scotland, Spain, and Israel. AST SpaceMobile’s intellectual property portfolio consists of 36 patent families worldwide, with more than 3,350 patent and patent pending claims as of March 31, 2024.\n\nThe company’s flagship product, the SpaceMobile Service, is designed to provide cellular broadband connectivity directly to standard, unmodified mobile devices using a constellation of high-powered, large phased-array satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). The service is expected to enable mobile network operators (MNOs) to augment and extend their coverage without building additional land-based infrastructure, particularly in areas where it is not cost-justified or geographically challenging.\n\n**Recent Developments**\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AST SpaceMobile made significant progress on several fronts:\n\n* Signed a milestone, 6-year definitive commercial agreement with AT&T for the SpaceMobile Service, which includes a $20 million commercial payment and a purchase order for network equipment.\n* Announced a strategic partnership with Verizon, with a $100 million commitment from Verizon, to provide direct-to-cellular AST SpaceMobile service to Verizon customers.\n* Completed the design and commenced the tape-out of the company’s custom AST5000 ASIC chip, which is expected to enable materially greater throughput capacity and processing bandwidth for the next-generation Block 2 BlueBird satellites.\n* Continued to advance discussions with additional strategic partners, following the blueprint of commercial payments alongside commercial agreements.\n* Received non-binding letters of interest from three institutions for non-dilutive, quasi-governmental funding sources, providing a framework for accessing significant long-term, lower-cost capital.\n\n**Financials and Liquidity**\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, AST SpaceMobile had $212.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, including $107.7 million in net proceeds from the January 2024 common stock offering and $104.8 million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible notes. The company also has an additional $51.5 million in gross proceeds available to draw under its Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions and approvals.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, the company reported total operating expenses of $56.0 million, including $19.9 million in depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted operating expenses, which exclude depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, were $31.1 million for the quarter, a decrease of $7.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAs of March 31, 2024, AST SpaceMobile has incurred approximately $326.4 million in gross capitalized property and equipment costs, including the costs of satellite materials, advance launch payments, the BlueWalker 3 test satellite, assembly and integration facilities, and ground antennas.\n\n**Risks and Challenges**\n\nAST SpaceMobile faces several risks and challenges that could impact its ability to execute its business plan:\n\n* Successful and timely completion of the design, assembly, integration, testing, and launch of its satellite constellation, which could be subject to delays and cost overruns.\n* Obtaining necessary regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions to operate its SpaceMobile Service.\n* Negotiating and executing definitive commercial agreements with mobile network operators that would supersede preliminary agreements and memoranda of understanding.\n* Maintaining and expanding its relationships with key partners, including wireless infrastructure providers and government entities.\n* Managing the complex supply chain and manufacturing processes required to produce its satellites and components.\n* Competing with other satellite-based and terrestrial wireless communication providers in a rapidly evolving industry.\n* Securing sufficient capital to fund its ongoing operations and planned growth initiatives.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nAST SpaceMobile is at a critical juncture as it transitions from a development-stage company to a commercial operation. The company’s recent strategic partnerships, regulatory approvals, and progress in manufacturing and satellite development demonstrate its ability to execute on its ambitious vision of bridging the global connectivity gap. However, the company still faces significant risks and challenges, and its long-term success will depend on its ability to successfully navigate the complex technological, regulatory, and competitive landscape of the satellite communications industry.\n\nSource: [https://beyondspx.com/2024/06/23/ast-spacemobile-bridging-the-connectivity-gap-with-ambitious-space-based-cellular-network/](https://beyondspx.com/2024/06/23/ast-spacemobile-bridging-the-connectivity-gap-with-ambitious-space-based-cellular-network/)",

Maybe it will, but that does take into account all the big potential catalysts coming up soon.\n\nThe reason the sp was so low was a few delays due to trouble sourcing parts, dilution and no clear funding pathway. Most of those have been erased for time being. Ceo announced no dilution this year, att and Verizon signed big prepayment and convertible notes deals and if thjngs go according to plan asts will be booking revenue by end of the year.",
