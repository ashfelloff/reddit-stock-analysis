S&P Dow Jones Indices uses a metric called float-adjusted market capitalization to determine how much of a company's outstanding share count is included when determining weightings for the rebalancing. A document published by the company said it excludes shares owned by long-term strategic shareholders, a category that includes corporate officers, asset managers and insurance companies with a seat on the board, as well as those owned by other publicly traded companies.‚Äù\n\n* Source: [https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240614299/popular-tech-sector-etf-could-see-major-shakeup-as-apple-microsoft-and-nvidia-jockey-for-position](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240614299/popular-tech-sector-etf-could-see-major-shakeup-as-apple-microsoft-and-nvidia-jockey-for-position)\\*\n\nNext week is going to be interesting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/d64l8952rm6d1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29f6513bcbb1a7032910db48ecd5cd4c0fbba93b",
