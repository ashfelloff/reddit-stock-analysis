How about you focus on \"earning\" a few bucks to avoid eating ramen again tonight, rather than topics well above your cognitive level.\n\n\nMuch like this case he's required to post bond for, the \"hush money\" case is yet another loser. Companies routinely pay individuals in order for them to sign an NDA. If anything, Trump is a victim of a shakedown and someone that violated an NDA.\n\n\nThe fact that he was a presidential candidate is meaningless. That's not an opinion, it's settled case law from the John Edwards \"hush money\" fiasco. \n\n\nIt's weak attempts to get him that have resulted in him being the Teflon Don. Nothing sticks because all you mental midgets will jump at anything to indict and convict him. ",
