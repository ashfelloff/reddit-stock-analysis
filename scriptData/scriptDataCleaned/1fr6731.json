  "selftext": "1.2k turned into 13k, thank you PDD BABA and JD\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jpn7fwmz6hrd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=06678742be3b04137700b541992a8d9375d90441\n\nI am myself a Chinese citizen, came to the US and studied for 7 years. Now I've worked for 1.5 yrs, just paid off some money I borrowed from my family. Being debt free, I looked into investing 3 months ago, started by doing day trading on a paper account for a few weeks, kind of understood generally how short term trades work, and it certainly helped me in doing 1dte and 0dte SPY options later on.\n\nHowever, with my minimal initial capital, investing in stocks have very diminishing returns. I then thought options is literately perfect. If I loss everything, it doesn't matter, I am young and don't really have much in hand anyway. But if I win big, I can have a meaningful starting capital to do some more stable investing with more meaningful returns. I put a month's paycheck minus rent into options gambling and started the journey right as the July huge dip happened.\n\nFor the next two months, it was really meh, sometimes I win, but there were a few times when I was down 80% and bounced back. My downfall is holding on to gains for too long... and they just fizzle out later (its almost like if I browse WSB daily XD).\n\nAround last week, my mom also gave me a speculative 1.5k for investing in the US, since China has been in a multi-year shit market. She told me exactly which stocks to buy, but gave me free control over 200$ of it in options play.\n\nFinally the day came. Wednesday I turned 200$ into 600$ on PDD calls during trading hours, sold the gains and bought 1.2k worth of OTM PDD, BABA, and JD calls expiring on Friday right before close. Overnight I watched the Hang Seng index, the SSE index, and JD/BABA charts on HSE, and I almost shitted myself... JD rose 10% overnight, and PDD gained 12 dollars. I immediately closed all these positions in the morning.\n\nNow, my initial investment has almost 5x'ed, and my mom's money also 2.5x'ed. I can finally do fun things like the wheel strategy, and investing in stocks will now have meaningful returns. I put almost all my investment money + a bit more deposits into stocks, and left out 500$ to keep gambling in options. I told my mom to do the same with her money, and I will keep doing options with 300$ of it. If somehow I can 10x this, I will pull out the majority into stocks, and repeat with 1000$ for options play. Currently I have already 2x'ed that 500$.\n\nNow my positions...\n\nI still think the Chinese economy is being driven by the ccp into a dumpster, and the stimulus, at least in the near future, won't fix it at all. However, I will continue to ride this wave of Chinese market rally for some time. I think there's gonna be around another week's worth of gains on the table. Though now I have no Chinese options held over the weekend, most of my money are in various Chinese stocks, and they most likely will go into SPXL, MOAT, gold and some selected US stocks after this wave of rally fades.\n\nHopefully next week Chinese stocks make me proud and 10x my options play money again.",
