          "body": "I mean there’s many reasons. \n\n1. FSD is still years away from reaching level-4 autonomy and they would need level 5 to have a functioning robotaxi service. It’s not just some subjective categorization they need to be certified at that level by regulators and they’re sitting at level-2 now.\n\n2. Their investments into AI are not great. They have essentially given up on DOJO and musk has a reputation for faking supercomputers since before Tesla. They ordered far fewer NVDA chips than any of their competitors despite making a big deal out of the number and the ones they did order were rerouted to xAI (which ostensibly would be competition for TSLA in the near future). The machine learning on FSD is impressive but the unwillingness to start with geofencing or pay for more sensors is a limitation that their architecture will find hard to overcome.\n\n3. Optimus: the most vaporware of all Tesla vaporware. Elon has a child-like obsession with sci-fi-esque humanoid robots but at this point in time the form factor is not very efficient and far behind other robotics companies that can actually fully focus on robotics. Evan as far as humanoid robots OpenAI’s figure 1 is much further ahead. All of the Optimus demos of them performing basic tasks I’m aware of to this point have been done with haptics/human controllers and not autonomy. How far away do you really think that is from being a useful household robot. 5 years? 10 years? 20? Well according to musk in 2025 they’ll start mass production and eventually Optimus will outnumber humans globally (lmfao)\n\nThe market LOVES massive promises of future revenue but when it doesn’t come fast enough the gains are erased. That’s why Tesla is in a multi-year downtrend to begin with. The best move would probably be just to sit on TSLQ shares because this shit could pop over 220 in the near term.",
