Unless you can program them on the client side of your terminal.\n\nLeaving your stop-losses with your trading platform is just waiting in line for enough of you to pile up on a number, before a trader decides to stop-loss hunt you with a price-moving sale, that he will immediately counter balance with a buy, at a lower price.\n\nEx: I sell at 11->10, momentum activates your stop loss at 9.80, means that i get a lot of you to sell at 9.70->9.50 (with slippage and momentum), giving me a buyback. I just lowered my PA for the entire position, to the lowest price of the day.\n\nStanding Sell at 11-12 and go for lunch.",
