Please see the St. Louis Fed website for that data. This graph shows the \"change\" in reserves, not the total amount, which aids your argument that no bank reserves have been withdrawn by the Fed's QT program, but that is not the truth.\n\nThe wind down of RRP, remittances to the Treasury, and the Fed's \"deferred losses\" (interest paid to banks using RRP) have all helped counteract the reserve vacuum that QT creates, but not enough to replace the liquidity that QT has removed. Therefore, another crisis is incoming.",

At that scale they're far more interested in not losing money than making it and the higher interest rates go the less people are going to be taking on loans also the more people are going to want to deposit money when they're getting a 5% return on cash in an account. They're going to be forced to put the money somewhere. That's a lot of the reason equities have probably been running but even more so in a long view treasuries are paying close to the return the s&p averages over around 100 years for the first time in a long time because rates have been so low for so long up until recently because of inflation. \n\nRates go up to kill the demand side of things because the supply side cant be fixed. High rates means bonds are more attractive relative to the risk. Trying to find a safe place to park money means banks will buy the treasuries from the fed and the fed takes money out of supply. \n\nThere's a lot of liquidity and nowhere to put it which is why the fed is selling treasuries to banks and some of the deposits are flowing into the stock market which is becoming incredibly bloated. When the fed cuts rates the bonds bought at the peak will trade at a premium to the now lower rated bonds and I would be willing to bet in anticipation to that cut equities will be sold off to buy risk free treasuries and lock in a high risk free rate.",
