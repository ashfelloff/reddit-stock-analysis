LMT is in a fairly clear topping pattern, with upward momentum peterimg out, to my eye. I'd cut your losses ASAP. 40-50% is better than 0%. \n\nLMT shares and LEAPs are fine medium-term plays once the bottom is in, but this short-dated play is cooked. I'd look for an entry in the 500-525 range. NFA lol.",
