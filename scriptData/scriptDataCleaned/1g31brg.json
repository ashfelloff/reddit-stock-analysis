Wanted to be sure so asked a.i search and got a good laugh. \n\n\"Recovering from 99% Loss\nBased on the provided search results, to recover from a 99% loss, you would need a 100% gain. This is because a 99% loss means the investment value is reduced to 1% of its original value. To get back to the original value, you would need a 100% increase, which would bring the investment value back to its starting point.\n\n**In mathematical terms, if the original investment value is $100, a 99% loss would reduce it to $1. To recover, you would need a 100% gain, which would increase the value to $100 again.**\n\nNote that this calculation assumes a linear recovery, where the percentage gain is directly proportional to the loss. In reality, markets can be volatile, and recoveries may not always follow a straightforward arithmetic progression. However, based on the provided information, a 100% gain would be necessary to recover from a 99% loss.\"\n\nGood bot.",
