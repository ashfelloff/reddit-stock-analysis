Weren't we supposed to have fully autonomous, end-to-end self-driving cars already?\n* Tesla body styling is polarizing and hasn't been updated in years/ever? \n* Elon is a polarizing figure and is no longer the tech guru / media darling that he used to be. I don't see him clawing his way back into the public's good graces.\n* Tesla build quality is an absolute crapshoot\n* Cybertruck \n\nSpeculative, but I guess I could see if they deliver on completely automated self-driving, that could bring in additional customers and completely upend the ride share business, but that requires regulatory changes and political maneuvering that would be >1-2 years in the making. I guess my imagination is failing me on ways in which Tesla could explode in 1-2 years that doesn't involve it evolving into something completely different than just a car company.",
