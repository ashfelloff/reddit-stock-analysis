  "score": 262,
  "selftext": "As the title said, I got offered a job as a contractor at a startup company (a private one). They demand 20hrs/week minimum, at 40$/hr. At the end end of the month, I'll get compensation in stock only based on the hours I worked. The contract also says the stock is at 1$ \"preferred\". How does it work ? I never got paid in stock before, and I have noo idea how to liquidate it when I need actual cash in my bank account. I live in Morocco. The company's abroad.\n\nI have never sold or bought stock so any help is appreciated. Some of my questions are:  \nWhat if need cash on hand? Can I just sell easily ?\n\nWhat if there's no one to sell to ?\n\nWhat if the company goes bankrupt ?\n\nShould I contact my bank to convert the stock into money ?\n\nDoes it take long to convert ?\n\nIs it as reliable as cash in your bank account ?\n\nAlso, any taxes I should worry about ?\n\nEDIT ===========\n\nThank you all for the helpful comments ! I definitely won't take that job, might try to negotiate actual payment (prolly wont get it, but that's as far as I'll go.)\n\n  \nEDIT2 ===============\n\nHere's the company for anyone asking a link to another reddit post: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1e4igxm/warning_avoid_alterlearning_educational_platform/)",

The reality is usually that while they may say that you own, say, 50k in equity value, you simply do not have anyone to sell it to.

That means that even if you wanted to monetize that equity, there is no way to do it.\n\n\nHow much is worth shares of a company that is not making money and is illiquid? Pretty much zero.\n\n\nI would not necessarily advise against having a part (like 10 to 20%) of your compensation being in the form of equity. That's a gamble that many people who work for startups make: if the company succeeds, you might be looking at early retirement. But in the meantime you have bills to pay and a life to live. Being paid solely in equity is a recipe for exploitation.\n\n\nBefore you know it you'll be asking for them to pay you some of that equity for pennies on the dollar just so you can feed yourself and will feel like you have to keep working for them without limits, lest their company fails altogether and you end up never seeing the color of this promised value.\n\n\nA startup is all but guaranteed to go through multiple financial restructuring and you can expect early equity to be diluted or wiped out one way or another. So even if the company is ultimately successful, there's pretty high chance that the equity will still be virtually worthless. \n\n\nIt's a terrible position to put yourself in and tbh, any serious startup with management worth their salt would not expect the people who work for them to do it without getting paid actual money. ",

That essentially puts the power in your hand by giving you the money and then letting you decide whether you want to purchase those options. As a contractor you might not be privy to as much information as an employee, but this way at least you can opt to keep the cash.\n\nOtherwise, yeah, if they're paying you only in preferred stock, I would treat this \"opportunity\" as unpaid.

He said he couldn't pay me, but we signed an agreement that said upon launching, I would be entitled to 50% of the revenue up to a certain amount for the first 10 years. Then afterward, I'd be entitled to 10% of the net proceeds if he ever sold it. Because he wasn't paying me at all, it kept falling down in priority on my list of things to do. After a while I told him that I don't think I have time to do this unless he paid me. We agreed to void our agreement and part ways. 6 months later he actually paid someone to build the website and when I asked how much he ended up spending, he was like, \"A lot. If anything, based on what I had in mind in our agreement, you would've ended up being a lot cheaper.\"\n\nNever work for free if you don't have to.",

In the US, the tech industry is still in a weird spot, but you can expect $150,000 to $250,000 a year depending on the company. Let's go with $204,000 as a halfway point to make it divisible to $17,000 a month. 20 work days a month, 8 hour days, translates that to $106.25. With that in mind, if I was contracting I'd ask for at least $150 an hour. However, in the US not being an employee costs you A LOT in benefits, particularly health insurance. So there's a much larger premium for contractors since they have to cover all that stuff out-of-pocket.\n\nSome of my contracting buddies prefer to do daily rates rather than hourly. It lets them smooth out their earnings as the project ramps up and winds down. I definitely see the value in that; I was once contracting by the hour and it was great in the beginning because I was pulling in 60 hour weeks and getting 1.5x on anything over 40. Then as the project was finishing up and I was doing maybe 30 hours a week, I was making a lot less. Luckily, my manager just let me keep clocking in 60 hours so it worked out.",

Is this illegal?\n\nI'm not a lawyer, but I definitely recall reading about companies getting taken to court and hit hard for trying to pay their employees in alternate ways that make it next to impossible for them to even access their salary, or force a bunch of it to be eaten up in fees/etc. Like for example years ago there were some companies that tried to pay their employees in gift cards with such strict rules that it was impossible to spend the money without incurring big fees (effectively pushing the employee's salary below minimum wage). They got hammered pretty hard in court for this violation of labor laws.\n\nWhile being paid only in stock isn't unheard of, it's usually just very big publicly traded stocks (where the person could easily liquidate it on the market).

I gave my investors preferred shares. In the event of a liquidation event my investor or preferred shareholders would’ve been paid first before me. Also your acceptance depends on how close to the team you are. There are other cases where shares can be sold secondary market. This is usually done before or during a large event that is coming up.
