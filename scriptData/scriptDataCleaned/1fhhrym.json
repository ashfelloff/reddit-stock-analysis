I too paid for an ivy league education in the game of life so I can confirm it’s not a big thing to worry about so long as you learned an important lesson.  \n\nIt’s just money there are plenty of ways to reload over time.  This is why I switched to futures over options for short term trading.  This way I can be right on direction and not have to worry about theta decay.  Also it’s best to figure a portion of your overall bankroll for short term risky trades rather than betting it all.  I focus on 20% of my portfolio rather than 100%.  Easier to survive the swings.\n\nOn the bright side you’ll have some capital gains tax write offs to look forward to in the future.  If you have no gains then you get to write off a max of $3k every year.  If you have up to $63k worth of capital gains you can write it off completely paying no taxes on that amount.  You can carry forward those write offs indefinitely.",
