  "selftext": "Since the recent drop, it's only closed under $30 once on 5/10.\n\nThere's a lot of open interest around the $30 strike, which makes me think that put sellers have a lot of interest in keeping the price over $30 from now and into the future. \n\nIt sort of looks like it's trending up.\n\nAverage analyst PT: $40.\n\nToo big to fail.\n\nSafe play would be $29.0/$28.5 PCS for 6% return on risk.\nModerate play would be $30.0/$29.5 PCS for 35% return on risk.\n\nI do not yet have a position, but will look for an entry on Monday or Tuesday for Friday expiration.\n\nI would not recommend being a net buyer of options here.\n\nI'm not a profitable trader, my analysis is moot.",

Being so close to support, it makes sense that the weekly put/call ratio to be lower than call/put ratio.

On the GPU front, INTC just gave up & their products were a massive disappointment. Everyone else in the industry is making money, somehow Intel is losing. You should stop & think about why that may be.",
