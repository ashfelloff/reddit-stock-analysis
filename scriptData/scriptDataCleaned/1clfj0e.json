They did it before with Sora vs Gemini 1.5 pro. Every OpenAI announcement has been on a Thursday or Tuesday. If they wait until Tuesday then that is Google I/O. Thursday is likely the date",

They may announce it earlier tomorrow, since they typically do Tuesday and Thursday for their announcements, but AI twitter is saying May 9th. If they don't announce by May 9th, I will likely exit most of my position for a small loss and keep a couple. Worth the gamble imo. I highly doubt the market priced in this competition.",
