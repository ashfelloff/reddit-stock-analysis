They may announce it earlier tomorrow, since they typically do Tuesday and Thursday for their announcements, but AI twitter is saying May 9th. If they don't announce by May 9th, I will likely exit most of my position for a small loss and keep a couple. Worth the gamble imo. I highly doubt the market priced in this competition.",
