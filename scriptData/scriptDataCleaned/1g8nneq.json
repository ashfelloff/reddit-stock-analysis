We know this investment is happening because it is publicly reported. So there is one of 2 possibilities; either it succeeds, and Nvidia takes a huge hit to earnings due to losing their biggest customers and increased competition, or it fails, and all of these companies take a huge hit to earnings via depreciation on their capex or writeoffs.\n\n2. They are not manufacturing their own chips, they are designing their own chips and contracting out manufacturing to other fabs like TSMC/Samsung. This is a big reason to be bullish on international stocks. ASML, TSMC, and Samsung are going to be big winners in the rush for AI chips. \n\n3. The high capex costs are a big reason why tech stocks no longer deserve high P/E Ratios. Tech is historically an industry that can scale with low cost, providing high return on invested capital. If tech companies have to spend hundreds of billions on datacenters and AI hardware to compete, then that will hurt their return on equity.",

While I have nothing but respect for Vanguard and Mr. Buckley, since that prediction the nominal price return on the S&P 500 has been over 100% (inflation-adjusted it's 58%). \n\nThis translates into an 11% annualized return (inflation-adjusted it's 7%).\n\nSo, more than 6 years in, Mr. Buckley is wrong. And interestingly, Vanguard's current 10-year estimate is about the same--i.e., they expect about 4.2% for the next decade through 2034.\n\nBut turning back to Goldman's 10-year estimate of 3%, the thing they said that was most interesting is that “[t]he current high level of *equity valuations* is a key reason our 10-year forward return forecast sits at the lower end of the historical distribution.” \n\nThey specifically point to the outperformance of the “Magnificent 7” in the S&P 500.\n\nSo let's discuss equity valuations, but my key point is going to be that objective measures of equity valuation have changed more than you might think, and there are reasons.\n\nThe average S&P p/e ratio of the last 60 years (1964 - 2024) is about 19, but that's deceptive.\n\nLook deeper and you'l see that the average p/e ratio of the S&P 500 over the last 30 years (1994 - 2024) was 25 whereas the average p/e from the *previous* 30-year period (1964 to 1993) was a lowly 14.\n\nLet that sink in, four-fucking-teen. Can you imagine?  \n\nThis is not your parent’s stock market; this is not the market experienced by Peter Lynch and other old-school market luminaries.\n\nSo what's going on here? Why did multiples expand so much in the last 30 years?\n\nThe answer is technology, which has historically outperformed and traded at higher multiples. \n\n60 years ago technology made up a tiny fraction of the S&P 500 market capitalization. Even 30 years ago it was *less* than 10%.\n\nToday, the \"Magnificent 7\" stocks make up more than 30% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization and all are \"tech stocks” [Personally, I hesitate to call Tesla a tech stock, but whatever.]  That’s triple the weighting from 30 years ago and much higher than it was even during the peak of the dot-com era when it was about 20%.\n\nWhat’s more, it’s those 7 stocks that have driven more than 90% of recent stock market gains.\n\nBut what about the other 493 stocks?\n\nThe p/e ratio of the \"bottom 493” S&P 500 stocks is currently . . . wait for it . . . 19. \n\nIn other words, the \"bottom 493\" are consistent with the S&P 500's average 60-year p/e ratio and below the average of the S&P 500 p/e ratio over the last 30 years. In addition, analysts are currently predicting 15% earnings growth for the entire S&P 500 in 2025, putting the S&P 500's overall 12-month forward p/e at 22.\n\nI'd also argue that multiples have expanded in the last 30 years because our sense of valuation has changed from 1964 versus 1994. After all, valuation is mostly a subjective application of recency bias. Recent p/e ratios serve as valuation anchors, informing entire markets of what is currently “normal.” So a p/e ratio of 25, which is the average S&P 500 p/e ratio from the last 30 years, is “normal\" because that’s what it’s been for *three decades.*\n\nGoldman and others do not discuss these kinds of changes. As best as I can tell, they look back as far as they can and apply the logic that we will \"revert to the mean.\" \n\nThe last 30 years, however, says otherwise.\n\nAll this said, I don't know how anyone can predict 10-year returns with a straight face.\n\nI personally expect single-digit returns, but that's about as far as I am willing to go.",
