Which means I own 0.000001% of blackberry (Actual math btw, that's the real percentage I own) \n\nIn order to have sway in how the company runs I would probably need at least 1% - but this depends on who owns what percentage of the remainder. If there are 100 investors and they all own 1%, then I'm equal weight to all of them. If one guy owns 51% and the public owns the remaining 49% then you would probably only matter to the 51% guy if you owned 10-20% or more. \n\nMassive companies like Blackberry are more likely to have a share structure that is more like 5-10% in a bunch of companies and then a bunch left over for the public trading or investment firms. Which means in order to actually speak and have your voice heard in any way that matters you would probably need 1-5% \n\nThis is admittedly, a poor understanding. I don't actually know how all this shit works in practice it's just what I've gleaned from partially related sources. No one has explicitly told me this is how it works. (Which seems appropriate for this sub) \n\nIf you watch those investment shows like shark tank (awful) and dragons den (Good) then you may notice the investors always want at least 5% in any business. And 20-30% is considered a heavy price to pay. \n\nIf I worked for Blackberry and I wanted to sway the company I would probably need at least 5% which would be 29,461,626 shares. Or at the market rate as of writing this, I would need to spend $92 million dollars Canadian. (Current rate is $3.14 CAD per share)",
