  "score": 40,
  "selftext": "I saw SMCI's 12b-25 report when they filed it, however one thing I could not quite grasp - this check box in Part II:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lnpo84bpzgmd1.png?width=1155&format=png&auto=webp&s=e190227038d54bbcb34248e82fd5db4a27c22456\n\n  \nI've read only a handful 12b-25 forms before that one, but only [one](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/883697/000114036111019521/doc1.htm) with the extension box unchecked, and that company [didn't do well afterwards](https://www.massdevice.com/regen-biologics-files-bankruptcy/).\n\nSeveral financial outlets wrote that *Super Micro has assured that it will complete the filing within the stipulated extension period with minor performance revisions.*  \nThat bit of text got certain amount of attention and based on posts and comments all over, people seem to hold onto it. So I dismissed this whole check box thing and accept that we'll be getting the 10-K soon.\n\nBut that box kept bugging me, so today I scratched the surface just a little, and noticed that those few outlets all quoted one and the same source, Zacks Investment Research, and I didn't see anyone else other than them reporting it, let alone official statement.\n\nSo I dug a little deeper into it. Turns out, **SMCI did make an official statement**, just without much fanfare, and people obviously missed it. **One has to check that box if they believe and/or want to explicitly declare whether they expect to file within the 15 day grace period (which they didn't)**, and Part III of Form NT (only) includes management’s narrative explanation of the reason why the 10-Q or the 10-K will be filed late. ([link1](https://www.wilmerhale.com/en/insights/blogs/keeping-current-disclosure-and-governance-developments/20230828-recent-sec-enforcement-activity-serves-as-a-reminder-that-rule-12b-25-requires-substantive-disclosures#:~:text=Rule%2012b%2D25%20requires%20a,and%20less), [link2](https://accounting.unibocconi.eu/sites/default/files/files/media/attachments/BDK_BocconiPresentation_June201220120605171817.pdf))\n\nSo now what? Maybe they will report it on time, but the company management obviously isn't sure (and therefore wouldn't check the extension box), so they distanced themselves from further accusations if the company doesn't file 10-K on time.  \nOne has to understand that filing a 12b-25 is not a thing you file to buy yourself some time because you think you will be able to fulfill your obligations on time, and all you need is just a simple extension, but because you're required to do so when you are late.  \n  \nMaybe nothing happens, but this just keeps getting more and more interesting!\n\nThe complete 12b-25 form can be seen on SEC site [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1375365/000137536524000031/smci-form12bx25nt10xkx2024.htm).  \n\n\nTL;DR: SMCI didn't check the extension box on their 12b-25 filing, and the only reports saying they'll file on time are from one source, Zacks. So, it looks like the company is not confident about meeting the deadline, and things could get really spicy very soon!",
