A day before the ATM, priced jumped from 28-29 to 36 just because the launch **wasn't delayed**.  \n3. There are many positive catalysts expected after launch - from the technical ones (satellites unfurling, successful tests/diagnostics) to potential funding announcements (which may as well be contingent on a successful launch).  \n\nFor all those reasons, I'd expect a relatively small (up to 32-34) jump up on a successful launch, profit taking dump back to 29-30, then a slow grind up with small jumps every time we get technical news about the sats, and a big jump if / when we hear news of additional funding.",
