Not only the years we've been at war, the war of work, but from the moment as a child when we realized that the world could be conquered.\n\nIt has been a lifetime struggle. A never-ending fight. I say to you, and you will understand that it is a privilege to fight! We are warriors!\n\nSalesmen of north-eastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more: Rise and be worthy of this historical hour! No revolution is worth anything unless it can defend itself! Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty: to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite!\n\nWe must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!",

                          "body": "Yea, but it didn't plummet like this. People are panick selling which shows public confidence.\n\nNot everyone has the same confidence, but there is some widely held similar sentiment regarding its future and stability. \n\nThis has been very very telling. It's not like it dropped a little faster, no, it's that at the time you mentioned  people had insane faith in the stock even in the midst of the sustained explosion(and that feels like an understatement) it had.\n\nA lot of, if not half, or even most thought it was probably overvalued, but the hype remained.\n\nThis was a fucking meteor, and not one large transaction, this has been a group effort \n\nSo yea, this is not a good indication. The dip will likely be lower than last major dip. I couldn't say that at the start, but there's a line in the sand where it goes from \"pulling back\" to panick selling. People are panick selling and if they weren't Friday they absolutely were today, hence the double drop rate.\n\nGood thing is I think most people realize next earning call is going to be great absolutely, so it might not dip much lower than last time and it will come back up, so hold them bags boys",

Once the 5.5T$ (notional value in shares) of calls expired, MMs began unloading all the shares they had to buy, hence, any buying pressure is literally stomped out. Probably aren’t enough buyers at these levels in tandem with other people taking profit on shares they’ve held for months so the price is dropping quickly. \n\nProbably will get downvoted for this, but we probably won’t see any true support till 70-80/share. Not saying the top is in, but we may not see any significant move to the upside for a little bit, probably consolidation for a while heading into next earnings.\n\nAlso, retailers who bought the recent highs are now conditioned to continuing buying all the way down and are bagholders in the short term.
