And they are all telling the ceo to raise prices and stop competing or else they will kick them out and get a new ceo who will follow orders… the problem isn’t going to be fixed until the conflict of interest is fixed.  And because investors essentially own the government, I don’t see that happening any time soon.\n\nThey’ll just cause a crash, buy up the carcasses, pump the economy full of taxpayer money again, rack up the us government debt as far as it goes, then move to Europe when America implodes.\n\nNobody gives a shit about the debt because the only people the debt affects is your average American who cannot jump shit when this country collapses.",

You could just apply for a loan and there was little to no verification of whether you actually needed the money. People were getting loans while subsequently laying off their work force. Those loans were then moved around on the balance sheet and often reinvested elsewhere, nothing at all to do with the employment related relief it was supposed to be for.\n\nFed printed money hand over foot to delay a recession we should have had in 2020. We are now getting bent over for these same decisions. Again - why tf wouldn’t you blame the fed.",
