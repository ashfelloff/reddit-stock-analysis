You can't use nominal returns through 1970-1990, because contraction occurred during stagflation as nominal prices increased. It is a straight up embarrassing rookie mistake...\n\nThe dataset also included rate cuts that began at the bottom of an already active recession. Naturally the markets goes up once the economy recovers from a recession and valuations are cheap. It's not applicable to the current market as we're currently cutting rates following a market boom, not bust.\n\nWhen you control for these variables, the data actually suggests that there's usually a bear market after rate cuts following a boom. Although some of those declines are short lived, it's still important to know that they exist, so you don't get caught off guard.\n\nNov 1966: +14% 12-month performance.\n\nSep 1969: -28% drawdown in monthly price. -25% 8 months after rate cut. -14% 12-month performance.\n\nJan 1981: -29% drawdown. -26% 18 months after rate cut. -14% 12-month performance\n\nAug 1984: +10% 12 month performance.\n\nApr 1989: -19% drawdown. -10% 18 months after rate cut. +2% 12-month performance.\n\nJun 1995: +19% 12M performance.\n\nNov 2000: -42% drawdown. -40% 22 months after rate cut. -15% 12-month performance\n\nJul 2007: -53% drawdown. -50% 19 months after rate cut. -18% 12-month performance\n\nJul 2019: -20% drawdown. -14% 9 months after rate cut. +9% 12 month performance.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)\n\n**Condensed summary for short attention spans:**  \nData since 1950 suggest that a bear market will occur \\~70% of the time after the Fed starts cutting rates following an market boom.",

                      "body": "Re-read what I wrote above. I already explained how the risk is lower than 08 due to fix rate mortgages. There are however still around 1/4 of the mortgages in the past 5 years that got the short end of the stick with very high interest rates. These people need home prices to keep appreciating otherwise they're walking along the edge of the cliff. The issue right now is that people who locked in low rates not wanting to sell and people not wanting to pay high interest rates has caused a stalemate in prices. As rates comes down, demand will increase but supply will also increase due to more freedom to refinance. To break through the current home price to income ratio of 7, interest rates needs to be near 0 which is unlikely. \n\n  \nStarts ups are indeed high risk, particularly in the current interest rate environment since they constantly need new financing to stay afloat and fund R&D. Lenders are also charging higher than usual risk premium due to the asymmetric information problem. The market gives AI startups lofty valuations without considering how their financing will eat into growth down the line. This is literally what a bubble is. \n\nAnd even if the Fed were to cut rates, the short term liabilities take around a year to expire, so there's a delay in how interest rates impact a corporation's balance sheet. It's one of the reasons why those rate cuts historically have not prevented recessions when the economy started showing signs of weakness.",

This could also explain why smallcaps have been performing so poorly - they do not have the same privileges as do the largecaps when it comes to using these financial tools to hedge out their interest rate risk.\n\nThat said though, financial tools have always been zerosum - there must always be a willing counterparty to take on the other side of the risk.
