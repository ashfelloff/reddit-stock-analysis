These Greedy Pig bonus shares just dilute the value and crush the other bag holders to Trumps benefits - obviously they do not increase the value of the company. The fact that he will get these is actually causing the stock to crater before he gets them because it will happen and so float shares held by not Trump will get diluted by about 50%. Gotta luv the greed.",

Rolling the protective put will be out of the cards as the underlying would have to have exceptional performance to get them back in the green. The cover calls will need to be nearer or below the underlying entry that they took to generate any substantial protection, while putting a call away point with not enough return to make it worth the risk.

There’s clearly not enough demand to support the stock to offset the sellers. There’s fundamentally no reason to own shares in the stock. But that won’t stop whimsical Trump supporters or anyone looking to profit off of any shred of positive news Trump may get. Because of the low float (Trump himself owns half the shares outstanding), any demand for shares will easily move the price up, but as a double edged sword large funds won’t be able to place large trades in this without being scrutinized for market manipulation.\n\nWhat’s hilarious is that even in this day and age it’s still a mystery who’s buying any shares in this.\n[TradingView - “Who’s Buying DJT stock?”](https://www.tradingview.com/news/DJN_DN20240410006393:0)\n\nWith that said, because of the low float, the conspiracist in me believes Trump must be funding some hedge fund to discretely support the stock so that he can get his earn out, at which point as other Redditors said, such dilution should really drive price down further.
