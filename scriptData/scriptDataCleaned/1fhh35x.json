  "selftext": "\nThis week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.\n\nYet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.\n\nDoes anyone see what I am seeing, or am I missing something here?\n",

The problem is they aren’t medically cleared and does not qualify for health insurance (seeing the pattern here now? Low cost aids are intentionally blocked from qualifying.)\n\nNow, materials are literally cheaper than AirPod materials. The software is the question mark.

One set gets charged while she's using the other.  For travel she might even toss three into her bag.  The cost is negligible compared to closing a single deal -  and her company allows her to expense them as a consumable. \n\nIf you use them heavy they last about 18mo or so before needing to be trashed due to battery wear.  For $190/pair (average cost we pay because we stock up during sales) it's really not a big deal compared to a medical device.\n\nThe only \"secret sauce\" here is software.  Apple could run laps around the existing players if they decided to do so in that arena.  I've met some of the \"programmers\" for such companies - it won't even be a competition.\n\nWill they replace every hearing aid on the market?  Of course not.

Mine cost me $5000 after the insurance pays their share, and they're several years old now. The insides have been upgraded / replaced once already but I can't afford a full replacement. The battery lasts a full week of daytime use, and programming is part of the service the doctor provides, so I cannot customize it. I do, however, have copies of all my hearing tests for the last 10 years, so I can see how it has changed and can extrapolate reasonably well. Plus, Apple claims they'll provide a hearing test feature.\n\nIf Apple provides all those same frequencies, it would be truly game changing. The Airpods Pro 2 are ungainly and only last 6 hours, but for about $250 each I could afford to buy two pair and charge one while wearing the other pair, then swap out when they're spent. Given culture the way it is today, I can get away with wearing them anywhere, too. Plus, listening to music on them would be a far better experience than anything my current hearing aids can do since they require a loop necklace antenna and buggy bluetooth sync to work today. That will be a huge win for Apple right there.\n\nFinally, I could easily build a set of microphones to feed into the Airpods. I work with Raspberry Pi and IoT all the time, so assembling and programming a microphone array would not take more than a month for me. I could build myself a custom necklace that would really amp up my hearing all around and allow me to program which air heard the result to custom effect. I can't wait to try it out!

The question is whether the remainder of the market will be sufficient to move the needle on APPL stock.

Gn resound had something like this a year back.\n\nBut why now? US FDA changed regulations around sharing aids sometime in 2019 or so, and they allowed hearing aid to be sold over the counter. This enabled consumer companies like Apple to roll this out.\n\nSo, is the apple one any good? Not really. It’s a gimmick. Why? Apple AirPods only last 6-7 hours with a single charge and continuous playback (hearing aid feature is effectively continuous playback mode). This is not usable for most people. Medical grade hearing aids last 3-4 days with one battery. You don’t want grandma worrying about charging her AirPods every 6 hours and sit down for an hour for it to charge without hearing. This is why traditional hearing aids last multiple days. \n\nThis is a nothing burger. They already had the transparency mode, which passes through external sounds to the ear. Hearing Aid mode is basically amplifying it and playing it louder, with some additional minor challenges.\n\nIf you are looking for Apple and health, this ain’t it. Apple HealthKit is more promising. More and more medical grade devices now integrate with Apple HealthKit and their fertility tracking etc is getting really really good. Recently, FDA allowed Dexcomm to sell their continuous glucose monitor directly to customers and dexcom is now working with Apple HealthKit giving Apple glucose data from users. This is a medical grade FDA cleared device used by millions of people who are diabetic/pre diabetic . \n\n\nSource: myself, an electrical engineer who used to design hearing aids for a living",

Inflation will normalize it for the sidelines.\n\nOn top of the fact that the biggest argument against Apple is *already* the cost, so I don't know why you thought this would do anything. \"Deaf people in the market for a new hearing aid\" is not exactly a massive market to switch non-Apple people into new Apple people. It is an important and altruistic market for someone to reach, but in this case it's not going to move things significantly for a *long* time, and since we're talking about Apple, it will probably look like part of a normal broad increase as they also continue to improve other areas of their business.\n\nThis whole entire song and dance is priced in.",
