      "body": "Can't see my post, so I'll post it here:\n\n\nBought 19 230puts yesterday for 10 cents each after asking chatgpt-4o if salesforce would miss earnings and it told me it would significantly miss with an EPS of 0. Asked it the same question later in the day, but rephrased to 'will CRM beat earnings?' and got a different answer which made me panic and contemplate selling and going into a different earnings play. Ultimately I decided to keep the puts as CRM has moved big before. I sold early this morning for about 25k gain at $13.40. The numbers look a little off as TD factors in the fee with the total which was about $31 on a $190 purchase. Didn't catch the max which would have netted a 33k profit despite me believing it would continue down after open, my diamond hands aren't that diamondy, but first big win in a long time. Overall, over the past 4 years, since coming across wsbgod's post on Reddit's front page and discovering options and wsbets, I'm still down, enough that my losses would make the front page, so hopefully I can get a few more wins like this so that I can post my overall chart, proudly, one day.Â ",

Then in the next column how much money I would make with that many puts and the difference between the strike price and 220. I did this for strikes 252.5 (of which I could only get 1 including fees) and below to 225 to see which strike would generate the most profit and if it was worth it or if should play a bit closer to the current stock price. Profit kept increasing till the 230 strike price and then decreased at the 225 strike price, assuming it would hit 220. So I yolod on what my crude method showed would be most profitable assuming it fell to 220. So I was going for 19k, but I'll take the extra 6.Â ",
