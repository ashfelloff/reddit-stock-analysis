  "selftext": "I've been working at options for a year, and sometimes, I hit big and do well. More times I lose money.\n\nI understand all the Greeks, and stop limits, etc. I've consumed tons of information. \n\nI've learned my problem is greed and paper handing, more times than I care to remember.\n\nI love Options. But the stress is causes on me, is substantial. This past two weeks alone I feel like all I do is look at fucking charts.\n\nAs you will see recently, I've had some good days. I panic sold a few, took profits but could have 3x if I held. I also got greedy and didn't sell, and those turned into losses.\n\n(For example, SMH fucked me so hard today. Sold call at open, bought put, put was 30% positive....but I held thinking it was going to continue to tank, and fuuuuck. He ripped. And my call I sold was worth 2x more than I sold it for if I had waited.)\n\nObviously, lots of variables come into play, but the stress and time consumption of it all it eating away at me. The sad part is, the market is very volatile right now, and that's where option traders can make the most money. \n\nBut I'm very close to liquidating everything, dumping it into VOO, and taking a break. As you can see, I've taken breaks before. In the back of my head, there's this fleeting thought \"I just need one big play and I can recoup all my losses this year....\"\n\nAnyways, that's my Ted Talk. Feel free to roast me, give me advice, or whatever.",

If you weren't planning on that, you'll get burned.  \n  \nBut $2k isn't that crazy. You're going to need 100 shares per contract you sell. Depending on what stock you buy, that's tens of thousands of dollars worth of stock. Take something like MSFT.  Currently, it's at 402. So you need $40,200 worth of stock to sell a single contract. A september 420 call (for example) is currently about $6.85.\n\nSo say your microsoft goes up to 425 - now you have to sell your 100 shares for $42,000. That's an $1,800 gain on the stock and $685 on the calls. Great. Pay your taxes on both and move on. You missed out on $5, but who cares. That's not a bad trade.   \n  \nNow imagine if you had had bought that stock a year ago (or worse, almost a year ago) at $322 and you weren't paying attention to the fact that you're already up $80. All of a sudden, that $685 isn't looking like such a good idea \\*unless you were fine with selling the stock all along\\* for whatever reason. You could wind up kicking yourself for getting out of a stock you wanted to keep for a measly $685.\n\nBottom line: don't sell calls against stock you're not happy to sell.",
