                  "body": ">Are you saying that MS would fund alternatives to Qualcomm’s ARM chips if they took over Intel?\n\n\nYes, because I don't believe Qualcomm would continue to develop ARM and x86 in parallel and obviously they're not buying INTC to kill their only thing that makes profit.\n\n\nQualcomm is in deep legal shit with ARM over their Nuvia cores. Also there is the early commercial failure of those chips because Windows software isn't ready and it's completely out of their hands. It's just my personal assessment that if Qualcomm takes over Intel or at least the client CPU business, it makes zero sense to fund two parallel product stacks where one of them sucks. Seems obvious to me that it's much smarter to buy 80% market share on day 1 and not invest tens of billions over several years competing with yourself. But it *could* make a lot ot sense to combine QCOM's industry leading mobile SOC design capability with Intel's IP and make better x86 chips for Windows to compete with Apple Mac chips. The x86/AMD64 cross-licensing would have to be renegotiated between AMD and INTC and I'm convinced nobody on Reddit has any idea if that would be a major hurdle or not.\n\n\nOn Microsoft's side, the whole point of throwing massive subsidies and marketing funds at Qualcomm was to kickstart Windows on ARM so they could break free from the Intel/AMD duopoly and compete worldwide at all price points - even if say China comes under export restrictions in a trade war - and wider performance ranges. You're not going to pay Intel money to help you stop buying Intel, and INTC(/QCOM) aren't going to invest R&D just to tear down the only moat keeping Intel in business today.\n\n\nThere is precedent for this. AMD had a program deep enough into development to announce it on the roadmap, offering choice of ARM and x86 in the same hardware platform. They killed it because there was no customer interest. There is absolutely nothing holding back AMD or Intel from selling chips with ARM cores, it's just that everything else being equal, x86 has more compatibility and therefore a bigger TAM for the same development cost. AMD continues to say in public that they're happy to make ARM products for any customer that wants them but there haven't been takers yet because the price isn't right. I believe Intel has said similar.\n\n\nThe dominant reason to use ARM in the PC and server spaces is that a company wants to build custom chips but they can't license x86 so they *must* use ARM. See AWS, Azure, NVDA, Ampere, previously Nuvia=QCOM in servers. Someday x86 may be a dinosaur and all the popular software runs on ARM but not x86. That day is not coming soon.",

You’ve really written gibberish to be honest. Side note accretion / dilution doesn’t work in that way. And it’ll only be bad for the share price if they overpay on what the market perceives to be the long term value of the acquisition. Just because they issue additional shares doesn’t mean every share automatically becomes worth less as long as what they buy with the new capital is worth equivalent or more than the cash received for the issued shares.

Aswath Damodoran, the Dean recently valued Intel at $29 using conservative assumptions. It’s trading at tangible book value. If QCOM did a stock swap assigning a relative valuation to INTC at slightly less than QCOM’s current valuation based on EV/EBITDA of 16 it would not be dilutive. INTC’s multiple is 11 on a depressed EBITDA. This implies a premium of 40% to Intels current stock valuation would be doable. Arguably the new QCOM is a bigger better company who would have a bunch of new assets and an in house foundry to make their chips, cutting out the markup they currently pay TSMC and SAMSUNG. It’s really a no brainer for them.",

      "body": "Qualcomm interest in Intel, which is not new, makes a lot of sense.  Qualcomm has said they want to expand into pc and data center chipsets, and Intel has the IP, industry know-how, and relationships to help make this happen.  It also seems regulators will be more willing to see a strategic domestic company with deep pockets step in to help keep Intel from failing.  It also appears there wouldn’t be monopoly issues where both companies are more collateral vendors than head to head competitors.  Interesting that Qualcomm opened an office in Folsom, CA a few months ago that is across the street from one of Intel’s largest pc, data center, and AI research facilities with 5,000+ employees.",
