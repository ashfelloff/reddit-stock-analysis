They manage free-cash flow so much better and breaking the companies up into 3 spinoffs have streamlined things brilliantly. \n\nThe aerospace division (“GE” ticker) still has tons of room to run and I expect a very positive earnings report later this month both in numbers from the previous quarter and guidance looking forward. \n\nIs there something I’m missing? This ticker has been a SMASH hit for me and I don’t see why that would stop anytime soon.\n\nPositions:\n\nGE 05/17 140c\nGE 06-21 145c\nGE 01/2025 160c",
