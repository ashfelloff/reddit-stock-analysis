Been trying to be more objective, balanced in my market anticipation and positions, but I DO NOT like this play.  All the individual mega-cap names are hitting resistance or falling. Msft working on an outside reversal.  Nothing wrong with expecting test of aths, but I do not like the timing one bit.  So your yolo will probably work, I hope it goes well for you!",
