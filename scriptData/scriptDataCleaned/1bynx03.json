  "selftext": "This is all I have to show for my trading carrer so far, a total loss of over 60k. After three years of working an average of 52hrs  per week, just so I can keep throwing money into the market. I started as I'm sure most you reading this, with a few thousands hopping to get a homerun. My first year was a total loss, at one point I was up $2000 but that was it. Second year was around the same but now It took me longer to the money, I've learned from a few mistakes but still not profitable.  This year I've finally developed a strategy that seens to be profitable but my lack of discipline and rush to recover my losses stopped me from taking gains, and keeping them once I made them. My username reveals my mindset at the time  I started trading, today that username is just a curse mark and constant reminder of the  cause for all my failures.  I have decided to trade my last 4000 (thanks to my tax returns), no more yolos, no more deposits. This time is the last time, either I make all my money back in the next three years, or I loose it all and burn in flames. I hope this post serves to inspire those that might be we I am, or on the way there, to reconsider your decisions and thier consequences, and hopefully evolve from degenerate gambler to regenerate trader.\n#regenerated #disregared",

Just ‚Äî maybe do some paper trading first so you don‚Äôt make those mistakes with real money.

That goes against what most people will say is riskier, but I‚Äôve found way more success. You will more likely than not be in the green at some point no matter what on weeklies and can sell if you don‚Äôt get greedy (I usually make auto sells at a price point so I don‚Äôt get greedy and lose it all), but on longer expos IV and market swings can absolutely fuck you and you‚Äôll wanna wait because there‚Äôs ‚Äúso much time for it to change,‚Äù and then it expires worthless.

I started as I'm sure most you reading this, with a few hits hopping to have a good time. My first year wasn't great, at one point I had a good night but that was it. Second year was around the same but now It took me longer to feel the high, I've learned from a few mistakes and now have a cleaner source for my drug. This year I've tried to stop, but I couldn't. My username reveals my mindset at the time I started doing drugs, today that username is just a curse mark and constant reminder of the cause for all my failures. I have decided to use my last 4000 (thanks to my tax returns) to buy more heroin, but then its over. This time is the last time, either I have one last good time or I get stuff laced with fentanyl and will be teleported to heaven. I hope this post serves to inspire those that might be we I am, or on the way there, to reconsider your decisions and their consequences, and hopefully evolve from heroin drug user to cannabis connoisseur.\n\nBro you got problems.
