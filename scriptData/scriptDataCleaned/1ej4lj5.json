It is just used to provide justification to force people to work their lives away just for basic food, shelter, healthcare.  The government could just provide those things to people but they don't because then they would not be able to force everyone into labor.  Completely unethical.  Make these damn rich people pay what they owe before creating these fucking bullshit coins that only exist as a testament to what a scam this entire socioeconomic system is.",

The issue is not taxing the rich. Rich people don't consume that much they park their money away or reinvest it. So the next time the government needs money it just ends up in the rich people's pocket because they're the ones who owns the companies where the money will end up anyways. Not taxing them also takes money out of circulation so the rate the government needs to create money out of thin air again is a lot more frequent. \n\nIt's so annoying that rich people can say with a straight face they pay a lot of taxes. They should! They have so much wealth and it's the country, infrastructure, and military that enable them to build that wealth and securely maintain it.
