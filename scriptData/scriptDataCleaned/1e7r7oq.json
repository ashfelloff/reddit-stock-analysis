While the Millennials are lazy ass, avo toast splurging, and world ruining spoiled brats.\n\nReality however is actually the opposite:\n\n1. The GREATEST GENERATION were strong men who lived through \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" technological disruption after another from factory lines, cars, electricity, radio, airplanes, etcetc. Saw a world going down in flames in \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" disasters. Fought wars in \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" world wars (twice!). Lived through multiple \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" market crashes. Had a \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" great depression. \"ONCE IN A CENTURY\" advent of nuclear weapons and potential nuclear annihilation. All before hitting the 40s and settling down with kids.\n\n2. The boomers? They came into a world born BUILT by greatest generation. Where homes were cheap, jobs were plentiful, the economy was booming, the world was full of resources, nature was left largely untouched by war even if some cities were destroyed, and the world was at peace.\n\n3. National debt was slowly paid off by the greatest generation after the war leaving the US at a low debt to GDP level.\n\n##And what did the boomers do with that?\n\n1. Most didn't study hard nor went to college. Even those that did followed the same path: they spent their days being anti-establishment and counter culture hippies. They had \"free love\" and orgies until STDs exploded. They did drugs until it became an epidemic. Went to wood stock, kumbaya, or whatever drug fueled music orgies they fancied.\n\n2. Even after doing that in their early 20s they still had a good job market to get into. Even non-HS grads can come out and land a good factor job that paid well enough to support a wife and kids. Homes were so readily available that even with a wife and kids an uneducated man can afford a home.\n\n3. Because the national debt was low and economy was strong boomers were allowed to borrow and buy homes as well as build wealth.\n\n##And what did the boomers do after they found success?\n\n1. Closed the job market by allowing free trade in to kill trade jobs. Fucked up the job market even worse with the GFC so that even college grads don't have jobs.\n\n2. Voted for politicians who were short sighted. They themselves keep holding onto power even when they don't represent the people well, openly trade, rack up national debt, and clearly are too old for the job.\n\n3. When given the reigns to corporations they either fucked them up and asked for bailouts airlines/banks/insurance/etcetc and/or held on to positions well past their prime.\n\n4. They got their homes and then closed the door behind them with their NIMBY policies and voting in anti-building politicians.\n\n5. They squandered the world's resources in a single generation while simultaneously trashing the oceans, killing off ecosystems, eroding the ozone, creating so much trash plastic that microplastics are in every single male's testicles (including newborn babies), making superdump after superdump, fueling global warming with their gas guzzlers, pushing climate change to the point where super disasters are NORMAL, and continue to fuck up the world as much as they can before they kick the bucket.\n\n6. Racked up the national debt to unseen and astronomical levels with no intention to stop or cut it back down. A big FUCK YOU to the next generation as they pass the check to them.",

If you pick the top 7 from AMZ and dust the worse performing 12 that would boost the performance by a large amount. Concentration after the fact is a terrible way to compare things. Mag 7 is 30% of the index AFTER their performance 4 years ago NVDA wasn't even in any mag 7 idea. Just pick NVDA and compare it to the performance of the mag7 and see how silly it is. S&P vs Nasdaq is also a bad comparison. Only useful comparisons are similar sized indexes or similar sized top performers as you say.\n\nEdit: FAANG which was the top before MAG 7 has a 5y performance of 205% so the minor change of shuffling only a couple companies already doubled the performance. Minor changes make a big difference with only a few companies.\n\nThis is the market cap of 20 years for the top 25 S&P companies. Every single company less is boosting performance because a single company had such a large increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xol8h5qoaodd1.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=9636e781f77a043f060fd6eefe7586caf5c15d7b",

The Great Recession didn’t start to turn around until the exact moment Fed Chair Bernanke promised that he wouldn’t let another bank fail.\n\nWhat the fed actually seems to be doing for the long run is pushing a situation of much higher prices, much more dollars in existence and severely exacerbated wealth inequality.
