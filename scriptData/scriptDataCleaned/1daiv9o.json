The average trading volume for NVDA is 65 million shares...the public float is made up of 65% institutional and 35% retail. So out of a 65 million trading volume that would be 42 million shares Institutional and 22 million retail. On a split date if Institutions are selling more than retail are buying you don't get much of a boost on the actual split date. Institutions have much more pull on the stock than retail. However historically stock prices rise during the weeks following the split date. Also take into consideration the impact a Fed meeting and CPI have on the market this coming Wednesday. Going into that from the split date could potentially create a muted response to the split...which creates a great buying opportunity this week on a pullback.",
