But a car company doing it because they do have a ton of hardware geeks they need to impress to hire into their recruitment funnels\n\nFacebook: social media sharing, ads network\n\nAmazon: delivery logistics until they got into cloud, takes over tons of start ups in all sorts of spaces\n\nApple: peak hardware, design, software company \n\nNetflix: movie streaming considered one of the top because they pay considerably better than other industry leaders and have a very engineering mindset\n\nGoogle: everything, everywhere\n\nTesla: competes with a lot of car engineering startups to recruit talent into the industry as the same engineers can be pulled into other industries just as well\n\nHaving a lot of money and tossing at expensive talent means you are a footprinting as a tech company whatever steps you take",

Maybe it’s just market cap, but they have a lot of clout for being a content distribution platform. They can claim some adjacency to Hollywood and celebrities though",

Have you heard throwing a \"Monkey Wrench into the gears\" well Netflix popularized it in tech with the Chaos Monkey (https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/). They would randomly shut down services and force engineering teams to harden the platform to work around internal services going down. It was the one I recall the most, but they're really focused on taking out poor performers knowing that it will create team friction. But not like Amazon does with stressing out their engineers and keeping those that can work in a toxic environment. Netflix had a reputation for virtuous cycle rather than toxic cycle and well paid. So that's absolutely a dream job for engineers.\n\nNetflix was also really big during the IoT (Internet of Things) era. Got to have every TV be smart tv. They were making the best Stream Guides on these platforms. Recommendation engines. Smart phones. Working out clear video on cell phone data, rural data, and then moving up to 4k video streams. \n\nIt's movie quality is criticized more than youtube video with a talking head vlogger at 4k. \n\nIMO It's a tech company within a parent media company really and moves like a tech company.",

US workers are going to be replaced by tele-operated robots, with the operator living in India getting paid dirt Indian wages. The real interesting question nobody is asking about is what happens when a tele-operated robot, acting via fake “autonomous AI”, goes off an assaults someone because the Indian operator is disgruntled and anonymous?

A lot of machine learning relies on human annotated data- my team (not Amazon, but household name company) works with another team that contracts people to collect feedback this way. The goal is that over time you curate a good training set and your reliance on the human annotated component drops. It's likely that Amazon wasn't reducing their dependency on annotations fast enough to make it worthwhile, but I think the media version was sensationalized and tried to make it sound like there were literally people just watching camera feeds in real time and marking orders, which is almost certainly not the reality. It was just that the quality of the models wasn't yet high enough where it could be completely human-free.\n\nThey also haven't killed off the technology- if you happen to live in Seattle, a lot of the arenas/stadiums have grab and go stores even today.",
