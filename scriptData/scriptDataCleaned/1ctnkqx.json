                          "body": "Most people don't actually know the history with Reddit's monetization efforts which is why the IPO was valued so low. It's honestly so good for people like us who want to accumulate while it's valued in the single digits still. Both wall street and the average investor just look at the raw numbers and how long its existed without knowing the context behind them and consider it a junk stock. Opportunities like this don't come around very often, if ever honestly lol. This is one of those companies that will make new millionaries years from now just because it was valued so unbelievably low at ipo\n\nFor anyone who isn't aware or hasn't read the S1, Reddit never tried to monetize before 2018. It took them less than 6 years to go from virtually no revenue to over a billion in revenue per year. They tripled revenue in the last 3 years alone lol. Advertisers are just starting to grasp how valuable of a platform it is recently and more and more companies are interested in their data to train their LLMs. It would take some really gross negligence on management's part to not break 3-4 billion in annual revenue over the next 3-5 years. Couple that with the fact that the cost of revenue for them is essentially nothing (they have an absolutely fucking insane 89% gross margin on their revenue), and they should be an extremely profitable company for years to come. They have an outstanding balance sheet (>2B in cash and less than 200M in debt) and an incredible margin on their business. Insane to me that anyone even has a bear case for this company right now. The fact that redditors are talking about reddit being worthless ON REDDIT tells you all you need to know honestly lol",
