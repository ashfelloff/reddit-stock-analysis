  "selftext": "Thank you PLTR and TSLA üò≠üò≠. Had 48 strike price calls on PLTR for earnings that started this momentum. Then got 307.5 strike calls on TSLA that got me to 25k. My only regret is not holding‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve done the math and with the calls I had if I held a few more days on both PLTR and TSLA I could easily have over 150k in my acct. I try not to think about it since I made great money and played it safe by not holding the calls overnight.",

Congratulations good sir, use the money wisely and don‚Äôt flush it all at once. You have the ability to even do successful day trades if you want now. 25k is the next step toward 100k+. You‚Äôve got this!",
