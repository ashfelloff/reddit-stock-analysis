      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Providing the bond market with very unique and insanely high performing securitized instruments.\n\nThey are delivering a BTC yield to shareholders, and have increased BTC per share by 18% just in 2024 (as of last month).\n\nAnd their market cap is now positioned where they are in line for inclusion into the biggest most important indexes: QQQ and SP500.\n\nWith that, they get passive flows in the billions, buying at any price.  And the initial allocations and rebalancing could be enormous.  From there, they are positioned to keep scraping it into BTC.\n\nAnd FASB adoption also approaching now in December.  When that happens, they will no longer be showing tiny or negative earnings (and their earnings will show the largest quarter on quarter increase maybe in history).  And that also is likely to raise a lot of attention, and also allow it to qualify as an investible equity for many institutions that won’t invest in equities that don’t meet certain criteria.\n\nAnyway, could go on and list another 100 or so reasons.\n\nI like it and I’m not letting go.

Providing the bond market with very unique and insanely high performing securitized instruments.\n\nThey are delivering a BTC yield to shareholders, and have increased BTC per share by 18% just in 2024 (as of last month).\n\nAnd their market cap is now positioned where they are in line for inclusion into the biggest most important indexes: QQQ and SP500.\n\nWith that, they get passive flows in the billions, buying at any price.  And the initial allocations and rebalancing could be enormous.  From there, they are positioned to keep scraping it into BTC.\n\nAnd FASB adoption also approaching now in December.  When that happens, they will no longer be showing tiny or negative earnings (and their earnings will show the largest quarter on quarter increase maybe in history).  And that also is likely to raise a lot of attention, and also allow it to qualify as an investible equity for many institutions that won’t invest in equities that don’t meet certain criteria.\n\nAnyway, could go on and list another 100 or so reasons.\n\nI like it and I’m not letting go.  For me, selling any at all would be too risky now.  Will rebalance in Q4 2025, but not liquidating shares.  This could easily be Apple at $5, imo.  (Or maybe Standard Oil.)\n\n(Just my conclusions and ideas.  DYOR.  NFA….)",

      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",
