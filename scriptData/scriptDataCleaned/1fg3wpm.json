You know capitalism is the society you were born into, and you're playing the hand you were dealt. Your mindset is better than most just by the fact that you're trying to learn how to be a trader, even if you're failing, don't give up.\n\nI will not let your misguided anger get under my skin. I've seen more than you ever likely will. Maybe your Dad left you guys, maybe your Mom is a hooker on fentanyl. I dont know man. Maybe you just got dealt the shittiest hand, but remember, it could be worse, it always can.\n\nStay up, king. You'll make it if you never give up.",
