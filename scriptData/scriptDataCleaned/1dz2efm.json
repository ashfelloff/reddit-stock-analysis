I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\n**News:** [Generic-Viagra Safety Called Into Doubt After False Data Found by FDA](file:///C:/Users/edwar/Desktop/winning_watchlist/watchlists/Generic-Viagra%20Safety%20Called%20Into%20Doubt%20After%20False%20Data%20Found%20by%20FDA)\n\n**INDV**- Issued a 2024 profit warning, also announced discontinuation of sales their schizophrenia drug Perseris.\n\n**HELE-** (Parent of consumer brands such as Hydro Flask, Drybar, Revlon, Vicks, Braun). Reported EPS of $.99 vs $1.59. Lowered fiscal outlook for 2025.  \n\n**BP-**  Warned of $2B impairment in their second quarter, mainly due to BP’s charges of refineries in Germany.  \n\n**AAPL-** Still looking at the $230 level, but other than that not going to play this short\n\n**PARA-** Read a Reuters article that supposedly values PARA closer to $13 rather than $15 as most people believe.\n\n**AMZN-** And again, watching AMZN.
