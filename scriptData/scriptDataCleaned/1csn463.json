If there is less time, the value of your contracts will go down.  If there is a huge swing, your contracts will experience a huge change in premium as well.  If it expires then OTM you will lose all of the money you put in. You only have to buy the 100 shares if you execute your contract.  Also, for asking if a stock is ITM it will be valued less, in some cases yes. That is why you look at a break even price. Break even price is the price the stock has to be for you to make exactly zero dollars when the contract expires",
