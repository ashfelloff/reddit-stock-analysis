  "selftext": "Nvidia surpassed $3 trillion in market cap during intraday trading on Wednesday as investors continue to clamor for the company making most of the chips powering the AI boom.\n\nNvidia shares were up more than 4% to $1,219 at one point during intraday trading on Wednesday.\n\nNvidia’s milestone is the latest stunning mark in a run where the stock price has gone parabolic as investors bet on artificial intelligence. Shares are up over 3,224% over the last five years. It will split its stock 10-1 later this month.\n\nApple was the first U.S. company to reach a $3 trillion market cap in January 2022. Microsoft hit $3 trillion in market value in January 2024.\n\nIn May, Nvidia reported first-quarter earnings that suggested demand for the company’s pricey and powerful AI chips, often called GPUs, showed no sign of slowing down. Nvidia reported overall sales of $26 billion, more than triple what the company reported a year ago. Nvidia also beat Wall Street expectations for sales and earnings and said it would report revenue of about $28 billion in the current quarter.\n\nNvidia shares have surged in recent years, powered by the tech industry’s need for its chips, which are used to develop and deploy big artificial intelligence models like the one at the heart of OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nCompanies such as Google, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are buying billions of dollars of Nvidia’s graphics processing units.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/nvidia-briefly-passes-3-trillion-market-cap-on-back-of-ai-boom.html",

                          "body": "Recently watched a video that went into detail about this. Here are a few things I remember off the top of my head.\n\n* Most people in these positions are experts in their field, super motivated and disciplined, strive to get better and better. So yes, now they're multimillionaires but they're not the type of people to just quit and retire in their 30s or 40s. If they leave, they're likely quitting to start something new or join another start up.\n* Most of these tech companies are in expensive ass areas. NVIDIA for example is in the bay area which can fetch a few million dollars for a basic house. Maybe their stock options turned into $5 mil and then they buy a nice house for $4 mil, bought a new car, etc. Seems crazy for the average person in Ohio but I can see them running through it quickly after high taxes in California,\n* Lifestyle inflation along with their personal networks. Sure you made $10 million, but that's a small fish in the big pond of silicon valley. Your coworker has $15 million. Your ex coworker at Google has $20 million. Your new neighbor in your multi million dollar neighborhood has $50 million and is your boss. Maybe you could move to Ohio and retire at 35 but if you're in that kind of situation to begin with I'm sure you're just even more motivated to keep working.\n* These people also just like their jobs. You're not working at an insurance company making phone calls all day. You're working for THEE fastest growing company and making history. You have a great CEO and their company is built very well where you don't deal with 100 levels of management and if you have any seniority you're only a few levels away from talking/working with the CEO. I think he has like 50 direct reports or something like that (this is why they're so profitable and run so well). That's got to be an exciting work environment even if it's high demand.",

But next gen AI whether this coming one or next will very likely take the current schema of “AI is only really useful if you know how to implement it” to “AI is effective enough in the eyes of CEOs/board members that large layoffs happen and society as a whole changes probably for the worse”. I say this based on a decent but not expert understanding of how AI works, a knowledge of what the limitations are, and that even if the rumors about next gen AI metrics are overestimated by 50%, it’s going to be a sizesble leap in capability and performance. Hence why I said this gen or next. This level of AI usefulness is coming, it is just a matter of when.\n\nThe main question is, is there enough grid power to support the data centers required to support the processing power necessary to achieve that. I work in the industry and I can say generally most tech companies just seem to be competing to get to that point first. Just the amount of concrete being poured for new data centers across the world is truly astounding.\n\nYour overall point about Nvidia’s growth being reliant on the greater economy is definitely a good one but what I’ll say about that is in a tight economy if AI exists in sufficient enough ability by the time the economy turns sour, the layoffs as companies look for ways to cut cost will be very significant. Even if the AI actually isn’t on par with humans yet but “close enough”. \n\nQuarterly profits above humanity per usual. ",

Kind of how nuclear deterrence works would Apple or Microsoft want a world where their products can't sell to the masses because no one has money because AI replaced them? That alone should put guardrails up for the uses of AI and deter the current tech giants from ushering in and AI revolution that leads to the demise of the companies that created it. Of course it's possible there are outcomes we can't even imagine right now.  \n\nAnd since we took a nice detour from the original post I'll say as an NVDA holder I'm hopeful that AI continues to scale, governments use a light hand to help ensure there are still humans with jobs and money, and the economy booms because we find a synergy and efficiency with AI at our disposal.",

Never look to a billionaire for rational behavior, bad track record of being partially detached from reality.\n\nOut of curiosity, when you say productivity gains do you just mean that people don’t lose their jobs and just “learn to use AI” type of productivity? Because beyond customer service other job types are also already starting to be replaced. Are these jobs that I’d consider shocking that current AI can replace? No, but the grim reaper of advanced AI will slowly come for all white collar workers over time. Some types of work will take longer to replace for sure.\n\nI’d bet that we both strongly agree that if AI only appears flashy enough and actually isn’t all that, people in charge will think they can replace humans with AI who they definitely can’t and it will backfire.
