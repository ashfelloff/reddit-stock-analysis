Furthermore: LMS is being replaced by LXP (learning experience platforms) which are another tier of competition. There are also platforms that are built around pre-existing content (e.g., Healthstream, Relias in the healthcare training space).\n\nDocebo is not an awful product but I demoed and didn’t care for certain aspects. We ended up selecting and deploying a different LMS platform. Fedramp info may be true but fed moves slow and LMS platforms are sticky and difficult to unwind.",

There are so few auditors across the US that technically it could take up to 3 years to become compliant. All these external IT companies /MSP's supporting engineering companies are going to need to get fedramp certified in order to support them. It's basically a race to see who gets it first so they can keep+steal business.",
