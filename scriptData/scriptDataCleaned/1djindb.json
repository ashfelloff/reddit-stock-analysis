  "selftext": "I am still holding my calls and now even more so believe in HPE. They said in their earnings they closed a contract with MSFT to be their AI systems supplier and just announced “Nvidia AI computing by HPE”, that has to be what they are referencing. If the then biggest company in the market liked that product before it was announced to the world and decided to jump in with them then my statement remains. \n\nIn what world does their partnership with the now biggest company in the market, together selling a range of “turnkey AI integration” products to the other biggest companies in the market and the US Gov not double or triple their valuation. They are poised to have a shot at being an industry leader and now have the products and contracts to prove it. Not trying to be bullish just because I made a gamble on Aug calls before earnings. I wanna know anyone’s real bearish opinions on them.\n\nEdit: musk sucks a little but he will be heading tsla now for a while since everything got approved, he also mentioned needing to start sourcing AI integration systems from Nvidia for helping his auto drive functions. Sounds like in the next year him and other auto companies may jump on board buying from HPE",
