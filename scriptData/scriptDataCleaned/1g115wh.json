And it won't be for a long time. \nWhy you ask? \n\n\nBecause every other automotive company lobbying world wide will sandbag it on a political level until they introduce their competing systems. \n\n\nBecause regulators actually have a point in not approving a technology that has little to no redundancy in sensors and may cause  lot of accidents. The burden of proof is with Tesla on this one. It's absolutely baffling how Tesla shills actually reiterate that regularly approval will just happen because the data shows it's safe. It. Will. Not.\n\n\nTesla better whip up another presentation for December and reveal their 25t$ model2 and a production version of the roadster 2.0 shipping beginning of 2025 or they lose all credibility at this point.",
