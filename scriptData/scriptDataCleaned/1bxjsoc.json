  "selftext": "Next week Wednesday and Thursday will be, without a doubt, one of the most volatile days of the year with Inflation YoY, CPI, and FOMC minutes all releasing next Wednesday. Not only that, we have initial jobless claims and PPI MoM releasing the next day. \n\nClearly, there’s no synchronicity within the fed as you have some saying they’re on the right path and others saying the opposite. What these people say has a huge impact on the market as seen last week and next week could see some serious damage. \n\nMy guess is they’re going to come to a conclusion they’re only going to do 1 cut sometime this year, maybe 2 if we’re lucky. 10 year yield is at 4.4% and inflation is still creeping up. The market is in serious need for a correction and they know they should rip the band-aid off now before election season. \n\nI’ll most likely buy $7.5 UVXY 4/19 calls on Monday or Tuesday depending on what happens Monday. If positive news comes out next Wednesday, best believe I’ll be buying SPY calls. SPY has literally been trading sideways for almost 2 months now and market confidence is uncertain at this point. Next week will make or break the bull market. \n\nWhat’s your plays for next week?",

But this is outrageously stupid. \n\nDespite sticky inflation, perhaps even reaccelerating higher, AND treasury yields climbing higher (the correction in 2022-2023 was pre-cursed by rising bond yields, because fixed-income portfolio managers look at macro data), the Fed has done everything in their power to maintain a “wait and see more data” approach, as not to spook the markets (probably for a political agenda).\n\nEffectively, this approach has led to putting ALL of the chips on this next CPI print. There’s no pussyfooting anymore if this print comes in hot, with the FOMC meeting 3 weeks thereafter. \n\nThere’s no guarantee it’ll be a bad report, but there’s no overreaction if it is. \n\nIt’ll be multiple blood red days, again, because the market is begging for a correction and the fed will be forced to go from 3 rate cuts to less, or none. \n\nAnd oh by the fucking way.
