It just means that if you sold a security (stock, option, etc) for a loss you cannot buy that same security for 30 days if you want to deduct those losses from gains/taxes. Its easier to avoid the Wash Sale rule with Options because even if you buy an Option for the same stock, its considered a different security as long as the strike price or expiration date is different that the one you took the loss on.\n\nHOLDING a stock for more than 30 days has nothing to do with the Wash Sale Rule. The only benefit of holding for a longer period of time would be holding for at least 365 days so its taxed at 15% versus what ever your regular income tax rate is, which is always higher than 15%.",

To sell calls you need to own 100 shares  of the underlying stock, which in this case is SPY.(we're ignoring selling naked calls because it's extremely risky and you won't be approved for it anyway) \n\nSelling a call means that you agree to sell your 100 shares at a set price before a set date. For agreeing to do this you receive money from the buyer called a premium. The person buying the call can choose to execute the contract at any point before it expires, meaning they choose to buy your shares. If you sell a call you typically hope the stock price stays flat. If you buy a call you're hoping the price goes up. Whoever bought his calls has the right to buy 100 shares of spy at 507.50 a share, if spy was to go up to 515 before the call expires the buyer gets to buy the stock at a discount of $750. The buyer could also just resell the call for a profit since the stock price going up will make the calls price go up\n\nThat is the very basics of how a call option works. There's a ton to learn about options before using them because they give you access to a lot of leverage and if you mess up you could potentially lose more money then you even have to start",
