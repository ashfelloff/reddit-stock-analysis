  "score": 317,
  "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices on Monday said it plans to acquire server maker ZT Systems for $4.9 billion as the company seeks to expand its portfolio of artificial intelligence chips and hardware and battle Nvidia.\n\nAMD plans to pay for 75% of the ZT Systems acquisition with cash and the remainder in stock. The company had $5.34 billion in cash and short-term investments as of the second quarter.\n\nThe computing requirements for AI have dictated that tech companies string together thousands of chips in clusters to achieve the necessary amount of data crunching horsepower. Stringing together the vast numbers of chips has meant the makeup of whole server systems has become increasingly important, which is why AMD is acquiring ZT Systems.\n\n“AI systems are our number one strategic priority,” AMD CEO Lisa Su said in an interview with Reuters.\n\nThe addition of ZT Systems engineers will allow AMD to more quickly test and roll out its latest AI graphics processing units (GPUs) at the scale cloud computing giants such as Microsoft require, Su said.\n\n“The main way (ZT Systems) is additive to the company is we sell more GPUs,” Su said.\n\nAMD plans to break off its server manufacturing business and sell it once the deal closes, as it has no plans to compete with companies such as Super Micro Computer, Su said.\n\nAMD has not yet held talks with potential buyers.\n\nZT Systems Chief Executive Frank Zhang will join AMD and report to AMD’s data center chief, Forrest Norrod.\n\nThe closely held ZT Systems has roughly 2,500 employees of which AMD plans to retain about 1,000 engineers. Currently, ZT Systems generates annual revenue of roughly $10 billion, Su said.\n\nExecutives expect the deal to close in the first half of 2025 and expect an additional 12 to 18 months to sell the manufacturing business.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang said at the company’s developer conference in March that the one-time chip designer now creates and sells entire data centers, or the individual components needed to build one. This year analysts expect the company to generate $105.9 billion from its data center segment, which includes chips and other AI hardware. Su said last month the company expects to collect roughly $4.5 billion worth of AI chip revenue this year. The company’s customers include Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nAMD expects ZT Systems to contribute to the company’s adjusted financial performance by the end of 2025.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/amd-to-acquire-server-builder-zt-systems.html",

Today AMD provides chips and relies on 3rd-party integrators.  This acquision will help them compete in some of the same markets where NVidia, including perhaps hosting their own GPUs and providing AI tokens as a service.",

I train AI models for a living and have yet to see lots of Virtual Machine offerings with AMD CPUs with NVIDIA GPUs. Even the weakest K80 and T4 GPUs, I havent seen any AMD CPU being paired with it on both AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud platform providers or SaaS. Top platforms such as Modal and Bento do not provide such offerings. Maybe in PCs. I use Ryzen + RTX for local development. I believe in AMD in CPUs thats why I want them to win the CPU race.\n\nBenchmarks mean nothing if they dont get adopted by developers, frameworks, SaaS, companies, etc. I will start shifting my view when I attend a conference or see research papers that use AMD as their machine for training. Right now, Pytorch and Tensorflow have shit integration with RocM and most pruning and sparsification techniques are tied to NVIDIA GPUs",

NVDA is a heavily vertically-integrated AI solution provider, from raw hardware to networked stacks to software. On-site, colocate, or TaaS (tokens as a service).  AMD currently produces only the bottom layer, relying on purchasers or 3rd parties to integrate and provide the software interface.",

My success is on my sleeve.\n\n\nYou are right. And AMD will still see success, especially in tight margin applications like consoles, but that's same old story for them. In fact, the pushes coming from msft, meta, Google, and Amazon would make me very nervous for AMDs future in the server space.\n\n\nThere's a chance this acquisition never pays itself off.",
