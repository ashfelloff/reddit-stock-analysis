  "selftext": "There are multiple discussions on various threads that a Fed rate cut shall unleash the bull and take the equities market to stratosphere.\nWhile interest rate regime are very important factor but even more important is an investor outlook of the economy and his/her expectations in coming quarters.\n\nUS economy has done phenomenally well post covid [one of the best GDP growth among OCED countries] but at the same time has been beset by inflation. \n\nA high inflation is extremely corrosive to an economy and may end with burst of asset bubbles which spreads misery all around: and if interest rate tool is blunted [too low rates] then it will become even more difficult to reignite the economic engine.\n\nSo Fed had to intervene and bring down the inflation to benign levels (one may argue if it means 2%, or 2.5% or 3%, but I am not an economist).\n\nThankfully, US interest rates are on downward trajectory and while GDP growth has slipped (2.8%) and unemployment figures have rise (4.3%) , this is no cause for a panic [at least just yet].\n\nUS economy is in midst of enjoying new level of prosperity thanks to AI and other technological advancements, and so secular growth trends are very much intact. \n\nIt is likely, US Fed shall start the cutting cycle in September with 25 basis points. \n\nFunds and astute investors have already been rotating out of over valued sectors [tech & AI] in favour of relatively undervalued sectors and companies [small caps, commodities, electricity, energy, airlines, agricultural commodities].\n\nThis rebalancing is causing certain popular stocks to plummet while certain [till recently] obscure stocks to rise.\n\nThe indices Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 will rise at a slower pace than FH 2024. But smart investors may boost returns by trimming tech positions, and by fortifying their portfolios with strong companies in small caps, commodities ,energy, airlines, and agricultural commodities sectors.

About Nov 2022, when the 'hike shock' had been processed by the market, and even though the FFR had just been bumped by another 75 bps to 3.75-4.00% (which means we've had another 150bps of hikes to go)\n\nFor what little a random retail trader's estimations are worth:\n\nThe market could keep dipping lower for a while, then, *supposing* the cuts are mild enough (25-50bps at a time, and no 100+ panic cuts on terrible data), we could see tech and large caps commencing a new bullrun once we're halfway+ to ZIRP, like 1.50-2.00% fed funds rate.\n\nAt these levels of overnight rate it's almost impossible for the stock market to not trend upwards for the mere fact that money supply goes up by a whole lot, bonds are giving back very little and risk appetite grows substantially.",

Rate cuts encourage economic activity meaning more people invest driving prices up\n\n2. Lower discount rates mean higher valuations which in turn increases intrinsic values\n\n3. Increased investing and more economic activity within firms driving profits up\n\nIt’s not 1:1 of rate cut = bull but come on give it some\nCredibility. AI is all about high levels of investment at the minute, and people are saying they are overvalued, cutting rates decreases the overvaluation and increases spending.",
