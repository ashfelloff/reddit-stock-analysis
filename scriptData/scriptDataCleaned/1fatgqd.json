I was right about Polestar going up and Nvidia going down so thereâ€™s that but I am a college student in the army 2 yr of credits going for a business admin degree and also have 2 years of tech school in entrepreneurship. Wolfspeed will 10x. Polestar will 2x. Nvdx will 2x. Nvda will ATH. Tesla depends on election but from its current point could get attacked if dems win or go underregulated if republicans win =$$$$. Same with Facebook and meta trump wins $$$ dems win= investigation im independent but those companies lean republican rn heavy and are risking a lot for an election result. If dems win anything green new deal will go up and EV/ reduced emissions. I think market will be highly unstable until U.S. elections.",
