  "selftext": "There’s no way for us regular joes to make or lose money on this.  This is coming someone who has worked in the field and still talks to people working in the field.  \n\nIn the near future you’ll have public offerings of AI HyperScalers like Cweave but be warned this is likely going to be pump and dump. \n\nI’m not saying this is right but there’s a lot of inconsistencies you should consider.   \n\nI know everyone is going to say I’m wrong but I’ve correctly pointed AMD rise, INTC demise (this I am reminded every week that INTC is a value play but Intel has fallen every year for 6 years), NVDA becoming the most valuable company, SMCI scam.   Many of them years before it happens.  \n\nOver half a decade  ago I was one of the first to test AMD server chips and thought the perfromance/watt would propel AMD this performance/watt ratio gap for anyone in the field is a dead giveaway INTC would dead company in the future.  How long I didn’t know but I knew Intel was a dying company 6+ years ago.  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\n3 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I thought they would be the AI leader. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price and possibly the most valuable company in the world.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nSix months ago when SMCI was being pushed on to the public I said it was a scam to fleece retail.  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw9c8l/goldman_sachs_and_morgan_knowingly_offering_scams/\n\nI didn’t know when the timing of the dump was but I said it’d be under $100 in the future before all the accounting fraud reports came. \n\nDigging around and talking with people in the field be very careful when Coreweave get offered, it may pump, even for a year but their numbers are going to be cooked.    \n\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/1f3zgbh/looks_like_nvda_growth_was_not_organic_possible/",

So I don’t know the exact but it seems very fishy and makes me think PE loaned money to 2.6 billion to coreweave to pump up SMCI and NVDA revenue numbers and they are going dump on retail? \n\nhttps://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/\n\nI can’t put my finger on it but there’s definitely alarm bells ringing",
