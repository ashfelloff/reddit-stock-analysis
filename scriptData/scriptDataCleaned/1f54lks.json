  "selftext": "MongoDB¬†shares jumped as much as 16% in extended trading Thursday after the database software maker reported healthy fiscal second-quarter earnings and pushed up full-year guidance.\n\nHere‚Äôs how the company did against LSEG consensus:\n\n* **Earnings per share:**¬†70 cents adjusted vs. 49 cents expected\n* **Revenue:**¬†$478.1 million vs. $464.1 million\n\nMongoDB‚Äôs revenue grew 13% year over year in the quarter that ended July 31, according to a¬†[statement](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mongodb-inc-announces-second-quarter-fiscal-2025-financial-results-302234446.html). The quarter‚Äôs net loss came to $54.5 million, or 74 cents per share, compared with $37.6 million, or 53 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\n‚ÄúWe believe we are incredibly well positioned to help customers incorporate generative AI into their business and modernize their legacy application estate,‚Äù CEO Dev Ittycheria said in the statement.\n\nThe company‚Äôs Atlas cloud database service enjoyed modestly better consumption than expected, he said on a conference call with analysts.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, Atlas consumption growth slowed as clients observed more challenging economic conditions, and usage in the fiscal second quarter implied that the climate did not change, Ittycheria said.\n\n‚ÄúWe generally have not seen the macro environment impact our ability to win new business, and that was true in Q2 as well,‚Äù Ittycheria said. ‚ÄúWe realized that this is different from what you hear from some other software vendors.‚Äù\n\nOn Thursday Ash Kulkarni, CEO of search software maker¬†Elastic, said the volume of client commitments it closed in its¬†[fiscal first quarter](https://ir.elastic.co/news/news-details/2024/Elastic-Reports-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2025-Financial-Results/default.aspx)¬†was below plan. That stock was down 23% after hours. During the MongoDB call, Ittycheria talked about helping companies migrate from Elastic products.\n\nWith respect to guidance, MongoDB called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 65 cents to 68 cents per share on $493.0 million to $497.0 million in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected 60 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $478.8 million in revenue.\n\nManagement nudged up its fiscal 2025 forecast. MongoDB now sees $2.33 to $2.47 per share in adjusted earnings, with $1.92 billion to $1.93 billion in revenue. That‚Äôs up from the May guidance of $2.15¬†to¬†$2.30 in adjusted earnings per share and $1.88 billion¬†to¬†$1.90 billion in revenue. Analysts had predicted $2.26 per share in adjusted earnings, along with $1.90 billion in revenue.\n\nExcluding the after-hours move, MongoDB shares were down almost 40% on the year, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% in the same period.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/mongodb-mdb-q2-earnings-report-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/mongodb-mdb-q2-earnings-report-2025.html)",
