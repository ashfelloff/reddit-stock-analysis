If you sold 50 chicken burritos, each with 8 oz or chicken, the computer simply does the math and expects that you will have consumed no more than 400 oz of chicken. If you used more, you're overdelivering and need to cut back, because chicken is expensive.\n\n\nI used to work as a shift lead at a different franchise and we did inventory on perishables literally every single night. If there's any kind of overusage of ingredients going on, the computer system and the managers are going to know within the day. And yes, they will bug their employees about it.
