If you sold 50 chicken burritos, each with 8 oz or chicken, the computer simply does the math and expects that you will have consumed no more than 400 oz of chicken. If you used more, you're overdelivering and need to cut back, because chicken is expensive.\n\n\nI used to work as a shift lead at a different franchise and we did inventory on perishables literally every single night. If there's any kind of overusage of ingredients going on, the computer system and the managers are going to know within the day. And yes, they will bug their employees about it.

Was chipotle late to the inflation/shrinkflation game, and now as the late entry are receiving the brunt of the fire? \n\nI loved chipotle growing up. My dad got the shot end of the divorce but I remember the meals with him at chipotle and I couldn’t recall a single dinner out with my mom at a nice restaurant. I used to love chipotle, probably for that reason. But the food was always banger and valuable. I haven’t been in years and me and my dad get together for lunch at a local sub shack on the side of the traffic circle now. \n\nI was not surprised when chipotle ran during the pandemic, I was surprised with how long and high it ran. \n\nIs this stock overvalued or undervalued, in your opinion, as of market close today?",
