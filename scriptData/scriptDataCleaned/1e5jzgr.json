If we assume that options contracts are always priced at fair market value, and because we know that IV crush causes the fair market value of an options contract to go down over time, then we can conclude that the expected value of investing in options will always be negative.

Maybe this is the wrong place to seek help because plenty enablers, or callous people, or also people in the same boats or unqualified individuals.\n\nThe first step is to recognize one has a problem, whether he  confess it on here or another website.
