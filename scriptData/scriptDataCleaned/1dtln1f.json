It’s a great resource, I appreciate the folks that took the time to make it available. I’m about to dig in!\n\nThat being said, I downloaded and app called “My Learn” and “Trading View” Any suggestions on other apps or resources? I am hoping to gain a good understanding of how to understand vitals, properly research, and make an educated decision. I want to take guess work out of my decisions as much as possible. \n\nThanks in advance ",
