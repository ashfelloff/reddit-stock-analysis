Why would the extrinsic value drop like a rock today given how long dated the contract is?\n\nOverall my shares are up 150% since I bought them while the calls are up 360% and I bought shares and options at the same time. So overall, the calls are behaving as I would expect versus shares (leveraged gains) except specifically today, where they are deleveraged. Weird.",
