This makes it a unique option in the market.\n   - Many people in the USA and Europe eagerly await Novavax's vaccine, especially since it has already been selected for vaccination campaigns in countries like France.\n\n2. **Matrix-M: A Game-Changing Vaccine Adjuvant**:\n   - Novavax's success isn't solely tied to its COVID-19 vaccine. The real game-changer is Matrix-M, a patented vaccine adjuvant.\n   - Matrix-M is a cutting-edge biotech innovation that will play a crucial role in future vaccines.\n   - Sanofi, a major pharmaceutical company, has even signed a contract with Novavax to use Matrix-M in their upcoming flu and COVID vaccines.\n   - This positions Novavax as a company with significant potential for future royalties.\n\n3. **Malaria Vaccine R21/Matrix-M**:\n   - Novavax's collaboration extends beyond COVID-19. They're part of a groundbreaking malaria vaccine project.\n   - The R21/Matrix-M vaccine, developed jointly by Oxford University, Serum Institute of India, and Novavax, boasts an impressive efficacy rate of 77%.\n   - For the first time, we have two vaccines available to combat malaria, a disease responsible for over 600,000 deaths annually (with 80% of victims being children under 5).\n   - In 2025, up to 100 million people could receive this vaccine, marking a significant step forward in global health.\n\n4. **Investment Outlook**:\n   - Novavax's stock is poised for growth. While it may not reach the astronomical heights seen during the COVID frenzy (200++++), it's still promising.\n   - Expect gradual increases: from $25-$30 (maximum by September), to $35-$40 (December 2024), and potentially $50-$100 (within 12 months).\n\n\n\n",

As several mutations arose, it helped reduce severity because the antibodies would be similar and able to help your body learn how to combat the strain you have more quickly as opposed to fighting it completely blind. This is similar to how flu and cold virus vaccines work. Did you not take any immunology or pathology courses in school?

This certainly won’t be the end considering it isn’t even FDA approved yet and with climate change that shit is already arriving in Europe and US. \n\nMalaria affects similar countries and even though compared to Dengue it „suffers“ from climate change, it is still perceived as the far more significant threat. \n\nTherefore I am not sure about your LoL but I also do not understand enough about this topic to LoL at you :)",
