Unfortunately the market dipped in the last few minutes but I sold for a total of $20,000 at a price of $91 per contract (purchase price of $23)\n\nMy last post I turned $400 in to $4000 with 0 DTE spy. And after a few trades I put my entire portfolio again today. I am officially done, for the short term at least.\n\nPlease don’t try to repeat this, it took months of being at a loss and a massive amount of luck lately. You won’t have the same result.",
