Was this simply a bigger chunk of players realizing profits? That crazy spike on nvda volume Friday eod was spectacular. What do you expect next week? Flatline, a modest growth, slow decline or start of a landfall? No real reason for the latter but apparently nowadays no reasons are needed for significant leaps and drops.\nI feel with nvda shareholders meeting and month-end (remember end of may power hour before close) anything can happen.",
