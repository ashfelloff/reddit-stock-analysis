              "body": "NO! WRONG! You're smarter than them in the sense that you found the arbitrage. \n\nIf you're buying Costco gold bars, buying with the BoA CC that gives you 3% cash back online (up to 5.25%), and stacking that with the 2% executive member bonus? Then you're buying gold below spot most of the time and technically just churning for cash/points. If you also found a way to sell the gold bars at near market price and/or are willing to wait a few days/weeks since gold is rising this year then you're also making money on the appreciation on gold price. If you're holding gold long then you're up 15% YTD. DIS/NKE/SBUX/MCD/LVMH/UPS/ChinaIndexes/etcetc all sucking ass this year.\n\nIt's smart because me and the other mofos buying gold off Costco are also doing that. Some might not sell their gold, others might use 2% cards without limits like the BoA, some keep opening new cards to get the signup bonus + 0%APR since gold is going up anyways to play the long game, etcetcetc. But each are smart because they found the arbitrage. That's why discussion on forums/subreddits about this method is so split. Folks either get it or they don't.\n\nYou just happen to ALSO be EXTREMELY REGARDED because you sold the gold for cash and don't repeat the cycle or just put it into something like VOO. Instead you're a degen regard who dumped it into NVDA calls at the peak AFTER it's ran up like 10000000%.",
