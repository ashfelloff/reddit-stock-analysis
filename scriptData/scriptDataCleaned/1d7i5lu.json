Fuck. I wish I had $2k…. I wish I had $200, fuck, I wish I had $2. Anybody want to meet me behind the Wendy’s dumpster for a good time? I’m not gay, but $20 is $20.\n\nEdit: also you’re kind of insane for letting that much ride still. You should close out a few hundred k more, liquid is always better than risk. Speaking of risk, of that few hundred k closed out, you should throw like 50k back into options and get fucking filthy rich. I’d get fucking calls long term, short term, and some puts to hedge too. But that’s why I’m poor and you’re rich probably.",
