Like they aren’t giving Ukraine and Israel actually money they are sending them stuff to that value. So that money is already in the military budget or weapons that will just lie ideal. USA does this for influence & strength & that influence keeps things like the USA dollar as the globals default currency and the USA market as the primary purchasing power. Israel is essentially for containing the Middle East and oil supplies. Regardless of what you think about how Israel or Ukraine function the reason is that it’s in the USA’s interest to do so. Other countries and allies will cozy up to Russia or China if they don’t believe that the USA will be there to protect them. All of which keeps the USA as the biggest global economy and keeps trade going that helps the USA. \nIf you want universal healthcare like every other developed county then you need to tax your billionaires. It’s that simple. The deficit rose under Trump because of tax breaks to the richest. The USA economy has to tax the super rich more and use that on more projects like Biden’s infrastructure spree which creates growth and jobs and taxes so that growth outstrips the deficit. \nUSA also pays more than any other country in healthcare despite ranking 13th in healthcare standards. Too much unproductive money going to middlemen like health insurance businesses - who are designed to deny claims. \nSo structurally USA just needs to adopt a higher rate of taxation for the top 1% and genuinely it would fund all your issues like healthcare and child poverty. It would have no effect on the USA market.",

Saying taxes doesn’t make money is stupidly regarded. Trickle down economics doesn’t work; taxation of the higher class increases productivity, efficiency and reduces the deficit. During USA highest rates of growth it had far higher levels of taxes than now; put down your Hayek and actually read economics from a noble winning economist; you want to lower the deficit and create a more equal country taxes are the way to do that. Rich people just hoard their resources meaning you actually take out capital from the productive cycle; higher taxes on corporations and individuals mean they are actually more likely to use that money to create more profit driving innovation instead of just hoarding it. Fact is you have had Trump/Bush and the deficit went up hugely. Last time USA returned a surplus? Clinton.",

If the markets are trading a lot above their moving averages and are due for a pullback, then a big international event typically triggers a market correction, even if that event does not have much relevance for the economy, take e.g. the Hamas attack against Israel. \n\nIt's then a matter of traders deciding to cash in on their profits so that they can watch the news instead of monitoring the charts. If the markets are already down to the shorter-term moving averages, then the markets would be in for a rebound, but such a rebound may then be shallower and stall out as traders decide to follow whatever international event is occurring.",
