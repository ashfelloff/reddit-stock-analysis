It was a great commuter car.  The self driving was great feature not perfect. Y any means but I loved it when stuck in heavy traffic.  Up until they introduced driver eye sight tracking. That shit was creepy.   Either way tho great car would get another if my situation changed.   \n\nAnother thing to point out is if you take hard data and not media reports then Tesla’s are safer than standard vehicles.  They have a reputation for blowing up however gasoline cars are much more likely to burn according to a Swedish study.\n\nSo ya thanks for making me defend a valid point about aerospace and making it about some car",
