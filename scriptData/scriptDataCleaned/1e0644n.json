Not too much to assume earnings will follow suit.\n\nSo then it’s all about forward guidance.\nTheir 2nd half is stronger than first mainly due to phone upgrade cycles. TSMC current guidance is 20-25% revenue growth. But they are now at 28% already.\n\nDo they have the nerve to sandbag and maintain 20-25%.
