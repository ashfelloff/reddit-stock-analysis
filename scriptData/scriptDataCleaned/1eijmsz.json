I just had to firmly believe my thesis that they would surprise us on earnings and show off that buying BTC at ridiculously low interest rates would make the price closer to 2k once folks did the math. I'm wrong but not dead. I  didn't but 0DTE calls on Intel. So I guess I have that going for me which is nice.",
