If you don't have enough workers to fill the open jobs, you raise wages to attract lazy Americans to get off their ass and go to work.

Higher product prices = higher inflation.\n\nIn this case, too many jobs added is okay because there're lots of immigrants (legal + illegal) coming to US recently to fill those empty positions, so it's not inflationary because you don't have worker shortage.\n\nPreviously, you can only add 100k jobs a month to accommodate the new teenagers and young adults getting jobs. You add more and eventually there's no one else to work. Because of immigrants coming here looking for jobs, you can actually add 200-250k jobs a month and still not run out of workers, so 300k jobs isn't that \"hot\".",

                      "body": "Yes so for a high inflation cycle, typically after input prices spike, initially businesses eat those costs jnto margins first because they are reluctant to raise prices. Then after a while, consumers start accepting that high inflation is prevalent, then businesses raise prices. Then consumers start realizing wages aren't keeping up with inflation, they start asking for higher wages.\n\nNow after the fed tries to fight inflation, input prices gradually drop. Businesses won't lower prices immediately because they will try to recoup losses they are up initially. After a while, consumers realize inflation is less high and start becoming more price conscious. As consumers become more price conscious, businesses start to increase prices less often. However, consumers will still demand a higher wage increase to catch up for inflation that already occurred. This is the period when consumers catch up to inflation. It will happen for a while and gradually wind down as businesses cannot eat up that cost forever. \n\nSo in general, the wage catch up period happens after inflation already started dropping. With more unions in the past, consumers had more negotiating power and that period might have dragged out for longer, sometimes leading to wage inflation spiral. Without union, that period might be shorter, and I think consumers ultimately lose out after it's all over. So that helped the fed keep inflation down and not worried about wage inflation spiral, but at the cost of consumer spending power. \n\nThat's why I think high inflation periods ultimately leave consumers worse off permanently. So it's important that when inflation first started spiking that consumers remain price conscious and shop for cheaper alternatives. Businesses will tend to always win out on pricing. But if consumers are price conscious and will shop for cheaper alternatives, that makes businesses think twice before raising prices, and to think of alternatives like globalization and other things to cut down costs before raising prices. This was the business mindset after 2008 recession.\n\nBut during covid, Americans didn't care and spent like no tomorrow. It didn't help that the fed and the gov \"normalized\" inflation and talked like the price increases were temporary due to supply shortage and chip shortage. That seemed to give consumers the false belief to just keep spending despite the outrageous sticker prices, because they think after the supply chain problem is over, prices will deflate back to 2019 level. This gave businesses the excuse to raise prices instead of finding ways to cut cost, since consumers accepted them.\n\n That's why in 2022 when the fed started fighting inflation and consumers becoming price sensitive again, many megacap companies started realizing they relied too much on price increases, had too many dead weight employees, and had to go on firing spree to cut cost and focus on profitability instead of sales growth",

          "body": "There is still upside risk which the Alt Fed talked about back in January. \n\nSomething they’ve heard amongst multiple business and industry leaders is that they are ready and waiting to deploy assets at the first sign of the Fed lowering rates. There is worry that this pent up demand can unravel the inflation control that’s been done if it floods suddenly into the system and kickoff another fear spiral about prices. \n\nEvery good jobs report puts a sharper focus on prices. If PCE stays stubbornly above 2% then will the board really vote for a rate cut by June—which the Alt Fed is currently tracking at a 70% probability for a 25 bps cut?\n\nIMO I’m seeing more and more evidence to keep rates steady through June and the market probably won’t love that. But the market is pricing in a probability of 2 cuts versus 3 so it’s not going to bottom out…unless the Fed keeps seeing sticky inflation during a growing economy and keeps rates high longer. If 2024 finishes the year with only one rate cut then I have to imagine the market takes at least a 10% pullback before settling into sideways trading for 9-12 months.",

              "body": "Here's what is likely to happen.\n\nif core PCE YoY goes to around 2.5%, the Fed will start cutting. They keep saying they don't care about politics, but if possible, they will prefer to stay out of politics spotlight and get a cut in before having to cut around fall this year.\n\n2.5% core PCE YoY is \"close enough\" to 2.0% that they can justify the cut and use the rate hike lag as an excuse, even measurement noise, or lag of PCE rent vs real time rent. 2.7% to 3%, that's much harder to justify because it rounds to 3%.\n\nNow if you look at the core PCE MoM and trace back 12 months, most of the first half 2023 core PCE are around 0.3% MoM or higher. It's not until summer 2023 that the MoM got pretty low, around 0.2%. So as we get more prints and those high months get removed from the YoY, core PCE YoY is likely to continue dropping, close to 2.5% by June FOMC. As long as core PCE YoY keeps dropping, the Fed will feel \"okay\" and market will use that as an excuse to rally, or at least not correct. BUT after June FOMC, core PCE YoY will likely go higher again.\n\nWhat's conflicting is that June will likely be when the Fed start cutting, which one would think is good for stocks. I don't think so. I think stocks rally in anticipation of rate cut, but drop when the rate cut happens because it's afraid the economy is weak when the Fed cuts and will start pricing in some form of recession. June is also when presidential race heats up, which raise uncertainty for market. It's also when YoY inflation start going up.\n\nSo SP500 is likely to grind back up to 5200-5400 and then have a correction around June.",
