  "selftext": "Posting this here because the \"spacemob\" don't like examining risk\n\nTL;DR ASTS has near-guaranteed upside in the long term, as long as they don't fuck up their technology completely. However, there are huge downsides over the next \\~3 months, and these risks continue to grow every day.\n\nThe upcoming ASTS Bluebird Block 1 launch scheduled for early September is a huge moment for the company to become revenue-generating. But as the date draws closer, we are seeing an increasing number of contraindications for launch, and this has downstream ramifications.\n\nAll of my statements have primary references.\n\n# Today's risks\n\n-[ ASTS Bluebird Block 1 is slated for a Falcon 9 delivery vehicle at Cape Canaveral's Space Force SLC-40 launchpad](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7143). This is the [same launchpad that Starlink 8-6 took off of](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7618) and [failed to recover from](https://youtu.be/gCEEYJahjaE?t=4643).\n\nThe [FAA has grounded all Falcon 9's ](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacexs-falcon-9-grounded-after-failing-landing-attempt-2024-08-28/)pending investigation of the recent failure. ASTS is now grounded from the same rocket and same launchpad that they were hoping to earn you money from.\n\nThe last time SpaceX was grounded (a couple months ago), [it took two weeks to be airborne again](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/28/g-s1-19934/faa-spacex-falcon9-grounded-polaris-dawn). Put a pin in this.\n\n[Most rocket failures originate from the launchpad](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230518-what-are-the-odds-of-a-successful-space-launch). (See also: see Peter Beck's comments from Wild Wild Space documentary)\n\nSpaceX had yet another launch scheduled before ASTS: [Starlink 8-10](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7499)\n\nSpaceX's quickest turnaround for a launchpad[ is around 3 days](https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2024/07/spacex-q2/#:~:text=In%20April%202024%2C%20SpaceX%20also,1%20and%20USSF%2D62%20missions). That means even before this recent failure, **the earliest possible launch for Bluebird was around 4 September.**\n\nCape Canaveral has notoriously bad weather in September and October.[ Next week calls for thunderstorms every single day](https://weather.com/weather/tenday/l/86161c1d891e1a3363bcb21b857124be6c14f73ca4c2d94bf2501249eb73eec6). Not only that, but the probability of storms has GROWN from 20% this weekend to over 60% every day next week. The [do-not-launch criteria for SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_commit_criteria) revolves almost entirely around thunder, wind shear, and icing conditions.\n\nASTS is short on time because of their launch slot. SpaceX is planning to use SLC-40 to[ cuck Boeing](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-decides-to-bring-starliner-spacecraft-back-to-earth-without-crew/). C[rew-9 is scheduled from this same launchpad on September 24](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/6881) -- there is absolutely NO WAY that SpaceX will compromise on this launch, and in all likelihood, they will pay cancelation fees to ASTS in order to ensure Crew-9 goes smoothly. While their record launchpad turnaround time is only three days, I estimate they will take 10 days as a precaution. They've booked nothing past early September. That means that if ASTS cannot launch before September 14-ish, they will get pushed to October\n\nOctober is a horrible launch month in Florida. [The last time ASTS tried to launch in late Autumn, their stock dropped over 50% because of multiple delays](https://spacenews.com/ast-spacemobile-delays-commercial-satellite-debut-by-six-months/).\n\n# Tomorrow's Consequences\n\nFew sources here because much  has been inferred from ASTS's recent earnings call where the CEO spoke at length about their guidance.[ A lot of positivity](https://investors.ast-science.com/quarterly-results) can be drawn from his statements, but the risks are spoken between the lines.\n\nIf this September Block 1 launch is delayed, Bluebird Block 2 will likely be delayed as a result. ASTS has always wanted to test Block1 on an alpha subscriber population in the U.S. Block 2 however is the company's major revenue-generating launch where they intend to scale up for regular consumers over a year or more.\n\nA lot of spacemobbers will tell you that ASTS's runway is long. If the runway is long, I'm here to tell you that it is also extremely narrow, and the past few days are not looking good.\n\n\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8dlrpg6mlkld1.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4bcca6e95c61bbcae0a7ae7a7555559eea3e3aa\n\n",

But you make no effort to actually evaluate the risk of failure. You just list a bunch of what ifs. They are only relevant if you give some percentage odds. The risk of failure is small. A delay is not unlikely but it is very unlikely to be a long delay.  This post is pretty meaningless. The real risk in next three to six months is in space. Will these things work the way they are supposed to? That we are just trusting AST on. And that is truly risky. Rocket launches are very reliable and we have a good idea of the risk of them.

Did you not see that **$150m+ of warrants were just called**? That provides MULTIPLE MONTHS of runway by itself for ASTS. Not to mention any kind of additional funding, new partners signing on, loans they can take out now that interest rates are coming down, and the list goes on.\n\n>That means that if ASTS cannot launch before September 14-ish\n\nAlso wrong again, [tentative launch date of Sept. 13](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/details/7143)",

There will still be the possibility of further delays, but you like one delay means more delays are likely as if no one ever launches in September of October. What are the actual odds.  \"If they push to mid September that means months of bad news\" has no factual support. The odds of months of bad news are really not much different between early September and mid September. The weather doesn't fall off a cliff.  Last year, they had 14 launches in September and October from Cape Canaveral. You list one scheduled conflict that you think without evidence will pre-empt ASTS.  What about all the other dates? How likely is it they can't fit into any of those other dates? You make no attempt to figure that out. You just list weather. You also make no attempt to figure out how long the delay will be this time. You make no attempt to actually calculate the risk of failure on launch. This might as well be a chatbot.",

They still have both static fires to go through, which means potential delays, which means stock drops and maybe even funding rounds. I’m also eyeing the fact that the launch pad is still under construction, I feel like we saw SpaceX make this mistake where the concrete pad did not properly settle in time, resulting in damage to their starship test. But im sure rklb learned from this…\n\nEven after a successful first launch they will have to prove both the economics of their pricing and the reliability of their recovery and relaunch operations, not to mention the FAA hurdles for any missteps. SpaceX meanwhile is finding retirable boosters with 20+ launches already. \n\nAs far as payload parts go, I’m seeing that much of the industry is vertically integrated still. For example ASTS manufactures their entire satellite. I would be watching for rumors of talks to service a constellation before I’m really sold on this part of the company to scale/profit. While there’s a lot of potential here, this particular piece of the business feels a lot more vulnerable to competition than their rockets\n\nIt seems like earth to LEO payload delivery is  going to be a high risk race to the bottom of profit margins. It’s a transportation company so just like airlines and busses, eventually the business tops out. they aren’t the first, and they won’t be special for long. Unlike spectrum services such as ASTS, there is no law of physics in launching rockets that stops competition from sprouting.There’s a period in there where I believe rklb is a good investment, but it doesn’t begin for another year or more.\n\nSo IMO I will be in and out of the stock for at least a couple more years before I start parking there as an investment, and that would only be until the industry starts getting really crowded.",

But it’s based on when you want to get in. I’m stilling buying more as it goes up avg my positions. But not really sure how to answer that. It’s a gamble.",

The rest of us will never need it nor will we ever pay for it. \n\nAT&T, Verizon, etc. will take the bulk share of any revenue and will only offer satellite service similar to how they offer their $10 or $20 international day or weekly passes. \n\nThe biggest issue is Elon Musk. They're competing with Starlink yet they must depend on SpaceX to deliver their loads. Elon will figure out a way to undermine their success.",
