  "score": 94,
  "selftext": "Nancy Pelosi has continued to sell shares of Visa Inc. (V), with the most recent transaction occurring on July 1, 2024. This marks a consistent trend, as similar transactions were recorded on November 8, 2022, and June 21, 2022.\n\nPelosi's spouse conducted the sales, raising questions about underlying market sentiments and potential signals of slowing consumer spending. \n\nWhat do you all think? Noise or she knows something?\n\nSource: \nhttps://www.levelfields.ai/news/pelosi-keeps-selling-visa-stock-are-pelosis-trades-a-sign-of-slowing-consumer-spending?utm_source=Klaviyo&utm_medium=campaign&_kx=GRQirMYG1TF85OtdyGg1fOssav89rvmkuMsMuZkuTAU.RaD4Px",
