  "selftext": "Intels Q3 earnings are due on 30/10. Estimated EPS is -0.02, so expectations are low. With the release of xeon 6, in Q2 I think server could be decent.\nXeon 6 gets obliterated by AMD Turin, but the later was released in October, so it'll impact Q4 sales.\n\nArrow Lake does not perform too well, as was expected. So I don't think intel managed to turn around yet. But expectations are low. Also, [rumors about takeovers](https://youtu.be/PKUXU1gewco?si=wdeSAt3qJxWeoZlZ) could boost the stock in the coming week.\n\nSo, I'm bullish, but Intel being Intel, I'm not going to yolo this one.",

Lots of movement, lots of opinions, lots of hype around earnings makes for good premiums. Shares are relatively cheap so the moves don't jump on people's radar, but the IV is high.\n\nIntel @ \\~$20 is around their asset value, so we're so close to the floor, it seems fairly safe until they unload something major or take on a huge amount of debt. If they start unloading pieces of the business, then it would need to adjust.\n\nSo long-run, I'm acquiring, short-run I'm taking advantage of volatility with a floor.
