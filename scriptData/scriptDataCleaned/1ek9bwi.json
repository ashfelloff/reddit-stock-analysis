More than 70% of the layoffs came from temporary workers which Hurricane Beryl certainly had an impact on. The fed Put is alive and well with 525 basis points of ammunition at their disposal. There‚Äôs still a lot of cash on the sidelines and as soon as the fed cuts those mny mrkt yields won‚Äôt seem so great anymore, not to mention the discount rate being lower and risk asset prices becoming more attractive. Smart money taking gains while the poors freak out over a non event and make bad decisions‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a tale as old as time.",

Otherwise, most of the increase in unemployment rate from 3.4% to 4.3% had been due to more people joining the workforce and not actual employee firing.\n\nSeems like the market just freaked out over tech earnings and then found any reason to sell off. Market never cared for things like ISM manufacturing since the US is mostly a service economy, and yet that caused a 3% sell off. Unemployment rate was 4.1% rounded down last month, trending up, and close to triggering the Sahm rule, yet market rallied on that. Surely market must have known the Sahm rule would get triggered at some point, although not b/c of layoffs but more people working.",
