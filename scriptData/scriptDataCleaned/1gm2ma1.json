But not just them, he wants to kick out all immigrants, including those who have earned their citizenship. He claims 20 million people which is currently 6% of the population or one in 16 people.¬†\n\n\nHere's a quick history lesson, Hitler tried to blame the Jews on all of their problems and they were less than 1% of the population about 525,000 people. About 200,000 had Polish citizenship and just left, and other countries basically ended up filling up their asylum quotas including the USA. So Hitler's final solution was to round them up and put them on trains to prisons. But that didn't work because they ran out of prisons, so he ordered his army to kill them in mass graves with machine guns, and chemical weapons, while the rest were forced into labor camps until they starved to death.¬†\n\n\nBut killing all of the Jews in Germany wasn't enough. He needed to kill all of the Jews in Poland too. The Jewish population in Poland after he was done went from 3 million to 45,000. But he wasn't done with Poland because there were other Jews and other countries and he needed to kill them there too. And the entire world just watched as fascism did its thing. He ended up killing 6 million Jews throughout Europe. A sick ideology that blames a boogeyman, and the belief that if you are cruel to anyone who's not exactly just like you, it will solve all of your problems. Anyone who was his enemy deserve to die. That's called fascism.¬†\n\n\nWhen you vote for someone who promises to hurt a minority group because they are the cause of all of your problems. They took your jobs, they made inflation, they impregnated your daughters, they made your son gay, they drink the blood of babies. All the same bullshit Hitler said. Congratulations, you are a fascist. Now you can start spreading rumors about blood libel and covid-5g microwaves. Make sure to prove your tough by not wearing a mask during a pandemic! The true Aryan race can't get sick, look at Sweden! Besides nobody died, the only people who died were poor immigrants who couldn't afford proper health care. As long as you're part of the fascist party you'll be safe. Unless you're in the inner circle, then you're first to be blamed in your head gets chopped off. Why same reason that Taliban hate women. They're all a bunch of fucking losers, and can only feel powerful, if others suffer. Cruelty is the point",
