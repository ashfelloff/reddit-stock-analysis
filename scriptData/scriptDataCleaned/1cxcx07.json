                  "body": "\"Even more dramatically, those movies have actually lost Disney approximately $2.8 billion, making the future of Star Wars movies more than a little shaky.\"\n\nWhile the article has a lot of speculation if you include the disastrous starwars hotel and the TV series they spent billions on that nobody watched this doesn't seem to be true. Their official disney numbers show profits but mostly because disney streaming paid disney productions  huge amounts of money they then lost. \n\nhttps://insidethemagic.net/2024/04/disney-ready-to-give-up-on-star-wars-after-losing-billions-nk1/\n\nAnd ,marvel WAS a money printing machine but well not anymore. Here the situation is a bit more shaky for 2023 with marvels and quantumania losing millions while guardians 3 made money but the series they again paid themselves most likely losing money too. So they are lucky if they ran even.\n\nhttps://thedirect.com/article/marvels-studios-money-lost-mcu-movies\n\nBut whatever the exact financial truth its amazing in general how you can screw up two of the most profitable franchises of all time like that.\n\nYou can just see how the profit making machine that was disney until 2020 started to stutter with quarters losing money and other quarters bringing profit but much less than the pre pandemic and less prepandering trend\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/224415/quarterly-net-income-of-the-walt-disney-company/*",
