  "selftext": "* Microsoft-backed (NASDAQ:MSFT) OpenAI is not expected to earn annual profits until 2029, according to company financial documents obtained by The Information.\n* The documents show annual losses could spike as high as $14B in 2026, the report said.\n* The projections showed the company reaching annual revenue of $100B in 2029. OpenAI also expects to spend about $200B through the end of the decade, minus stock compensations. Losses between 2023 and 2028 are projected to total $44B.\n* The report also found that Microsoft is entitled to 20% of OpenAI's revenue.\n* Last week, OpenAI completed its latest funding round totaling $6.6B, which propelled the company to a $157B valuation. Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) both participated in the round.",

                      "body": "Too much to put in a comment - look up “Zoomtopia recaps” for a full set of details. But I will say what jumped out to me:\n\nNon-native “AI Companion” that follows you through integrated partners via API (they showed a significant list). This was the biggest piece for me which demonstrated that they’re beyond meetings, and full asynch UCaaS innovators. They announced plans to monetize AI through premium features / an “AI studio,” but still include many features in their bundled plans. From an investor perspective, this was a huge missing piece for them, since I worried about how they would roll out so many expensive (to run) features and maintain their margins. \n\nIndustry solutions (healthcare, education, fed) - very differentiated products to solve for pain points in these massive TAMs vs giving everyone the same “meetings” platform. \n\nThe power of their contact center solutions, had some great use case demos. They specifically noted in an analyst session that they organically doubled their CX base in the past year alone.  This was striking to me because they did something similar with their PBX phone replacement ZoomPhone. Lots of TAM for taking, and doing it organically is a +1 on the quality of their product. \n\nEmployee engagement / EX: tailoring their software for front-line workers vs. being enterprise “knowledge worker” focused. They acquired a company named Workvivo, and were named preferred and only migration partner from META’s EX spindown. They demoed a use case that was very compelling in their keynote. \n\nThey are casting a very wide net on B2B and B2C.\n\nI also attended their investor sessions (virtually) and was very impressed with their long-term plan. They plan to maintain their gold standard gross margin, and improve operating and FCF margins which are already insanely impressive. I already sing their praises for their financial mgmt, and their new CFO seems like she’ll be able to help place bets on B2B and B2C sides (she was MSFT commercial CFO).",
