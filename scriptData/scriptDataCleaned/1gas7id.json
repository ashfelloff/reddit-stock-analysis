Meanwhile the business was rotting from the inside, and their dysfunctional management has caused the company to lose money every year since 2018. Now they are issuing tens of billions worth of new stock and diluting shareholders to stave off bankruptcy.\n\nBuying stock high and selling low is a practice that ultimately harms shareholders, but American shareholders are docile starry eyed sheep who blindly follow whatever management tells them.",

There are three big reasons for this: \n\n1) Actuarial savings. With a 401k, you must save enough money and limit withdrawal rates to a level low enough to last for your maximum potential lifespan. Defined benefit pensions only need to save enough for the average worker's lifespan, because some people will die earlier and others will die later. This reduces the cost of a given future income by 30%. \n\n2) Reduced management fees, which save approximately 10%. \n\n3) With a 401k, your asset allocation must vary across your lifespan. When you're young you can maintain 100% equities, giving a high rate of return. However, you have virtually no money invested. Conversely, as you get older, you must add bonds to account for sequence of return risk, reducing your average rate of return during the time when you have the largest account balance. Pension funds can maintain an optimal asset allocation at all times, increasing the lifetime rate of return.",
