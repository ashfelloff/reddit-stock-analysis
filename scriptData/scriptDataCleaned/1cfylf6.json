But that each remaining percent is twice as hard as the last one to get right.  It's probably gonna be another ten years for them to get there. And maybe never for vehicles that don't have Lidar.

It's so dumb to me they can't pick someone up without the passenger sitting in the driver's seat yet it can drive all around with no passenger at all. \n\nI asked a cop in Scottsdale what they thought of the driverless cars and he said they are amazing, he's never had to pull one over, and they're way better than human drivers from what he observes. \n\nRandom tangent: Should we give up on 100% efficiency and instead ask ourselves if we'd be better off with slightly inefficient driverless cars that overall still cause way less accidents than human-operated cars? \"Automatic vs. Manual\" cars will probably start referring to if it is driverless.",
