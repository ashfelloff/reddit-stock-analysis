  "selftext": ">TOKYO, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Nintendo (7974.T) cut its operating profit forecast for the year to March 2025 by 10% to 360 billion yen ($2.36 billion) on Tuesday, as sales of its ageing Switch console lost steam.\n\n>The forecast is below analyst estimates for profit of 391.4 billion yen.\n\n>The Kyoto-based gaming company sold 4.7 million Switch consoles in the first half of the financial year, down from 6.8 million units in the same period a year earlier.\n\n>Nintendo lowered its full-year sales forecast for the console, which is in its eighth year on the market, by 7% to 12.5 million units. That would be down 20% from actual Switch sales of 15.7 million units a year earlier.\n\n>It also revised down its annual software sales forecast by 3% to 160 million units.\n\n>Furukawa said there was no change to Nintendo's plan to announce a successor to its long-lasting Switch console in the current financial year to March, but did not go into specifics.\n\n>\"Making an announcement this year has gotten quite difficult ... You would not want to divert attention to an upcoming console in the middle of the critical year-end shopping season,\" Yasuda said.\n\n>Shares in Nintendo closed down 3.9% ahead of the earnings announcement, underperforming the Nikkei average's 1.1% gain.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/technology/nintendo-cuts-annual-operating-profit-forecast-switch-sales-slow-2024-11-05/",

They are trying hard with Nintendo Alarmo and some expanding online services to music.
