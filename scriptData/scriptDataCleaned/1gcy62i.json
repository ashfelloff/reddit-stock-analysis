  "selftext": "Excerpt is from their lawsuit against V\n\n\n5. As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls \"a chicken-and-egg problem.\" To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, \"build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees\" is \"a herculean task.\" Visa further recognizes that these effects create \"an enormous moat\" around its business.\n\n6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as \"PIN networks\" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.\n\n7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopolyâ€”one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.\n\n",

If the US or US states started doing that, every/many Americans would immediately have a trusted card that could be used by Visa, MC, etc.    \n    \nSimilarly, nearly everyone has a smart phone with Apple Pay and Google Wallet.
