So when they finally announced the new iOS AI features at WWDC, there was this huge circlejerk of “OMG we were right, this will make so much money”. \n\nI think their sudden rush to pump out new products (Vision Pro, plus the rumored thin phone and flip phone) is indicative of shit sales and growth. They are looking for new ways to squeeze out more $$$ from their subset of customers that care about status / image, because not as many people have the money to upgrade every year in this economy.",
