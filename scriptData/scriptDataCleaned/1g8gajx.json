If you buy AMD stock on the last Monday of October, the average return for the rest of the year is 24.52%, and the stock is higher 88.89% of the time. This data starts in 2015 because it is the first full year after Dr. Lisa Su became CEO of AMD. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e2tzzcmjy0wd1.jpg?width=1942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4f0f907afeaf646562e6d6e20b0ab4099f9c38c6\n\nSome of you may be wondering why this period is so strong for AMD stock. Let me share my personal theory. AMD depends on TSMC for chip manufacturing. Taiwan is protected by its geography and weather, but the Chinese have two windows of opportunity to cross the Strait with favorable weather. The first is from late March to the end of April. The second is from late September to late October. Last year, China launched major military exercises around Taiwan in April. This year, they did it in October, which just ended a few days ago. (They also launch these exercises when they are provoked, such as when Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan or during the recent Taiwanese elections.)\n\nIn my view, the end of October triggers a relief rally in stocks related to TSMC, most notably AMD and Nvidia. This combines with earnings and strong seasonality, resulting in massive outperformance in a relatively short period of time.\n\nA quick word of warning—this time period includes earnings. If you want to avoid earnings risk, you can wait until the first Monday of November. If you wait until November, the average return is 19.06%, and the stock is higher 77.78% of the time by the end of the year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hd4mviffy0wd1.jpg?width=1930&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8987a1dab26da66ba129a56fd4b0e5122154c5\n\nHere is a quick comparison \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/36id0g9my0wd1.jpg?width=646&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d57997661eaf54f6e39d4f64aabc3fb8593827f2\n\nI do all this shit manually so I apologize if there is an error in one of my calculations. \n\nMy positions: Long 1000 shares with a cost basis of $157.90. Although I am considering switching to a risk reversal. I would use a risk reversal selling the Jan. 2025 $155 puts collecting 12.70 then using that to buy twice as many Jan. 2025 $180 calls for $6.50 (I would buy x2 as many calls to make the net cost \\~.30) ",
