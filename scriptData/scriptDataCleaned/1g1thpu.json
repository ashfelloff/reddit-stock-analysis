  "selftext": "Whoever tried doing the 1% a day thing was doing it wrong. This is a result of a LOT of day trades. I can easily do 10-15 day trades a day. Keep around $30k in this account and play with it for fun money. A lot of boomer stock scalping, such as DG, RKT, UVXY, JPM, HUM, and AZN. UVXY has a special place in my heart because there‚Äôs always money to be made in volatility. All I want is 10-15 cents per share x 1400 shares about 5-10 times a day. Bought a house early 2022 and all my money had to go there so that‚Äôs why you see a flatline there for a while.  ",
