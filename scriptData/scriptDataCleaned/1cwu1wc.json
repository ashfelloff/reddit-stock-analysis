                  "body": "Humans aren't inherently unique. If you consider all the actions and thoughts that any human has ever had, most everyone has had the same basic human experience. Anger, fear, envy, sexual desire, passion, stress, anxiety etc. even the way these emotions are physically expressed are standard human behaviour. Fighting, fleeing, having sex, making a purchase, chasing a hobby, manipulating others. How often are these expressed? Probably can be charted as a percentage. Homicides rank 15/100000 in the Americas, so 0.00015% of the population express murder in response to some emotional agonist. I only use this metric because it's readily available, but you can see where I'm going. Nobody is a trail blazer in terms of human behaviour. We are a function of our hormones and habits. Realistically, AI will optimise the extraction of resources through the population through sales/ads tactics. But to think that this will be meaningfully used in ways other than for monetary benefit, and instead be used to 'out' someone's habits misunderstands the premise of the technology. You can see what happens companies try to extract maximum value from their users by increasing ad volume, Facebook is a perfect example. Ads increase to the point where the original point of connecting to others is forgotten and people tend to just 'wake up' and remove themselves from that eco system. My point is that, these systems are only as lucrative as the people that use them, and if the cost is prohibitive, people stop using them. So there is a balancing act for corporations, and fortunately, no one has created a whole eco system that we are so dependant on that we have to use it, there is plenty of competition.",

That social media sites were allowing access to their networks and data to US government for clandestine activities. The Snowden leaks. \n\nDid that cause you to stop using email and text? Nope. People didn’t even stop using social media, which would be far easier to give up.\n\nDid it make you organize a vote to shut that shit down? Nope. \n\nNobody really cares all that much to do anything about it. Then you have TikTok. We basically know the Chinese government uses apps like TikTok to collect data from US citizens. Does that stop millions of Americans from using TikTok? Nope.\n\nAnd our own domestic companies do the same shit and have for quite some time. This is well known and so accepted that if you bring up the china tiktok shit probably an American will shrug and say oh well my own country does that to me too. \n\nSo nobody really cares all that much.
