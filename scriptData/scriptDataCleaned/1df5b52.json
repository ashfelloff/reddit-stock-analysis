The posts where you see someone shares that they made a lucky call going against the grain and making $1M overnight are not a sign that the odd of this actually being you someday arent slim to zero.  You are straight up gambling.  How much research are you putting into these decisions?  Have you been waking up at 5am for the past 6 months to gather info and chart out possibilities of how this could end up being the right play at the right time?  If you are literally making moves based on “what goes up must come down” logic, you really NEED to quit as odds are you wont just get lucky some day or the day you make 1M is the day you are finally out of the red.\n\nKeep in mind, I have no doubt some crazy win posts are legit, but I also have no doubt some are photoshops or apps that you just punch numbers into and get a screenshot.

More of me wants to yolo on something to make it back.\n\nI more so wonder about what is wrong with us. I've always been a \"counter trend\" guy. Trying to catch the top or bottom, always expecting a reversion to the mean. But usually i have a bear-ish skew when i think about how things \"should be\". I wonder if that's related to my scarcity mentality or other insecurities or chip on my shoulder.\n\nI've got some other psychological issues that I'm seeking a therapist for.   \nThank you for sharing and letting me commiserate with you.  \nBest of luck to you and I and every bear out here.",
