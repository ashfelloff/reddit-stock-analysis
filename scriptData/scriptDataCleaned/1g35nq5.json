  "score": 3312,
  "selftext": ">\"The corporate cure is always the same—lay off workers,\" said one critic. \"Stock buybacks and layoffs are joined at the hip. It's time they were outlawed entirely.\"\n\n>The manufacturing giant Boeing, under the leadership of new CEO Kelly Ortberg, announced Friday that it will axe roughly 10% of its total workforce in the coming months, a move that drew attention to the company's massive spending on stock buybacks in recent years.\n\n>Boeing, which is currently facing a machinist strike, spent an estimated $68 billion on executive-enriching share repurchases and dividends between 2010 and 2019—spending that critics say refutes the company's claim that layoffs and inadequate worker compensation are necessary.",

It's definitely a good upgrade, don't get me wrong, but this is the same type of improvement that has been happening for portable computers for the past 30 years. After being delayed for a bit it's happening on the Windows side now too with Intel and AMD mobile processors getting similar improvements to the M3 chips.\n\nThe watch kicked off a new product category (I know Pebble and Garmin were first but Apple was more feature rich) and definitely is class leading but it's an old category (approaching 10 years since launch) and has more or less topped out for new adopters. That could change if they can get FDA approval for real time non-invasive glucose readings but that's a tough nut to crack, lots of pharma companies have been trying to do that as well for decades and they haven't gotten it working either (there was a watch at one point [as seen in the movie Panic Room] but it wasn't very accurate and could burn the users skin).\n\nAirPods are similar to the watch, lots of competition and are an old category now.\n\nAirtags are newer but it's a pretty simple device, it does one thing really well but there's limits on how to improve it or add features. It too has plenty of competition as well.\n\nGo listen to Better Offline or read stuff published by Ed Zitron. There are no hyper growth markets left to conquer and Silicon Valley has been desperately trying to create the next one without success for the past 10 years or so. AI is the latest one but it's looking very precarious. Expect it to implode in 1-2 years.",

Housing aid? Medicare? No passing the buck here, if the government is subsidizing your workforce you do not get to do stock buybacks. (edit: Extend this to contracted employees as well, no contracting out your janitors to minimum wage third parties)\n\n3: Wages: All Employees must be getting paid above prevailing wages.\n-If you're not already paying employees higher wages than your competitors, you're clearly not financially strong enough to do buybacks.\n\n4: No Layoffs for the past 5 years: If you've recently laid people off, clearly your business needs to shore up it's books better before engaging in stock buybacks.\n\nedit: Thanks /u/cheftestpilot87\n5: Any tax incentives provided by State/Local/Federal must be paid back to a total of at least 50%. If you're doing so well that you are looking to do stock buybacks, you **Should** be paying your full share, however it is still good to incentivize investment via incentives.",

If the company over a decade buys back 90% of it and now has 100'000 shares you now own 1/1'000th of it, 10 times as much.\n\nThis is also relevant if you own the company indirectly through futures or VOO/SPY/ETC.",

The buybacks of 2010-2019 have nothing to do with.\n\nA: The management under Dave Calhoun 2020-24\nB: The management under Kelly Ortberg 2024-?\nC: The problems the company has had fixing problems of previous management post 2018 plane crashes and onwards\n\nThe layoffs equally has nothing to do with the buybacks.\n\nIn the pandemic they had to lay off people for obvious reasons. Post pandemic they could again hire roughly the same amount of people. \n\nNow after having a return to cash flow year in 2023 (also reflected in return of the stock) the door plug event happened which set of a media and political shitstorm and self inflicted quality control and lesser production, which management under Dave Calhoun kept well below the proposed quantities of FAA per month. Costing more than even FAA demanded just to keep up with the opinions of people and politics!\n\nThen when everything is ramping up again the machinist goes on strike effectively halting some but not all production at the company. But they’re halting production of the same 737 max’s that had the self inflicted limits mentioned above!\n\nThe layoffs was the first thing to expect as a cost saving measure because THEY HAVE TO when machinists are trying to ransom the company they work at while the same company is already suffering financially! It’s stupid!\n\nIt is flawed logic when they think they’re ransoming the company from a position of strength when actually they’re just creating a catch 22! A strike would have worked if they first let the company sort out the financial mess of cash flow from the door plug event! \n\nYou’re trying to get more money, not from what Boeing is making NOW but from what they WILL make in the future because they all know that when production eventually goes to 2018 levels it is a cash flow generator deluxe. \n\nCan you take a union rep seriously when they first recommend the union to accept a lesser offer before the strike then stonewall the better offers coming after the refusal of the same recommendation? It is nonsense!\n\nStop trying to connect dots of old damn happenings to recent issues when we live in the now and work towards a future (which we either invest and believe in or don’t). Same goes for articles blaming Calhoun or even Ortberg for culture, problems and happenings pre existing them is nuts!\n\nThe fact is that there is NO correlation nor causality in the either the articles or your reasoning. The fact is that there is straight line causality in layoffs because of the machinist ransoming the company at the worst possible time for their own benefit! I could predict on September 3rd before the strike that should the strike happen financially Boeing would have to lay off people. It’s straight up math and could be seen from a mile away!!",
