There’s been a lot of increased demand and improved supply for/of H100s and H200s and Huang has signaled that demand hasn’t paused for the H chips even with anticipation for Blackwell. As a result, I’m expecting earnings to beat expectations once again and favorable guidance which should help the stock approach $1,100. If they announce a stock split, I imagine the pre-split price could go even higher",
