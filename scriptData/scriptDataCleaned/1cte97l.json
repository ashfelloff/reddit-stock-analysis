That's **it**.\n\nA wash sale changes basis for tax reporting and not realized gains/losses at the time of transaction.\n\nYour cost basis changes because wash sales transfer the loss.\n\nThis is the whole point of wash sales: to prevent everyone from selling their losers on Dec 31 to incur huge tax losses and then buy it all back on Jan 2 to reestablish their portfolio.\n\nAn ape example:\n\nSo say you made 20k in losing trades on something and 30k on winning. With no wash sale you only get taxed on 10k but with it being a wash sale you get taxed on the full 30k even though you only made 10k on it. All the gain sales get counted as profit and you aren’t able to deduct any of the losses. \n\nRoth IRA is extremely risky to do that since it's your financial future (limited amount can be entered annually but its ALL tax free, all gains. You can't withdraw without a penalty until you're **59½** but he has 271K tax free for retirement on top of whatever else he contributes/gains in the account by then.)",

I would probably transfer to an actually good broker (boring one like Vanguard or something) and throw it all into VTSAX or  VOO or similar. Then just forget about it and go on with your life, knowing you'll have $2-5 million in 30 years all tax-free.\n\n\nAlso to anyone else seeing this... I would probably advise not trying this. The chance that you correctly predict the direction on a call/put you're trying to scalp *3 times in a row* is very low, and OP did this setting up good stop losses. I would assume that for every 100 people that try this, maybe 1 would be successful like OP. Don't gamble with your retirement funds folks, and scalping SPY options is stressful and risky... remember that the phrase \"picking up pennies in front of a steamroller\" is used to describe the high-risk nature of strategies specifically like scalping SPY options.",

Somewhat based on need, but mostly based on how much you put in. Everyone who works for a paycheck has this. Its not really enough to live off of for very long at above the poverty level.\n - IRA - money you earned this year that you decide to put into a retirement account. Not taxed when you put it in (encourages saving more) but taxed when you take it out\n - Roth IRA - if you don't make a lot of money, you qualify for this. Taxed when you put money in, not taxed when you take it out, as long as you're old. Helps encourage lower-income people to save more, as they don't pay much in taxes (or nothing) so an IRA isn't really an incentive.\n - 401K - basically the same as an IRA, but managed by the company you work for. Has more of an employer-matching system to further encourage you to save more.\n\nTLDR: because the Social Security amounts aren't enough to actually help you retire (they help, but not much), the other systems were invented with more personal-control over your retirement funds.",
