The entire system's a fucking scam.\n\nThe colleges have spent decades jacking up prices so everybody starts their adult life with a preposterously huge pile of debt. The economy has been rigged so only the top 10% or so are actually doing okay and everyone else is living paycheck to paycheck, so you get stuck making minimum payments for decades.\n\nMeanwhile, the people responsible for all this got their college education paid for by working a summer job. And those same people are the ones expecting you to cut them a check.\n\nFor what, exactly? Oh, my education is just *soooo* much better now that it costs 100x more? And everyone was just so much better at their jobs 50 years ago which is why they got paid living wages and we don't? Great job, guys! I'll definitely pay you real money to reward you for these things you've done.\n\nThe parasites who fucked the country over six ways from sunday aren't getting as big a payday as they expected.? Boo fucking hoo. The absolute horror of billionaires not siphoning even more money out of the lower and middle classes, how can I possibly sleep at night knowing that they'll only be able to afford one megayacht and not two.\n\n\\*Yes, I really am suggesting you just stop paying. There are ways to do it legally, they are ways to do it not legally. Look into it, and do it. Just be sure you don't default on private loans because those shitfucks will just sue you.",

Govt gives loans to farmers\n\n2. Farmers have made up 50-70+% of the population of India for the last 70 years\n\n3. Farmers cannot pay back loans\n\n4. Govt (in need of votes) bails them out with tax money\n\n5. Farmers take more loans\n\n6. Infinite money glitch (obviously at the expense of taxes collected which conveniently excludes the agricultural income)\n\n7. The cycle continues to this day. \n\nNever underestimate the freebie-based vote bank politics.",
