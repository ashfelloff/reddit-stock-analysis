Taiwan is an island near China that would likely be blockaded by Chinese navy ships. So if the US was to support Taiwan with weapons like we did with Ukraine it would pretty much guarantee a direct conflict with china. Ukraine doesn't have much value to the US aside from sticking a thorn into Russia and making their life difficult. Taiwan on the other hand makes all of our nvidia chips, amd chips apple chips which power our ai super computers. The economic risks of losing access to that supply chain and china gaining a monopoly on advanced chips would be catastrophic so would war with china. Its hard to say but I'd put my money on war with china. its also possible they force our hand by preemptively attacking our local military bases in Japan and Guam if they feel direct conflict is inevitable",

US strategy right now revolves around firing long-range missiles from well outside the Chinese A2AD zone to sink their invading ships. They want to stay as far back as possible.

Now you’re saying they “lost” because they didn’t achieve the political goal of the war. Those are two completely different things. Failing to install a democracy in a region seemingly utterly antithetical to the notion is a political failure, not a military failure.\n\n(2) I’ll use the same analogy from before, in said case you’d hire an exterminator to fumigate the home and kill every single cockroach in the walls. Unfortunately, “fumigating” the Middle East of fundamentalist Islam is not a realistic option, as appealing to me as it may sound.\n\n(3) you’re getting into semantics about Taiwan not being recognized as a state LOL. I don’t think there’s a single major player on the world stage who would put thought into major consideration when Taiwan is quite literally a critical backbone of all technology on the planet, and yes they would 100% be ready to play hardball in defending Taiwan as a means to protect the well being of the entire global economy.

And that seems impossible, you'd need to sink the whole Chinese navy, secure the skies from all their many aircraft and missiles.  \n\nIf the US is so ready to defend Taiwan, why haven't they signed a treaty like with Japan, Korea, Australia, NATO?",

A lot of international water lines would be redrawn in China favor if Taiwan is \"repatriated\" or re-united with the Chinese mainland aka Communist China.\n\nAlso life is cheap in China. They would have no problem sacrificing an entire battalion of paratroopers if it meant crippling Taiwan to the point where the west sees it as more trouble than its worth.\n\nAll I'm saying is. It would be wise of them to do more than rig it self destruct. I'm thinking flack cannons like this paired with the best radar and automated Ariel surveillance known to man would be a money well spent on behalf of the governments involved here- or at the very least a minuture \"iron dome\" system around TSMC but something tells me the entire island is about to get one.

If China could do it, they already would be.  Take away those few small things and they're back to where they are now.  \n\nA theoretical invasion would take a lot of time.  Plenty of time for all the employees to evacuate the area and sobitoge the equipment.  By the time China got anyone to the fabs they would be just as useless as the ones China already has.  \n\nLook at what happened to the oil fields in the middle east when the US 'secured' them.  They got blown up.  Sure we eventually fixed them but it's not as easy as just rolling up and taking over.",
