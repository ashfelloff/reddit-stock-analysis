Bernstein displayed a table in the note to clients that shows Buffett tends to trim the shares when its price to earnings ratio gets above 30 and he buys more during quarters when the valuation is around the current range.\n\nWe believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple’s China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,” stated the analyst.\n\n “We further believe that replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle\n\nCalling it very bullish.\n\nAnd this.\n\nCramer says Apple’s Monday rally doesn’t have ‘staying power’ after analyst upgrade\nApril 29,2024\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/cramer-says-apples-monday-rally-doesnt-have-staying-power-.html\n\nAnd yet the put call open interest ratio for May 3,2024 contracts are at the 0.58 level or definitely bullish.\n\nCalls it is ?\n\nThe decrease in China sales is already priced in the stock. So even if they mention a decline in China sales the stock could still bounce if guidance and earnings are good.\n\nNarrow earnings beat, moderate to strong guidance because of the iPad refresh coming shortly after.\nArtificial Intelligence will be mentioned.\n\nIt’s all about the guidance .\n\nUnlikely to rocket but +3-5% seems reasonable barring a surprise.",
