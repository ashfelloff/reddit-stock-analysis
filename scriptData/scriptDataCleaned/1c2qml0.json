  "selftext": "The market is struggling with inflation data and global unrest and undergoing a slight correction. A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:\n\n1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it’s an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  \n\n2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV’s and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   \n\n3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don’t see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  \n\n4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   \n\n5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       \n\nWe are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap’s are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.    \n",
