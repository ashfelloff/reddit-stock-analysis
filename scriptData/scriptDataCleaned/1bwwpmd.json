However, I would rather keep that investment as stock or leaps.\n\nTheir monthly report (for March) is due [April 10](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/financial-calendar). What's your estimation ? I would guess a 5-10% bump for the monthly report and another 10-15% for ER, which would land it around $170. Considering its smooth sailing, which we know for the last 30 days is a laughable statement but hoping.\n\nI think the guidance and status on new fabs will be the price driving force with the ER. I also don't think any institutional investor is going to look at missing some monthly numbers due to the earthquake having any significance (TSM has an A+ track record), while if they show that an earthquake of that magnitude didn't affect them would definitely give a nice boost.",
