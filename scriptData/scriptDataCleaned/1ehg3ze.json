Back in the 1970s we had a more robust manufacturing sector, a less globalized workforce, and our universities had far fewer foreign graduates. If you wanted to make more widgets, you needed to hire more people locally.\n\nAfter the work-from-home days of covid, businesses are better situated than ever before to outsource jobs to foreign countries. We currently have about 22 million Americans who work from home all the time, and never go to the office. We have around 168 million jobs total. The math looks pretty grim for the American worker. 22/168 = 13% of our workforce that could get fired and replaced by a cheaper remote worker in another country. Currently, we only outsource about 300,000 jobs per year. That number is likely to grow quickly.\n\nWho will get the jobs instead? We have around 1 million foreign college students per year, but only 85,000 H1-B visas for recent graduates. The majority of American-educated foreign students return to their home countries, but they still have the same skillsets as their American classmates. They provide a fruitful labor pool for companies looking to outsource. Employers can even conduct interviews in the USA before students graduate and then hire them to a satellite office in their home country (for a salary much lower than their American counterparts).\n\nAnother risk is that across all OECD countries, the number of 25-34 year-olds with a university degree is forecast to grow from 137 million as of 2013 to 300 million by 2030. The competition for jobs will grow.\n\nGovernment intervention might help, such as putting tariffs on outsourced labor, or giving tax breaks to companies that hire Americans. But it's hard to see the Democrats doing a 180 on their \"tHeYrE gOnNa TaKe oUr jObS!!\" rhetoric. And they've made identity politics a core part of their doctrine--hard to start discriminating against people based on national origin without fragmenting the party. It's also hard to see the Republicans doing anything that would make American businesses (and stocks) less competitive.",

If we are using the narrative where unemployment is going up due to more people looking for work, continuing claims should be even higher than historical levels because it takes longer for people to find work if there are more of them looking.\n\nEdit : by the way, I don't know why 20% is the threshold when clearly 1995 surpassed that without a recession. Clearly there were past recessions that started below the 10% level. We are past that now, and no recession so far. Also, we are going past 10%, from an extremely low level (and that detail cannot be stressed enough). That's the thing that broke many of past indicators. If you're going up X% from a level that's way below normal, the normalization part technically shouldn't count",
