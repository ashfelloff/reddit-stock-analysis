If anything you should be looking 2 quarters out - your calls expire right before their next ER… which is probably why you bought them because they were cheap\n\nThat being said - retail is struggling and the Nike brand has fallen off since their dominance over the last couple of decades.  They could be primed for a turnaround.  I’ll buy in for oct calls if they pull back more",
