  "selftext": "Hello! I am needing some advice. Say I have an extra  $400 every two weeks (after bills, 401k, Roth) to invest. I am new to investing and want to set up a good routine. I am considering buying QQQM and VTI (open to other ETFs) for long term investments. What would you guys suggest for the breakdown of $400 into both of those ETFs? Example: 50/50 of ($200/$200) or something else?\n\nSorry if this is dumb, but thanks for the feedback! \n\nEdit: if this is the wrong subreddit, please let me know which one it should go in. Thanks! \n\nEdit: can you guys read? ",

Once the emergency fund is built out, then you can start putting the entire $400 into the stock market.",

It tracks the SP500 but mitigates the risk of the heavy weight stocks causing the index to tank if in the unlikely scenario one of them tanks. You won’t necessarily get the same return but it will still be a good return. \nI am personally partial to SCHG because the research I’ve done it has beaten the annual return of most of the “Main” ETFs like VOO…",

It might be better to pick one depending on your risk tolerance depending on how familiar you are with investing and how much time you want to spend learning more. For example, QQQM has a higher beta than VTI which means the expected return is higher, but it gets there by taking more risk aka volatility. Different people respond in different ways to volatility. \n\nOnly piece of advice I would give is to buy shares whenever you have money to allocate and don't try to time the market. That is one of the hardest skills to learn in investing and it takes a lot of time to learn how to do it effectively. Even the best of the professionals has a success rate similar to batting averages. \n\nYou can balance either using current price or cost basis. I personally prefer balancing by cost basis, but I think I am in the minority there. Whichever method you choose, just buy a share whenever you can and put the money into whichever ticker is lower.",
