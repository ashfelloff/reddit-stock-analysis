I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.\n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Fed Seen Rejecting Calls for Jumbo Rate Cut in Economist Survey](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-09/fed-seen-rejecting-calls-for-jumbo-rate-cut-in-economist-survey)\n\n**There will be no post Monday/Tuesday.**\n\n* [**SG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SG&p=d) - Reports -.13 EPS vs -.11 expected. Raised full year outlook, causing surge in stock prices.\n* [**TTWO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TTWO&p=d) - Beats on latest earnings, EPS of 0.05 vs .01 exp. This was a huge earnings beat, but adjusted sales were lighter than expected. In other news, the Borderlands movie gets a 7% on Rotten Tomatoes lol.\n* [**TSM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSM&p=d) - Reported earnings (in Taiwan) overnight. Reported 45% increase in revenue, and good guidance, sales for the month.\n* Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: **AMD**/**ARM**/**MU**/**SOXL**/**NVDA**/**NVDL**. Still long **NVDA**.\n* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - Saw a continued up move from yesterday, watching $25 level. (Biased short, however.)\n* [**RKLB**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RKLB&p=d) - Met revenue expectations of $106M vs $105-110M expected. Cited “critical milestone in development of our new medium lift rocket Neutron”. 17 new launches signed for 2024.",

One can only imagine how much DLC and other games they may have done had online not been such a cash cow.  And that makes me curious how far they might have pushed the online features now that they are developing towards those long term goals.\n\nI'm sure that GTA6 will still launch with an epic story campaign because that's the hook, but I imagine it'll be designed to interconnect players with the online platform.  I can't imagine Social Club and all that will stay as its outdated and poorly integrated form.\n\nI do also like it as a short play, because once the game launches... who knows, could go either way.

I started with the conservative Bogleheads approach but FOMO hit me when I came across NVDA and seeing how much it skyrocketed. I discovered a friend invested in it in early 2023 and made a killing from it, and I decided to sell all my shares of VTI and went all in on NVDA in early June just before the stock split. I also invested in RYCEY and PLTR.  I wish I had less invested in NVDA and more in the other 2, which is why I asked about them.",
