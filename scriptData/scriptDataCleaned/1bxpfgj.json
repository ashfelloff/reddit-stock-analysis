          "body": "I think you have a grave misunderstanding of insurance.\n\nIt is currently highly, highly regulated as is by the state DOI - That is why we’re in this issue of run away premiums. Insurance companies are looking for approval for ways to tailor policies opposed to raising premiums or canceling policies. \n\nSee my prior reply on this thread:\n\nThis is nothing new to insurance, this has been an option for 30+ years. I’ll refer you to the term ‘Betterment’. Fairly common in auto insurance for wear items that are damaged in an auto claim, this same approach to claims is being explored in home owners.\n\nThe insurer has always owed to restore you to pre-loss condition. Obviously they can’t rebuild your 20 year old roof, so they reimburse you a new one. (Replacement Cost)\n\nIn the current scheme / way policies are written, they would pay upfront the Actual Cash Value of the damaged roof (depreciated amount), then when work is completed, the remaining amount is reimbursed - which sum of the two amounts would be defined as the replacement value (policy allowing).\n\nNow, it’s pretty obvious the problem with this current system: The owner gets a new roof with no additional cost. He was returned to a better than pre-loss condition. Which leads to rampant exploitation and additional insurance costs that impact everyone. Currently, most state DOI’s insist home owners policies are written this way. (Replacement Cost).\n\nHowever, with the focus now on home insurance costs going up due to catastrophes and the general inflation of goods and services, the DOI’s are being pushed revisiting ‘replacement cost’ requirements in the home owners policies to combat rising premiums.\n\nBetterment, if allowed by the DOI when applied to say a roof - the insurance company would still owe for 100% the labor costs but would apply depreciation to the cost of materials depending on the age of the prior damaged roof. So, for example, if the damaged roof is 15 years into a roof that is expected to last 30 years, the insurance company would only pay 50% of the materials, while the home owner would pay the other 50% (plus any applicable deductible).\n\nThis approach I believe is far more sensible to raising rates across the board to underwrite claims where the home owners are effectively gaining value off their claim. Why this has not been the case all along is because in the eye of the doi’s -  premiums should directly reflect the insured item. Constantly adjusting a premium to reflect a depreciating component was seen as tedious if not impossible in the days of pen and paper so the premium was always based on replacement cost.  This was great until home owners started liberally utilizing their home owners policies at any occurrence in an attempt to replace their old roofs even for the most minor of damage. Claim occurrence data has reflected this trend for the last 10 years. With current technology, and quick data keeping / assessment, home owners insurance premium could be now ‘fine tuned’ to specifics of the insured items including wear and age.\n\nAll that is really needed are the state DOI’s to allow betterment be applied liberally to HO’s policies. Which, I believe will happen to combat the rising premium costs that have made headlines.\n\nPs- none of this has anything to do with insurance companies being greedy. Rates / Risks are regulated universally by the DOI. So what really matters to an insurer is obtaining the biggest insured pool as it usually means they can offer the best price for the same coverage (law of large numbers). Best Price always wins the customer’s business 99% of the time in insurance. This keeps it very competitive and lean between insurers. To put it into perspective: on average, for every $1.00 of premiums taken .97 cents is paid out on claims and admin costs. The 3% profit + float (money set aside for claims) is invested in the interim. Thats how insurance companies make money.\n\nWhat this all has to do with is insurance companies pushing the DOI’s to allow for alternatives such as tailoring policies to reflect the age / wear of the insured items to raising premiums. This is the insurance companies advocating on behalf of the customers / public’s concerns about the ability to pay the required HO insurance premiums if it continues to reflect replacement cost reimbursement language by the DOI..",

There are many problems in the industry and carriers are realizing that more customers means bigger annual losses, higher loss ratios, and less profits.\n\nAt the top reinsurance companies have cut their capacity making the cost to spread risk for consumer carriers extremely high. These increased costs have been a sort of justification for carriers to reduced their exposures. \n\nReducing exposures for the sake of profits right now means getting rid of insureds for admitted carriers. This involves raising rates as high as the states department of insurance will allow, placing hurdles to write new business like complex requirements most can’t meet, and creating high underwriting hurdles in order to non-renew accounts. Accounts that carriers used to fight for are now undesirable. \n\nWhere things are really going to get really interesting is when these measures fail. The reality is insurance companies are losing and can’t raise rates fast enough. Climate change, rampant costs to repair property and vehicles, social inflation and nuclear settlements awarded etc.. A windshield 10 years ago was $250 now they’re $3,500, take 30 days to order and can only come from the manufacturer. Even if there was multiple options insureds demand only OEM when they can get it.\n\nInsurance companies are merging, smaller regionals are going out of business and the lack of competition is magnifying the problem.\n\nThe next 5-10 years are going to get really interesting for the industry, probably a lot sooner than that.",

      "body": "This is nothing new to insurance, this has been an option for 30+ years. I’ll refer you to the term ‘Betterment’. Fairly common in auto insurance for wear items that are damaged in an auto claim, this same approach to claims is being explored in home owners.\n\nThe insurer has always owed to restore you to pre-loss condition. Obviously they can’t rebuild your 20 year old roof, so they reimburse you a new one. (Replacement Cost)\n\nIn the current scheme / way policies are written, they would pay upfront the Actual Cash Value of the damaged roof (depreciated amount), then when work is completed, the remaining amount is reimbursed - which sum of the two amounts would be defined as the replacement value (policy allowing).\n\nNow, it’s pretty obvious the problem with this current system: The owner gets a new roof with no additional cost. He was returned to a better than pre-loss condition. Which leads to rampant exploitation and additional insurance costs that impact everyone. Currently, most state DOI’s insist home owners policies are written this way. (Replacement Cost).\n\nHowever, with the focus now on home insurance costs going up due to catastrophes and the general inflation of goods and services, the DOI’s are being pushed revisiting ‘replacement cost’ requirements in the home owners policies to combat rising premiums.\n\nBetterment, if allowed by the DOI when applied to say a roof - the insurance company would still owe for 100% the labor costs but would apply depreciation to the cost of materials depending on the age of the prior damaged roof. So, for example, if the damaged roof is 15 years into a roof that is expected to last 30 years, the insurance company would only pay 50% of the materials, while the home owner would pay the other 50% (plus any applicable deductible).\n\nThis approach I believe is far more sensible to raising rates across the board to underwrite claims where the home owners are effectively gaining value off their claim. Why this has not been the case all along is because in the eye of the doi’s -  premiums should directly reflect the insured item. Constantly adjusting a premium to reflect a depreciating component was seen as tedious if not impossible in the days of pen and paper so the premium was always based on replacement cost.  This was great until home owners started liberally utilizing their home owners policies at any occurrence in an attempt to replace their old roofs even for the most minor of damage. Claim occurrence data has reflected this trend for the last 10 years. With current technology, and quick data keeping / assessment, home owners insurance premium could be now ‘fine tuned’ to specifics of the insured items including wear and age.\n\nAll that is really needed are the state DOI’s to allow betterment be applied liberally to HO’s policies. Which, I believe will happen to combat the rising premium costs that have made headlines.\n\nPs- none of this has anything to do with insurance companies being greedy. Rates / Risks are regulated universally by the DOI. So what really matters to an insurer is obtaining the biggest insured pool as it usually means they can offer the best price for the same coverage (law of large numbers). Best Price always wins the customer’s business 99% of the time in insurance. This keeps it very competitive and lean between insurers. To put it into perspective: on average, for every $1.00 of premiums taken .97 cents is paid out on claims and admin costs. The 3% profit + float (money set aside for claims) is invested in the interim. Thats how insurance companies make money.\n\nWhat this all has to do with is insurance companies pushing the DOI’s to allow for alternatives such as tailoring policies to reflect the age / wear of the insured items to raising premiums. This is the insurance companies advocating on behalf of the customers / public’s concerns about the ability to pay the required HO insurance premiums if it continues to reflect replacement cost reimbursement language by the DOI..",
