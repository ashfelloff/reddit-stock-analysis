There's for sure more people in India than the official numbers and it's the among the most poor numbers differ the most.\n\nHad to check up a bit more since as you say, the numbers are not fresh, but I knew the population increase is way lower today than 30-40 years ago and this is what I find also on Wikipedia.\n\n> In 2022, the median age of an Indian was 28.7 years,[13] compared to 38.4 for China and 48.6 for Japan; and, by 2030; India's dependency ratio will be just over 0.4.[14] However, the number of children in India peaked more than a decade ago and is now falling. The number of children under the age of five peaked in 2007, and since then the number has been falling. The number of Indians under 15 years old peaked slightly later (in 2011) and is now also declining.[15]\n\nWhat it does for the amount of child labour on the total I don't know. What's positive for the numbers is that extreme poverty has dropped significantly the last 10-15 years, but I guess the real number of child labout will always be hidden in the fact we're never been able to trust the numbers about India and their population.",

They’re pitching a total 50% now for the poor and middle class. \n\nEverything came to light during Covid. A lot of propaganda and the scale of it was revealed when about 5 people were dying every week in every single persons building and reported infected numbers were 20k a day. The reality was closer to 500k, maybe more. The peak should have been ~20x more than reported. \n\nMy building of 75 flats itself had about 20 people die. That was like 15% of my entire building.
