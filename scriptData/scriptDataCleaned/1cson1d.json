You will be tempted to recoup these losses by trying to make another play. \n\nIt won‚Äôt happen, you‚Äôll continue to lose money, and, as desperation grows, you‚Äôll make more bad plays based on emotions and the losses will start to become exponential. You need to walk away from options bc this will only get worse. \n\nThat‚Äôs enough for now, I‚Äôve got to get back to the Wendy‚Äôs register.\n\nsteppinrazor2009: ‚ÄúOw STOP hitting me with that whip!!‚Äù\n\nManager: ‚Äúthen get back inside.
