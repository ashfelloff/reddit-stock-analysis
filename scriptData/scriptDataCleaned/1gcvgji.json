Still, you gotta take a moment to contemplate this.\n\nThe funny thing is that Elon has outright lied/being wrong with predictions like dates for models and stuff, most recently the shenanigans with the robot at his events.\n\n\nBUT 2 weeks later he says 20-30 revenue growth next year and everyone believes him lol.\n\n\nThanks god im not a bear",

      "body": "I've owned a Tesla vehicle since 2017.  That's when I started following the company a little more than the average consumer I suppose.  I decided to invest when everyone else entered the market in 2020.  Threw some money in different things, but mainly in TSLA bc I initially drank the Kool aid.  My plan was to hold for a few years and see what happens.  Since then, Elon has become a vastly different personality, or is shedding whatever mask he had on before.  I continue to hold TSLA regardless of Elon.\n\nI've watched Tesla prove to be the only car manufacturer that has mass produced EVs at a good profit margin.  I'm unsure how Chinese companies compare honestly.  While other well known manufacturers are trying to catch up.  Low numbers and or low profit margins if any.  They were all, we'll be all electric by 20xx.  Not anymore.  All while Tesla is continuously improving their manufacturing processes, batteries, the cars themselves, etc.\n\nPundits kept saying, the competition will embarrass Tesla.  Ford, Porsche, Rivian, Fisker, VW, etc.  Some good products out there, but none led to Tesla going under or even slowing down.\n\nThe robotaxi event, to me, was less about hey we did it (or are close to it or faking parts of it), and more \"this is what the future should look like, and we are a little closer to it with the things we are doing at Tesla.\"  It was wild to see.\n\nThe energy business is another piece of Tesla.  Residential, commercial, large energy storage, etc.  They are becoming a retail energy provider, auto insurance, and so on.  A bit like Google.  Some of their stuff will do well, others I think will go the way of Google glass, haha.\n\nIF...they really can get the world to a place that adopts this robotaxi, that's a lot of value.  IF...they make this robot that can really be semi affordable and do mundane and/or dangerous tasks, that's huge.  AI powering it all.  Big IFs, for sure.  \n\nOther companies may be doing some of these things, but not all of them.  Perhaps I'm delusional, but at this point, I am holding and gonna see where this ride continues to go.",
