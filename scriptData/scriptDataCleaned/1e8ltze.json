Not too long an expiry because of long tail risk.\n\nJust saw this Yahoo Finance post:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/biggest-outage-history-crowdstrike-stock-095000169.html?client_hour_clock=24&clientlang=2&guccounter=1\n\nFirst, here's a very important point: The troubles weren't linked to a cyberattack. They were simply the result of a faulty software update. This is key because it doesn't call into question CrowdStrike's ability to do its job of protecting companies from such attacks. And though this software bug created chaos, unfortunately these sorts of events do happen from time to time -- and have happened to other companies.\n\nEdit: Biden stepping down. Okay nothing to do with CRWD.",

Following a faux pas like this CRWD is going to be on defense, desperately trying to retain relationships.\n\nIt will cost them in the short term, and it will cost them in the long term. Renewals are going to be aggressively discounted for retention. Existing contracts will be ignored if the customers really want to immediately migrate.\n\nDespite legal standing to assert the TCV, in order to realize that you'd be looking at litigation against all customers who wanted to leave. Not only will that be prohibitively expensive, but it risks making a bad situation much worse with respect to future customer perception of the brand.\n\nThe more meaningful reality is that rip & replace is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive - even if there are comparable vendors on balance today, which isn't clear. More than likely a majority of customers will stay but every contract will be discounted significantly in the name of retention.\n\nRunaway churn in SaaS/PaaS is about the only thing that can kill businesses over $100M ARR.
