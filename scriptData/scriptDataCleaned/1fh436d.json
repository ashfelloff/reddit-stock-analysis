There were other mandated sales that also occurred the past few years that drew it down more, BUT recently they've managed to prevent about 140M of other mandated sales that were to occur (IIRC the TCJA had 10M in mandated sales, and plenty of other laws that has been passed prior to that which had mandated sales baked in).",
