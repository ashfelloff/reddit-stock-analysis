SPY volume is barely at its daily average and it is still far from the 20DAY EMA (around 551 I think). I think if we see real selling volume we're in for a full correction. I might be very wrong though so who knows, and I'd welcome counter arguments. Some analysts seem to be saying this could be a correction: [https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-sachs-says-sp-500-correction-is-coming-urges-investors-not-to-buy-dip-3501595](https://ca.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/goldman-sachs-says-sp-500-correction-is-coming-urges-investors-not-to-buy-dip-3501595) \n\n(edit I meant 20DAY EMA)",
