  "title": "Williams Sonoma Stock Split and \"Low Inventory\" Strategy is Scam to Consumer",

Didn't know this \"luxe brand\" was basically an internet scam until I gave them thousands of dollars for nursery furniture (WSM is parent company for West Elm/Pottery Barn/Pottery Barn Kids) and it's been EIGHT months and still nothing after numerous calls. When I posted in other forums, it's clear that this is a business practice they've sustained for years, and some people didn't get their furniture for TWO YEARS. \n\nBasically, a $7 billion a year corporation is stealing the time-value of money from members of Main Street.\n\nI am pretty sure if it caught up with them, they'd have to pay millions in fees for violating the FTC's \"Mail, Internet, or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule\" that requires consent from the consumer for a greater than 30 day delay. They did not give it to me and I doubt they give it to others. \n\nFrom the internet - \"The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can impose civil penalties of up to $50,120 per violation of its rules, or per day for ongoing violations\"\n\nI am going to talk to a lawyer to understand if this can be a class-action lawsuit. Curious what other experienced stock investors think of this. ",

Furniture takes a long time to build and has a lot of upfront costs (materials and labor).\n\nIf you came to me and asked me.to build you a bookcase, I'd charge you at least a portion upfront and probably not deliver the merchandise for a long time while I built it. \n\nHowever, they should clearly give you a timeframe to expect your merchandise. As a business, I'd offer compensation if that timeframe was exceeded, but there's no law that saws they have to.",

Additionally the items were listed in stock at the time and are still listed as in stock on their website. A manager I spoke to says inventory is always wrong.",
