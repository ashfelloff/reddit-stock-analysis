  "selftext": "So I invested my life savings into bonds but got bored of the 5.5% return and decided I wanted to try options with bigger amounts since I traded with small amounts of cash. The bullish run after September ate me up and I lost 210k over a span of a couple months.\n\nI waited until July of 2024 to start trading again because I wanted to grow my real estate company and needed the capital to buy cash. So I said oh well I already lost everything so what’s another short. Thankfully Japan decided to raise rates and tanked our market and I made it all back.\n\nNow my portfolio is up 50k over a span of multiple trades. God is good\n\nYOLO.",
