While CTR for Reddit is on the lower end, the user base of Reddit is actually more primed for making purchases than say on Facebook.

When you want to look up a product or something, you’re checking TikTok and typing it in Google -> which generally will lead to a subreddit as a top search result.\n\nI foresee this becoming more prominent over the next few years - it will take awhile for enough to get on board to get enough long term data.
