The fact is that all the candidates for president that we have had in recent years, at least the one with any chance of winning, are good for the economy and wall street. Some are better than others but none would justify a significant drop in the market if elected. \n\nAll of what you hear about threats to democracy etc. is a political game meant to score points with the base, increase donations, and entrench existing political power. I say this as someone who is not a fan of the orange buffoon. The politicians and pundits saying Trump is a threat to democracy don't truly believe it. Not now, not back then. It's just a way for them to signal their political affiliation and gain social credit.

I think at the very least riots may have occurred, which would have drastic affects on the market.\n\nThe best course of action is to just let the election play out. If Trump gets elected then we can at least have solice knowing this would be his last term ever. The US would only have to endure two additional years of being the laughing stock of the world again. We just have to hope he does nothing to worsen inflation or cause a war in those two years because both would be horrible for the stock market long term.\n\nAs others noted, I do believe he'll call for rate cuts. The idiots will cheer thinking it's a good thing, which is what he counts on. So we'll be back to fighting inflation after his term again.",

What will increase for sure is volatility which has been low. But traders will be looking to hedge which will increase implied vol across the board.",
