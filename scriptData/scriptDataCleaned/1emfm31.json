Aged like milk no?\n\nRivian is well received and has good investment backing. They are also handcuffed to EV sentiment and I foresee more growing pains in that realm unless crude oil prices skyrocket.\n\nTesla has the name, the network they built, charge credits, and years upon years of advancement in EV MFG (not saying it‚Äôs QUALITY tho lol). The brand attracts all sorts of different investors.\n\nRivian is simply an EV MFR. Tesla is perceived as more. Why should Rivian be valued even half that of ford or GM? Its stock has as much upside as it does downside. And at the end of the day its share price does not reflect its real value in the industry. I believe shortly after IPO it was the 2nd most valuable car MFR behind Tesla, which again is more than a car company in the eyes of investors.\n\nTheir bread and butter will be to reach profitability, but they have less mechanisms to do that and it will take years. Honestly I‚Äôm just waiting for them to drop to roughly $8b market cap and then wait for full acquisition once EV gains a little more momentum.",
