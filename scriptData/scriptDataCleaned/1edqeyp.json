              "body": "There are three ways out.¬†\n\n1) as you described.¬†This is called austerity and is the primary way that economies deal with this type of situation.¬†\n\nAusterity has a long history and is the preferred solution of central banks for hundreds of years, so you‚Äôll see a lot of people talk about ‚Äúreducing spending and increasing taxes.‚Äù It‚Äôs the central banks solution to everything, but it‚Äôs not what is actually driving the story these days ‚Äî technology improvement have overtaken austerity as a solution to financial expansion for over 50 years in leading economies.\n\nThe US, with its massive financial, technological and military advantage, is a little different leading us to‚Ä¶¬†\n\n2) gdp growth through **massive wars** and the associated spending. Look up the recent US draft changes to see what they just did. And lastly‚Ä¶\n\n3) the national debt is debt over gdp ‚Äî a ratio. It‚Äôs not just a number, it‚Äôs a number related to productivity.¬†Let‚Äôs expand on this so people understand it better.¬†\n\nA country's national debt is often expressed as a percentage of its gross domestic product (GDP), called the *debt-to-GDP ratio*.¬†¬†\n\nThis ratio is a useful way to compare debt levels over time and between countries of different sizes, and is the standard way economists look at national debts ‚Äî they are relative to the economies they are attached to. Common sense, right?¬†\n\nIt can also be interpreted as the number of years it would take to pay back the debt if the entire GDP were used for repayment. ¬†That‚Äôs easy to understand, right?\n\nA higher debt-to-GDP ratio generally indicates that a government will have a harder time repaying its debt and a higher risk of default.¬†\n\nDefault could cause financial panic in both domestic and international markets and that‚Äôs what everyone is worried about.¬†\n\nHowever, the *ratio can decrease due to a government surplus, GDP growth, or inflation*.¬†\n\nSo, you could **increase productivity** to a large degree and grow the economy out of its bad debt *ratio*, such as with the application of breakthrough productivity technologies like robotics, manufacturing 4.0, and cognitive digital intelligence.¬†\n\nYou can also inflate your way out of it, and as long as your inflation is better than competing alternatives you can remain relatively stable‚Ä¶ counterintuitive but that‚Äôs what has been happening to the US dollar exactly since 2020.\n\nSo, all of these ways are valid ways out, and each is likely to contribute to the ultimate solution to the US‚Äôs current situation.¬†\n\nPeople often present things are ‚Äúdebt bad, everything over‚Äù but the reality is much more complex ‚Äî and that complexity is in play right now.\n\nEven this post is childishly simplistic in its explanation, but I think it‚Äôs important to go deeper and seek a more thorough understanding of complex problems like this.\n\nSome combination of all of these things will likely be employed in the next 10 years, and at the core is going to be the question of whether the US has wise decision makers or bad decision makers, because they will make a profound different to how this turns out.¬†",

                      "body": "Technically you may be correct but there is a *vast* difference between a war economy and a peacetime economy engaging in stimulus debt spending. WW2 just happened to be the last actual major war.\n\nDuring wartime, governments typically increase spending significantly to finance military operations, procurement, and other war-related expenses. This spending often leads to higher levels of debt. The focus is on immediate needs, such as defense and production of war materials, and the economic rationale is to ensure national security and support the war effort, often disregarding short-term fiscal constraints.\n\nIn peacetime, stimulus spending is generally aimed at stimulating economic growth, reducing unemployment, and addressing economic downturns or recessions.¬†\nThe focus is on long-term economic stability and growth, and spending is directed towards infrastructure, education, healthcare, and social welfare programs. Debt incurred during peacetime is often more scrutinized, with an emphasis on sustainable economic policies and debt levels.\n\nWartime spending typically results in rapid economic changes, such as increased production, employment, and sometimes inflation. Peacetime stimulus aims for more gradual economic improvements and stability.\n\nWartime debt is often considered a necessary short-term measure, whereas peacetime debt requires careful management to avoid long-term fiscal problems. There is much more of a focus on fiscal responsibility during peacetime and wartime spending tends to be dramatically greater.\n\nWartime spending prioritizes defense and like I just said: immediate needs, often sidelining other sectors. Peacetime stimulus focuses on sectors like infrastructure, healthcare, and education, impacting long-term growth and societal well-being. These are radically different spending priorities.\n\nJust because something operates on the same economic principle or utilizes similar mechanisms doesn‚Äôt make it intrinsically equivalent like your insinuating.\n\nThe same dollar buys a book or a gun, but when you need to buy a gun it‚Äôs generally not an experience that equivocates a great deal of elasticity of demand. You‚Äôre buying a gun because you need it right now, books because you‚Äôre hoping the investment in the future pays off.\n\nAgain again, peacetime spending on defense is also not an equivalent, as we know from the percentage gdp nato nations have been willing to spend. Only after the Russian invasion have we seen European nations start to pony up percentages of gdp as they realize they have an existential risk.",
