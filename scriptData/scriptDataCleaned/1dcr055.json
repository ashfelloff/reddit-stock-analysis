  "selftext": "(I can't add more than one image, so I will be referencing them and linking in comments)\n\n*TLDR:* The stock price, thanks to rising cargo shipment demand, has gone through the roof. Citibank has tried to cover their/clients asses by manipulating the stock price. After the drop and today's price reassurance is **now the perfect opportunity to buy in.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygn0v8x03s5d1.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=36e4c9563bd3b56d82b414357010b1dc88f0197e\n\nThe stock price of this cargo shipping company has in the last 6 months risen **168.37%**  and during the last month **16.26%.** \n\nThis is mainly caused by the increasing demand in overseas container shipping, as proven by the rising **WCI** (World Container Index). *The composite index increased 12% to $4,716 per 40ft container this week and has increased 181% when compared with the same week last year.*\n\nNow that we know the price increase is justified and why it's happening, let's take a look at the stock development during the last few days. \n\nFrom Wednesday on Thursday the price went from **28,80 USD** to a low of **19,11 USD** the following day (aa **drop of 20%**, image 1 in comments). \n\n*Why did this happen you are probably wondering??*\n\n[Kenon sold 5 million shares in a block trade using Citigroup. ](https://x.com/christankerfund/status/1798537825643859977)Once again, why? The price has massively increased in a small period of time so Kenon probably tried to short sell, but the price just kept increasing. So they tried to save their ass with Citigroup reporting the same day a price target in their analysis of 13USD. (image 2). Pushing the price in AH down allowing Kenon to save their asses. \n\nThat the price target of 13USD is absolute bullshit and ZIM has potential to aim way higher (30s, 40s) was proven today. Retail pulled the price 4,45% to 20,43USD. (image 3). **This is a very bullish signal.** \n\nEdit: position in comments",
