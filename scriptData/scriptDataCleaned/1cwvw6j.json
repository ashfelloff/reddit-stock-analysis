My point is that he did NOT throw away 40 billion to prove that he isn't afraid of shooting himself in the foot.\n\nTwitter's Covid share price peaked at \\~$70/share during Covid. Elon didn't think, when he made the offer, that he was vastly overpaying for Twitter. He thought the cost structure in Twitter was bloated and that he could easily turn it profitable. People were talking about how he could easily IPO Twitter again, at a profit, once he made the necessary cost cuts. At least initially, investors and banks were trying to co-invest with him because they thought buying Twitter was a genius move. \n\nWhen Elon realized that he vastly, vastly overpaid for Twitter, and that he was now in a position where he had to shoot his foot, he tried to retreat. He hired lawyers and tried to get out of the transaction, but had to close in the end.\n\nSo no, he is not the kind of person to shoot his own foot to make a point. He won't leave Tesla just because his ridiculous pay package is shot down.\n\nP.S. \n\nAlso, he really “only” contributed ~$25 BN of his own money. $40 BN is misleading. The rest of the money is from bank loans and equity investors. If Twitter goes bankrupt, he’s not on the hook for the rest of the money.
