  "selftext": "Hey guys, Airbnb is reporting earnings today and I wanted to know everyone's thoughts on it. So far they're looking to hit $1.8 billion in revenue, marking a solid 20% year-over-year growth. Guys, that's insane. That’s not just good; it's their best first quarter ever. We're looking at a net income of $117 million compared to a net loss of $19 million last year. The turnaround story here is all about scaling revenue while keeping a tight leash on expenses and raking in some decent interest income. This rocketed their net income margin from a shitty -1% to a pretty decent +6%.\n\nSo here I'm gonna outline my bullish thesis on Airbnb and try to justify buying calls for earnings. I want to know if it's a good idea. \n\n**Cash Flow and Share Buybacks**\n\nFree Cash Flow (FCF) hitting a massive $1.6 billion, thanks to increased bookings and margin expansions. What does Airbnb do with all that cash? Buybacks. They’ve bought back $2 billion worth of shares and just announced a new buyback program up to $2.5 billion. This rewards shareholders and boosts EPS.\n\n**Bookings and Travel Trends**\n\nTravel isn't just rebounding; it's *evolving*. Airbnb’s total Nights and Experiences booked jumped by 19%. 36% spike in cross-border bookings. Long-term stays (28 nights or more) are also doing well, making up 18% of all bookings. This isn't just a rebound; how and why people travel is changing.\n\n**Supply Growth**\n\nOn the supply side, Airbnb boosted its listings by 18% year-over-year. That's growth across the board... North America, Latin America, urban, non-urban, etc. More supply means more options for consumers and more revenue potential for Airbnb.\n\n**The Analyst's Angle**\n\nFrom what I've read all analysts are keen on Airbnb's performance, noting the resilience in travel demand and robust financial health. Looking at pre-earnings forecasts there are strong expectations based on prevailing travel trends and economic conditions.\n\n### My thoughts\n\nAirbnb is doing pretty damn well in our post-pandemic world. They're capitalizing on new travel behaviors, like increased interest in international destinations and longer stays, which could be a long-term trend rather than a short-lived reaction.\n\nSo guys, what’s the play here? Airbnb seems to be on a solid path with strategic stock buybacks, strong quarterly performances, and robust growth prospects in the travel sector. You can grab shares if you're looking for a growth stock with some stability and bullish market sentiment. I'm going to grab calls tho. IV on calls actually doesn't make it seem like it's worth doing. If you expect a 5% bump AH, calls won't be profitable due to the premiums right now. 5/10 160c is $5.80/share. But I'll go ahead and grab the 165c just to see, it's a little cheaper at $3.75/share.",

Felt like the demand was less and you could stay in some really cool places for $100-200 a night. Now those same places are $300-450 a night with all the extra demand, fees and inflation. I also really dig not having to look up a breakfast place if I don't want to. Hitting a continental even just for a coffee and pastry is a great way to start a vacation morning.",
