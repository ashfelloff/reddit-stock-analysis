              "body": "Ngl, it looks bad. I was in very similar situation with MRVL earnings. I was in a call for about a month out. Come morning, I saw that shit go down from $485 to less than $150 within seconds of market opening. My regarded ass doubled down, and down, and down…u get the picture. I ended up with 18 contracts and my average went down to about $81 per contract. I sat through that shit Friday. Then come Monday, it finally went up b4 market opened. As soon as the fucking bell rang, I was slight green and I sold. I got lucky. Instead of losing just $485, I was looking at losing over $1300 at one point. So be careful in doing whatever it is u r planning on doing. And good luck!",
