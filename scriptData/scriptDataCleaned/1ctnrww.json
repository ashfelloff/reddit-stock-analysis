You could wait for a big market correction, then buy some SPY calls, and maybe you could make it all back, but it doesn't sound like you have the impulse control to wait for the ideal setup. You have to seriously ask yourself why you are doing this. Are you in it for the rush? Are you trying to make money? Many, if not most here, have \"been there, done that\". I have lost so much money being overleveraged in the past that now I am TOO careful. \n\nBest of luck to you. I strongly suspect that you won't listen to anyone here, but who knows.",

Like today I brought a SMCI put (at around +1.5%) after I saw majority of other stocks at red but low and behold it was rising and I sold it at a loss of $300 before losing more. I was right to sell since it rose to +2.5% afterwards but if I were to hold it until close I would've actually made money on it. \n\nSame for my SPY puts I brought a day before. There was an opportunity to sell for a gain during the day but sold at a loss an hour in open.\n\nI try not to overleverage anymore (revenge bet). Only at times were it seems too good to pass up like the first 5-10mins of open and close. Made 6k on TSLA puts Wed's open and made almost 1k on TSLA calls during the day today. Going to start selling calls/puts to get some spare change at least. Wish I can make a journal of my journey on here tbh😅",
