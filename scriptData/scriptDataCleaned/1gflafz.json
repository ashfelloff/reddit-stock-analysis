Including tesla (he basically gave the manufacturing away lol). The hardest parts for an ev is the battery. The easiest parts for a car is manufactured by your friends and acquaintances. In manufacturing, ppl working in the same industry (especially the ceos) are really tight knit. They commonly go out to eat together and play golf together (especially in East asia).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd this is what you get.

I personally know how the car parts manufacturing industry in East Asia works. And although yeah theoretically it's hard to source every parts that a car needs, it's far easier for a Chinese company to source all parts than an American company. Just by how the cultural nature of car parts manufacturing in East Asia Works.\n\n\nLike I said, EVERY car part manufacturing ceos personally know each other in East Asia. You guys will never understand the scene here and you guys will NEVER win capitalistic wise in terms of manufacturing cars cheaper so long as you guys keep outsourcing the manufacturing to china. Although it's too late now. All the technical know-how was shared anyway so china doesn't need any more help.",
