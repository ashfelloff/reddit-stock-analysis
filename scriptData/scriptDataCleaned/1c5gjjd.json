Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)\n\n• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.\n\n• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",

The bond market is still pricing in rate cuts even with the 10y moving up to 4.66%. No rate cuts would eventually uninvert the yield curve on the long end. That means a 5.4%+ 10y and a ~10% drop in the price of TLT that would eat the 4.5% dividends and then some. You wouldn't just need conviction rates would drop. You would need to be convinced that a recession and rush to safety were imminent.",
