A classic scenario where people who lose money will essentially up the ante to get back to where they were. It's a horrible phenomenon of gambling.\n\nIf you have $100,000 and gamble $500 and lose it. Your next thought should be, ok lost $500 and that sucked, time to walk away with $99,500. But instead, what tends to happen is people try to bet $1,000 to make it back. And then lose that. So of course, they continue to up the ante thinking that eventually, they will get lucky if they try enough times.\n\nOnce they reach the 50% loss mark, it becomes evident that they either need to YOLO their remaining stack, or YOLO half of it twice and double both times to get back.\n\nGambling is evil.
