If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.\n\nThe bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)\n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

          "body": "They do for me also all the time but then if it starts recovering I’m more than happy to buy back in even at a higher price. \n\nFor example, just this morning. Put in a market open order which opened and filled at $83 on a $10k investment. Had a meeting around opening bell so wasn’t watching and it swiftly dropped 6%. Hesitated a bit because I thought maybe it had found bottom but quickly realized it hadn’t. Put in a stop loss of 3% that was quickly filled. The stock has since recovered to around 77 a share. I’m still watching it and will be buying back in at some point, not all that concerned about the loss because I’ve learned that if it’s falling, you don’t know how long it’s going to fall for.",
