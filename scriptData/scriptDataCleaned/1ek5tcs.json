  "title": "$RARE is due for a drop",
  "score": 88,
  "selftext": "Last Friday, RARE beat earnings expectations, causing the stock to shoot up by 14.31% ($47.38-$50.47) in one day. Post-market it has gone up an extra 2.97%($50-$51.97). This situation is similar to a previous positive earnings report back in February when RARE also beat expectations and shot up to around $53. However, after a month, it sank back down to a price of $45. At the two peaks of that run, RARE had an RSI of 71.55 and then 67.50. The current RSI now is 72.80. In addition, the stock currently has a -7.95 EPS, -208.43% Return on Equity, and a -121.57% Profit Margin. RARE is currently overvalued to the tits and due for a significant drop, so puts are definitely the play.\n\nI also invite you to do your own DD on RARE, I'm just here to bring attention to it (I'm 18 with only $200 in the bank)\n\nLink for it on Yahoo Finance:  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RARE/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RARE/)",
