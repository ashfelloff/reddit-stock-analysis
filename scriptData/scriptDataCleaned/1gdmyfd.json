The oil market is taking BBs word and pricing in the sector won’t be affected.

Iran would certainly mobilize and start attacking the energy infrastructure in Saudis Arabia and choking off the Hormuz straight as to pinch energy prices globally. Iran without its oil and nuclear program would lose influence in the region which might back them into a corner and also draw a stronger reaction from Russia as it needs Irans support and influence.

Israel might be hitting strategic targets well but psychologically they are loosing the battle. who will forget the videos of 200 missiles on Israel's air. their public also knows who is the real enemy . without taking down Iran's islamic regime they will keep fighting Hizbullah , Hamas and Houtis for years maybe centuries ....Iran won the diplomatic war against Israel as of now ... we will see what will happen after US election . but if Iran doesnt hit back , i think its over for Israel ...",
