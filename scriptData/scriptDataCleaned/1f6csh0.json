I truly believe that my next 10x increase to come from AI. \n\nI would say, if these companies are \"just creating value for shareholders\" then I'm one of those shareholders that's benefiting from them. I wasn't even very aggressive in my investments. I was just playing along at home and just about anyone else can as well. Paying attention to the industry and know a bit about the technology behind the hype, I think it's fairly easy to spot when things are slowing down and about to turning sour, so you'd be able to start to slowly withdraw from those investments and park your money elsewhere that's safer. \n\nRight now, I don't think AI is anywhere near its peak. Yes, AI is premature and we don't know where it'll end up or how people will be making money from it, but it's also far too premature to be worried about the bubble bursting.

                                  "body": "The dot.com bubble was very different. Not to say that valuations could be stretched at this point. I was old enough to do the dot.com. Right around 30. I know way too many companies that were basically three card monty. Sucking up VC money. Padding sales data when they showed up at the offices. Pipeline stuffing. Also, essentially we will buy X or advertise c on your platform if you do the same with us. Just shuffling VC money around the room to look like platform had interest or their was sales. I wouldn’t doubt there are probably some companies like that now. But that was so much about infancy. This is not infancy. This is massive corporations with massive earnings and cash hoards throwing that cash at being first movers … it’s that important. It would be idiotic for the meta nvda msft types, downstream chip players and fabs, software value add players, to be burning through their cash as they are. They know history. They know what is playing out here. Having used ChatGPT for a myriad of things, my wife the same. I have been learning prompts, she just learn as you go, we are stunned at the impact on our lives and then I read and see what else is happening that makes what we are doing silly. When companies like msft are throwing down 125B on a single datacenter as an example. You just don’t do that on hype. This race is critical to corporate survival and global balances of power. He’ll even China is creating a regulatory body to ensure we don’t end up AIing wwiii with all of it. Tech companies are readily letting people go, hiring at lower salaries bc AI is changing the landscape for standard computer science guys. Just look at the silly things your person at home is doing on social media with AI tools. And then imagine what the players are doing with the best minds and engineers in the country/world. We haven’t even started to speak to timelines on healthcare and processing data regarding studies and time to insight on drug candidates. Learning is going to be accelerated by magnitudes and at speed we can’t fathom. Things will be needed. Necessity is the mother of invention. It doesn’t not fail. Power sources will be uncovered. People had been far and happy for a while. No more. Another anecdotal cliche, publish or perish…translation keep up and get it done or disappear.",

What EV/EBIT does is strip out the effect of how a company is financed.\n\nSay you have two companies both with the same EV ($1B) and the same EBIT ($50M). One of them has no debt, so its $1B market cap and pays no interest costs (its net income will be $50M minus whatever taxes it pays). The other one has $500M market cap and $500M debt, so its net income will be $50M minus interest costs minus taxes. They may have different P/E ratios based on the interest and tax regime but the important thing to understand is that underneath they are the same operating business just financed different ways. So you have to evaluate the two things separately (quality of the business + how the business is financed).",

      "body": "I worked for a competitor of IBM for years, so I acknowledge my bias. That said, I found IBM to be a kind of cult to many customers in the 80s and 90s, and a few even now. \n\nAt first, enterprises looked at IBM as the Cadillac of computing. They locked in many places with their mainframe computing; the IBM 360 was a staple of business. The biggest places had sales staff with personal relations to the C level of enterprises and sole sourced the equipment. UNIVAC, DEC, Tandem and others to a lesser extent. \n\nAs the 80s and 90s rolled around, Big Blue kept high prices on their Cadillac and although they rolled out their UNIX (AIX) and virtually invented the PC, the pricing was high,  proprietary in an open source minded world and they lost market share. \n\nFor one retail company, the Bd of Directors required competitive bidding, and even though any competitor could provide less price and equal or superior function, IBM would be awarded the work \"because we are used to them\". Finally others stopped bidding the pointless exercise; it was just to press IBM to keep their pricing down. When the old guard retired, and the enterprise realized the premium they paid for obsolete proprietary systems it was too late. They still used the IBM OS/2 PC into the 2000s. They went from sales of billions to bankruptcy. I am convinced their cult belief in IBM and failure to modernize contributed. \n\nI did a study for multiple companies that illustrated if they moved off the bloated AIX systems to competitive systems, they would save millions. The paradigm shift always seemed risky, but those that moved were well rewarded. \n\nIn the last 15 years, where IBM competed against Dell,  HP/HPE, Fujitsu, Amazon, Microsoft and others for data center refresh, cloud and other updates, they  rarely stood the test, unless it was from one of those cultist enterprises who had decided before the bid. \n\nThey still have a mainframe market; it is expensive to migrate but not impossible. Their database product , PC, AIX and others are considered by most to be \"old iron\". Even their cloud is a bit proprietary and pricey; iron cloud. Watson has been discussed\n\nTheir quantum computing research is admirable but given their history of trying to make things proprietary so they can keep price and margin high, I won't expect it to play well with others. It is vaporware somewhat. \n\nAll said, their sales and margins and employee count are down to 2/3 of the numbers 10 years ago. The legacy of arrogance. \n\nI vote thumbs down. \n\nFWIW.",
