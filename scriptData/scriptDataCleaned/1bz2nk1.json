That means there are no market makers involved in this share. Market makers are important to ETFs as they create and redeem units to keep the ETF trading close to NAV.\n\nThe person who first put together this DD did so with the explicit idea that this stock will become the flavour of the month and trade at a stupid premium to NAV. They have openly discussed on the DXYZ subreddit trying to get this onto the wall street bets front page.\n\nThis is an open attempt at pumping the stock via WSB in order to get out at a premium. The fact that this DD is flawed should tell you all you need to know about it's quality.",
