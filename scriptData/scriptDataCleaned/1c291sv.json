      "body": "The sentiment around INTC now is extremely analogous to AMD in 2015. And I see it at the Zen preview 2015 part of the cycle. Until there is more certainty around 18A, there isn't a real reason to be buying Intel at the moment, especially given market conditions.\n\nFor those new to the sub. AMD was memed on for years from 2015 to 2018 before it finally broke out. This was 2 years AFTER the release of Zen 1. And keep in mind, AMD's long term goal was 20% of the server market in 2025 and parity with Intel in performance. Does that sound as bullish as leadership in processing by 2027? \n\nI bought from 30, rode it to 50 and sold at 42 at the news. I rather be in the market so I have about 70% OXY 30% GLD.\n\nI expect Intel to be a 200 stock at some point before 2027. I just think I can get a better entry, maybe even in the low 30s.",

I have about 2300+ shares 1/2 my net worth in INTC (pretty regarded I know) and managed to pour in on both sides of the dip over the last few years with a cost basis around 45. To make matters worse much of that came from selling off AMD and.. NVDA. Fuck me sideways upside down and every which way. I'm drowning here and down about 20k between all my accounts with INTC over 3-4 years. Fortunately I held on to at least some NVDA and sold off in March because it seemed stupidly overvalued.\n\nINTC as a long term hold has made sense to me for years now with their change in direction, righting past wrongs of not adopting euv tech, foundry services, and the fact that they can actually manufacture chips seemed like a more stable business. Their current worth seems crazy low.\n\nMay time prove us right! ðŸš€ðŸŒ›",

      "body": "I believe that if Intel is successful in their fab business they will be a $3T company in 10 years.  For almost all degens on WSB 10 years might as well be 100 years.  \n\nOn a shorter term horizon Intel has a few things that can move the stock but nothing like what WSB likes to see, these things will take months if not a year or two.\n\n1. Gaudi3 - can compete with NVidia on a price/performance level.  At some point Nvidia can lower their prices but until the production of AI chips can exceed demand that won't happen.  I expect saturation to happen some time in 2026. Until then I think everyone selling AI chips can win.\n\nOther things that can happen: NVidia chips are made almost exclusively by Taiwan Semi (and all their high end chips are) The stupid pissing matches between the US and China can have unknown consequences.  What if the US Fed government requires all subcontractors to use US based and manufactured (or at least not China/Taiwan) chips in their AI applications?  TSM is still a few years out before they can manufacture in the US and even then the US Fab will not be the most cutting edge tech. This means Intel's new fabs will start making bank from the get go but the Ohio fab won't go into production until 2026.\n\n2. MobilEye - Intel owns 88%.  But the market is often more regarded than WSB and If full self driving takes off it can happen that INTC's market cap is less than MBLY.  It has happened that a parent company is worth less than the sum of its parts. This isn't the case with INTC right now but I think that the value of MobilEye is not reflected in INTC stock price.\n\nThere is a possibility that there are some applications that will soak up all available AI chips and still have a shortage (Full Self Driving cars, Robotics, etc.) but I think that before these explode in the market they will be available in smaller quantities, i.e. one year 5000, next year 50,000, then 5 million, then everyone so this is unlikely to happen over the next year.\n\n3. Windows 10 end of life in 2025.  Hundreds of millions of PCs will need to be upgraded before Oct of 2025.  Intel will maintain a dominant marketshare of these.\n\n\n\nSemiconductors are cyclical and have been for dozens of years.  We are currently still on the upswing.  NVDA may reach $2K if mania strikes people.  TSM may double from where it is now and INTC will hit $50!\n\nAfter the first bust in AI chips will be a great buying opportunity because the next boom will happen a few years after the bust.  Again these things are a few years out and not WSB territory.  Someone will happen to buy 0 days on the day of the bust and turn 10K to 1M but that is random luck, before then 1000 people will turn $10K to $0.\n\nDisclosure, I own 2K shares INTC, 2K shares TSM in an IRA (50% of my IRA).  I have 15 years to retirement, will come earlier if my predictions pan out.  I hope to sell before the bust and buy back after the bust and retire at the next boom.",
