  "selftext": "Ford Motor guided to the low end of its previously announced 2024 earnings forecast as it slightly topped Wall Street’s third-quarter expectations.\n\nThe Detroit automaker said Monday it now expects adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of about $10 billion. It had previously guided to between $10 billion and $12 billion. It retained its forecast for adjusted free cash flow of between $7.5 billion and $8.5 billion.\n\nHere’s how the company performed in the third quarter, compared with average estimates compiled by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 49 cents adj. vs. 47 cents adj. expected\n\nAutomotive revenue: $43.07 billion vs. $41.88 billion expected\n\nThe automaker was under pressure after a disappointing second quarter in which unexpected warranty costs caused the company to miss Wall Street’s earnings expectations.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/ford-motor-f-earnings-q3-2024.html",

This is probably a value play, but they should cut back on those absurd adjustments that somehow show a 1.65x GAAP EBIT (how can you actually manage to almost 1.7x your EBIT, and they also had the same multiple aprox. for the first 9 mo. of 2023)",
