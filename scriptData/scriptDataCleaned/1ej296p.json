The chips that TSMC produces in Taiwan (#1) are way more advanced than anything produced in the US and it will be that way for quite a while.

Sure we could say Intel makes 'advanced' chips but their business is pretty messed up the past couple years or so - meanwhile AMD and Nvidia dominate the CPU/GPU markets for the most part moving forward (specifically regarding servers/data centers - where the money is made).",

Usually, it will be triggered by some institutions that got greedy and over leveraged themself into the bull run and tried to cover it up with documents/trades. Greedy times are the best for it because everyone is too busy trying to make that easy sure to win money. Wouldn't be surprised if it has something to do with nvda investments.\n\nThis will lead to investigation and findings that multiple institutions did the same, and we have a 2008 2.0, 2020 2.0, dotcom 2.0, etc. New regulations and repeat cycle.",
