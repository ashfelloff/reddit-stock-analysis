  "score": 122,
  "selftext": "Eli LillyÂ on Wednesday fell short of profit and revenue expectations for the third quarter and slashed its full-year adjusted profit guidance, sending its stock tumbling roughly 10%.\n\nThe drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $13.02 to $13.52 per share, down from previous guidance of $16.10 to $16.60 per share.Â \n\nEli Lilly also lowered the high-end of its revenue outlook for the year and now expects sales of between $45.4 billion and $46 billion. The companyâ€™s previous guidance called for revenue of as much as $46.6 billion.\n\nHereâ€™s whatÂ Eli Lilly reported for the periodÂ ended September 30 compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:Â \n\n* **Earnings per share:**Â $1.18 adjusted vs. $1.47 expected\n* **Revenue:**Â $11.44 billion vs. $12.11 billion expected\n\nDemand in the U.S. has far outpaced supply for Lillyâ€™s incretin drugs, such as Zepbound and Mounjaro, over the last year. Both treatments mimic certain gut hormones to tamp down a personâ€™s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.\n\nThe popularity of those injectable drugs has forced both Eli Lilly and its main rival, Novo Nordisk, to invest billions to increase manufacturing capacity for the treatments.\n\nEli Lillyâ€™s supply woes began to ease earlier this year. As of Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administrationâ€™sÂ drug databaseÂ said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Still, the agency warns that patients may not always be able to immediately fill their prescription for those drugs at a particular pharmacy.",
