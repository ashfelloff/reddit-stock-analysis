Here is positioning as of today 3:30 pm, the left side is the call-side gamma exposure (calculated using open interest), right side is put side gamma exposure.  I used all expiries from now until the end of the month. Breaking through 59 is a key level, as the exposure flips from net-negative to net-positive. If we get to 64 or 65 prior to your expiration, I would at very least take half the contracts off and move the stop to break-even for the remaining. It's possible it goes to 70, but sputters out after that. Put-gamma hedging forms support at 55.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kb6xok0ngifd1.png?width=1171&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6d0b798a45029008d183f0b8e48d6d6cb842d18\n\nEDIT: Oh this is an earnings play. In that case it's anyone's guess, good luck. But still, there's an awful lot of August 2nd calls open and we're below all of it, so we will probably pull up into them. But as you can see those August 16th puts at 52.5 may be where traders are thinking price will head after call-side takes profits or if earnings are bad. But maybe they're hedging their longs and we could take a bounce down there.",
