After a sector has been on fire for weeks week, the question becomes what is left that still has juice?\n\n**The answer: Large Reactors. Specifically Brookfield Renewable Corp (BEPC)**\n\n  \n**LARGE REACTORS**\n\nSMRs have been getting all the attention in the media. When Mag7 talks about nuclear - they talk about SMR. Why? Small is beautiful. And less intimidating. This is more about optics that strategy.\n\nLets get into the data: *Altman wants multiple 5 GW AI centers built across the countr*y.\n\nSMRs produce yield 10 MW to 300 MW. And that upper end is theoretical, because none are in production. Even assuming a 300 Mwe output, that is 15 reactors per data center.\n\nLet's take a step back. Is the gov really going to start building dozens of SMRs at once - before a single one is up and running and established with a proven performance and safety record? Especially after decades of building scarcely any reactors at all?\n\nFar, far too much risk. Yes, there will be a handful of SMRs built to prove out the technology. This may take around a decade. *And then* those need to for a number of years (and likely be iterated upon) before these is the confidence to deploy these widely.\n\n**In sum, to go from 0 to many SMRs will take decades.**\n\n**We don’t have decades. AI is a military horserace between the US and the rest of the world – particularly china – and in two decades the winner of that will already be decided.**\n\n  \nThe US needs to scale up nuclear energy production NOW. There is only one path to do that. And in sweeping report by the DOE - with industry and government as a target (i.e. no incentive to whitewash things by playing up SMRs) - the DOE outlines that plan:\n\n[https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF\\_DOE\\_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf](https://liftoff.energy.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LIFTOFF_DOE_AdvNuclear-vX7.pdf)\n\n  \nThe main parts of the report. \n\n- SMRs won't cut it for scaling out nuclear\n\n- They need \\*a single design of a large nuclear reactor\\*. \n\nIt must be a single design because of the realities of our national nuclear workforce. We don’t have the technical expertise to have folks going around being one type of nuclear plant, re-tooling, re-trained – and then building a different design.\n\n- They want to run with something tried and true. Something we know from many years already that gets the job done. That people in our nation already have experience building and maintaining. **That friends is the AP1000.**\n\n**- They want 5-10 new nuclear reactors \\*of that single design\\***\n\n**- They want that order to be placed before 2025**\n\n\n\nRelevant snips from the report:\n\n[Large Reactors are Will be The Bulk of Energy Production](https://preview.redd.it/9aektshonbwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=367e220243be46d8185a744958e9818530fb68a5)\n\n[They Want to Order 5-10 Reactors in One Go](https://preview.redd.it/fcwok020obwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c98e1c063e85c5f6b6c215f5d822713908a6f2)\n\n[AP1000 is the Design they Want](https://preview.redd.it/r01x3841obwd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c867e8ca8f5977fa0e704161e495ca6c102ebde)\n\n[They Want to Place these Orders Now](https://preview.redd.it/f37nrri9xbwd1.png?width=1053&format=png&auto=webp&s=b41798db75ddff864ceeb2d90d2c4984e0cba595)\n\n\n\n**INTERMISSION: PROJECT VOGTLE**\n\nWe are unambiguously on the eve on a nuclear renaissance. Yet there has basically only one major nuclear project in the US in the past four decades. *That project is Votgle.*\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nIf you happened to be a young buck in the 70s working on nuclear, maybe you have some experience on another major project. Odds are you are retired now, and it’s a long distant memory at best.  For absolutely everyone else – you only experience of a major reactor build is Votgle.\n\nProject Votgle was a beauty of a project. And what did they use? Westinghouse. In the 80s Westinghouse PWRs. And as recently as 2023, Westinghouse AP1000s.\n\nEveryone in the country has the same single reference for a major successful nuclear build-out. And it was built on the AP1000s…You now have to build 5-10 nuclear plants of a single design asap.\n\nWhat are you going to pick?\n\nUnderstanding Vogtle makes it very clear while the DOE is so bullish on AP1000s in the report.\n\nNow onto BEPC...  \n\n\n**BEPC: THE WESTINGHOUSE STAKE**\n\nWestinghouse builds the AP1000s. And Westinghouse was bought out a few years ago by a consortium including BEPC. Hence BEPC is basically only one of two ways you can get exposure to Westinghouse. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/752veemapbwd1.png?width=1340&format=png&auto=webp&s=6bb8b0209a2eb693b873e9262b9975df933a881d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/adwnem3hpbwd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=99d40940a008486e0a3eff7aca09db83670019e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ruu2z75kpbwd1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbcfc93de40acb905f169b370058d5e542e23690\n\n\n\n**BEPC: THE MICROSOFT DEAL**\n\nYou may be familiar with CORZ, a bitcoin miner that has been running 300% on a deal for 200 MW of power. BEPC has a deal with MSFT for 50W. **That is 50x the power.** Let it sink in - \"largest ever corporate partnership\" and \"key enable of potentially one of the most significant technology innovations in history.\" This is not hyperbole. BEPC is a major player here.\n\n[https:\\/\\/bep.brookfield.com\\/sites\\/bep-brookfield-ir\\/files\\/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2\\/2024\\/brookfield-renewable-corporate-profile-may-2024.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/n6ib4ccopbwd1.png?width=1070&format=png&auto=webp&s=8810295447003dc26912325356b808ef7a53ea0f)\n\n\n\n**BEPC: VALUATION AND CHART**\n\nWhat else is it important to know? The company is trading with a PE of \\~17 and dividend of 4%. This seems shockingly cheap compared to nearly every other nuclear trade. Or an energy supplier of any kind with key partnerships to the big AI players.\n\nThe chart to me is pure poetry. \n\nMy read - BEPC has seen very little of the froth hitting nuclear or energy in the past month - but over the past week the market is starting to wake up.\n\nMore or less the same setup when I picked up LEU calls that 10x'd once it rapidly re-rated. In that case I saw something that was starting to inflect, did a deep dive, liked what I saw and figured it had plenty more to run, and levered the fuck up.\n\nI think this could happen here as well. And on 30% move - which every nuclear play seems obligated to make, though at different times - the contracts are going to outright print.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ib52jc15vbwd1.png?width=1395&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab8fbc11ff885279491b1d8dc02e3da8bd22ff9b\n\nIn sum, long af BEPC calls of various strikes and expiries.  \n",

Notice they modeled the costs of future builds with the AP1000s (and not any other design) because they are keen on building AP1000s.** \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2wm5bdsyfewd1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=d55da6ad8d95a0d380d91d581b21eedf6d05b8df\n\n  \nI get that you might not been keen on AP1000s, but the Dept of Energy folks seem to have a thing for them.",

In the UK.\n\nLarge reactors can use natural (unenriched) uranium and are easier to de-fuel, for Pu239 production. Now. The UK, US and France have too much weapons grade plutonium if anything, so large, difficult to decommission reactors are unnecessary. They're massive capital projects\n\nSMRs require enriched uranium, but they're just built in a factory, moved to site, then they're de-fuelled and buried when we're done with them. They're very similar to the submarine reactors that Rolls Royce and Westinghouse (Brookfield corp) have been making for 60 years. There are also a bunch of startups with high hopes but no engineering experience.\n\nMy bet is on Rolls Royce. Its a car company that diversified into jet engines and reactors:- (unlike Tesla, which is a car company trying to diversify into novelties and toys). I'm also invested in US-based Brookfield because its a great company - like an infrastructure-focussed Berkshire Hathaway. Both have been doing very well recently for their shareholders.\n\nSmall enriched uranium SMRs can't be used to make atom bombs, so they can be made on a production line and sold anywhere without nuclear proliferation concerns. But the 5-30% enriched fuel has to be purchased from the US, UK, France, China or Russia:- \"the nuclear gulf states\". Uranium isn't the critical bottleneck you all think it is. The value is added by gas centrifuging UF6. Only governments can do that.",

Looking at BEPC's [Q2 results](https://bep.brookfield.com/sites/bep-brookfield-ir/files/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/2024/Q2/q2-2024-bep-press-release-updated.pdf), nuclear/Westinghouse revenues are described to fall under the \"Distributed Energy & Storage\" line item, which was $61 million out of $830 million total 2024 revenue at the time of the report.  I wonder if anyone could shed some light on how much of an impact 5-10 AP1000 reactors would make to this line item?  I'm not sure how Westinghouse's revenue on reactors shakes out.  Do they simply sell the reactor and it's parts? Or do they also receive revenue from the construction labor in setting it up?\n\nEdit: Actually, I think I have that wrong. The [supplemental information ](https://bep.brookfield.com/sites/bep-brookfield-ir/files/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/2024/Q2/bep-q2-2024-supplemental.pdf)for Q2 results makes it more clear on page 12 that nuclear falls under \"Sustainable Solutions\". Which page 8 shows is only 5% of their FFO.  Either way, I'm at a loss for how to quantify the impact of 5-10 additional reactors to their financials and the share price.\n\nEdit 2: So I've learned in this article on the [Westinghouse fraud case ](https://www.powermag.com/former-westinghouse-executive-charged-with-conspiracy-fraud-in-connection-with-v-c-summer-nuclear-project/)(lol) that they were paid $600 million for construction work in 2016-17.. so if BEPC get's 51% of something in that ballpark for multiple units, yeah could be huge for the SP I'd imagine... I'm very interested.  Someone come and poke holes in this please.",

Do they own 51% or Westinghouse or does the consortium and how much revenue flows through to BEPC…even fund managers are getting confused looking into it\n\nBy now every regard with a pulse is convinced that the future nuclear reactor TAM is large and is loving the pretty Microsoft 10 GW slide chart, but we have no hardened data on unit economics / potential torque timing specific to BEPC by way of its (10%? 50%?) Westinghouse stake, which is important imo if we want to play value investor and talk about EV/EBITDA comparables etc. \n\nNuclear trade all about vibes/reflexivity and while this trade can certainly work, a confusing Brookfield family stonk seems like more of a heavy lift bc of complexity for less upside (vs clean setup like LEU or just riding current winners after they cool off). That said, BEPC low IV option chain + reduced potential downside volatility relative to other nuclear names up 100% on the month is attractive for risk management, for sure, but expectations should prob be moderated…Just gut reaction tho so here’s to hoping trade works out  🍻",

For BEPC, we have DOE wanting 5-10 order-book by 2025, which is great but that’s not a lot to go off of. Especially in options trading being early = being wrong, and the setup of BEPC up 15% last 5 sessions and now essentially just waiting for some undefined announcement sometime next year at earliest not compelling to point of wanting to lever up today.  Would personally rather buy in once announcement hits the tape and/or we get more concrete updates wrt SMRs vs larger reactors.

Is the gov really going to start building dozens of SMRs at once - before a single one is up and running and established with a proven performance and safety record?

The government hasn't exactly been spearheading the development of AI, I wouldn't be one bit surprised if the private sector figures out how to get the capacity needed quicker. Also AGI is probably more than two decades away, and it requires ingenuity and creativity just as much as it requires raw power, so megawatt count isn't deciding the winner.

          "body": "Right. They do not use large reactors in submarines.\n\nFor some applications the primary consideration is size. For stuff that needs sub 30-300 mw SMRs are useful.\n\nHowever, large reactors clock in 30% cheaper per unit of energy produced than SMRs. That is a huge difference. So for anything that does not specifically need a dedicated power source of sub 300 mw (i.e. 5GW data centers, anything on the grid - i.e. majority of energy demand) then large reactors are the way to go.\n\n  \nThe actual AI companies are stating massive power is needed. I am not just making a conjecture. Last month Altman stated OpenAI wants to build 5-7 data centers of 5 GW power each. That would take roughly 35 large power reactors. And they are just talking about what OpenAI wants.\n\n[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/openai-asked-us-to-approve-energy-guzzling-5gw-data-centers-report-says/)\n\nMicrosoft just struck a deal to re-open a nuclear plant in NY as well.",
