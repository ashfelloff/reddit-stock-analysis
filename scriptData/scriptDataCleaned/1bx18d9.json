It have to be nearly as close as reflectors either, especially on straight parts.  \n\nMaybe there is reflector or electronic indicator that could be put on the sides of the roads.  If the vendors would get together and design a road and vehicle system, they could all build to that system.  Making it safer and more reliable in adverse weather conditions.
