  "selftext": " COST $905 Long Call Calendar Spread: Either I’m Crazy or Vacationing in Bora Bora This Winter\n\nI either truly belong on this sub, or I’ll be sipping cocktails in Bora Bora after this trade. Everyone said not to touch Costco’s earnings because “they just can’t exceed expectations.” So, I thought, why not play with that sentiment?\n\nThe Play:\n\nSell: 9/27 $905 Call (for those who think Costco will blow up after earnings)\n\nBuy: 1/17/25 $905 Call (because Costco is a solid long-term hold)\n\n\nMy Thinking:\n\nI predict Costco will end this week only up around 3% from the current price. I’m not expecting a huge earnings surprise, so I’m selling the short-term call to pocket some premium.\n\nBut long-term, I believe Costco will continue to grow, which is why I’m holding the January 2025 call.\n\n\nIf they hit those earnings, I might be in trouble short term, but long term, I think it’s a solid bet.\n\nThoughts? Am I crazy for doing this?",
