No one cared that Xiaomi or whoever the fuck had it first.\n\nSame thing happened with the X and same thing will happen to foldable phones and whatever techno-forward invention some other loser company comes out with. Matter of fact, Apple users don’t know jack shit about the new tech but once Apple releases it, all of a sudden they’re all experts.",
