So I might have a buy on a stock but not because of management's narrative, or have a negative view of an industry which was widely hyped, and so on.\n\nMy last recommendation was a company whose IPO we missed out on. This meant I could publish first which I did with a sell, because it was abundantly obvious their market would saturate within 18 months and sales would begin dropping (they sold long lived products into a market with more or less fixed government funding so this wasn't exactly rocket surgery). This caused outrage at my firm and ultimately was the last straw. About 5 quarters later the company pre-announced low sales and a couple years after that it was sold for less than 10% of the IPO price.\n\nFunny thing was, when I got the boot I wasn't just the analyst with the best stock picking record at the firm, I had the best stock picking record of any analyst they had ever employed. \n\nBut that is not a very high bar - there is a reason bank do not publish the stock picking track record of their analysts.",

For transparency, I am NOT a TSLA holder (it doesn't fit in my investment strategy), but I am a Telsa owner (Model Y Premium).\n\n1. Tesla EPS for the twelve months ending June 30, 2024 was $3.55, a 0.57% increase year-over-year. Not quite the death spiral that comments would suggest.\n\n2. The automotive industry as a whole has taken a major hit because of inflation. People just don't have new car money right now and there is still a lot of good value to be found on the used car market. Ford had a very bad quarter as well.\n\n3. If TSLA gets their self-driving software working the way it's supposed to, their stock will print, and so will their revenues. They will compete with Uber with a fleet of electric robo-taxi's  \n\n4. Every car manufacturer wants to use Tesla's charging infrastructure,  and as the other manufactures ramp up, Tesla will be their supplier of electricity.\n\n5. Optimus will be a significant achievement,  and another money printing discovery for Tesla once they go into production. Although personally,  I believe the official timeline is a bit exaggerated. \n\n6. EV Sales are up overall. Tesla's marketshare has eroded, but so has McDonalds, and no one here is predicting their demise. It's possible to shed marketshare and still continue to sell more of your product year after year. That market is still expanding rapidly and will be for decades.\n\nIn summary, Tesla is still a very dynamic company with many poles in the water. I would say they are probably better positioned than Apple (a company that seems to be out of ideas). I wouldn't count them out yet, the stock will continue to profit as long as their projects remain viable and serious traders see the long play on it.",

      "body": "EDIT: TLDR Elon is a red herring. Be Objective. Focus on the numbers, the product lines, and the business model. \n\nFirst, let’s start by stating the obvious — facts don’t care about your feelings. If you’re an Elon hater, you have no business commenting here and frankly no business investing. You need to have IQ and EQ to be a great investor. If you can’t leave your feelings out of the equation, you’ll never be a great investor. \n\nSecond, the “true” value of Tesla based on the numbers pegs it somewhere closer to $100 or so. BUT there are 2 factors that “skew” the value because they are very real but hard to quantify. (A) the value of teslas pipeline (AI, charging networks, solar, autonomous robots, and a very deep bench of IP) and (B) teslas business plan (some people wrongly say “Elon” — what they really mean is Tesla’s business plan). To date, Tesla has managed to execute on that plan in what can only be described as remarkable. That “execution value” is worth something. It’s worth a lot in a world of talkers — many of whom like to come on here and cry to distract from their own failings in life. Elon and the teams he builds are amongst the most brilliant, strategic, and ambitious minds on this planet — objectively (name another company that ramped up production as fast as Tesla did with the model 3). \n\nThe leaders/strategists here know that his overly ambitious timelines are intentional. He’s not “lying”. he’s intentionally setting unreasonable deadlines to force change faster (e.g., shoot for the stars to land on the moon logic). The fact that most people don’t see that proves the Wall Street thesis that Alpha comes from arbitraging the difference between what Main Street thinks should be, versus that which actually is. And most of the time, what Main Street thinks is based on feelings, not facts. Feelings have an odd way of distorting reality. We see it in politics, in celebrity, influencers use it to drive growth (Mr. Beast for example has mastered the art of manipulating/playing into people’s feelings and is now very wealthy as a result). In a world of democratized investing, now more than ever we are seeing retail move markets based on feelings — e.g. GameStop (so yes, sometimes feelings win, but it’s the exception). Generally that delta, between what “should” be versus what is… that’s how Wall Street generates alpha and “beats” beta. Remove your feelings toward Elon. Look at the company objectively. Look at the robotics. The design patents. The engineering patents. The charging networks. The solar technology. Past execution. Operational efficiency https://www.bocconitrading.net/post/tesla-s-operational-efficiency-analysis, etc…\n\nYou need to look at the micro and macro. Objectively folks. Take Elon out of the equation (I’ll briefly say that his image does have an impact. Obviously. But image is easy to fix. Hire a good PR firm. Zuck did it. Bezos did it. A new villain will come along - just wait until y’all learn about Palmer luckey 😂😅).",

A 40% downside risk with a price target of $135 is significant, especially given the company's recent developments and the general market sentiment around EVs.\n\nFor those holding or considering investing in Tesla, it's worth looking at different perspectives and data points. While analyst opinions can provide insights, it's also important to consider broader market trends and personal investment goals. Tesla has always been a volatile stock, and reactions to quarterly reports can sometimes be overblown.\n\nIf you're interested in gauging the general sentiment is among Tesla holders, tools like [Upside](https://www.upsideinvest.io/TSLA) can provide a snapshot of investor activity and average entry prices, which for TSLA is $89.
