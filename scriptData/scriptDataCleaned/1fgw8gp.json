  "title": "Why Is the S&P 500 so Bullish?",
  "score": 29,
  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nI've been closely following the current economic indicators and I'm puzzled by the S&P 500 reaching new all-time highs. I broke up my logic into individual points:\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Inflation Forecasts indicate that inflation remains stubbornly high. High inflation typically reduces consumer purchasing power and can squeeze corporate profit margins, which university theory says that these should pressure stock prices downward. Is this no longer the case?\n\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve has as we all know raised interest rates to combat inflation the past year or so. Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs for both consumers and businesses, which slow economic growth and make equities less attractive compared to fixed-income investments. Now this often isn't reflected in financial statements right away, it takes time for the effects of interest rates to effect the bottomline. You don't really notice until you start paying the cumulative interest.\n\n\n\n\nWall Street has been saying there's a 50% chance of a 0.5 rate cut pricing it into the market if the Fed decides to pause or reverse its tightening measures. If the Fed doesn’t act as expected, this uncertainty could lead to a tremendous oopsie daisy that no one seems to be talking about. When has the Fed acted in the interest of the equities market? They work for the government.\n\n\n\n\nYouth unemployment rates ain't looking so good and there's a rising sense of generational hopelessness present in pop culture and everyday narratives.High youth unemployment can lead to reduced consumer spending which is pretty surface level, but on a large scale, doesn't this also lead to a reduced savings rate, less investments and therefore less money flowing into companies who need to maintain a large price\n\n\n\nNow obviously these are a few off the top of my head examples pointing to the negative so I'm asking you to offer a counter-argument.\n\n\nWhy do YOU believe the S&P 500 is continuing to climb to new heights?\n\nAre strong corporate earnings or future growth expectations counterbalancing these negative factors?\n\nAre there international developments or global market trends supporting the S&P 500's rise?\n\nIs the anticipation of future rate cuts fueling buying behavior now?\n\nDisclaimer: This is not financial advice. Please do your own research before making any investment decisions. Stonkz only go up",

That gamma causes the V’s we see nearly every day as opex gets closer every month. The charm on expiration days further influences the massive moves up once the low end is tapped on given days. Since tech is still a decent buy with strong earnings, it’s easy to drive them up when needed to find the top end of the oi on those trades. Add that with forced 401k index buying to create a market that can never go under the artificial floor created by the options trades. If it does fall below, MM’s are forced to hedge as more call buying comes in to prop. Last week NVDA was the ticker used to prop. At around 7% of the S&P, all that is needed is strong call buying on that one ticker, followed by fomo from retail, to move the market back up where they want it. Personally, I think after the election and the start of the lowering cycle (likely into 2025), this method will stop working and we will see a steady decline as these trades unwind along with various carry trades in futures (JPY, GC,CL, etc).",

If there is another pull back that's normal. There has been rotation for several months now from Mag 7 to the other 473 in anticipation of the rate cuts. The Mag 7 have tons of cash they don't borrow while the small caps need to borrow so will be more profitable with lower rates. But right now no one knows if we will dip into recession or not. If not stocks climb, if we do then could be another correction. SP500 is for long term investors. Most people just deposit X amount of their pay check every month into it and over time it returns about 10%. If you try to time it odds are against you.

I still think people should stay invested.\n\nBullish long-term for all of the reasons other users have listed below. That said, just because the US has a great  economic foundation, abundant natural resources, profitable and innovative corporations, and strong growth doesn't mean that the US stock market is immune to temporary downturns and contractions. We had them in 2022, 2018, and 2015 (and yes, the GFC). It happens.\n\nWhy would one be bearish short-term? The S&P 500's Shiller P/E ratio is the third highest it's been in history at 36.27. We went up fast and high since since last Fall - we can't go up forever without positive macroeconomic *and* earnings data to support such astronomical growth.\n\nAs you know, the Federal Reserve has been trying to control inflation and, thus far, has been pretty successful. That said, there is evidence that the labor market is weakening and that growth is stalling (companies are revising down their 2025 forecasts). Bringing down inflation without stifling economic growth and employment is extremely hard, hence why many have doubts about a soft landing.\n\nDoes a \"hard landing\" mean an apocalypse and the end of the US as the world's economic superpower? NO! It means contraction and increased unemployment, which we would eventually break out of and, in all likelihood, emerge from stronger.\n\nAll of this is cyclical, hence the concept of \"[the business cycle](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/businesscycle.asp)\". There's a saying about economic expansions, which is where economic growth is strongest: \"expansions never die of old age.\"\n\nAnyways, just stay invested. Even if you lump-summed 100K into SPY in 2007 ~~2008~~, right before the GFC, then never added a penny, you'd be up over 400K and at $554,691 ~~$529,164~~ for an average of a 10.13% annual return.\n\nEDIT: Forgot that the GFC crash was in 2007, not 2008.",
