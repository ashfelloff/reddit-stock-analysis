          "body": "I’d get out on this position whenever possible. Conor fight looking more and more unlikely by the day. First it was Conor partying 2 weekends in a row only being 5 weeks out, then the press conference being postponed,  a rumor of a minor injury to Conor, now you can no longer preorder UFC303 on ESPN+, as well as the UFC YouTube channel making the free Conor fights they just posted private. Radio silence from Dana and Conor. If this falls through it could be the biggest PPV flop of all time, worse than UFC200. I wanted to get in on this bet with you, but it’s just too risky betting on a fighter to make it out of training camp healthy(especially Conor with his antics). \n\nI hope I am wrong about all of this, Conor wins and it’s a top 5 PPV seller of all time, but things look shaky to be betting solely on Conor here.",

I feel this was enabled again to try to get as many “early bird” buys as possible before Conor pulls out so it doesn’t have the worst PPV numbers of the year(which will easily happen looking at the talent on the rest of the card). I think they are trying to act like Conor is fighting as long as they can to sell these “early bird” PPVs. The last time they did the early bird special was UFC 297, and go look at how shitty of talent they had on that card(UFC 303 talent is worse if you exclude Conor)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/quie3dhind6d1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b406dc5e32a32089dcd30fd8dfadc5ab0199b762",

I've been eyeing tko from the sideline since Feb/March, volumes were low on options at the time so I ultimately didn't dive in even though I was very bullish on it (should have bought stocks...)\n\nBut now at 106? I don't think there's much room. Could be wrong, of course. Good luck! What's your plan? Stocks or options?",
