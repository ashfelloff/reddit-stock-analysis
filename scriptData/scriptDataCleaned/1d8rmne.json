I'm at 3% until fall 2026 so I think the rates should be less crazy then.  Still, I'm a bit surprised that 5% is enough to send everyone in a tailspin, historically 5% doesn't seem that high.  I was really more afraid of being stuck renewing at 7%+.  Although the issue probably mostly affects new home buyers who bought their homes for double what I paid.",

We never needed it, there is no real market, and now we are drowning in the debt of it and our electricity bills will likely double over the next few years to pay it off.\n\nMeanwhile, the new government just signed a $65 Million dollar deal to get 500 new units of affordable housing, which means the going rate to construct affordable housing initiatives is about $130K, thanks to economy of scale and building what is necessary rather than oversized detached suburb lots.\n\nWhat that means is that for the public cost of a massive concrete dam we don't need and is just bleeding us... we could have instead built 100,000 affordable housing units. We have a population of ~500,000 and there are ~265,000 homes in NL right now.... and so 100,000 housing units could have rehomed every single renter in the entire province and could have increased the housing supply by 1/3rd. Rent paid in then would have repaid the initial public debt instead of our current situation where all of us will be paying for something we never needed, or the units could have been sold at cost and we would have quickly broken even on public expenditure...which would still have been $13 Billion better off than we are now.",
