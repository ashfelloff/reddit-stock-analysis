What is a realistic operating margin for ASTS once satellites are up and online.\n\n30% 40%?\n\nJust trying to do some valuation calculations and I’d rather not have to fully learn the business to do that. \n\nThanks in advance.\n\nI do assume they’d be printing money once there up and running aside from advertising \n\nBut assuming 1b revenue by 2028 and 30% margins that’s a p/e of 28. If they continue growing revenue to 2-3b eventually then they’re a good buy, but if they can run a 40-50% margin once established that would change things.",
