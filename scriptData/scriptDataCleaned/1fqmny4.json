Hiring rate has been decreasing over the last 12 months. If there's no lay off but less and less hiring, unemployment rate can easily go up, and payroll can still go down. How much longer can that go before employers are forced to resort to lay off, because they're running out of cost cutting measures?

America wasn't the only country that provided stimulus. And yet America is the one with the highest inflation problem, while not even being dependent on Russian oil prices like Europe is. \n\nSo let's go with your theory and assume it was all due to Russian war and supply chain. Then in theory the fed could've done nothing and inflation would have gone down on its own?",

I'm not saying that the home you live in shouldn't be able to appreciate like an investment (I wouldn't even know how to do this), I'm saying that there should be heavy financial disincentives against people owning houses that they don't live in, that they solely own for financial reasons. I would allow everyone to own 3 houses, and after that tax the fuck out of them so that it makes no fiscal sense to own more than that.\n\nBut if this leads to fewer people wanting to buy houses, that would be a *good thing* as it would drive down the cost of homes. \n\nAlso, you'd still be incentivized to buy because of the magic of locking in a price. I bought my house in 2009, and 15 years later I have a 2009 mortgage payment in 2024. Anyone renting right now would kill for my house at 2009 prices.",

              "body": "Because the Fed can only do monetary policy, they can't do anything about the unevenness of the price changes, such as the goods industry being in deflation and housing industry is still in running inflation. The Fed should ask that the government use fiscal policy to do something about the housing shortage, so they can cut rates to help the goods industries.\n\nBut they probably know that the government doesn't want the price of housing to stop going up. Both liberals and conservatives want housing prices to keep going up. Don't listen to what they say, only look at the results of what they do.\n\nIf the Federal and state government wanted to do something to make housing affordable, they could enact these four changes to the housing policy:\n\n* Enact incentives for home builders so they can intentionally overbuild even when prices are in decline.\n* Enact incentives for home buyers so then can move to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable.\n* Enact incentives for employers to locate jobs to where housing is affordable, safe and insurable.\n* Enact new taxes to punish employers who don't pay their workers enough to live near where they work.\n\nIf all four of these changes were made in the housing policy, cities who have codes that prevent home construction would notice that employers and home buyers are leaving the area to buy better affordable housing. Simply if they fail to do new home construction, people would leave in search of affordable housing instead of trying to out compete the rich people and investors and corporations. Also if codes are so lax that new houses are not insurable, not energy efficient, built in unsafe areas or built as sprawl in the middle of nowhere, the builder wouldn't want to build because they won't make money if houses won't sell. Cities that let builders build good quality safe and affordable housing would have a lot of growth and prosperity. The nimby cities would get left behind and experience population decline and despair.",
