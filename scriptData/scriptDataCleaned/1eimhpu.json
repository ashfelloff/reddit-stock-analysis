Especially right now, on the verge of another bear market. Of course it‚Äôll go up over many years and prob forever, but right now retail is piled into nvidia as they have been for awhile. Everyone trusts it. The one safe haven. To risky to short, yet to trustworthy to buy. You don‚Äôt think mms know that? This is a business nvidia can be manipulated dosent matter how good it is. market has to correct this year at some point, and the one thing holding it up has to take a hit to do it. Imo the big boys will use any excuse to bring it down. Us competition probes, chip restrictions to China/russia, beginning of a recession, AI morality lawsuits. You name it. Give it one excuse not to be ‚Äúperfect‚Äù or more at earnings time and she‚Äôs falling. The trend just changed this week.",
