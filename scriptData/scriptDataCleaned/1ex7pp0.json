I think bdsm used to be the king of taboos but in the past couple decades it's become pretty mainstream (idk what word to use here) and, at least in western cultures, it's quite rare to run into someone who hasn't tried it or at least hasn't heard of it. I think the next place people have gravitated towards then is incest. Incest porn seems pretty huge in hentai, but I think in porn no one wants to straight up do something like that. The concept of step siblings gives a more \"guilt free\" approach to incest.",

And clearly their parent is dating your parent, you're living under the same roof, there's going to be a lot of situations where you are in close proximity one way or the other.\n\nWhile it's controversial to *say*, the fact is since men and women can't *just be friends*. This means that two non-related people always being in such a living setup would logically lead to *something* assuming they got along reasonably well.\n\nThus where the fantasy comes from. Reality is obviously different. But understanding the fetish is extremely easy given a little bit of examination.",
