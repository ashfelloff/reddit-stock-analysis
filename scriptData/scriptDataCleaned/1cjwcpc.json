I am looking ahead, and if they do it right, with the restructuring going on and the major investment into bringing chip manufacturing back in US soil, long term, Intel will rise. My average is $40, will average down as I can. I think Intel will rise to $100 plus a share.\n\nAlso, I am a embedded software engineer, and anything governmental, they don’t want chips that are manufactured outside US for defense contracts (what I heard), only ST microelectronics provides micro controllers that are US based. Guess what? Intel is bringing that back home as well, meaning that Intel can be a processor used on anything IT wise for defense projects.\n\nAlso I believe they are trying to do something with their wafer technology and bring manufacturing home as well.\nI may be wrong, but I think Intel if it plays this restructuring right, and uses those government grants properly, will be on top again, after all, they have solid technology on processors for desktop and servers for over a decade.\n\nWhat’s your take on this?",

Maintaining a certain amount of semiconductor self sufficiency is always prudent for any great modern day industrial power, but not to the extent of the hysteria we are seeing today. Every microchip that ends up in the military industrial complex is just another expensive toy that ultimately goes boom.  \n\nThe way I see it, the world cannot economically sustain too many players in the supply chain. At some point all this capacity building is gonna implode once the grant money runs out. If the world is focused on building more ploughshares than swords, then there's nothing wrong with maintaining semiconductor co-dependencies with other countries, even potential economic rivals.

China is hostile, every single thing they do, they trying to destroy US and EU, they have history of inserting spy software and back doors into their computers products. Huawei was a good example, good phones, good prices point, but unfortunately loaded with software that was meant to report back to mother China..\nThey are doing so with network equipments, including 5G cellular network equipment. This has been allowed for way too long. I totally agree with any measures US/EU will take to address this issues, we need to decouple from Asia, or find a way to remove this issue where America or European corporations can make a lot of money from taking advantage of cheap labor and non existent environmental regulations in Asia. Let’s start to make the battle field even and remove this advantages, so that other nations can actually create good paying jobs for their populations.\n\nAlso bringing back this jobs in US will be good for our economy, after all, if we are bringing people to poverty, who the hell will spend the money to keep the economy rolling?\n\nRight now, I see the wealth concentrated in the hands of few people, while the rest of us is starving or forced to live on the line of poverty, stock working jobs that pay barely enough to pay rent or a mortgage.\n\nThings need to change, and by doing someone to force our companies to bring on shore manufacturing is a good step in my opinion for our own future. And we can stop founding hostile economies like China, Russia etc…. from exploiting this greed for maximizing profits that American corporations seem to be obsessed with.\n\nBack to Intel, yes, decoupling from Asia is a smart move, especially when our government is finally taking the necessary measures to secure our critical infrastructure, starting from our defense systems, there is no space for Chinese chips that may hide flows that will allow the Chinese communist regime to infiltrate and potentially take over our infrastructure in case of a war.\n\nBusiness wise, government contracts can be way more profitable than consumer grade electronics products.\nIf I was in any position at Intel to make decisions, I would heavily invest into military grade chips, including microcontrollers aimed for embedded systems that run both, bare metal real time applications, or Linux distros aimed for real time applications that rely on secure TCP networks connection, and have these chips designed and produced in USA, the company can grow and become very profitable.

For something to work on a variety of hardware, either translation systems need to be made for the different hardware standards, or the hardware manufacturers need to adopt a standard industry wide.  Nvidia won't do that unless they're about to be overtaken anyway.\n\nIt's also complicated by the fact that hardware manufacturers are now optimizing for things like transformers, building algorithm specific circuitry and interfaces to control it.  As we discover new ML algorithms they'll likely continue that pattern.  Those manufacturers are going to be pretty reluctant to adopt open standards, and if the standard isn't evolving at pace with the technology anyway, they simply can't adopt them.",
