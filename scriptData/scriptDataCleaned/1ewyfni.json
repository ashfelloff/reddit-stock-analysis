No one had really landed on the moon and successfully transmitted data back to ground station in ages, with Japan coming closest. \n\nIt was revealed they had successfully landed and were slowly transmitting data, there was a small sell off - and the following day the CEO met with the press to say their vehicle had landed on its side with only a few days of weak data transmission until it shits the bed. The stock went from $10 down to $3 in the months following that",

It is funny that you don't mention the reason the lander came down sideways - some regard, who most likely is fired from the company and the country - forgot to engage a switch that was intended to fire up the landing sequence. A damn switch - physical one, that a human operates. \n\nI guess they have worked out the problem regarding turning on a switch.",
