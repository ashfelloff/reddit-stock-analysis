Something they can pop open on their 10\" tablet screen or 13\" laptop screen, and have some light and noise to make their 1br apartments feel less empty. Some reality show junk or an anime season can get that job done for under $5M production costs. \n\nAnd on the high end, the streaming business model just does not pay back $250M film budgets. The only way to break even on those is theatrical releases. And in a time where Americans are cutting back on Dollar General, people aren't willing to venture to the cinema and plunk down $20/ticket for much short of a franchise tentpole release.\n\nThere's just not a big audience for the mid budget stuff any more. Not enough to justify those mid budgets. \n\nThe next victim after those will be prestige streaming TV shows costing $150M+. You just don't earn that money back with extra subscriptions. Apple spent $250M on Foundation to have 1M people watch it, FFS. That's not a business model that you can keep going.",
