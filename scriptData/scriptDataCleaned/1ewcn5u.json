Decided to go Deep ITM and took 100k plus an additional 23k (123k) and turned it into this. Recently added 19k in cash and turned it into 31k trading weeklies on SPY and NVDA. \n\nCurrent position: [https://gyazo.com/899597dceb0d887b3f450d526b07056c](https://gyazo.com/899597dceb0d887b3f450d526b07056c) \n\nBought 3 contracts of these back in April 2024 but after the split they converted to 30 contracts. \n\nShould i convert to shares or just continue holding the LEAPS?",
