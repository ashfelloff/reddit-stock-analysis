  "selftext": "For context, I’m relatively new to the stock market. Ubisoft (UBSFY) has been trending downwards for quite some time now, with stocks at an all-time low in the last few months. What are your opinions on their likelihood to bounce back/be bought out by another company, and if they ARE bought out do you think their stock price would increase significantly? Regardless, I think I’m going to purchase some stock because it’s incredibly cheap as of right now and I’m willing to risk a small amount of money in the interest of long term returns. Just wanted some opinions of people who have been doing this for longer and are more knowledgeable 😁 thanks in advance. ",

This has gone viral on various social media platforms and is also the cause of delaying the release of this game.\n\nAnother negative point is that Ubisoft is going down the road of milking gamers with micro transaction, which is also causing major backlash.\n\nAs long as this social/political issue is not resolve, I would not touch this stock.",

Then again, I actually play video games and over the recent years, Ubisoft games have pretty much been off the radar for me. Unlike a dozen years ago, when they churned out formulaic bangers every year.\n\nFar Cry used to be a must buy for FPS players. I was huge into Tom Clancy stuff -- the man died, but the IPs are not dead? Where are the old style tactical Splinter Cell, Ghost Recon, and Rainbow Six games? And, pardon my French: Why is Assassin's Creed shit since after Origins? It's not like Ubisoft is lacking IPs they could build into anything they want. The problem is that they (=the management and creative directors) want to build the wrong thing. They are consistently building the wrong thing, and they are pissing off their most consistent customers by chasing a dead dreams of live services and excessive monetization schemes.\n\nThe market is saturated with that stuff. Meanwhile, people like me who used to play Ubisoft games for most of their lives, I would gladly buy a couple of games from them every year, but I am no longer the target audience. I don't do live services, I have a life -- I am in my thirties, have a wife and everything. Time is most precious to me now. I could buy all their games every year, that's not the problem. The problem is that their games are no longer fun, and when they're live services, they're intentionally made so they are wasting my time. Thanks, but no thanks.\n\nWith that in mind, I have a hard time justifying even gambling on this. Heads must roll first.",

They tend to chase gaming trends and that paid off massively (pun intended) in the last gen with open world adventure games.
