It takes clarity of mind to see it objectively, and there's a reason the whole space is full of hyperactive personalities telling you things like \"it's a revolution\" etc... But the fact is this \"tech\" sucks and hasn't done anything meaningful in 15 years. Crazy amounts of energy usage for.... 6-7 transactions per second with a 10 minute confirmation latency is, objectively, hot garbage.\n\nThere's a reason people don't advocate you actually buy your own crypto, but rather, leverage centralized systems like tether or Gemini: cuz Blockchain can't actually do what it was set out to do, which was to be true digital cash. Once the actual technologists starting it (cypherpunks) realized it was failing, a bunch of grifters stepped in to constantly refit the narrative, move the goal posts, and gaslight you into thinking you're \"stupid\" if you don't \"understand\" it.\n\nI felt sick about the money I earned and donated just about all of it by now. \n\nI highly recommend you check this out:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ORdWE_ffirg?si=wOG_1-EHb1JEctWd",

There’s not really a good reason to be replacing the dollar. \n\nThat being said, Bitcoin is supposed to be like buying gold. It’s a store of value that’s non-inflationary. That’s why there’s only a finite amount of it, and that’s why the transaction speeds are slow. It’s not meant to be spent day to day on nickel and dime shit.\n\nSecondly, there are more eco-friendly crypto projects with much lower fees that are meant to be spent like regular currency. These currencies are crap because there’s not really any benefit to them over national currencies. They’re not backed by anything and have no purchasing power. But if for some reason tomorrow everybody decided it would be easier to be their own bank and every business accepted x crypto the world would keep spinning. \n\nIMO, the grifting comes in when you realize that lots of these currencies are beholden to their creators. They can change the rules of their currency at will, and sometimes grant themselves huge stacks of money right off the bat (that’s how rug pulls happen, as you probably know). \n\nThe idea of decentralized currency only works if everybody’s not an idiot, and unfortunately we live in a world of idiots. People don’t want to live in a world where grandma gets scammed and the banks can’t reverse the transaction. \n\nThere’s a hundred valid reasons crypto is shit, saying it’s because it takes bitcoin 10 minutes to validate a transaction is missing the point I think",
