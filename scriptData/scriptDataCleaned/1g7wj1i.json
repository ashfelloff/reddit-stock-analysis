  "title": "NexGen Energy (NXE) The Next Uranium Giant?",
  "score": 41,
  "selftext": "Hey r/wallstreetbets,\n\nLet's talk about NexGen Energy (NXE), a uranium play that's been catching my eye. This Canadian company is developing the Rook I project, potentially one of the largest uranium deposits globally.\n\nQuick facts:\n\n- Production expected in 2028\n\n- $CADÂ 2 billion annual free cash flow projected\n\n- Stock trading around $CAD 11.5\n\n- Analysts' price targets: $CADÂ 13.13 average, $CADÂ 21.00 high\n\nWhat do you think? Is uranium a big thing with the clean energy push? Are we comfortable investing in nuclear energy? Could NXE be a major player in the commodities sector? Is it already to late to invest?\n\nLet's hear your thoughts on NXE and the uranium market. Is this a gem or just another risky bet?\n\n  \n[https://www.nexgenenergy.ca/homepage/](https://www.nexgenenergy.ca/homepage/)\n\n[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/NXE/forecast/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/TSE/NXE/forecast/)\n\n[https://www.nexgenenergy.ca/rook-1-project/](https://www.nexgenenergy.ca/rook-1-project/)",

In previous high season in the uranium sector that discount to NAV was <15%. We are now in the first month of the new high season.\n\nIn the meantime Nexgen Energy (NXE) is a large cap where most investors go to when they hear about the uranium sector. NXE share price will increase together with the other uranium company stocks.\n\nBy consequence: Mega uranium acts as a turbo on Nexgen Energy.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",
