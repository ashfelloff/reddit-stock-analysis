My daughter's custodial account is another 600 shares of PLTR with an average of like $7. I bought more shares through 2022 and 2023 and sold CC's and CSPs on the ticker for the entire time. Most of the premium that I get from selling CC's (maybe 50k? total) has gone into selling CSPs. I used to track my average in terms of what I bought via premium, but I stopped tracking so actively during 2022. Now I just sell calls on pops (thanks for buying my 35C's all month, btw)",

              "body": "I've actually been researching them in an obsessive manner since October of 2020. My first buy was shortly after the DPO at $18, and I began selling CC's on it in the mid 20s. During the explosive move from 28 to 35 one day, my shares were called and I experienced extreme FOMO. This was very bad long term as it led to me buying back in mid 20s and then riding it down for 2 straight years. I probably had buys at 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 25, 20, 16, 14, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 dollars. \n\nDuring this time though I continued to research and found that while the stock was headed to single digits, the business was improving its metrics and its execution on every count. I put some extra money aside for my daughter, then 1 year old, and made a custodial account and bought her hundreds of shares at like $6.99.\n\nI have 11,000 in my main account at $16 but only after 4 straight years of buys from high 20s to below 10.\n\nThat said, I used the shares to generate premiums for a lot of that period, which I then used to buy more shares, so the cost basis math gets very muddy. I no longer have a good grasp on it.\n\nTL;DR I've been hooked on the palantir kool-aid for 4 years now. I thought they were good in 2021 and I thought they were even better in 2023. 2024 has basically just been playing out what I suspected.",

Yes, you immediately get the premium for rolling it out to a future date, but it's not so cut and dry as to whether or not that is a more profitable strategy than just letting the calls get assigned and then wheeling back into selling CSPs in order to buy back into the stock.\n\nObviously for this guy, it looks like rolling them out has worked well and I was just curious as to what that strategy has looked like for him. In case you are unaware, this is a form of learning rather than just rudimentary googling.\n\nYou could have said something helpful, but instead you wrote that?

Then in 2022 he gave a bunch of money to JD Vance, I assume hoping to make something of a 2024 run, but later announced he wasn't publicly backing anyone anymore and also wasn't funding any more candidates. I think personally he still wants a Republican to win for his own interests, but is done publicly getting his other ventures into hot water because of it and wants to stay out of the spotlight.",

Foundry completely changes what we think of as needing in an ERP sense, and I'm a big believer in their idea of the ontology or how they describe laying out your entire business to make better decisions about how to run it. Their commercial side of the business is now half of their revenue, and growing at a steadier clip. I'm expecting that we see a reacceleration of b2b sales over the next year, widespread adoption of AIP, and more AIPCons where huge customers are telling each other about how important the product is and how much money it's saving them. After that, I expect Foundry (and then Apollo) to start becoming very mainstream product names.",
