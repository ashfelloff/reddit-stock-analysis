  "selftext": "I work in the semiconductor industry and after listening to an intern discuss the design of Nvidia chips and the critical role of memory, where 80% of the transistors in the H200 and likely even more in Blackwell are dedicated to memory—I decided to delve deeper into companies that specialize in memory.\n\nWhy Micron?\n\n\t•\tMicron is just coming out of a cyclical bottom, which is typical for the industry.\n\t•\tThey recently raised their guidance from $5.8 billion to $6.6 billion, showing confidence in market demand.\n\t•\tThey specialize in energy consumption, with their flagship chips needing 30% less energy than competitors’ products.\n\t•\tAs a local supplier from the US, they stand out compared to the other two big players, SK Hynix and Samsung, which are located in Korea.\n\t•Supplier for leather Jacket\n\nTL;DR Micron will moon on 26/06 after earnings. Position: 160c 19/07\n\n-no financial advice-\n\nEdit: Made a mistake yesterday, calls expiring 19/07",

I think I would have tripled, and we're still a couple of weeks out of earnings!\n\nHonestly though, at 140$ now it's starting to get dicey.

Sounds to me more like they plan to keep it low so they can beat in Q4 rather than anything concerning but wall street seems to have been looking for them to raise and instead they went with sort of a motto of beat in Q3 & raise in Q4 approach. At least that’s my understanding. Idk 🤷\n\nI’m holding a call and still trying to figure out if everyone else thinks this is as concerning as after market made it look bc it really doesn’t sound bad at all to me but 🤷. I mean they beat on EPS and beat on revenue. Idr see the problem aside from that it might have been a bit overextended going into earnings according to some people",
