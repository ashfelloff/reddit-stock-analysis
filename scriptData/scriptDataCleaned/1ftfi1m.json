      "body": "Unions suck. Nobody does anything. I hate the way union reps talk. Always fighting something. So many people are paid to do nothing. But we need the threat of unions to keep corporations in line. So I tolerate them.\n\nBut for real a company can't be competitive if it's unionized. You just can't. Only way is to force everyone to be unionized so it's an even playing field. But then companies just go overseas. Can't be done. Unless it's something you can't send overseas.",
