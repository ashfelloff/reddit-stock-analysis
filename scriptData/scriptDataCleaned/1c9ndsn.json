Netflix even passed Disney in the number of subscribers over the past year. \n\nNetflix still has to report revenue and operating margins and said they will announce numbers when new milestones are reached. Probably 300 million subscribers. Which in my opinion will be sooner than expected. \n\nNetflix is making better quality content and has teamed up with Tom Brady, WWE (Raw) and countless new seasons of many different shows. \n\nThis post said the recession ended Friday is unlikely based on so many factors-to many to list, but I think by August, September you will see Netflix head back to $650-$675 and you will wish you scooped up some during this giant dip. \n\nGood luck regards!",
