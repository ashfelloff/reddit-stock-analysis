With that much money why wouldn't you just buy month long expirations, downsize before earnings then pick up the dip?

Yoloing only works until it doesn't that's the point. I never said earnings play never works I said they're gambling if you know what you're getting into expect to loss everything. Also priced is not the same as priced in options with weekly expires during earnings days, those are wildly different, and you know that. That's just justifying gambling no matter how you mince it, that's the text book response from anyone who losses big. You do you with your money, but I recommend to not play earnings because situations like this happen all the time and it is completely avoidable.",
