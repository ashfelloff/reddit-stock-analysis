Executed the last 3. \nResult: 300 shares, $2.4k on-hand to do something else dumb and 5 Jan17 $20 calls waiting for launch.  Hoping when the calls come due I'll be walking away with at least 600 shares for my $150 investment. With my normal luck, that means the launch will veer offcourse and crash into their production facilty. ",

So, he’s already well in-the-money with a lot of time left until January. He probably bought the $20 call around when the actual price of the stock was $20, so if the price hadn’t risen to $31, he’d have paid money for no gain so far. If the stock had only risen to $21, he could have bought the shares for a dollar profit per share PLUS the money he paid for the option contract to begin with, so it matters how much the contract cost. If the contract cost $500, he’d still be in the hole $400, so in this example, he was wagering $500 that the stock price would rise to $25.01 or higher before the expiration in January. In this example, he would have a single dollar of profit (at 25.01, since 1 cent x 100 shares is a dollar) minus the commission that the brokerage charges. \n\nWhen you buy an option, you have the right to buy the stock at the strike price, but you aren’t obligated to. The risk is that you pay money for the contract but the underlying share price doesn’t move high enough to be profitable before it expires. Instead of exercising the option and acquiring the shares, he can sell the option to someone else for a profit, since the contract has risen in value. The contract would be worth roughly $1,100, since it lets you buy the stock at $20 and you can then turn around and sell the stock right now for the current market price, which is roughly $31. 31 - 20 = 11 x 100 shares = 1,100, so he would have a gain of roughly $600. Since OP started buying contracts when the stock price was around $2 in May and it has since went up to ~$37 this past week, and he kept rolling the profit into new contracts along the way, you can begin to see how $150 turned into $10,000+\n\nEdit: after looking again, the latest contract he bought was at a $15 strike, not $20, but the concept still stands",

But, you can buy weekly contracts like the $15 strike he recently bought, so in some cases you would have to close or exercise the position and roll it forward if you wanted to stay invested. \n\nBut yeah, if the expiration is long enough out, it doesn’t necessarily help, if he’s confident it will keep rising. But, he may have wanted to sell it in order to realize the profit into cash instead of having the gain on paper, because it’s hard to know when the price has reached its high. Like for example, this past week it hit $37 but quickly leveled to $31. Keep in mind that as the actual stock price fluctuates, so will the corresponding option contracts. If he was a master at timing the markets, he could have potentially sold a contract/position right before a dip in the underlying stock price, and then immediately bought back the same option contract for a lower price, essentially earning money and still keeping the ability to buy the stock later for that same low $20 (but now at a reduced cost basis, because of the cheaper contract)",

                  "body": "That’s generally not gonna happen on an option that’s in-the-money because there’s always someone that has a reason to buy it, at least from what I know. Could be someone that owns a bad put and wants to close out their position by buying the offsetting call, could be a market maker, could be someone speculating that it’ll go higher. Most likely it’s someone covering their short position that’s out-of-the-money (the bad put), again, just from what I know. \n\nBut yeah, if he really can’t sell it for its intrinsic value, he can always just exercise and then sell the shares to realize his profit. If the contract is in the money by at least one cent, his brokerage will automatically exercise his option for him upon expiration, unless he specifically tells them not to, so he won’t ever accidentally let the option ”expire” and lose his profits. \n\nIf he doesn’t have the cash to afford exercising and buying the shares, then it gets more complicated. Some brokers will close out the position by trying to sell it for you. Some will let you buy the shares on margin, I believe, if you have enough margin available. Some brokers will let you buy the shares and then place your account in a “restricted” state if you don’t have the margin to cover the purchase, for committing a “freeriding violation”. This means you cannot use margin and everything must be paid for with cash for a certain amount of time, I believe it’s 60 days. \n\nBut, the main thing to know here is that if you *don’t* actually want to hold the shares, you should always sell the contract before it expires. You won’t have to worry about having cash or margin to cover the purchase after exercise, and you’ll typically earn more money, especially if you sell the option with some time left before it expires, because you’ll earn money on the *time value* that’s remaining\n\nEdit: somewhat related: Also, you should always try to remember to close/sell call options that are out-of-the-money instead of just letting them expire worthless. What can happen is, you assume the option will expire worthless, but the stock rises some at the very last minute of trading and is now in-the-money by a few cents. Your broker will then exercise the option for you. Then, if you’re unlucky, the share price can fall back down below the strike price that you just bought it at in after hours trading or over the weekend, and now you’re holding shares at a loss on top of paying for the ‘losing’ option contract. This is one of the situations that gives options a ‘dangerous’ reputation for beginners",
