                      "body": "> I guess when people say passive, they mean actually buying shares and holding on to them (assuming the stock will go up).\n\nSorta. Usually if you're investing in shares, you are buying and holding shares longterm in the anticipation that the stock price value increases. There are things such as automatic purchasing where you designate specific time periods and dollar amounts that you contribute to a stock purchase, furthering the passivity if said stock you invest in allows DRIP (Dividend Reinvestment Plan) which automatically reinvests dividends into additional shares of a company's stock. This is typically the most passive way to go about this. It is also what most retirement plans like your 401k does, which automatically deducts a portion of your paycheck towards your investments.\n\n>Options or say trades (calls and puts) are more like gambling?\n\nYes, because options give you or allow you to have leverage. You are buying or selling contracts based on 100 shares of a company's underlying stock price. These involve specifc time horizons and expiration dates, so you have to be more actively tracking their value to consider when to close, execute, roll, or leave the option contract(s) alone. Now, depending how longterm a given contract you own is, will determine how \"active\" you are involved with it. \n\nExample: I buy a call option that expires next week - I'm going to be checking it constantly to consider exercising or closing it\n\nOther example: I buy a call option that expires next June - I'm not really concerned with it until probably next April or May because I know I have a ton of time to allow it to gain value in premium and leverage.",
