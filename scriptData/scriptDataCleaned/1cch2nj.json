      "body": "I ended up getting a single donut, after taking a loss on Tesla puts and losing about 40% on long term puts, liquidated them and put a small amount in meta puts being the gay bear that I was . \n\nIt just didn't seem to make sense that somehow a 20% gap up on meta was gonna magically repeat itself.  So figured being a gay bear was the right  . But besides that their was no real due diligence. \n\nJust saw this big ass gap, and figured it would need to be filled down at some point, and I didnt really see earnings having anything that impressive another crazy gap. \n\nHad the idea that maybe earnings would not be  good.\n\nI have some 400 puts but not sure if they will profit. Guess we will see",

Now short Tesla again.\n\nMSFT probably also not doing too well today but I could be wrong.\n\nTo anyone who claims \"it doesn't make sense\", it made a lot of sense.\n\nTesla was oversold and Musk regurgitated the lies he already told, which worked again. But the half-life of those lies is getting shorter every time he tells them.\n\nMETA is one of the big spenders on AI and that costs a lot of resources. No company turns a profit on their AI investments. META has risen 5 fold within a short period of time and no real correction.\n\nAlso, AI models are converging to each other. GPT was the clear leader, now we have several models that compete. META's model is somewhat open source and free, Apple also now has an open source model that's relatively light on resources. Some models get less resource intense and some of them can be trained on (very good) machines at home whilst still showing great results that compete with GPT. I wonder where that leaves the seller of shovels, NVDA. Seems to me those shovels are a little too big and a good spoon would suffice.",
