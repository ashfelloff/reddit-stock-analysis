Seems they have been doing terrible for a while in earnings. \n\nDo you guys think Walgreens at current prices is a value trap or a value stock?. Personally I find it hard to see if they could turn it around. And the 9 percent ish dividend feels like a trap..\n\nWhat are your thoughts? ",

                      "body": "It's the classic story of convenience stores.\n\nGrowth is massive. Management thinks, lets open a lot more stores.\n\nSO they open a ton of stores. For any number of reasons, stores start to do a little bit worse then expected.\n\nSo they cut some staff to make up for a decline in sales. As a result of cutting staff, theft rises. As a result of theft rising, they start cutting self-checkout (which is one of the main places theft occurs to begin with. You don't even have to try to steal everything, as a thief, you can just steal half the shit you have and walk right out, as it looks like you've paid for your stuff. Or at least, this is what I assume a lot of people stealing shit are doing.)\n\nThen when self checkout gets cut, it takes longer and longer to buy your stuff in still understaffed stores. So you stop going.\n\nBecause sales decline even more, management thinks that to get revenues back up, they have to raise prices on everything 3-5%, thinking retail won't hardly notice. But they do, and sales decline even more.\n\nDollar General, Dollar Tree, CVS, Walgreens, all of these companies have not done well in their stock price over the last year or so for this exact same pattern.\n\nTarget was actually experiencing the same problem, and it led to a decline in their share price as well. Luckily, Target realized that cutting grocery costs was best for their revenues, and they reversed course. \n\nAnd for CVS/Walgreens, the main appeal is that you can get prescriptions filled there. Guess who else is starting offer prescription refills? Better stores and ecommerce giants - Costco, and Amazon. Also add in Mark Cuban's Cost Plus, and you have even LESS reason to go there.\n\nI used to get my pantoprazole script filled at CVS. It was $60+. I get the same exact drug from CostPlus for about $15 + shipping. Why would I drive to CVS and pay 4x the same amount when I can get it shipped to me? I'm certainly not going there for anything else, with their ungodly high prices for literally everything.\n\nAnd I really mean that. Every grocery item that I can recall buying there is like twice the price of walmart or target.",

Doing things like closing stores may result in a bump up for another company in a different situation, but when the CEO of Walgreens literally admits on the conference call that \"We are at a point where the current pharmacy model is not sustainable\" and the $6B attempt at a pivot is a miss, the market is trying to figure out how to value what is essentially a melting ice cube and it's getting closer to Summer. If you listen to the call there really is not a convincing plan for what Walgreens looks like in the future and with the stock doing what it has, there's not much time to do anything.\n\nAre there companies who could buy it at this point and repurpose prime locations? Sure. Amazon, Kroger, etc. Would any of them be allowed to buy it at this point? IMO, no - it would only maybe be allowed if it became much more distressed - sorta/kinda similar to the situation with shitty media stocks and John Malone discussing the possibility that WBD would be allowed to buy PARA, but only if it got to the point where bankruptcy looked likely. Private equity? Maybe, but I don't know that that doesn't happen lower than here.",

I have 23 within 10 miles. Each needs inventory and staff. By comparison, there is 2 CVS within 5 miles, 5 within 10mi. It sounds like the CEO understood this too.\n\n2) They feel obligated to serve the communities and neighborhoods that have high shoplifting and burglary rates. They need to employ the armored gas station model if so. \n\n3) They have been employing a central model for low demand drugs. That makes sense from a cost model, but delays pickup by days and occasionally weeks. The druggist says they have supply chain issues from the supplier.HUH? Sounds suspiciously like they are caught in the JIT game with their pants down. Dissatisfied customers will be guided by \"when the going gets tough, the tough go shopping\". I have had to drive 30 miles to find the pills needed, and that wastes pharmacist time and costs. \n\n4) Historically, the Walgreen family were teatotalers and actually stopped selling liquor for a long time. They had good sales that lured customers. Now they do it half heartedly and leave money on the table IMHO. \n\n5)Their biggest competition is likely CVS. CVS is in bed with Caremark and insurance which direct subscribers to CVS with lower copay. I read recently that they have negotiated drug rates that compete well against Walgreens. I can't imagine that Walgreens doesn't but they don't seem as successful.",
