He's lost his magic he once had so he's likely not getting that after all.\n\n2. instead of making cybertrucks in an economy where people are struggling to get groceries and people better off aren't out buying $130k steel clad aluminum death traps, make fleet vehicle platforms for delivery and service vans and sell them at a $35k price point. Fleets are the secret sauce of other automakers when dealing with slow periods. Ford's fleet sales is what kept them afloat during the bailout era and were the one automaker who didnt need bailout money. Keeps the dealer networks happy too. Having service contracts with major entities or businesses to keep high use vehicles on the road with special supercharger contracts means more long term revenue. These fleet platforms can be based off existing platforms. Instead of going big with the CT and the Semi, go small with small city delivery vans. Could even make box truck platforms and small trucks (I would buy a 2 seater mini truck platform with a bed optional option) with an inverter option for job sites. Make these affordable (current options are low range and high priced from Stellantis, ford, and nissan) and absolutely wreck the competition. Delivery vehicles that can use NACS would be killer. \n\nThen of course, police and rugged SUV/Sedan options, steel underframe for bull bars and other options, offer a civvy version of this for a rugged model Y for offroading/camping to compete with Rivian.\n\n3. Rehire most of the SC team and fucking focus on rolling it out to third parties before EA/EVGO/everyone else catches up. Given the massive improvements these networks are undergoing, it's no mystery where the old supercharger team went. \n\n4. see #1, put elon in the back seat for a while and let people run the company. He's compromised by right wing yes men who are clearly manipulating him into self sabotage. Every action he has done shows he no longer cares about EV adoption because he thinks that his company will be spared. In reality, EV adoption dies, Tesla's fucked and China takes over every market but the US. But his friends will be happy with the result.\n\n5. Move AI development to another company, move robotics to another company. Too many irons in the fire, from an investment perspective this screams \"We have no new innovations as a car company or as an energy solutions provider, so we're doing something more profitable.\" Spin solar installs and powerwalls off too, given that you can no longer buy a standalone powerwall, and must fork out an additional $50k to get solar, it's no longer an attractive option if you just want home backup power.\n\n  \nAt this point, Tesla is resting on its laurels, and may be compromised because the CEO's trying to impress his rich friends who hate alternative energy. Given his new ties to Saudi money, he's likely doing them a big solid and crippling EV development on purpose. He's okay with sanctions, he's okay with incentives going away, he's okay with EV bans. Because he thinks AI and robots are now a better plan. Because those do not get in the way of his friends' and financial backers' interests.\n\n  \nThe saudi money thing is enough for me to choose another brand in the future. It's why I bought an EV, to stop funding those evil fucks.",
