It's far from finished, and likely never won't be finished to the state they've promised - but it's not like the game isn't there and that you don't get weekly updates as to what they're doing. It's not a *scam*. You can complain all you want about the lack of progress and content, and I honestly don't understand how they still make money (personally I spent 45 dollars on it 9 years ago and that's it, why the fuck keeps buying ships 8 years later???) - but it is by far the most transparent game development you have ever seen.",
