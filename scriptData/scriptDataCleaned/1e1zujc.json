I used to have to hire people to help me with side projects and now with the latest versions of anthropic and chatgpt4 I’m getting comparable crappy info (what do you expect from hiring low cost morons) but in less time and it’s fucking free because I’m not exceeding the free token quota. Also I don’t need to manage them, which I loathe. I just need to check the outputs, which I always had to do anyway.",

Likely more than the market can sustain. It's $20/month for a reason - it's not that useful. They can increase this price as agents get more effective, but it remains unclear how long it will take to make them radically more capable to support say $100/month - which would still be cheap for a competent agent.\n\n\nSelf driving cars could easily achieve bumper revenue, but LLMs won't get you there. ",
