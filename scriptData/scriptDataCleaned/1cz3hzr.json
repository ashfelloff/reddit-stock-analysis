  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "I know topic of Risk Management does not invoke same feeling of euphoria [windfall of $], or grief [loss porn], or even courage [YOLO]. But this is one aspect of options trading that may help you consistently limit your losses, enhance your profits, and keep P&L in green [year after year].\n\n Here's a golden rule,\n\nTREAT CASH LIKE BLOOD\n\nIf you by accident severe your artery and blood is gushing out then will you:\n\nA) Wait to receive medical attention because your favourite tv show is on air and hope the wound go away\n\nB) Drop everything and seek immediate medical attention\n\nSimilarly, if an option position turns adverse will you:\n\n1) Dilly-dally and hope market will change to your benefit, all while going deeper in the red\n\n2) Immediately close the position and limit your losses\n\nEven if you have 30% success in predicting the direction of market or a stock, and you limit your losses: you will be able to generate a positive P&L by the end of the year.\n\nCUT YOUR LOSES, LET YOUR PROFITS RUN!\n\nAnd, yes it may [sometimes] very well happen that immediately after you cut an adverse position, market may turn around and now 'the old' position is churning profit. But such occurence is to be anticipated and should not be the reason to delay the loss limiting action. ",
