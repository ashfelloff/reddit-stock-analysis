Bullish as fuck.\n\nBut seriously, overweight people who consistently flunk their diet and exercise generally need a shock of some sort to wake up and start getting serious. Not wishing it on them, but events like a heart attack, stroke, being unable to walk down the street without gasping for breath, and so on. I can see the drug being a supplement to their diet and exercise, enabling them to see results faster (like you said), and therefore derive more motivation and feed that cycle of exercise / diet -> results -> exercise / diet.",

Yes America has unwalkable residential planning. Yes there are a variety of conditions and obstacles people face.\n\nBut really the solution for the average joe is a pill you take forever to suppress your appetite, instead of other strategies and lifestyle choices that provide a better quality of life? Thats too sad man.",

For dinner grab McD‚Äôs, too tired for any physical activity? Watch TV.  But let us blame the victim for making the poor choices after society has already beat them down. \nThere are 2 responsible parties in every decision a person makes, the person and society. i.e. A poor person steals a loaf of bread b/c they are starving 10% their own fault for stealing, 90% societies fault for letting someone get to starving in the first place. \nIf someone has nowhere to be active safely, nowhere to get healthy food, and no energy to make good choices (BTW, humans have a max capacity per day for making choices) what % is on them? And if it‚Äôs less than 50% why blame them at all?",
