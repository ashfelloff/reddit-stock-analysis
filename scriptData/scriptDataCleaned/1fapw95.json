For the past 20 years more than 90% of their revenue has come from ads., only recently has that number gone under 90%. They only released their AI chat bot when OpenAI and Microsoft threatened their ad. revenue stream, they only pushed Google Cloud hard when talks of a monopoly started to get louder. \n\nFor years I have been saying that Google’s business model is ‘convincing governments that they’re not a monopoly’.",

They will very likely take this to the Supreme Court. I think from the moment of the decision that would be at least another 2-3 years until the Supreme Court will make a decision. Means 2027-2028. \n\nNo way any meaningful change to GOOGL business will happen, at least from this case.",

I guess a settlement might be the easiest route for everyone involved. Just shows how complex these situations are, where money and public interest are intertwined.",
