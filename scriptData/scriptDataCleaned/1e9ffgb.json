This is because you've already paid income taxes on the money you contributed. However, if you withdraw earnings from your Roth IRA before you're 59½ AND the account is less than five years old, you may have to pay taxes and penalties. This is known as the five-year rule. The penalty is usually 10%, but you may be able to avoid it in certain situations, such as:\n\nUsing the withdrawal to buy or build your first home, up to a lifetime limit of $10,000\nUsing the withdrawal to pay for qualified education expenses\nBecoming disabled and needing the funds to live on\nReceiving distributions in the form of a series of substantially equal periodic payments\nBeing a survivor of domestic abuse\nMaking distributions to your heirs after your death \n\nThe and is a big one.
