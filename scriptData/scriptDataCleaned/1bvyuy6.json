  "selftext": "As I sit here, gazing at the ever-fluctuating ticker symbol of SPY, my heart swells with an inexplicable blend of hope, concern, and unwavering support. SPY, oh SPY, you are more than just an ETF to me. \n\nYou represent the pulse of the market, the ebb and flow of economic tides, and the collective aspirations of countless investors. Whether your value soars to new heights or takes a sudden plunge, know that my only wish is for your well-being, your contentment. It matters not if you ascend towards the heavens or descend into the depths of uncertainty; what truly matters is your happiness, your stability. \n\nLike a devoted friend, I find myself cheering for you in every market rally and holding my breath during every intraday drop, those historical moments etched into memory like the crests and troughs of an ocean wave. And my dear friend Zodiac, whose concern for your welfare matches my own, joins me in this emotional journey, analyzing the stars in hopes of deciphering your next move, your next inclination.   \n\n\nFor in the grand tapestry of financial markets, amidst the chaos of numbers and charts, it's the simple desire for your happiness, SPY, that resonates most deeply within us. So whether you rise or fall, know that you are cherished, you are loved, and may your journey be as fulfilling as it is unpredictable.",
