  "selftext": "My chart on Intuitive Surgical Inc. (ISRG); and itâ€™s been steadily moving upward within the white lines (an upward channel). Right now, the stock price is bouncing between $480 and $500, which is the purple box area. This means it's taking a pause before possibly making a bigger move.\n\nMy take : \n\n1. Uptrend: The stock has been moving higher for a while, staying within the white lines.\n\n\n2. Sideways movement: The stock has been stuck between $480 and $500 for a little while; price has been consolidating. If it can get above $500, it might move even higher, toward the top white line.\n\n\n3. Support levels: The colored lines (moving averages) show that the stock has good support and hasnâ€™t dropped much, which is a good sign it could keep going up.\n\nIf the stock breaks above $500, we could see it head towards $520. \n\nMy take is calls for a week post earnings ! \n\n",
