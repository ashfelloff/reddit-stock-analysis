Google earnings have grown over 2x since Q4 2022 earnings report, the stock is up like 35% since then though.

The valuation makes no sense, it's at the point where meta is going to be a bigger company by market cap in 2025.. something needs to change in the narrative for Google to outperform its peers, otherwise it will suffer as \"the next IBM\" (all companies go this way eventually) as it currently has been since chatbot release in Q4 2022.",

When it becomes more clear that the doj is not gonna break up Google ( imo it's a matter of national security for the US of sorts, and the government is never going to allow it in today's political climate) and that searchAI/etc is not gonna make Google obsolete ( though it's clear that some market share is likely to be lost in the future) then the share price will match the fundamentals.",

Goog gains 20B net profit annual instantly, as anyone who was gonna switch has already done it (it takes 2 seconds).  Honestly I think Google wants to stop this payment already but since Apple relies on it it will be an act of war. This is geopolitics not business.
