I’m curious, what were you thinking when you bought those?\n\nYou probably know better than most of us what to do with your position, but I’d suggest waiting for the split and initial run up, then consider starting to sell portions of your position. Althoughh it couldn’t hurt to sell a tiny portion now, like enough to cover your expenses for a year or two, on the off chance the stock stagnates or dips into/after the split.
