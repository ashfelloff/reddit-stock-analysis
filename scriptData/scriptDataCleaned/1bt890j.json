      "body": "SpaceX could end up being a huge winner no?\nAlready dominating the LEO market with Falcon 9 - some boosters being reused in the double digits when other rocket companies have never had commercial re-flights. Cost per ton to LEO on a Falcon 9 compared to similarly capable competition is already wild and the gap is growing. \n\nThere is the potential for Starlink to keep growing into the ISP market, and if Starship follows the path of Falcon 9 it'll be another massive drop in cost per ton to LEO. \n\nI always thought SpaceX would be a great company to invest in if it was public. Don't know shit about DXYZ tho",
