So obviously the rating changes come after the announcement. The same way the stock moves after the announcement. By your logic, the stock should move before the announcement as well, but that's just a stupid assumption.\n\nThe main value of credit rating agencies aren't predictions, it's the analysis of the current credit worthiness of the company based on public information. It's what investors gain from speaking to them and reading the analysis that they value, not the actual downgrade which is just the equivalent of a headline in a news story. Stock analysts have more a focus on earning predictions, but their target audience are the buy-side, not retail investors, and even the buy-side only use their analysis and information to form their own view - not take their price targets and buy/sell recommends as gospel.\n\nClearly you know very little about the market and how the agencies, analysts and IBs play into it. I recommend you stop running around acting like some cocky overconfident professional when all of your comments give a strong indication that you are talking absolute shit and have probably only been investing for a couple of years.

The reason could be for something as simple as our political, economical, or even prejudiced bias would prevent us from considering. \n\nThe research reports are a good way to gauge potentially different impact points on the stock pricing. Doesn't matter if it gels well with your beliefs or not, but it's good to be aware of what the potential triggers for the stock may be.\n\nAfter all, these analysts are usually the in-house specialists for the top investment houses, which means quite a bunch (not all) of these pressure points are incorporated into their trading outlay. \n\nIf news comes out that were to hit those pressure points, retail may shrug it off thinking of it as inconsequential action. But the argos will immediately act on it, either buying or selling as needed. And that buying/selling will effect retail.\n\nAnother aspect to remember is that investment houses also ask one set of analysts to write up a report on why the price will fall and another set to write a report on why the price will rise. The reason being they want to gauge what are all the ways that can be thought off with the tools they have to assess what news are relevant enough to spin as good/bad for stock pricing.",

They are worried about Intel stealing ideas. Not so much the IP which is protected. But the way those companies design their chips. \n\nThis isn't outsourcing some design to any fabricator. These chips are designed around specific, semi conductor producer specific processes called nodes and that takes several years. There is a whole set of design rules, documentation etc around. That is a PDK.   \n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process\\_design\\_kit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_design_kit) \n\nLike that we get to the second problem. Taking a design and making it ready for production and then producing the chips. That is where Intel has been dropping the ball for many years now. They had their original 10nm node for many years, but the chips they designed for it, would not work because of never ending manufacturing issues. Then Intel basically rebranded Skylake year after year. 6th-10th gen where all Skylake. The architectures designed for 10nm, basically died.  \n  \nThen what seems to be a completely redesigned, now less performing 10nm node (renamed to Intel 7 later) was introduced for Alder Lake in 2021, some five years later than 10nm chips where supposed to ship. Then we got to Raptor Lake which is basically Alder Lake with more cores and higher clock speeds to try and keep up with AMD at stupid power consumption levels. The higher end ones have been dying at an alarming rate. Something Intel only is starting to admit to after months of ever mounting public pressure. And it just gets worse and worse with that mess...\n\nThen Intel its next node is Intel 4. They started shipping chips based on that, nearly a year ago. That is Meteor Lake. But its only for laptops with \"Core Ultra 5/7/9\". Almost a year later, those are still not that plenty to find. Intel isn't making anything powerful like a desktop, let alone a server CPU, on that node. In fact, it seems that Meteor Lake finally convinced OEMs to include more AMD into their line ups. You see, Meteor Lake kinda sucks. Its expensive, not that well performing and doesn't seem to be available in large quantities either. \n\nBut most damming is that Intel its next generation of processors, Arrow Lake, is being made at TSMC its superior 3nm node. That includes laptops. Intel its server parts are slated to remain on 10nm/Intel 7 for a while. So Intel is making all that capacity with new fabs. But the current ones aren't even being used to capacity. And who would want to use them with their spotty track record over the last decade? They delivered one new node in a decade after massive struggles and the next node is so bad, that Intel doesn't even want to make most of its chips on that. TSMC delivered four and overtook Intel. \n\nIntel has all its hopes placed on the next node, 18A. But with Intel its abyssal track record, I would not believe it until I see it. \n\nIn summery:  \nGrandma's inheritance is gone...",

This is also why Apple is always first to any new TSMC node. They basically bankroll TSMC to develop the process and construct the production facilities. Basically Apple just drops billions in advance to be first. That is also why they often have better performing chips. Most of the performance gains aren't from architecture and never have been. Most comes from more transistors you can use with a smaller node.   \n  \nIf Intel wants to be taken seriously, they also need to adopt such a model where they can't touch guaranteed supply from 3th parties. Meaning that if Intel runs into trouble with manufacturing (again), they would have to prioritise their 3th party customers over themselves. If they don't, nobody is going the Intel route either...",
