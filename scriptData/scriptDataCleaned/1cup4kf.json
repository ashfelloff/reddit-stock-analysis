                      "body": "> The Biden Administration proposed two reforms related to capital gains. The first would make the capital gains of taxpayers with income over $1 million taxable as ordinary income, increasing the tax rate from 20 to 37 percent. The second would largely eliminate the stepped-up basis. Currently, capital gains are not considered realized when transferred at death or by gift, and the recipient of the property receives a “stepped-up” tax basis, meaning the capital gains of the decedent or donor are never taxed. The proposal would reclassify transfers at death or by gift as a realization event for the decedent or donor. Such transfers would then be taxable, save for certain exceptions such as transfers to spouses or charitable organizations.\n\nThis is (presumably) what fenris is talking about taxing gains appropriately. Don’t forget to tickle the heel while they finish.\n\n https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2024/04/president-bidens-budget-calls-for-raising-43-trillion-in-revenues-over-ten-years-heres-how#:~:text=The%20Biden%20Administration%20proposed%20two,eliminate%20the%20stepped%2Dup%20basis.",
