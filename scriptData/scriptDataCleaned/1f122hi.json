Like say SPY goes from $560 to $520 somehow in a few weeks, that would increase the price of these puts (granted marginally but they probably cost dirt cheap too) and would be enough to sell to close for a profit? If so, why is everyone freaking out assuming OP is banking on a 30% SPY crash or something",
