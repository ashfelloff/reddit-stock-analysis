  "selftext": "Last week on wednesday i made a post about SMCI and how it is undervalued at around $775 to $800 a share. Today it just crossed over $1000 and reached around $1014 per share which is almost a 30% gain within 1 week. This is due to elon musk making an announcement that Dell and SMCI would be building a supercomputer with xAI. Personally im no fan of Elon Musk, but this is good news for SMCI as it will provide the company greater revenue and profit, which will help their EPS grow much more quicker and make the company more valuable. Currently the company has a PE ratio of around 54 and has a market cap of around $55 to $60 billion. This means that if the company continues to grow at its current growth rate, it could potentionally be worth around $150 to $200 billion within 1 year.\n\nCurrently own 4 shares of SMCI and may buy more if it dips below $850.",
