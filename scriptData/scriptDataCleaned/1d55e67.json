Happy to see it going to someone else who treats this like a business instead of a hobby.\n\nThis is a zero sum game folks. You’re not selling unless someone else is buying, so don’t cry just because you’re on the wrong side of a trade, because the problem isn’t the person or computer on the other side. If you’re consistently losing money then I can with a near 100% certainty guarantee that the reason isn’t whoever it is that’s buying when you’re getting stopped out—it’s a risk management and education issue, not the algorithms.\n\nEmbrace your own dumbass faults and learn from them. Trade with the banks and quit complaining about them harvesting your life savings just because you don’t have a clue about what you’re doing. Even bad luck Brian should be able to make money in this market as long as he isn’t yeeting the whole loaf on every trade. Honestly.",

They were worth $0.01 most of the day because I suck at this game. \n\nThen in the last 10 minutes SPY starts to rocket, but little did I know my broker opened a marker order for my contracts ~1 hour before market close. Apparently this is standard practice in some cases. \n\nI was watching SPY climb and then poof *Trade executed at $0.01*. These options got as high as $1.60 before end of trading. A simple trailing stop loss order would have netted me at least a 50% gain. Instead I lost about 99%. \n\nStupid of me to not realize my broker would open an order for the expiring options. I leaned that lesson. Knowing some hedgies grabbed my options for literal Pennie’s and flipped them for 100x in a matter of minutes is painful. \n\nMy calls were still on the bitter edge.
