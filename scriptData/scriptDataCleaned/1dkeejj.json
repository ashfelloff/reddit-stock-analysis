We will correct, possibly back to $95 (previous peak from 1 month ago).\n\nNVDA could drop 10% and still be worth more than GOOG and AMZN combined. It added an entire NFLX worth of market cap in the past 2 days. There's no clear catalyst besides FOMO, and the daily thread is making serious target evaluation of $10T by September.\n\nClear euphoria, \"it's different this time\", new paradigm thinking. I may end up being wrong, but a drop to 95 would net me an 8x ($350k).",
