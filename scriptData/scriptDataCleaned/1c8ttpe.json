Cars sitting in inventory is a nightmare for their cash flow.\n\nAll the simps LOVE to talk about all the cash Tesla has, but they conveniently don't talk about short term liabilities, such as accounts payable.  Tesla's short term liabilities are pretty close to their cash $.\n\nMaking cars is expensive and there are a lot of costs.  They have to buy materials in advance of the sale.  If finished car is sold, then they have cash to pay the suppliers.  If they build cars and they sit on a lot unpurchased, they still have to pay suppliers but have no incoming cash.\n\nAs long as they sell most of the cars they build, no problems.

So when you drive a Tesla you’re driving an Elon car. \n\nIt was cool when he was Tony Stark billionaire genius 2.0. Now he’s proven to be an asshole idiot man baby so his companies have lost their luster for many.",

Electric cars are purchased on the coasts by a majority of rich, liberal-leaning buyers and they aren’t buying. And the bubbas in butt cheese, Alabama arent going to jump in and start buying. \n\nPersonally, I’m not buying a Tesla because they’re poorly made , overpriced cars and the CEO is an erratic wildcard such that I’m not sure the company will be around five years from now. But I’ve made enough on betting against TSLA that I could buy a few so I love Elon. He’s predictably fuckjng up and I’m getting paid.",
