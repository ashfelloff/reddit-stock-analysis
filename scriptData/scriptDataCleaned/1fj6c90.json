  "title": "How would you value Coinbase?",
  "score": 63,
  "selftext": "For starters, I think the difference in price and value with Coinbase stock is huge. I keep seeing it mentioned as 'cheap' because of the 30x P/E ratio. But that is way off.\n\nHere are a few key metrics showing conflicting signals:\n\n1. The stock is trading at a $40b market cap with \\~$3b in annual sales. Earnings are very volatile and cash flows are inconsistent.\n2. The business is asset-light but the custody assets are consistently growing on the balance sheet. They've gone from $2b to $200b in custody assets over five years.\n\nI know this is a momentum stock in many ways. Even though the crypto hype has slowed down, prices have doubled since last year. More money chasing fewer assets.\n\n$160 per share is rich. The stock price can get cut in half and I would still think it's expensive. But they have somehow combined 3-4 very valuable business models: a financial exchange, custody assets, software products and asset management.\n\nI don't care for the typical valuation methods. Not even comparables are applicable here. Only ICE, Nasdaq, CBOE and CMOE are similar but each has a different specialty. Even sum-of-parts would be interesting but would require constant updates. Which is useless because crypto momentum and volatility have a life of their own.\n\nTell me how you would value this stock. What would you need to see to de-risk this as an investment?\n\nP.S. Coinbase has been on my radar because of the recent regulatory progress. Their legal team is crushing it. First, they're spending \\~$20m YTD to provide more clarity for investors. Second, this will secure their leadership position along with some regulatory capture. It's a winning position from my perspective. But entry point still matters.",

To pay bills in the amounts and frequency I need I have to use my bank's billpay/ACH system which costs $2-$5 per transaction, takes 3-6 days to process, and only processes during banking hours.  My only access to the history of those transactions if I need it is within whatever limitations my bank puts on their online reporting (sometimes as little as 30 days depending on the bank).  If my bank doesn't like where I'm sending it to or how often I'm doing it they can just decline to let the money be sent, at any time, because they feel like it.\n\nZelle/Venmo aren't real things here, as they are just essentially loans from banks that cover the processing time of the actual transfers, and from a feasibility standpoint if you're moving around money frequently or in high amounts Zelle/Venmo will shut you down real fast or put cooldown periods on your account where you can't use it for a few weeks.  We're talking about a few thousand dollars here.\n\nAnd god forbid I need to transfer 6 figures or more (not uncommon in real estate).  Then I've got to go into the bank, during banking hours, and show ID.\n\nAll of this to access and move around my own money.
