      "body": "Denison's main issue is that their recovery method is unproven at scale in the region. Trials have been positive but it's a risk compared to other NA producers who are starting/restarting established processes. I have a small stake due to the record of their management team and the quality of their assets, and if things work out it could be a big winner, but there are cheaper companies closer to production who represent a lot less risk for major investors in the space (UEC, Encore etc.).",
