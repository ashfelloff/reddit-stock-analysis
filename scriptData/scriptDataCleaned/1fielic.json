No freaking duh the industrial nespresso is going to have a cheap restock cost when buying in bulk. Moving to that will save intel a lot. I hope they did it company wide. The savings will be significant, especially if it's full staff that's being eliminated. If it's just the luxury machines, like 5% of the service cost they were paying alone makes the replacement free.\n\nIt's literally the boomers taking their own advice and not spending money on coffee out at this point.
