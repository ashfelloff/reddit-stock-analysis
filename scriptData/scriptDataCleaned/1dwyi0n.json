For example, almost all credit unions are part of the Co-Op network, which means you can use ATMs at any other credit union for no fee as if they were owned by your credit union. For some reason, 7-Eleven ATMs are also Co-Op machines. This means that your local dingy credit union with 3 branches probably has more fee-free ATMs than Chase. Many also will reimburse you for out-of-network ATM fees.\n\nThere are other networks too, such as Moneypass, PLUS, and Allpoint.",

      "body": "Wells Fargo tried this a few years ago, they forced every checking account to have a minimum charge of $5.00. I worked in their marketing department at the time and nobody thought it was a good idea. Once we started promoting the upcoming fee, another group spoke out, customers. And they started closing accounts and banking somewhere else. So Wells Fargo relented and did away with the fee. For a time, at least.\n\nI left the company and later it was revealed all of the multiple ways Wells Fargo has consistently screwed over customers. Silent fees, phantom second accounts, collusion to keep rates high, it's staggering how many ways Wells Fargo has figured out to screw over its customers, apologize and promise never to do it again and then do it again. If you sign up on Monday with Wells Fargo, it's a $5.00 charge unless you maintain a $300 minimum balance and I am positive they have found ways to screw customers so they have to pay the $5.00. They truly are the abusive spouse of the banking industry. It sounds like JP Morgan wants to get in on the action. Move to a credit union.\n\nFree version of story:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-warns-86-million-customers-150827155.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-warns-86-million-customers-150827155.html)",
