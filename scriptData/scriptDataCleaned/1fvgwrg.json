Then there's the infamous first attempt of trying to purchase real world goods in 2010; 2 pizzas for 10,000 coins. I remember the real early days. So little was known about it's creator and most felt like it was purely a scam, myself included. It was difficult to see it any other way. Those that bought in were really just buying a lottery ticket without even knowing if there was a prize. I've watched stocks for many years, although only recently started trading and there's still so much I don't understand. Never had much spare cash, but I'm playing to learn. $900 is now $2.5k (in about 18 months) so no complaints, but there's a lot of cheap, dead stocks along for the ride. I've witnessed companies soar that I dreamt of or thought about buying, and that hindsight sucks, but I still don't regret not buying Bitcoin. It reeked of risk without reward. Even many of those that bought in soon assumed it would amount to nothing. 20% of pass keys are lost forever.",

You can try and sell it at 25, but it'll be a low fill, meaning your contract will be less likely to sell at that price. People obviously don't want to buy it high. So I sold at a medium. Say 18 or 19 dollars. I'm not the one to fully ask that. \n\nDepends. From my experience, I tried selling it higher than the average price, which could take a while to sell or not sell at all. But the price kept moving some. But whatever you try to sell it at, and someone takes interest in it, that what you'll get.",
