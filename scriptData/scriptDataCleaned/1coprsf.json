Usually the pre-market has people excited but then reality hits once it opens, usually it drops, and those call options are cheap, wait for it to drop to $898. So I get $200 worth of calls for call option price of $985 expiration this Friday, wait an hour, at most make $150-200, then sell and repeat the next day (I have a cash account so it’s helping me not lose more than I have) I do the same with Put Options.

The first 30 mins premarket, pumps like crazy, but it sucks cause unless you have calls you hold on to for a long time you might profit if you sell right away as soon as Market opens. Afterwards it drops crazy for like an hour or so it’s struggling to go back up, at that time i get a few crazy calls. Around 11ish it pumps back a bit, I sell no later than 12:30pm and then repeat. (Like right now $924 pre market price, when it opens, might go down to $908-$915, it will drop a bit, then correlate)",
