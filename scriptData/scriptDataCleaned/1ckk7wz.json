After 20 years I crossed into 7 digits territory. The growth curve is exponential so at a certain point it gets almost ludicrous. Like when the amount of ESOP value added to my account each year first exceeded my entire annual salary for that same year. Then there came a year when I realized that in that single year I added more to my retirement than my parents' entire life savings. It often seems surreal to me. But I'm not complaining lol.",
