NVDA goes up: You make money on your shares. You lose on your put. Depending on how much the underlying moved, you might be up. If the underlying moves up a lot, it'll more than offset the loss on your put.\n2. NVDA stays flat. You lose on your put. You don't make anything on your shares.\n3. NVDA goes down. You lose on your shares. You make money on your put.\n\nIn the above example, if you have 200k shares, a proper hedge would be 200k / 100 = 2k puts. The strike price of the puts should match your cost basis if you want a perfect hedge.\n\nImagine why this is important. 200k NVDA shares is a $24 million position. $600k in those put contracts is \\*only\\* 2.5% of your long position. It'll buy you peace of mind that your long position is protected in the case that NVDA has an epic crash. And in the worst case, if you hold those puts to 0, you've \\*only\\* lost 2.5% of your entire NVDA stack.",

Say you think a stock you've been long on is topping out and you want to sell, but you haven't held onto the shares for quite a year yet. If you sell now, you'd have to pay tax on your gains like it was any other type of income.\n\nA better idea might be instead to buy some PUT positions to hedge yourself against any losses until the the tax break kicks in, thus potentially saving you up to 15% in capital gains tax on your initial holdings.",
