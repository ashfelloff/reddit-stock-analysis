The growth has been unprecedented in the soft drink scene.  Revenue has grown 24% YOY, and increased $80 million dollars last quarter alone.   Not only is it growing fast, but profit margins also keep improving each quarter.  This is a healthy, thriving, and GROWING business.  Foreign markets are still essentially untapped; once it expands globally, this thing will be a giant.  The stock price this year, however, has not been reflective of the company's success.  Pepsi is one of the main distributors of Celsius, and they bought a little too much inventory so there will be some smaller orders in the short term.  Ok cool, don't care.  There has been some bad press around the energy drink market in general saying consumers are buying less because of inflation.  Still don't care.  $CELH is now cheaper on a P/E basis than Coca-Cola, which is a ZERO GROWTH stagnant company.  While the stock has been getting gutted this year, every cuck on wallstreet has put their grubby little hands in the honey pot and sold it short; and short interest has now grown to \\~13%.  But ut-oh, is that Celsius' music? A 10% rip today is going to be a big problem if you're short.  Through this entire downswing, institutional investors have been gobbling up the stock, increasing their positions by more that 400% so far in 2024.  The smart money knows that this is a healthy company with bad press and charmin-soft mfs selling it for way too cheap.  It's currently extremely oversold based on the RSI and the MACD is curling.  I think it's coming back in a big way. The fundamentals are there.  The analytics are there.  Where are you?  \n\nDisclaimer: I am two celsius deep rn ",
