ASTS is already expected to have $130M/year with just 5 birds in the air and over $1.5B/year with just 25 cause their TAM is orders of magnitudes higher. With a full constellation, $10B/year is easily within reach.\n\nThis is not the 1st time we see this kind of exponential jump from a new tech iteration. People forget that when Blackberry solved the network scaling issue that's when subscription data plans became the centerpiece of cell phone companies (versus regular voice/text) which completely upended the industry and catapulted Blackberry to the forefront.\n\nThe same will happen here.",
