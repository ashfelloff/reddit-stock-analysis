      "body": "Derivatives put you at a disadvantage because of the time decay from theta. I believe if you were inclined to take a risk towards the downside borrowing shares to short would be more effective. Due to the ability to scale into your position. However gambling on earnings is always a gamble and derivatives would protect you from downside. Either way I think putting large sums of capital into earnings is a way that will eventually lead to a loss. \n\nI would consider long term investing over options. You would be surprised by how much money you could make with simple buy and hold strategies",

Make a bit of money once or twice then get wrecked when you double down. \n\nI usually sell puts, but the last week was rough with the market putting some otm MSFT puts I sold down as much as 250% at some point. Those should be fine by EoW. I generally prefer theta to be on my side, but I'm not ever going to sell naked calls. Unless, I had a time machine to go back to early last year to YOLO my whole account into NVDA, I don't see how a buy and hold strategy could do better than I've done since the start of 2023 other than another terrible year like 2022, but even then I held AMZN shares for massive losses.",
