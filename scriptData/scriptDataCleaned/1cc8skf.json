Everyone buys and sells on this news.   \n\nSo if company beats earnings stock doesn’t go up-  because the price was already baked in by the news. \n\nIf the company misses earnings doesn’t matter because the price was already baked in by the news.   \n\nYou’d think that if a company beats wallstreet expectations that the price would go up but it never does - because everyone already expected it to do so.   \n\nUsually this news is just rumors or worse purposely market manipulation that your not in on so it can be randomnly off. \n\nWhich is why the saying buy / sells on the news is so valuable because the price is already built in by the time the actual news leaks.   \n\nI used to put automatic sell dates before every report date on stocks I owned to sell all of them 48 hours before earnings calls and then rebuy 48 hours later after learning this lesson many times.  Everytime I was too lazy I would get burned.  \n\nOf course the other saying “once you’ve read about it in the news” youre already late is also true.    But if your fast enough on the news cycle you can get in earlier than other idiots who read the same articles.    Since I’m not refreshing Twitter ( can’t compete with bots anyway ) I just buy and sell to avoid the mess of earnings reports.  If I already own the stock I can usually cash out.  Then make a bit more when the stock does it’s random market manipulated change on earnings day. \n\nJust be sure to sell before the actual earnings reports because that is when shit gets real.",
