  "title": "Morgan Stanley: NVIDIA To Earn $10 Billion In Revenue From Blackwell Chips Alone In Q4 2024",
  "score": 1175,
  "selftext": "The reason the stock is going up has more to do with this than Jensen, in my opinion. If anyone can recall that analysts were upset when Jensen would not give specifics on Q4 Blackwell revenue during the last earnings call. He only said that it would be \"billions\" in revenue. Now they have a specific number and 10 billion is way higher than expected. The margins will likely be high as well.\n\nhttps://wccftech.com/morgan-stanley-nvidia-to-earn-10-billion-in-revenue-from-blackwell-chips-alone-in-q4-2024/",

There have a been a number of articles on the subject over the last few years, Nvidia using Intel for some fab, competing with Apple for TSMC production space, TSMC ordering more machines for future production, etc, etc. They're not \"exciting\" articles and can talk about things that are being prepared for years in advance, so don't generally get posted here, just go search google if you're interested. \"Supply chain issues\" is something that can address what you're talking about as well.",
