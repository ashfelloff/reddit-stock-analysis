But pensions are tied to years of service though, with our's maxing out at 78% of your average pay from your 5 highest paying years (usually the last 5), so the incentive is there to max out your years of service.\n\nA real world example though, it has taken 30 years for the value of the dollar to halve. So by the time I am 90+ with no adjustments I would still be making 39% of my pay just from pension.

He did that many times at Rockwell Collins and then was leading the integration of Collins Aerospace after the sale and then eventually the Raytheon merger. With Boeing needing to integrate Spirit, and his track record of doing that, it lines up really well for that to be the driver. Imo anyway.¬†",

That'll only do so much, though. The other big issue is the class 1's are sending out 2-5mi long trains that can't fit in a siding to save on labor (basically you can move 2-4 trains with a single crew), so Amtrak winds up taking the siding because their trains are usually less than a thousand feet long. Money needs to be dumped into double tracking or at least elongating sidings and installing more crossovers where double+ territory exists, and upgrading non-signaled territory to CTC (Centralized Traffic Control), but the class 1's are only interested in doing that if it'll boost their profits in the long run. Limiting train length is another possible solution, but the railroads are already hiring anyone with a pulse and clean urine when 20 years ago you had to have connections just to get an interview for a conductor job. After a large wave of retirements and staff losses from covid, there just isn't enough man power (plus more crews means less extra money to show the shareholders each quarter).",
