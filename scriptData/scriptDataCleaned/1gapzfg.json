The market is firing right now and capital won't just suddenly disappear overnight if Trump wins, but to say that his ideas are \"good\" or won't affect economic growth is plain regarded.

Proposed corporate tax reforms would raise much-needed revenue to help address the deficit, with minimal impact on stock valuations\n\nHigher corporate taxes would mean less earnings per share, due to more tax expense... Also, it would not have a significant impact on the national debt. The corporate tax cuts in 2018 did not impact revenues much, the deficit only grew because of spending hikes.\n\nThe spending proposals from Harris would cost way more than corporate tax hikes would raise.\n\n>The stock market has surged during the Biden-Harris administration, with the S&P 500 on track to match last year’s impressive 20% gains.\n\nThe market went up because of AI... it was crashing bad throughout 2022 until AI hype saved it.\n\n>In contrast, a Trump presidency could create a small set of winners while negatively impacting the broader market. Trump’s proposed tariffs on imports and strict immigration policies would raise consumer prices and create unnecessary labor shortages, damaging market performance. \n\nI thought the same in 2016/2017, I feared that Trump's tariffs would crash the market. But the market skyrocketed during his presidency despite his tariffs. The biggest stocks in the  S&P500 are tech companies that aren't affected much by tariffs.\n\n>Additionally, Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric, including suggestions of using the military against domestic populations, would certainly further unsettle the markets, raising serious concerns about long-term economic stability.\n\nIMO Harris' hawkish foreign policy platform is a far greater threat than Trump's baseless comments.\n\nPeople focus way too much on the presidency and not enough on congress. There won't be many meaningful economic changes unless one party wins the house, senate, and presidency.\n\nI can see a market crash happening with either presidency, just because stock market valuations are so elevated relative to earnings and historical norms.",
