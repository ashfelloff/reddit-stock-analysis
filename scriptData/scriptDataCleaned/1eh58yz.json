Say fukc it and Yolo the remaining $37k on nvda calls before q1 earnings. Made back what was lost and some. Turned the gains into 1k tsla shares. Bought more tsla puts for q2 earnings. Cashed out big. Now holding a sh!tload of tsla calls and nvda calls. Next goal to turn the calls into 1.5k nvda shares and another 500 tsla shares. Goal is to hit $1M EOY. Just lots of luck and good timing.",
