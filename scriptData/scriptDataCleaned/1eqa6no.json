Might only be representative of the two individual stores I worked at.  \n\nBut home depot had better pay, better benefits, ran smoothly, wasn't a dumpster fire.\n\nThey ended up building a Costco right across the street from the Lowe's and immediately all the good employees quit and went to Costco. Lost literally half their workforce overnight. Because Costco literally pays double for the same job. Plus a pension, plus benefits, plus paid time off, plus this and that etc etc etc, Lowe's didn't have a chance. So...bullish on Costco lol",
