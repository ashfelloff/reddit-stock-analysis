  "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell famously remarked that 'prices of some things will go up and prices of other things will go down' in a 60 minute interview with Scott Pelley.\n\nPowell is due to speak tomorrow at a fireside chat in Washington DC tomorrow at 115pm.\n\nSome things that will be mentioned during tomorrow's speech include:\n\n'Inflation remains well above our two percent target\"\n\n'Strong Labor Demand has forced us to maintain rates since last July'\n\n'Higher Prices can persist for longer periods, these costs will trickle down to the retail sector'\n\n\n\nUnlike the Fed's kashkari, who 'jotted down 3 rate cuts for 2024', Powell 'penciled 3 rate cuts for 2024' in a prior speech held on December 01  2023.\n\n\n\nHedge accordingly, as any guidance that is inline with what he mentioned in previous speeches could cause an overreaction tomorrow.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
