The probability just isn‚Äôt there\n- underlying value moves away from you (obviously)\n- Vega. People call it IV. This is the options sensitivity. Events impact it like earning calls suck value out of options.\n- Rho. Interest rate changes, though less significant it‚Äôs an input for market makers\n- Dividends drop stocks, and therefor call options\n- ITM options have value converted from time value into intrinsic value, everything else approaches worthless\n\nWorked at a market maker and ran spreads around the underlying to see how we could remain profitable.\n\nThe house always wins.
