It literally has been flirting with 52W highs and gone up on days when other blue chip stocks go down.\n\nA strategy I have tried to employ with these big tickers is reversion back to the mean.\n\nIt’s gone up the last week and last month. It’s approaching 52W highs. $150 seems way more doable than $170, in fact it is expected following the reversion theory.\n\nYou picked the wrong side of this and now have to deal with theta, which is almost $0.04 per contract lost today. Why you didn’t exit this earlier today after the market was super green yesterday is regarded to me but yeah. Hopefully it can make a decent run in the next 3 hours so you could close before Monday as you’ll lose about 40% of the contract just over the weekend",
