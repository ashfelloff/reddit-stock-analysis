  "selftext": "> (Bloomberg) -- FedEx Corp. tumbled the most in two years after warning that its business would slow in the year ahead, an ominous sign about the direction of the US economy.\n\n> The parcel giant was hurt by a pullback on priority services as customers traded down to cheaper shipping options in what Chief Executive Officer Raj Subramaniam called ‚Äúa challenging quarter.‚Äù A broad effort to slash costs gained traction but only partially blunted those headwinds, the Memphis-based company said late Thursday.\n\n> FedEx‚Äôs shares slid 14% after the markets opened Friday in New York, the biggest intraday decline since September 2022. Rival United Parcel Service Inc. fell 3.4%.\n\n> The results spooked investors looking for signals about where the economy is headed after the Federal Reserve this week cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2020. The policy shift reflects growing concern about the health of the labor market as job gains have slowed and inflation cools.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-narrows-2025-outlook-posts-201154635.html",

      "body": "Anyone who buys transport/logistics stocks thinking they‚Äôre going to get rich off capital gains is not paying attention.  They are basically boring. You busy them for solid dividends and slow, boring dividend growth. The ups and downs of the share price simply change the yield and are generally buy opportunities. \nThat being said, FX is the weakest of the big three. I honestly don‚Äôt see them around in a decade. UPS is run b6 accountants and engineers. The accountants tell the engineers what AROI is needed for the next 5 years and the engineers figure out how to achieve it. There is no more solid, boring company on earth. \nDhl has the fortune of position in the international market. Tough to dislodge but trades on its name to charge exorbitant rates. That cannot last as the commercial marketplace gets flatter and regulators get more and more nosey about shipments and data quality.",
