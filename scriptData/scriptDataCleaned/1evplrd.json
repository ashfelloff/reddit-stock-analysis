My main concern is I don't have any investing experience at all so I'm not sure where to start & i don't know what platforms/apps are good, I'm looking for a platform that I can start with and use forever essentially, I don't wanna have to change platforms down the road because the platform i was previously using doesn't have certain things etc. So i guess i'm looking for the swiss army knife if investing platforms. what would you say is the best platform for that ?",

They allow you to easily exchange currency and buy foreign stocks directly on the foreign markets. This is very valuable and gives you access to many stocks you cannot get otherwise plus you bypass ADR fees assuming the stock you want even has ADR's. Their UI's (they have more than 1) arent great. Thier support is so so. But they do have some of the best margin rates. One thing they are missing is access to treasury auctions but they do offer secondary market bonds so you can always buy those. AFAIK, no other broker allows you access to international like these folks. It really is the only reason my main portfolio is there. You can start with the free (lite) account until your portfolio is large. At that point it might be worth it to upgrade to their pro account.\n\nAfter that, I would say Etrade and Fidelity are good and pretty much equal. Etrade was recently bought out but so far they have kept the UI and tools the same. Id say Etrade is a little more user friendly than Fidelity but not by much. Pretty much interchangeable.\n\nOnes to avoid like the plague include anything Vanguard, HealthEquity, or Compuserv. They are just terrible platforms which is ironic in the case of Vanguard, because they run some of the most popular ETF's.",

The 6 positions I do a daily buy on are all trading above my average price paid per asset, with AAPL being over 26% increase.
