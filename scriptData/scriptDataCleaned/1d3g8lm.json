Ten times that.\n\nKnow absolutely nothing about you, but if you keep your head and don't either fuck your entire life up or get yourself killed, in the future you will feel more... philosophical about losing $130k, no matter your level of wealth.\n\nIf you end up rich as fuck or even just regular rich, you'll laugh about $130k and how you stewed about it.\n\nThe real issue is if your perspective never changes. Like if you're still stewing about it 10 years from now just as bad, or end up completely destroying your life over the anger and resentment.\n\nYou can never change the fact you lost that money, but you can change your perspective on it and how you relate to this event. It sounds corny, but it's true. And it's really your only shot at finding peace.",

Thank god, after a couple weeks of losing like $10-20K a day, I decided to sell all my marijuana penny stocks and put half of it into NVDA at $9/share because of VR (no, not crypto, not AI) and half into some other shit. Literally lived off selling a little bit of NVDA every year since (and regretted every time I sold).
