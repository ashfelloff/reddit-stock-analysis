  "title": "Boeing freezes hiring in sweeping cost cuts as it grapples with factory worker strike",
  "score": 347,
  "selftext": "Boeing announced sweeping cost cuts including a hiring freeze and a pause on nonessential staff travel to preserve cash as it deals with a strike of more than 30,000 factory workers..\n\nBoeing factory workers, mostly in the Seattle area, started walking off the job early Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a tentative labor deal and to strike.\n\n“We are working in good faith to reach a new contract agreement that reflects their feedback and enables operations to resume,” CFO Brian West said in a staff note on Monday. ” However, our business is in a difficult period. This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way and we must take necessary actions to preserve cash and safeguard our shared future.”\n\nThe financial impact of the strike will depend on how long it lasts but Boeing is focused on conserving cash, West said at a Morgan Stanley conference Friday. He said the company’s new CEO, Kelly Ortberg, wants to get back to the bargaining table right away to reach a new deal.\n\nOn Friday, Moody’s put all of Boeing’s credit ratings on review for a downgrade and Fitch Ratings said a prolonged strike could put Boeing at risk of a downgrade. That could drive up the borrowing costs of a manufacturer that already has mounting debt.\n\nBoeing burned about $8 billion in the first half of the year as production slowed in the wake of a near-catastrophic door-panel blowout at the start of the year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/boeing-freezes-hiring-cost-cuts-factory-worker-strike.html",

          "body": "So true. I’ve worked for a number of companies where the bean counters took over the day to day operations. They would kill built up relationships with customers and suppliers. Everything is black and white to them. They have no idea how important relationships are. You can have 2 companies that provide the same quality and prices but it’s the relationships that have been developed that gets you the orders. At one particular company I worked at, a 10 year old customer would issue verbal purchase orders to get ahead of the delivery lead times. Once the bean counters took over, they would no longer allow verbal orders. Had to have signed hard copies before they could be accepted. The customer took his $10 million business elsewhere. Bean counters couldn’t understand why they did that. About 9 months later the company filed for bankruptcy. I learned quickly that when the bean counters take over, you start looking for another job.",

Not all bean counters are as arrogant as the some of the ones I've had to deal with. The worst are the ones that have the attitude of \"it's my way or the highway\".
