IBIT has a slightly lower expense ratio until mid next year (.125 vs .25) - both of them are low enough though.\n\nThe main reason I pick FBTC is because Fidelity does their own custody versus most other ETF’s using Coinbase. I trust Fidelity much more as they have their own digital asset wing who has been mining/involved in crypto for years. I like them being able to not rely on Coinbase.\n\nAlso they have stated they have plans to open their customers funds to self-custody, which I think aligns better with the ethos of BTC.",
