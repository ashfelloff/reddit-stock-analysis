  "title": "NVDA - don't buy the dip (yet)",
  "score": 64,
  "selftext": "The past few weeks I've been eyeing NVDA's run back to its pre-earnings highs ahead of their upcoming report. As I mentioned before, NVDA will be making a round-trip to its pre-earning print before it bounces again. I also firmly believe they will crush earnings expectations and the stock will bounce, though likely not hit new all-time highs just yet.\n\nSo the big question is - what's the optimal trading strategy here? Here are my thoughts:\n\n* Ignore any short-term rallies this week if they happen. NVDA likely has more room to run still. It will remain somewhat depressed as emotions rather than fundamentals trade.\n* Ignore the hype.  But - believe the hype.  What NVDA has is a lock on a market that's seeing tremendous investments.  This isn't stopping any time soon.  The stock will go higher (just not yet).\n\nIf possible, I'd recommend staying on the sidelines for another 2-3 weeks. It'll be tempting to jump in on temporary rallies if you're unestablished, and painful to watch dips if you're already holding. But I expect volatility to persist a bit longer.\n\nPuts are off the table for me personally (I avoid those). I'm looking to accumulate shares in the $600-700 range ahead of earnings. Even if it doesn't hit those prices, I will start picking up, especially if market looks past its current weakness after this week's PCE print.  \n\n&#x200B;",
