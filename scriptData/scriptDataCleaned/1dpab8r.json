The company’s only debt is from bonds so they don’t need high price to leverage their stock price. \n\nThey want a lower price for the buybacks announced for next year, they’re asking for 21 EPS for the year, they have 17 right now. Their revenue isn’t going to grow more than a few percent so they will have to get as much bang for their buck with stock buybacks next year to hit their goal and expectations likely\n\nSure investors and funds could still keep it up because jpmorgan sees it as a $350 stock but there isn’t anything to back it up really.
