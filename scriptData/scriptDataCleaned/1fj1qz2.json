By that, we are one 25 cut behind and the next should already be coming on. That means, according to the data, interpreted by the market, the cut should be 50 to get ahead of the curve and stop the direction, instead of just slowing the momentum down. The reason, why 25 is still very much likely is, that the market does not trust the Fed to follow the data, because they tend to be extremely conservative in their actions.
