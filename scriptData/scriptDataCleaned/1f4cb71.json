  "selftext": "Lululemon missed Wall Street‚Äôs fiscal second-quarter sales expectations and lowered its guidance Thursday after it botched a highly anticipated product launch and growth slowed in the Americas. \n\nThe company now expects full year net revenue to be between $10.38 and $10.48 billion, down from a previous range of between $10.7 billion and $10.8 billion. Lululemon anticipates earnings per share will be in a range of $13.95 to $14.15, down from previous guidance of $14.27 to $14.47.\n\nHere‚Äôs how company did compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:\n\nEarnings per share: $3.15 vs. $2.93 expected\n\nRevenue: $2.37 billion vs. $2.41 billion expected\n\nShares dropped as much as 10% in extended trading.\n\nThe company‚Äôs reported net income for the three-month period that ended July 28 was $393 million, or $3.15 per share, compared with $342 million, or $2.68 per share, a year earlier. \n\nSales rose to $2.37 billion, up about 7% from $2.21 billion a year earlier. Beyond total sales, Lululemon also missed expectations on comparable sales, which grew 2%, well behind estimates of 5.9%, according to StreetAccount.\n\nDuring the quarter, Lululemon pulled its Breezethrough leggings, launched in early July, after it received a wave of complaints about the product‚Äôs unflattering fit. The botched launch came after the company struggled with a number of other self-inflicted issues with its assortment, including not having the right colors and sizes that its core customers desired.\n\nThe flops have contributed to a slowdown in the company‚Äôs largest market, the Americas. During the quarter, sales grew only 1% in the region.\n\nSales jumped 29% in Lululemon‚Äôs international markets as the company looks to China for growth.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q2-2024.html",

Here‚Äôs some more background on the company:\n\n260 Sample Sale is a popular company that hosts sample sales in major cities, primarily in New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami. These events offer deeply discounted designer clothing, accessories, and other items from a variety of high-end brands. Here are some facts about 260 Sample Sale:\n\n1. **Location and Events**: 260 Sample Sale operates out of multiple locations in New York City, Los Angeles, and Miami. Each location hosts different sales for various brands.\n\n2. **Designer Brands**: The sales feature a wide range of designer brands, including Alexander Wang, Diane von Furstenberg, Marc Jacobs, Oscar de la Renta, The Kooples, and many more. The brands and items available vary from sale to sale.\n\n3. **Discounts**: Items are usually discounted significantly, often ranging from 50% to 80% off the retail price. This makes these sales popular among shoppers looking for luxury items at a fraction of the cost.\n\n4. **Frequent Updates**: 260 Sample Sale frequently updates its schedule with new sales, and shoppers can find information about upcoming events on their website or through their social media channels. This allows customers to stay informed about which brands will be featured and when the sales will occur.\n\n5. **Pop-Up Format**: These sales are temporary events, often lasting a few days to a week. They are set up in a pop-up format, creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity for shoppers.\n\n6. **Online Sales**: In addition to in-person events, 260 Sample Sale has expanded to offer online sales through their website, allowing customers outside of the physical locations to take advantage of the discounts.\n\n7. **Membership and Alerts**: While there is no formal membership required to shop at 260 Sample Sale, shoppers can sign up for email alerts to be notified of upcoming sales.
