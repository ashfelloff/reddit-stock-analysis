  "title": "Where is the media hype around $ALCC?",
  "score": 120,
  "selftext": "With Sam Altman’s ( big daddy AI) involvement I would have thought $ALCC would catch the attention of the media.\n\nDriving the price a lot higher in anticipation of the Merge Vote.\n\nTo my surprise nothing has been said bar a few outdated measly articles dated a few months back about the announcement of the ALCC-OKLO merger vote set for \nMay 7th 2024.\n\nAfter some research, I found OKLO’s Media and Public relations officer is out on maturity probably explaining the lack of attention I would expect a merger of this scale to get. \n\nRegardless I still think this is under covered and has gone vastly unappreciated for its potential. I don’t know if it’ll reach the heights of 40s like some of Altman’s alts claim, but I do believe 20-30 isn’t unreasonable if it finally gets some goddamn traction with the media.\n\nOn the flip side I wonder is Sam Altman’s name really not big enough to have the predicted multiplying effect on the price everyone claims it will have.\n",
