I’m not arguing that these are great companies with super bright futures, but 3x earnings is such a ridiculously low valuation.\n\nThink about it this way. Imagine you were in the market to buy a small business. You have to buy one of these two businesses. \n\nOption A: Over the last 5 years, it’s done $100k in profit each year. So no earnings growth. The price for the entire business is $300k or a 3x multiple.\n\nOption B: 5 years ago, the business did $100k in profit, and it now does $115k in profit. So earnings growth is around 3% per year. The price of the entire business is $2.3M or a 20x multiple.\n\nWhich one are you buying?",

High probability of it being delayed a couple of extra years, and they are already committing to the manufacturing of the robo-taxi car over the $25,000 car that would actually keep them viable as an auto company. Optimus looks cool, but we'd be seeing a lot more results already if the FSD approach was good at training a robot. It is a different set of problems, since you have to train the robot to do a lot of things fairly well, whereas with the car, it has one thing to do, and it has to do it perfectly in many different conditions.\n\nThe energy storage business looks good, but is not big enough yet to sustain the company through what looks to be a big fall-off of demand for their cars. Every liberal in America is trading their Tesla in for a Subaru. This has already happened in several countries in Europe - the bigger ones.\n\nI don't EVER short stocks, but I am expecting a big crash in the Tesla share price if Tesla can't start aggressively rolling out robo-taxis in the fourth quarter of this year, and the roll-out is smooth, and people will actually ride in the taxis enough to make them profitable almost immediately. And acceptance is a question mark, because any crashes will be front page news, and also Elon came out as a right-wing extremist just recently, and there are lots of people who think he is a giant douche now.

Now imagine if they get decimated in the international markets by Chinese EVs, Ford by the end of the decade can lose 50% of their revenue. It will be a much smaller company, locally propped up by tariffs.\n\nLook what’s happening inside China. VW had like 15% market share in ICE vehicles, and they have less than 0.1% share with EVs. VW EVs are a laughing stock inside China (there were many viral TikTok’s on how bad these are compared to domestic options which cost a fraction, look them up. They are a joke). VW has been wiped out in China when it comes to EVs, and 50% of all new vehicles sold in China are EVs. Traditional western companies have less than 0.5% share in this growing segment. \n\nThis will be a repeat of how Nokia etc got wiped out by Chinese handset makers worldwide. Nokia had dominant position and it took only a few years for its international market to go to near 0. \n\nThere is no future for these companies. The Chinese $20k-$25k EVs are better than anything in the west that costs under $50k. There is no competing with that in south east Asia, South America, Africa and South Asia. These western companies can kiss those markets goodbye \n\nThe sheer industrial scale Chinese manufacturers have cannot be beat. The unit cost for them is too low, and their resources supply chains are solid (China owns 80% of world’s graphite producers, China alone has enough battery manufacturing capacity to supply the entire worlds demand). \n\nChina is going all in on making energy cheaper, a key input to manufacturing and something China has been struggling with (China does not have much fossil fuel reserves, imports almost all of its energy). They are building more nuclear reactors than rest of the world combined. The capability added by the end of the decade is equivalent to 50% of the US’s total energy production capacity, across all sources. China is going to add that much capacity in nuclear energy alone. \n\nThere is no competing with this kind of scale.\n\nThese auto makers will be a tiny shell of themselves by the end of the decade.

Automakers have low P/Es because they are a cyclical market.\n\nChinese EVs are a new product coming on the market, but new products have entered before, and automakers managed to adjust to them.  From the Japanese economy cars of the 1970s to the Koreans in 1990, the new products disrupt the market, and the other automakers adapt; these are shocks to the industry, but they don't destroy existing infrastructure.\n\nEVs adoption is slowing; legacy carmakers are introducing their EVs, but they are taking a slow approach, funding development from profits from legacy models, and they will ramp up EV production as demand picks up, but ICE and hybrid models will be the bulk of sales for a long time to come.\n\nFord has been moving away from passenger cars and doubling down on light trucks and SUVs for years.  Their international revenue won't just evaporate because of EVs; most of their market will not have much competition from them.\n\nIt is absurd to claim that 'Chinese $20k-$25k EVs are better than anything in the west that costs under $50k'.  Looking at existing BYD cars, the are running about $10k cheaper than comparable western cars.  BYD and other Chinese automakers will have a market for ultra-cheap cars, but it will be domestically in China, and in southern Asia and other developing countries.\n\nThe fact is that countries are protective of their automakers, and their will be tariffs and other barriers to slow Chinese adoption and give the upper hand to domestic production.\n\nNo, China is not 'making energy cheaper'; energy is a mature market, and their just isn't any magic to bringing prices down.  Nuclear energy is a good option, but all-in it isn't much cheaper than other generation options.  Most of the cost of energy is in its distribution and maintenance of the infrastructure.\n\nEVs are an evolution of carmaking, not a revolution.  It will be a long transition, and their are many applications where ICE vehicles make more sense, and they will continue to have a significant share.  Carmaking is a capital intensive cyclical industry, and we should continue to see car companies address changes as they come, buy the landscape will look remarkably similar in 25 years to what it is today.",

      "body": "I’ve thought the same. There are so many good arguments both for and against legacy auto companies. The fact that it’s SO difficult to even remotely predict who the winners and lose will be likely signals that one should stay away from this industry for a while. Then again, contrarians may see this as a generational opportunity to load up on cheap auto stocks. \n\nThere are so many questions. Sometimes more than there are answers. I think of it like this. From a consumers perspective, are hybrids a solid short term bridge to EV? Will EV be the whole future? Or a combo of EV, ICE and others? If/when will the infrastructure be there to make owning EV realistic for most people? Will they hold/lose their value the way ICE cars do? Will we keep cars longer and replace the batteries? Are maintenance costs going to be higher? Will brand loyalty transfer from ICE to EV? When will tax credits end?\n\nPolitics is a whole wormhole in itself, so I won’t go much into it. But there is the question over what world trade will look like in a potential multi polar world where China and USA go head to head. After WW2, Japan wasn’t a threat to the USA or the west and could sell its cars in these places. Will Chinese companies be able to do the same without serious tariffs and other measures that could remove opportunities for them to replicate what Japan did in western markets. \n\nFrom an investors perspective, there’s a bit of overlap with the questions above. It seems China is undoubtably ahead in the EV race in terms of their supply chains, mineral supplies, battery manufacturing and their overall cost advantage. But it’s also arguably a race to the bottom. Dozens and dozens of new EV companies fighting for market share, many still unprofitable. That can’t go on forever. Consolidation will have to happen at some point. If/when that happens, which purely EV companies will be left standing? Without the cash flows from ICE vehicles to prop them up, which is a luxury legacy autos have and shouldn’t be ignored. Rivian needing that lifeline from VW being a good example. That being said, VW tried to play catch up with their own software division and battery co. Their investments in xpeng and rivian could be seen as a reflection of how difficult it is to catch up to these companies, in terms of their speedy development cycles with xpeng to their tech stack with rivian. Choosing to invest and form these ventures could be a signal that they’re further behind than we think and that catch up may be harder and take longer than we think. \n\nThen there’s an entirely different way of viewing it, which could be that cars as a whole could slowly lose their appeal in more places. Whilst I personally love the independence and freedoms that a car offers in a car friendly nation such as the USA, many nations recognise the importance and benefits of better rail and public transport infrastructure. Cars have advanced. We pack a lot more tech and features into them than we used to, but the reality is they’re getting more and more expensive relative to average incomes. If this trend continues, consumers may change their buying behaviours. They may just turn their back on car ownership entirely. If EV become the dominant cars of the future, there may be other factors that affect how people view cars. The gap between most and least reliable cars may lessen due to the technology having significantly fewer moving parts than ICE. As the tech matures, will people just choose the cheapest thing to do the job, with less emphasis on quality and reliability? Will self driving cars take over and remove the need or desire to own your own car entirely? \n\nThe sensible answer may be to view them as value traps and focus your attention on industries that aren’t facing the kind of disruption that the auto industry is facing.",

Money that can be extracted for mad profits. Right? Wait. Where did all the money go?\n\nLet's zoom out a bit. On one hand, you have so many services that's part of the cost of ownership, repairs, maintenance, insurance, etc. Who are all these middlemen and how did we get here?\n\nWhere is here? An auto company completes a BOM that leads them to source parts from PRIVATE (emphasis here) suppliers. They assemble them in public-owned factories filled with union workers. Somehow, during negotiation, they can't spare much money to union workers because their margins are razor thin. Their profits are nothing because the dealerships take from one end, and costs are high due to suppliers taking from the other end. The very public logo that corporate sits on is profitable, but barely.\n\nThink about it.  \nThey've privatized the profits, and they've socialized the costs. It's beautiful. The boards and owners of the parts and sources, as well as the services are often related and chaired by families of the board members. It's amazing!\n\nDo you own a Tesla by any chance?  \nYou know how Tesla was getting incredible healthy margins?  \nTesla dealerships/showrooms (mostly online)  \nTesla car insurance  \nTesla car repairs  \nTesla internal-sourced parts\n\nIt was never fair. Unions don't realize how they're negotiating a rigged game. Or maybe they do. I'm never really sure.\n\nADDED:  \nI should also not take away from all the very real woes of the industry and individual companies.  \n(1) Many of these brands have self-inflected wounds. Due to the sales practices of their dealership side, and the quality sacrifice of their production side, they've made unsound investments, neglected development, and propagated a poor image of their brand.  \n(2) The entire industry is in a knife fight with other members from other countries. They all complain about subsides but they all have some form of local subsidies everywhere. Somehow, they've made the most complex paperwork machine to burn money through as many hands as possible.  \n(3) Many of these companies have a gambling addiction. They use debt like it is a fashionable thing to do. They load their customers with debt, and somehow they drank their own coolaid and decided to take on a mountain of debt themselves.\n\nLosing a rigged game that's rigged in their favor.
