              "body": "yes but thats the exception, not the rule. In general Nike lost a lot of players and sponsorships. They retained many of the younger athletes, but older ones as well as not the crazy famous ones are now more at other brands.\nJust for example, starting 2026 Nike isnt sponsoring any League balls anymore, they used to sponsor La Liga, Serie A and Premier League at the same time. Lost copa america and copa libertadores too.\nFrom the big Clubs/nations, Mancity, ManUTD, Galatasaray, Portugal all recently changed. Not to forget the upcoming Barcelona change. \nMany athletes switched too, from neymar to ramos, Saka to Kane, Grealish etc. Its more noticeably if you compare it to back in the day. At the 2010 World cup, probably more than half the players wore those silver/Orange Nike boots, now Nike is probably a third.\n\nTheres probably stats for those kinds of things but I am really not talking out of my ass, i think",

They had the NBA uniforms for a while but that’s a thing of the past.  MLB, NBA and NFL uniforms are all Nike/Jordan.  Vast majority of college programs are Nike/Jordan which directly correlates to the on field/court success.  \n\nKansas is the highest paid college from an equipment standpoint, Adidas poached them from Nike by paying 6x the contract value.  Adidas used to have a larger stable of schools but the athletic success wasn’t there.  Michigan football was 46-42 in years 2-8 of their Adidas contract.  Go look up Harbaugh’s record in Ann Arbor, his very first task was to ditch Adidas for Jordan Brand.  Same thing for Baylor football and basketball.\n\nThe point I’m making is OP is looking at senior level soccer **only** through this lens of “Nike losing market share”.  That’s the equivalent of looking at a single ticker’s 1M chart and not looking at the all time chart.  Nike absolutely dominates the sports world in terms of market share.  Let’s not be completely regarded here.",

Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

The Italian Camo 6s were very literally a Nike.com release this past Saturday.\n\nNike doesn’t have current problems their stock price is just coming back to earth since everyone discovered AJ1s during the scamdemic.  Current price is just below the ATH prior to 🌈 lockdowns and The Last Dance.  If anything the stock was inflated off the hype and the fact that Panda Dunks used to be gatekept for fucking $350 now sell below the $115 retail.\n\nCouldn’t give away Kobe 1s a week before his death and they instantly shot to 3x retail after the crash.  New Lebrons sit on the Nike app with deep discounts right now but back when the Kobes sat around the Lebron Watch hype was unable to be contained.  It’s all cyclical and you’re missing the forest for the trees.\n\nAlso, the Kobe specific NCAA programs is only going to fuel the bottom line hype.  Texas is a KD exclusive program and the Kobe line is targeting the Nike blue bloods that aren’t UNC.  Only Kansas is left out in the cold in this regard and as KU alumni who went to school when we were a Jordan program it really fucking chaps my ass to see the Bill Self era be handicapped by a fucking soccer gear sponsorship.",
