We haven't got enough uranium production to meet all of the planned capacity and new mines will take a decade to build. Rising uranium prices will raise all boats in the uranium sector. Much harder to go wrong.\n\nIf you're dead set on operators I would look at the [extensive list of decomissioned reactors](https://www.nei.org/resources/statistics/decommissioning-status-for-shutdown-us-plants) and pick a couple favourites based on risks, capacity, location and decomissioning status rather than investing in every company that has ever touched nuclear.",

Union Pacific had plans for a mine which fell through as a result of the three mile island meltdown and the subsequent crash in the price of uranium. I believe that the company‚Äôs valuation is a legacy of their status as a Niger-based explorer and think there‚Äôs very strong potential for large price movement once they announce results from their upcoming drilling program and bring historical estimates up to modern standards (they also benefit from precise drill targets by leveraging historic data rather than the more luck-based approach that explorers usually take, helping minimize opex and resultant dilution). Morever, given the increased worldwide multipolarity, with Kazakh and Russian uranium supplies seemingly being earmarked for Russian and Chinese energy needs as well as an increase US focus on re-shoring nuclear energy supply chains, I think there‚Äôs lots of potential for M&A for viable deposits within the US.\n\nthere‚Äôs also a lot of potential for them to increase the resource estimate for the canning deposit compared to what union pacific estimated for 2 reasons: first, the historic drilling didn‚Äôt go very deep and ended in mineralization (i.e. deposit kept going below max drill depth) and their measurements also didn‚Äôt distinguish between U grades above 0.25%. myriad‚Äôs just started a drilling campaign to confirm and potentially upgrade the historic estimates\n\nbeyond that, high insider ownership and a decent share structure are confidence-inducing. \n\njust my 2 cents - let me know what you think, always looking for more perspectives especially when it comes to small caps",

AI and all that next gen chip deployments are power hungry hogs and that means more revenue to the power company. Even with a regulated company, that'll mean a larger dividend.\n\nI'm also kinda stupid and confused Duke with Dominion. Dominion provides power to Ashburn. But I expect both Duke and Dominion to be down in the short term because of Helene.\n\nTL:DR I'm expecting increased private investment and revenue for power companies that supply major data center hubs and announced expansions",

TLN with AWS/AMZN for a buildout of up to 960MW data campus (with 120MW already built out 2. CEG and MSFT have announced a partnership that is contingent on CEG starting up a unit at three mile island and alot of other contingencies, which if all come together would start earning CEG money in 2028-29\n\nThis leaves me to believe\n\n1.\t‚Å†Dual-reactors are key to any colocation deal for now , because in single reactor plants  (most of VST nukes) the power is shut off for planned maintenance outages, which makes the co-located data center immediately a ‚Äútaker‚Äù of the utilities power supply (aka the grid) and that strips away most of the benefit to a behind the meter deal between the plant operator and data center tenant\n2.\t‚Å†States matter - Tln was able to do the AMZN deal because their asset located in PA (Susquehanna plant) is a dual reactor which never received any state level subsidies to keep the plant open, compare that to states like IL,OH,NY,NJ, and a few more (where good amount of CEG dual reactors are located, as well as VST single reactors) who were compensated in the form of hourly credits per MWH to make sure the plants didn‚Äôt shut down, these state programs require the plant operator to offer a larger amount of output to the state for years, in that period of time the state would have to grant sign-off on any deal , and lastly the state would need to be incentivized to give up the base-load power they currently have locked in under these subsidy programs\n\nLastly , I am not sure why NRG gets mentioned in this Nuke colocation theme, it is my understanding that NRG sold its last nuclear plant to CEG under pressure from Elliot management and proceeded to take the money and buyback shares , they are clearly riding the wave, long term NRGs model of owning less generation assets while growing the overall amount of power sold to customers seems it can run into problems if power pricing continues in its trajectory. Merely my two cents and definitely not investment advice",

They have the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, a strong leadership team with PhDs, first mover advantage within the NRC application process and have hired on former regulatory staff, reactor technology that was already proven through decades of testing between 1964-1994, unique expertise within uranium recycling, and probably most importantly, partnership commitments driven by a robust commercialization model that is scalable and profitable overtime. This fits well with the future local energy needs of AI data centers.",

Look the price of uranium per pound and you will see the clear trend.\nCameco is your safest bet on that, BHP Billiton is the best miner but has lots of iron/copper which obfuscate the uranium effect. Kazakhstani production is the elephant in the room but I wouldnt dare to touch Russian cronies",
