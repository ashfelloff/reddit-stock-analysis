Even then there’s 10 other factors in calling a play.\n\nHit 542 yesterday and less than five minutes it pumped up 3 dollars, to 545. IMMEDIATELY CRASHED TO 541-540. \n\nBuying against the RSI is safer than buying with the trend. But greed is what crushes you. Not decay\n\nBought 540 puts at open for $15 and sold for $50 right before they went to 1.00+\n\nInversed myself and bought single calls on each bottom I thought it was done with\n\nOn my third call buy is when it spiked and out my 545 ITM, immediately get out. That was a gift not a smart play\n\nIf you look at spy as a whole and it went down $7 with no correction then you start to expect one, but people calling for full V correction are doing so out of desperation for their play. \n\nIf it’s down $7 with no sideways movement I’m buying a $2 correction up call. \nIf it’s down $10, I may be looking for a three dollar correction towards the middle or end of the day\n\nIn any case, you’re just hoping to call the bottom correctly and get out on a better contract price .",
