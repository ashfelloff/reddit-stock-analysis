If you sell enough of them it will happen eventually.\n\nBut you have the long position to counteract the one you sold. So it's still a defined-risk strategy in that you can decide how much you're willing to lose, because during assignment you'll only lose the amount of money between the two strikes.\n\nUnless you're selling American style options and holding them into expiry. In that case, you could potentially be faced with an unhedged assignment of your short position. That's when the GUHs start",
