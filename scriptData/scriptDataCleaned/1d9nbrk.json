The fact that they lost their gains and then some as easily as they did on the AI pump that occurred from HPE earnings is a bad look, IMHO.\n\nEdit: I will however say that this will most likely fail to be \"THE\" top some people are looking for, the S&P has never set what was \"THE\" top in June, and it set a new ATH yesterday and today intraday.",
