Right after I bought, it crashed to $5.5 and kept tanking. Do I wait until Nasa announce the decision of the bigger¬†contract?",

What sounds riskier: \nGambling a stock price will go up by a determined amount before a specified period and having to suffer iv crunch due to the mean reversing nature of volatility OR basically doing normal day/swing trading leveraged? \n\n\n\nYeah you dont own the underlying asset in both cases its not like you degenerates have the money to excercise the options. However cfd is safer if you know what you are doing. Degenerates will say in options you only lose the premium if the trading goes wrong however they still end up thousands of dollars in the red. \nCfd you also lose a \"small\" part because if it goes wrong you get margin called inmediately as to avoid your account blowing up\n\n\nWritten by the european gang",

I always laugh my ass off at this sub.\n\nTrading really is not rocket science or even that difficult, but coming on here to ask if you should sell or hold ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)\n\nYes yes please hold. HODL that bitch or even better, buy more shares, lower your average. Definitely, whatever you do, do NOT cut your losses and invest in a better stock moving more.\n\nThere is absolutely no way that there could be another stock with better odds of making your loss back than the one you‚Äôre currently holding. Those other stocks that are moving 50-300% daily? Yeah don‚Äôt bother with those. Just watch them moon without you while you hold onto your stock that slowly sinks.\n\nNobody else holds onto losing stocks. Everyone else is quickly cutting losses when the price goes in the direction they don‚Äôt expect and they are using their funds to buy into better, more positive moving stocks. That‚Äôs why 95% of traders lose money. They just have wet paper hands. Diamond hands is what you need to make money. Duh",
