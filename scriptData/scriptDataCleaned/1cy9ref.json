I think we are going to see investments decrease from this point on.  I think the AI venture is overblown.  Next quarter we are going to see negative results from tech.  Nvidia will still beat projections but it will be significantly less.  Keep in mind AI is essentially a glorified google search at this point.  The US is missing the boat on the next big thing with all this AI investment.  I think along side everything else in the political climate we are going to see the AI bubble pop similar to the dot com bubble.  This maybe the plan all along to pass along retail investment to financial institutions.  Very few people are thinking like this and I feel it's very important to start to consider these factors alongside many more.\n\nReal life interaction is the next big thing.  People want to be free to socialize like humans, that's what covid taught us.  Very few people want to be stuck inside their little crappy apartments they cannot afford.\n\nPlease prove me wrong.",

The stock itself is down 99 percent since covid.  Huge movie releases coming out this year.  Netflix subscription costs are going up.  Actors strikes are over.  AMC is paying down debt.  AMC is also developing new product.  CAT system being implemented.  Shorts are going to start to close on Friday and continue for the next two weeks.  Just a few reason for the practical investor to get bullish.\n\nIf AMC fails so do 75 percent of malls across the country.  So do retailers like Macy's, Ralph Lauren, etc.  Their are not enough developers to transform 100s of malls into condos across the country.\n\nEntertainment is America's main export and has been for 20 years.  Keep betting against America and get burned.",
