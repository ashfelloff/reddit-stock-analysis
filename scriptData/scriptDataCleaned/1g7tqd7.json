Everyone thinks the stock is currently underpriced at 57€ but I suspect the opposite and I am expecting the coming event will make the price drop.\n\nThinking about shorting the price with put options with a strike in Dec. 20 (European warrants) and 65€ or 55€ strike prices.\n\nWhat are your feelings about this guys ?\n\n",
