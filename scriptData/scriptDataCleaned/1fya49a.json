I sold near the top, bought back in not long after thinking I bought the dip, it wasn’t.\n\nI locked some gains, paid some taxes, but the lions share of that $300k is gone.  It wouldn’t have allowed me to retire, but it certainly would’ve been helpful.\n\nI’m not against stupid plays, practically gambling, but do yourself a favor: pay your taxes, take some cash out for savings, put 80% of what you got left into a solid company you believe in buying shares not on margin, or buy SPY shares.  Then take $20-40k and have fun with that, if you 10x that great, if not then you’re still a better winner than most of us here.",

I bought FXI and BABA as well, they are all in 2-3X gain, however, I decided YOLO into TIGR since it is not even 1 billion market cap (before pump) which means has more upside room to go.
