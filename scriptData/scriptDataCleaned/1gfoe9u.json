  "selftext": "**Midnight** Archer Aviation’s flagship eVTOL aircraft, is set to revolutionize urban air mobility. Designed for quick back-to-back flights, it's optimized for **20-50 mile trips** and can reach speeds up to **150 mph**. It features **12 electric motors and propellers** for redundancy, making it safer and significantly quieter (about **45 dB**) than traditional helicopters.  \n  \nThe company has a **$6 billion backlog of orders**, including significant contracts with **United Airlines** and the **U.S. Air Force** (worth up to **$142 million**), indicating strong market demand.  \n  \nThey're opening a **400,000 sq ft factory in Georgia** by the end of this year, aiming to produce **650 Midnight aircraft annually**, with plans to expand to over **2,300 units per year**.  \n  \nArcher's partnership with **Stellantis** (the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler) brings up to **$400 million** in funding and manufacturing expertise, positioning them well to scale production.  \n  \nThe **FAA recently approved a new category of aircraft** (powered-lift), paving the way for eVTOL operations, which could be a **$1.5 trillion market by 2040**.  \n  \nThe CEO, **Adam Goldstein**, is very transparent on Twitter. They also recently pouched **Billy Nolen**, the former acting FAA Administrator, to speed up certification.  \n  \nFinancially solid, Archer has about **$590 million in cash**, giving them an **18-month runway**. They're targeting profitability with **40-50% gross margins**.\n\n  \nWE FLY IN THIS COUNTRY",
