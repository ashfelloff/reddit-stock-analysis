  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.  \nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.  \n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.  \nSome stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.  \n\nNews: [US Floats Touger Trade Curbs in Chip Crackdown in China](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-17/us-considers-tougher-trade-rules-against-companies-in-chip-crackdown-on-china)\n\nMainly focused on chip companies today.  \n\n**[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d)** - News linked above. Other chip stocks I’m watching: \n**[ASML](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASML&p=d)** (also had earnings premarket), \n**[AMD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d)**, **[LAM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LRCX&p=d)**, \n**[SMCI](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMCI&p=d)**, **[SOXL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d)**/**[SXS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SXS&p=d)** (levered chip ETFs)  \n\n**[INTC](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=INTC&p=d)** - Moving up because it’s a domestic chip company (demand for it is increased for it as a result of reduced competition).  \n\n**[GTLB](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GTLB&p=d)** - Exploring sale.  \n\n**[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d)** - Interestingly had a bit of a bounce from selling off intraday yesterday, still biased negatively. Currently short. EDIT: Got stopped out of my position. \n\n**[FIVE](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FIVE&p=d)** - Named COO as interim CEO. Expects saves for Q2 to be $820M-826M, falls short of revenue expectations of $836.6M. EPS was $.53-.56, missing .63e  \n\nEarnings: **[UAL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UAL&p=d)**  \n\nIPOs: None I’m interested in  ",
