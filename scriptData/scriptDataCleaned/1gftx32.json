I've heard congress members like Nancy Pelosi defend themselves by saying \"This is a free market economy\" but that's a very weak defense. If there's anyone who genuinely supports congress stock trading, please share your reasoning. ",

But one of the things that *sort of* makes sense to me is that it is difficult to decide where to draw a line when it comes to restricting trading. For example, there are career bureaucrats in DC who are privy to the same / similar information that politicians have access to .. but no one is going after their portfolios in the same way. Many of these staffers live in the shadows and some are subjected to the same filing requirements as politicians, but for the most part, we ignore them. If we started to go down this path - that individuals with privileged information should be held to a higher standard - then we could theoretically have a hard time litigating who should and should not have those restrictions apply to them. It's a weak argument for sure, but it does illuminate some of the challenges associated with moving in this direction.",

Congress members have access to privileged, non-public information that can significantly influence market outcomes. This inherent imbalance makes it nearly impossible to ensure that their stock trades are free from the influence of insider knowledge.\n\nGiven that even the appearance of a conflict of interest can undermine public trust, it may be more prudent to prohibit stock trading altogether for Congress members. This would help prevent any potential exploitation of their insider access and reinforce the integrity of their roles as public servants.\n\nWith that in mind, I can't think of any *good* reason why they should be allowed to trade.\n\nOn the other hand, I am open to the idea of increasing compensation for government employees if it will attract higher-tier talent and elevate the quality of public service!",

      "body": "It depends on what your definition of trading stocks is.  There is something called a managed brokerage account in which you deposit money into an account and then specify trading strategies.  For example, you could say you wanted an account that trades only US small cap stocks, but you don't want to be invested in REITs.  Or maybe you want blue chip securities. but object to Wal Mart's labor practices and don't want to own their stock.  So you could have a blue chip ex WMT strategy.  From there, a computer algorithm will take your investment preferences and execute trades that align with your requirements and will rebalance your portfolio on a monthly basis.  Its similar idea to a mutual fund except that its not mutual (you are the only investor) and, to a certain extent, you can customize the holdings.  You could argue that it is the algorithm that is trading the stocks, not you, but thats not how it would be seen from an ownership perspective.  Technically the account holder is still trading the stocks even if the computer is making decisions on your behalf.  (That claim can actually get to be a bit hairy, but not for reasons that are relevant to your inquiry.)  But to your question, I don't see any reason why politicians should be forbidden from trading stocks in this manner provided that the algorithm requires a broad enough selection of stocks.  They wouldn't be directing trades in a way where they could make the algorithm buy too much of a specific stock, particularly if you were to put restrictions in place regarding how often they could change the investment strategy.\n\nBut this is essentially why the wording of your question is important.  I do think politicians should have the freedom to decide what kinds of investment strategies their money is going to be invested in.  Otherwise you run into issues that legal restrictions could be forcing them to invest in securities that they may have moral objections to or may not be appropriate for their retirement strategy.  However, even within that band of freedom, there does need to be some layer between the politician and the specific investment that prevents them from using insider information to direct trades to specific stocks.",

But it’s also true that many of these politicians established portfolios long before they headed down the political track. As citizens they deserve the right to take part in the opportunities available to anyone in this country. There should be some strict guardrails and environments that have to be there while someone is in office. But I wouldn’t just simply say somebody who may have, for instance, a healthy stake of Alphabet, Apple, Exxon, etc. should have to sell out of their cost basis just because they take office. The guardrails should address the OCI and/or ethical issues. If we want to say they cannot buy individual stocks during their period of service, that probably makes sense…restrict them to broad indexes. If I had to give up my existing portfolio to take public office, it would be a disincentive to go that route, even if I feel a strong calling to that service. I think there is a way to address the issues, real or perceived, without overly disincentivizing the decision to serve.",
