  "title": "Update: American consumer credit is tapped out part 2",

  "selftext": "Lady and gentlemen, 2 months ago [I came](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dcghne/american_consumer_credit_is_tapped_out_and_growth/) to you with the most autistic examination of economic data I could muster while only 4 shots in, and ended up drinking my own Kool-aid to the price of a LEAPS put against QQQ at the $480 strike expiring June of 2025. Today, I have an update on the data, the events of the past 2 months, and the position. Please see that topic for a broader explanation of my thesis and reasoning.\n\n**TL;DR**: I thought American consumers were defaulting on credit cards as fast as they were spending, and we were headed into a recession within a year.\n\n# What does the new data say?\n\nThe [G.19](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/current/default.htm) dropped of the 7th with June economic data on the American consumer. Revolving credit is down -1.5% YoY seasonally adjusted, and non-revolving credit is up 3.4%. This seems to confirm that May's increase in revolving credit was a fluke. We can also look at motor vehicle loans and see there was a spike in spending. Since the other part of my \"consumers are tapped out\" thesis was Americans weren't buying cars, what gives? Well two things have happened. First, vehicle interest rates are still quite high, so it's possible that some delinquencies are continuing to pile up interest. Vehicles are generally quick to be repossessed though so take that with a grain of salt and we would expect this to at this point be deflationary. What else is happening is vehicle prices [especially on the used market](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02) are starting to fall back to natural levels. This is bringing their prices more in line with actual demand, which is healthy. However it is also deflationary and thus points to a weakened consumer vs. previous market expectations, as current demand cannot sustain the high prices. The used car market is a canary in the consumer demand coal mine, as all discretionary spending will likely follow. The artificially inflated prices we have seen the past few years will begin to fall off a cliff as consumers are forced to make more and more drastic cuts to their spending in order to keep their heads above water.\n\nThis sentiment is being echoed by weak guidance by Q2 earnings reports based on consumer spending habits. In my last post I predicted a mid Q2 earnings followed by weakened guidance and that appears to be what we're seeing, as the ETF I primarily trade, QQQ, dropped from over $500 at its high to around $430 within the past 2 months. All the pieces are coming together and, if anything, it looks like things are happening faster than I anticipated. I see either a market crash before the election, or a major downward pull followed by a strong run-up then the crash in Q4/Q1 2025. It is my opinion that a bear market is on the horizon, and we've already seen a blip of what might be possible when the tumbling begins, so I'm making final preparations to go whole hog into even more bearish positions.\n\n# Position Update\n\nLast post I updated that I'd purchased a $480 strike put on QQQ for June 2025 for $3,400. I sold this on 08/05 for $5,750 and traded a short put against it in the meantime to lower my basis. Now, except for a QQQ 430/435 08/16 CCS I sold, I'm holding cash and playing earnings, waiting for this green rebound to top out before I reposition into long puts for 2025.",

This spending habit drives growth, which is what companies use when forecasting their quarterly revenues and to give guidance. The weakness in consumer spending especially with regards to discretionary purchases is being reflected in Q3 guidance being tepid this earnings season, which is a big contributing factor to the red we saw last week.\n\n\"I'm genuinely curious if you think there's something coming that can break the normal trend, or if your trying to play a much shorter term downtrend before we go back to nothing but green.\"\n\nI don't know what's going to happen. I'm sitting here looking at the clouds and thinking that's an awful lot of rain coming but I have no idea if it's just a storm or a cat 5 hurricane.\n\nIf I gaze into a crystal ball I see mediocre performance in Q3 and less than stellar guidance for Q4, combined with more geo-political bullshittery, causing the September Bear to come out of the cave hungrier than usual. Then there will probably be a strong rebound with massive green spikes heading into the election, followed by some very jagged back and forth activity that will make the theta gang happy. The \"thing\" I see happening is already kind of starting and that's the job market will get a little worse. And then a little worse. And then a little worse still. And it'll just tip-toe up about a tenth of a percent a month or so until we're in Q1 of 2025 with an unemployment rate just higher than the frictional rate but actually it's double that due to underemployment being rampant and the job statistics sucking thanks to zombie job postings, until Q4 announcements come out that hey, Q4 was pretty OK but Q1 is gonna suck because no one can afford anything and we've had to slash prices on this and that to clear inventory, and the deflationary pendulum swing comes down on the market like the reaper's scythe. Then the hiring freezes start, and the layoffs, and consumer spending will plummet, and even more companies will post bad guidance, and this downward spiral will last most of the year. By the time the bottom is in the unemployment ball will just start to get rolling, causing the market to start rebounding just as the real economy starts to suffer the worst of it.",

This also happens with debt consolidation. This is why transitions are a better metric than levels, because levels actually shrank in the wake of 2008 due to credit cards going so delinquent they were considered write-offs.",
