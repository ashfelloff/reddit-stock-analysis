  "score": 115,
  "selftext": "Since he has 80 million shares that he can't sell for 6 months. Can he sell covered calls at October and later on DJT. He sells 22.5 calls at $12-18 each, If he could sell enough of them, he could cash out 1 Billion now, and if the stock is still worth $20, in six months he cashes out another 1.6 billion.\n\nIf a broker is worried about early assignment because of a huge price increase, he could hedge with buying $115 calls at $1.\n\nLooks like they hint at the broker work around here:  \n \"Trump cannot sell his stock in the company for six months, making it difficult to translate Truth Social's value into liquid cash that can be spent on the campaign,\" Europa Group analysts said in a report. \"That outlook could change over the coming months, particularly if Trump obtains the waiver or can find a lender willing to accept shares in Trump Media as collateral.\"   \n[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-truth-social-djt-stock-down-losses-revenue-going-concern/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-truth-social-djt-stock-down-losses-revenue-going-concern/)  \n\n\n&#x200B;",
