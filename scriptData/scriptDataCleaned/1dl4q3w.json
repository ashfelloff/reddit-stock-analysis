If you were going to do an actual rotation it would be from that really nice profit you have into an index or a lower volatility metric. The small cap rotation would be a good one, they are still undervalued on a historical basis, you might be waiting a little bit so if you're used to those gains that could get you not getting the dopamine hit. Eventually I think small caps are going to work but it's going to be like one of those things where the news media is going to hype them then you're going to have a couple quarters of outperformance then everybody will think they're a good idea. Who knows when that actually happens. You could just go into the s&p 500 which will maintain a lot of that tech exposure since those are the largest companies but you have a lower volatility metric then what you're currently in \n\nThe other thing I'll warn you about Qualcomm is it is a much slower growing company than Nvidia so this rotation you have in mind, maybe it works, maybe it doesn't, I don't really see any odds to shift one way or the other which is why I don't like the trade. Like there's nothing really behind it other than just moving and it's even in the same sector. I think if you're going to rotate out of Nvidia number one I don't think I would rotate out of all of it and number two I would be looking at things like small caps and TLT and so on and so forth which are a completely different asset class.

Whether it continues to rise for 2 more years before it saturates, or 1 more year, or 6 more months, etc. Usually you can see the saturation curve coming if you keep looking at the profit you made. So in one year time we might see that NVIDIA is not rising any more and is more moving sideways. That might be a good time to move your money from NVIDIA to a different stock which does keep rising.\n\nMy main point is that sharp increases or decreases in price are (in my experience) the exception to the rule and stock prices often increase or decrease incrementally giving you enough time (weeks / months) to change from stock.\n\nWhat do you guys think? \n\nMaybe NVIDIA will rise 3X, 5X, 10X, but this will all be in the span of months and years.
