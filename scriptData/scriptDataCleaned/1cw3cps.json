I like under Armour as competition for the  Nike/adidas as I'm not a huge fan of puma or Reebok.  All in all I think Nike's MAP pricing policies across their retailers has been a huge setback for the consumer as these other companies try and keep similar pricing.  These companies don't want to see their product discounted hense max 20% sales outside of their outlet lines.  Other companies try and maintain similar price to not be seen as a lesser Brand. As consumers we know the product doesn't cost that much to make ($60cdn for a pair of men's shorts!?) I hope under Armour can turn it around and get their style and pricing on track.",
