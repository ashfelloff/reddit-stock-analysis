Not to say that Q4 has never disappointed but it's always the biggest quarter and the odds of the company doing better than expected are decent. \n\nI still own some NFLX from years ago (bought in the $300-$350 range). I'm waiting for it to cross the $700 mark before selling. I believe there is still upside. They're currently doing better than their competitors. Also their technology is superior. On almost all the devices I use, the Netflix app is faster and easier to use than its competitors. Some, like Paramount+ are criminally slow. Others, like Prime Video have a UI designed in the 9th circle of hell. Also Netflix doesn't show ads for their shows before you start a movie or an episode. Max does and that pisses me off, especially when I get served a trailer for something I've already watched. They know. They should be able to filter those out.",
