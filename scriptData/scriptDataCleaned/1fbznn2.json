This new post needed for table markdown.\n\nMy simulation (python and EODHD) shows that over the last 10 years or 4 years, returns are 6% per year with 58% time in the market, so effective rate 10%. Not as far off S&P500 than I expected, though a long way off the 29% promised.\n\nThere's much discussion about the sim benefiting from survivor bias by picking today's eventual winners. My guess was the bias boosts simulated returns, but others disagreed, so I checked it here [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fcwt9k/i\\_cracked\\_the\\_code\\_part\\_2/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1fcwt9k/i_cracked_the_code_part_2/)\n\nHere's a [10 year simulation](https://postimg.cc/cKhfGh2S) and extract of a \\~4 year sim table in case anyone wants to check a few trades. It's difficult to go older than 10 years due to lack of data in the API I use.\n\n|Date \\\\ $|NESN.SW|MDLZ|HSY|GIS|KHC|Subtotal|Cumulative gain|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020-03-17|1,000|1,000|1,000|1,000|1,000|5,000|0%|\n|2020-03-18|1,000|1,000|1,000|1,103|1,000|5,103|2%|\n|2020-04-23|1,000|1,000|855|1,103|1,000|4,958|-1%|\n|2020-04-28|1,000|1,001|855|1,103|1,000|4,958|-1%|\n|2020-04-30|1,000|1,001|855|1,103|1,512|5,470|9%|\n|2020-07-01|1,000|1,001|855|1,196|1,512|5,563|11%|\n|...||||||||\n|2024-05-01|1,000|1,426|1,438|1,132|1,751|6,746|35%|\n|2024-05-03|1,000|1,426|1,489|1,132|1,751|6,797|36%|\n|2024-06-26|1,000|1,426|1,489|1,035|1,751|6,700|34%|\n|2024-07-30|1,000|1,461|1,489|1,035|1,751|6,735|35%|\n|2024-07-31|1,000|1,461|1,489|1,035|1,783|6,767|35%|\n|2024-08-01|1,000|1,461|1,427|1,035|1,783|6,706|34%|\n|2024-09-06|933|1,461|1,474|1,239|1,804|6,911|38%|\n\n\\[edit\\] Loads of edits and additions from people's comments.",
