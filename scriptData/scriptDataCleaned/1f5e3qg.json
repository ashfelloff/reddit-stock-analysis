      "body": "From personal experience. I loved Lululemon back then, but eventually moved onto other brands. I think the shift to other brands is due to the rise of fitspo influencers on Instagram. For example, Whitney Simmons and her brand deals with Gymshark made Gymshark popular. Back in 2017, Gymshark leggings were always sold out as soon as they released. Today, you have several brands such as Gymshark, Alphalete, Buff Bunny, and P’tula that focus on gym wear, athleisure and loungewear that are probably more aesthetically pleasing. They cater to gym rats who love hip thrusts and the smith machine. They have leggings where the seam goes up your buttcrack so your butt looks bigger. \n\nI think Lululemon should have focused on brand deals back in 2020. Aligns will always be a favorite for some, but that’s all. I do love their “all the right places” for outdoor runs.",

I have very different observations from you… as well, I would never use my visits to make investment decisions  knowing there’s so much variance in what I see, versus what’s actually going on. The three stores by me are always crowded, have heavy men’s presence, and are packed despite competitors (Vuori, Alo, Atleta) moving literally next door. There’s also an increase of lower income desiring the brand\n\nBulletin 6 is valid though. Lululemon has already [stated](https://fortune.com/2024/01/03/lululemons-founder-chip-wilson-diversity-and-inclusion/) they need to focus on being unique and focusing on core demographic, so we’ll see how that goes",
