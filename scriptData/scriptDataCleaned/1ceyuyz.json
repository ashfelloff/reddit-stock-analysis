  "selftext": "Why did the market rally on the previous Friday even though we had a very crap PCE data? This just confirms that rate cuts are likely to be just once this year and maybe even off the table for 2024. Sometimes market makes no sense and it's scary. I don't think that PCE was priced in, can anyone tell me what is going on lol",

After amazon reports, hopefully, the market pops, then go short with sqqq or sdow.  The big guys will lift the market. \n\nVolatility is extremely high when these big corporations report.  The PCE data will matter when the clowns at CNBC(media) say it matters and start doing every other story on it and inflation concerns rise again.   Just watch them for early alerting on market shifts in direction.  If they keep reporting the same stories, then buy or sell in that direction.   The inflation story isn't hot yet as they  completely ignored PCE numbers after they pumped how important it was most of they week.\n\nRight now, they've been pushing energy very hard with every guest and host showing how bullish it still is.  Saying that even with run up, you should buy.  Which means on next pullback, buy some ExxonMobil or something.   In the last 9 months, it's been AI all day every day, so you should have definitely purchased nvidia last yr.\n\nHow does CNBC know?  They don't.   They basically parrot what's fed down to them by the largest hedge funds and trading firms who pay their bills.  Their ads pay their salaries.  The firms paying the most get their ideas pushed. Most of these firms lack any integrity.   Yahoo finance, mootly fool, cnbc, fox business(a bit loony fore)...cnbc...etc.  bloomberg and ft probably are the only ones that look at data on their own.",
