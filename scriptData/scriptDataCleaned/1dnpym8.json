  "score": 67,
  "selftext": "So I made [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dl1jco/nvda_easy_hold_yolo_update_140k/) post after last week's dip about holding NVDA leaps after \\~30k intra-day drop on Thursday from $172k to $140k.\n\nI knew the gheys would be out and about in full force especially after today.  Sure enough, I get out of work and see there already are some unhinged DMs/comments waiting, or asking for an update.\n\nI sold none of them, and in fact added a couple more Nov '24 leaps during lunch today.\n\nI've already made \\~10 posts at this point over various NVDA news/announcements in the past quarter, along with DD posts on the progression of this YOLO that started from \\~$38k, went to as high as $172k and is now down to $105k.\n\nI'm not repeating all that again, or listing more objective reasons simply because there's been no fundamental reason driving this sell-off other than:\n\na) profit-taking\n\nb) quarterly-end rebalancing\n\nc) sell the news factor after NVDA briefly toppled MSFT\n\nAll I'm gonna say is - Blackwell revenues for this year are going to be nuts, and it'll become clear in the next earnings call. If there ever was a time to load up on the dip (and I mean either leaps, or shares -- not regarded weeklies), it'd be now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4bvefivoel8d1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=e79c7a4382f20a69fb58a22be7ab147a1544bb89",

I do have 2 calls for July at 130 which probably arent gonna hit at this rate, all the rest of my calls are for september - december. 140 and 150 is the bulk and have a few december 180 as “what ifs”.

I still like nvda overall, but the +45% in 1 month had me nervous of the short term stability of the stock price and still does.

Buying calls is a good strategy but I sure as fuck wouldn’t do it now. They might go up this week but they’re going down in July and you could have gotten a way better entry. \n\nBut I’m sure you’ve been trading for a year or two and think you’re an expert. It’s amazing the complacency in traders that haven’t been through a bear market and seem to think those markets are predictable. \n\nBut good luck to you, buying calls on an overbought stock at the end of a bull run.
