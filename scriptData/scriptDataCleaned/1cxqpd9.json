This is my first post on this channel!\n\n In last 2 years I have made some stupid decisions with options trading like betting against the market flow or double down, revenge trade etc  and I have finally landed up here. Did learn few things but too late‚Ä¶\nI have lost all my savings that I had which sucks and with an unseen event coming up I definitely need to make up something to take care of it.\nI know many ppl might make fun and have nasty comments but it‚Äôs ok I am here actually looking for help if someone with better understanding and experience can help/guide me in correct direction with the options and help me get some of it back.\nThank you so much fellow traders! üôèüèª",

Praying is gambling. \n\nIf 5-10% isn't enough for you but have no problem not using a stop loss and watching your position collapse, you deserve to lose everything. If you can't compound 5-10% and be happy over time, that's why you'll fail like most others. \n\nTwo years of consistent gains to watch it all disappear in five days indicates you don't understand the value of a dollar and it's for that very reason you'll consciously watch your position go from an all time high to a flatline low without having a shred of care. \n\nSad to see how many of you are in this game just throwing money around like our economy is strong lol",
