  "selftext": "Donald Trump set to receive $1.25 billion worth of Trump Media stock in DJT earnout bonus.\n\nTrump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.\nApril 22,2024\n\nhttps://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday — an “earnout” bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday’s price.\n\nThat earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.\n\nTuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.\n\nThe 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company’s majority shareholder.\nTotal of 114.75 million shares.\n\nWhen the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump’s total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.\n\nThe merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.\n\nThat price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.\n\n52 week high of $79.38\nwas on Tuesday,March 26,2024.\nFirst day of trading under new name and stock symbol.\n\n52 week low $12.40\n\nThe greatest show on Earth.\n\nSo let’s look back a little to understand more.\n\nTrump Media stock jumps as much as 50% after DJT ticker debut,\nTuesday,March 26,2024\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/26/trump-media-stock-ticker-djt-debuts-after-dwac-merger.html\n \nThis stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.\nObviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.\n\nPlan accordingly.\nI wouldn’t be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.\n\nTrump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.\n\nWhat are your ideas regards.",

Thanks to propaganda and lobbying, they have not only convinced congressman but enough American people that they shouldn't pay taxes at all. Their companies all get government incentives and tax breaks while they off shore bank and line their pockets. There's a reason why almost every congressman is rich, it's because either they were rich already and wanted to help make laws to help themselves or they got paid off by the rich to help make those laws to help the 1%. Trump is in on it and always has been, hence why he gets away with paying less in taxes than a fucking part time worker.
