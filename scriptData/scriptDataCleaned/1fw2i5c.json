                          "body": "In Ubisoft's case, they're more a victim of their own creativity deficit and poor business choices, which have plagued their games for some time, but with one timely caveat. \n\nUbisoft has squandered or is in the process of squandering all their major franchises and even some standalone titles, which is largely due to repackaging the same basic formula repeatedly and acting like it's new, i.e. failing to innovate. Ubisoft's particular open-world formula they first pioneered with Assassin's Creed, has been recycled into Far Cry, Watch Dogs, The Division, Ghost Recon, Skull & Bones, and most recently Star Wars Outlaws. Combine this apparent unoriginality with predatory business practices like a litany of micro-transactions & season passes, release your \"AAAA\" (lol) feeling unpolished and riddled with bugs, and try to force PC players to use your shitty launcher instead of the gold standard that is Steam, and you have a recipe for disaster.  \n  \nHowever, their two most recent entries that \"did not meet expectations,\" which is corporate speak for being financial failures compared to the time and money invested, have been the most impactful. These would be Skull & Bones, which they hubristically touted as a new classification of a quadruple A game, which amounted to a worse iteration of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, which released a decade prior, and SW Outlaws, which they internally believed would be their own Red Dead Redemption 2 in space. Unfortunately for them, a Rockstar title it was not, and quickly fizzled out after releasing in a buggy state that caused many to not even bother attempting to get past the early game. As an aside, DEI compliance did play into their design of the game's protagonist, but that is not why the game flopped. It's even sold a million copies, but that is little comfort given the budget and faith they allotted to it.\n\nThe one timely caveat I initially mentioned regarding Ubisoft's DEI troubles is found in their choice of one protagonist in the delayed and unreleased Assassin's Creed Shadows. The game takes place in feudal Japan, a setting that naturally lends itself to AC mechanics and has been a longtime popular request of the series’ fanbase.   \n  \nDrawing inspiration from the dubious work of the now discredited Thomas Lockley, a British professor at Nihon University in Tokyo, Ubisoft chose to make their most advertised protagonist a fictionalized African samurai loosely based on the historical figure, Yasuke. There's a lot of backstory related to Lockley propping up this man as something he was not, including embellishing colorful claims in his English book on the topic (that he continually cited on his numerous Wiki contributions to Yasuke's page) not supported by real historical scholarship he published in Japanese, which allowed his revisionist history to go unnoticed by his Japanese colleagues and university before it blew up due to the attention AC Shadows received, resulting in his program being eliminated.\n\nAs one might imagine, many native Japanese have caught wind of this by now and are none too pleased to see their history and culture misrepresented considering there is no shortage of real Japanese samurai who could have been chosen instead. Granted, parading Yasuke, who’s at most a *bushi*, not an actual feudal samurai warrior, isn’t their only gripe with Ubisoft’s apparent disrespect for the Japanese people and their culture, as there are plenty of other slights resulting from laziness and incompetence like not understanding the appropriate seasons tied to things like rice farming and cherry blossoms blooming, mistakenly using Chinese assets instead of Japanese ones, ripping off the symbol of a modern reenactment troupe, and even initially releasing the Japanese trailer with Chinese subtitles. It's worth noting that Yasuke is the first AC protagonist ever based on a real historical figure, and he's the first to not appropriately match the demographics of the period and place. Interestingly, we do not have enough evidence about Yasuke, not even his given name, to definitely say too much about him, but he arrived in Japan under the liege of Jesuit priests and was possibly a Moorish infidel, i.e. Muslim, so the further liberties Ubisoft has taken to allegedly provide bisexual relationship choices provide more evidence that DEI platitudes take precedence over respect for historical and cultural context.  \n  \n*\\*****Warning, Rumors:*** Ubisoft insiders have claimed that the game was originally being designed to feature a Japanese samurai, but the decision to race swap him was made in the wake of the BLM riots, and this racial pandering to one group by offending the native population is clearly tarnished by appeasing DEI goals. Assassin's Creed now stands alone as Ubisoft's most important product. If Shadows fails, then it could be the last mistake they ever make before being restructured, taken over, or divided up and sold off. In this sense, you are right that Ubisoft finds itself in this precarious position because of being a garbage company, but DEI compromises in their product, saying nothing of their employment demographics, could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.",

It's even sold a million copies, but that is little comfort given the budget and faith they allotted to it.\n\nwhat is the DEI compliance? That she is a woman? This is just gamergate shit man and you aren't going to convince me that Ubi making a woman lead is 'DEI'. They're half our population, if having a gendered protagonist is DEI so are all the other AC's for having a gendered lead character. Is it because you/others, if we are talking in general terms, didn't view her as hot enough to fuck? If so, do you think women who game (and yes, they are real) get to call every ugly male protagonist a DEI protogonist as they secretely represent the over-weight basement dwellers who flock to video games for a feeling of happiness? Like what are we hoping to accomplish with this line of thought? To just be shitty to the other gender? Its not that I don't understand the concept but it feels like a race to the bottom. Both women and men play video games, I think it is very normal for some games to have protagonists without exaggerated sex characteristics. \n\nI don't want to see Cloud in FF7 swinging around a fucking 12\" python while sporting grey sweatpants, I am guessing women don't want to play as some DDD woman dressed in an exceptionally provocative manner. I think the idea of a middle ground is fine especially when games like Stellar Blade do still exist.\n\n>In this sense, you are right that Ubisoft finds itself in this precarious position because of being a garbage company, but DEI compromises in their product, saying nothing of their employment demographics, could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\n\nNot going to argue with you because these are subjective opinions but I do want to reiterate something - the 'DEI' aspect is not why Ubisoft is failing. That is what everyone in this thread is talking about and it just isn't true. If they made good games no one would care about 'DEI' (Gay ass BG3, Sexless Elden Ring, Lesbian fucking lead in TLOU2). Ubisoft is failing because they haven't changed their formula in a decade, not because they are using a fictional black man as a lead protagonist. I will absolutely give Japanese people, or honestly anyone from SE Asia, a pass if they are upset they cannot play as a Japanese man. I understand that general idea even if I don't necessarily feel the same way (im a ginger, we get race swapped for black people or women constantly so maybe I'm just used to it). I think this is legitimate but only when the affected group airs the grievance otherwise, it feels fairly performative.\n\nSo if the argument is that they'll fail even harder then we agree, and i think that is the case.\n\nBut empolyment demographrics is kinda bull shit from where I am sitting. BG3 was made by the gayest fucking group of programmers ever in the triple A space and it crushed. Why? Because the game is good. There is no such thing as 'employment' demographics, there are good teams and bad teams. Good leaders build good teams - Ubisoft has awful leadership. That is why we are here today, not because they employ women. It feels like workers are being blamed (the women programmers, black programmers, Asian programmers, gay programmers, etc) vs the awful fucking management that is attempting to broaden appeal via social commentary while refusing to make better games.\n\nI agree that this is pandering, my anger is just at shitty game directors not employees.",

(I'm old enough to remember when the downvote button was supposed to mean \"does not contribute,\" instead of \"I disagree/don't like what you're saying.\")\n\nI don't think it's fair to relegate the criticism of the choice to unfounded conspiracies, and but there is a good reason it invokes reminders of the gamergate controversy. Yes, women are half the population, but they are not half the gaming population, so if there was an attempt to appeal to as many players as possible, then I do not believe it makes much business sense. Regardless, I also don't care nor have a problem with playing as a set female character, and there are plenty of examples of this being executed well. What I was referring to regarding the DEI influence on the character is actually a more subtle design choice, but one that is a pervasive theme throughout modern Western gaming, which is making female characters more plain, perhaps more masculine, or at least less feminine, and generally less objectively attractive, which is justified to be \"more inclusive\" (as if attractive women do not exist). I'm not looking for a video game waifu, but I do find the motives behind these choices interesting nonetheless.\n\nThere are numerous examples of this occurring across the industry, including making Abby from  TLOU Part II a distinctively mannish body, Aloy's changes between Horizon Zero Dawn and Forbidden West, Mary Jane's strikingly noticeable redesign in Spider-Man 2, the \"nerfing\" of female avatars in Pokemon Go that flattened their hips and waists and overall 'uglier' according to many of its players. Similarly, there's been the change of character creators from male and female to the pointlessly vague substitutes of 'body type 1' and 'body type 2.' These kinds of changes were the ones I was referring to regarding SW Outlaws' protagonist. Although she was based on a real actress, certain unfavorable alterations were made to the character to tip the scales towards inclusivity.\n\nThis goes beyond gaming, but personally, I take issue with historical characters being race-swapped when it serves no other purpose than DEI/representation, which is far more pervasive in film and television. I don't really care about fictional stories as much, but AC Shadows is problematic because of the historical setting and its departure from all previous entries. \n\nPerhaps I should have phrased it differently, but I meant to clarify to literally say nothing of the employment demographics, because I was only intending to comment on the way that DEI ideas have altered their products, not the people who make them.",

I probably just disagree as I fundamentally see these spaces as becoming increasingly more reflective of the real world as time goes on. Like basically zero women in ttrpgs forty years ago to today where, while they're still a minority, it's in the ball park of 25-40% in the US at least. Maybe it'll always be a minority, and that's fine we shouldn't fight for people to care about a topic like gaming, but I think it's important everyone gets to partake in the genre if they want to. If that means less waifus in gaming, or the alternative of more himbo men, I personally see that as more gain than lost. Gamings cool, the more people who are interested means the more games. Also means more diversity which means there are going to be games that do shoot to satisfy this larger audience. But games for just men will always exist lol, stellar blade being a prime example given it just got a boob physics update. Just my opinion, not trying to saying yours is wrong or anything like that.\n\nThe AC stuff makes more sense. I see the AC shadows critique and it does come across as more offensive given their aiming for historical accuracy with this one. I'm from a Western country so maybe Im just already acclimated to some of it haha. Appreciate the conversation, have a good one.",

People hate the company and the decision that ruined the games, not the IP itself. But Tencent is pretty fucking anti-consumer and also love forcing their in-house kernel level anti cheat onto games they make, I'd rather someone else acquire it instead. France government might block it though, Ubisoft is considered the nation's gaming publisher and AC is regularly cited as if it's some sort of important France cultural item",

How does it make me racist… if I feel like a Chinese Govt backed Data Collection company, that injects Kernal lvl spyware into our PCs, wants to invest more into Ubi? & I don’t like the idea of that\n\nHow does it make me racist that I don’t support politically motivated DEI initiatives that are there to just “show” they have DEI while behind closed doors they don’t really believe in it or practice it?\n\nWhy is it racist if I don’t support politically motivated Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion during the writing process of videogames?\n\nDEI in itself is fine and is great for managers in the workplace. I would argue that ALL managers should study psychology. (DEI includes psychology, sociology, etc etc)\n\nBut when you’re creating artistic pieces and appealing to politics by making DEI about just checking boxes that say “look we are doing diversity” while not even actually practicing that in the work place is like such a stupid thing and we all know it. \n\nWe all know that they’re churning out shit pieces to appeal to investors and look like they’re doing something good when they’re not. Especially in this case where they try to force that narrative, and include bullshit micro transactions in the back. \n\nI mean it’s fine if a Chinese company wants to make good games, but unfortunately politics is in even our most precious of things including cultural videogames. \n\nBut it’s like ever since micro transactions have been created, Pandora’s box has been opened and can never be closed. Investors/CFOs don’t really care about gamers, their bottom line is just money. \n\nSo like some part of me just feels like almost every major game company should be shorted and fall.
