  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "230 was my target sell point, however having held since April I'm skeptical as to whether or not they will beat earnings. With sales up 40% YOY in China at a cost of a 20% discount and only a 17% upgrade rate among Apple users for their satellite and AI upgrades I feel like things are pretty volatile. They've beaten expectations the last 4 quarters and these expectations don't seem too high. Plus with 2025 being the year most have faith they will skyrocket I feel like if they do beat these earnings that will be the catalyst for full faith hype kinda like Nvidia. Bullish signals for sure, and it seems like CPI data anticipation isn't really affecting the stock like others that have stagnated this week. 4 trillion by the end of the year possible?",
