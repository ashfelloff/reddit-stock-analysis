  "title": "Talking about $INTC Takeover Rumors and Apollo Deal",
  "score": 80,
  "selftext": "Let’s talk about the rumors: Qualcomm potentially taking over Intel, and the investment from Apollo. First, the Qualcomm takeover—it’s super unlikely. A takeover is usually either a cash buyout or a merger.\n\nNo way Qualcomm goes for a cash buyout. They don’t have that kind of cash lying around, and there’s no chance they’re gonna take on massive debt just to buy Intel. Intel isn’t exactly rolling in profits right now, so taking on that debt would just hurt Qualcomm in the long run with all the interest payments and losses they'd have to deal with from Intel. So yeah, not happening.\n\nA merger seems a bit more possible, but here’s the thing: Qualcomm is already crushing it in AI chips for phones and probably gonna lead the AI PC game too. What do they really get from merging with Intel? The foundry business is the only thing that might attract them, but the price could be steep. Qualcomm would have to deal with Intel’s losses and those from its subsidiaries. Plus, Intel’s board and shareholders wouldn’t agree to a lowball offer. And if Qualcomm offers a premium just for the foundry, I’m not sure their board or shareholders would sign off either.\n\nSo yeah, a merger? Not likely. Best case, Qualcomm ends up being a big customer for Intel’s foundry business when they spin it off.\n\nAs for the Apollo deal, that seems more legit, but $5 billion isn’t gonna move the needle much for Intel. It might cover one or two quarters of cash burn, but the downside is a likely unsexy valuation and heavy dilution for shareholders. Intel needs the money, so it’ll probably happen, but it’s definitely not great news for shareholders—definitely not the bullish one.\n\n",

It's a chicken and egg problem for WoA (not something Apple had to worry about since they control the whole Mac ecosystem).\n\nAll it takes is one app/driver/game not working and the hypothetical Nvidia/ARM laptop goes back to the store.",

Intel getting sold off in a large chunk or completely is 0% chance of happening.

It means you couldn't get funding from anyone legit so you're turning to the people who want you to work the corner to pay it back.\n\nNone of this is bullish for Intel.  Plus I'm hearing in roadmap meetings the word \"value\" a lot which doesn't mean there's any hope of gross margins improving.
