  "selftext": "You may be wondering how the hell I lost money on the play of a lifetime. I bought 100 167.5P when the contracts were going for .35, costing a total of 3.5k for the position. These contracts were trading for 7.00 only one hour after I entered, meaning my 3.5k position was worth 70k. This 20 bagger will haunt me.\n\nThe strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you‚Äôve been following Tesla‚Äôs dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to \n35k.\n\nOne problem: I sold only 10 minutes after opening my position for a small loss of 500$. Why you ask? I‚Äôm a paper handed bitch who loses conviction in my own plays. Roast me",
