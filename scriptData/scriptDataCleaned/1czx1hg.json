The CDC reported the worker had mild eye symptoms and has recovered. Officials emphasize the low risk to the public with no human-to-human transmission observed. Bird flu has been detected in 52 herds across nine states. **The US is in discussions with Moderna and Pfizer about developing avian flu vaccines.** The infection highlights the importance of personal protective equipment for those handling sick livestock.",
