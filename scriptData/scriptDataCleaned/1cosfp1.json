The fact that each position are small in the context of my entire balance, makes it easier psychologically to hold through some inevitable drops.\n\nFor example, my most recent play was ENB, i started 3 positions when the stock was 48, i saw the chart showing some really nice potentials for a breakout, then the stock failed to break and dropped to 45; luckily my options exp were May 17th and June, so i had time to wait it out.\n\nI also know that the exp is after earning date AND ex-div date, then when stock reached previous low, and i saw heavy volume on the bounce (double bottom), i quickly doubled down, in the end my positions totals 14k canadian dollars, the stock rallied hard before earning, and i sold everything this Wednesday, 2 days before the earning date. My total proceeds were around 60k, i left around 20k on the table due to timing of the exit.",
