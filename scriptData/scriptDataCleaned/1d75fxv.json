  "selftext": "Edit - Well damn. EPS and revenue beat but guidance is king these days. Holding onto the calls at this point in case a miracle happens but counting the full 8k as a loss. Only down 1.7k on shares so far but if it does the same thing it has done the last 3 quarters, it will rebound to new highs so not too worried. Congratulations to all the Bears and better luck next time to all the Bulls with me.\n\nI believe BBWI is going to crush earnings based on 5 months of store stalking and no one is talking about it. Literally not one mention about earnings on wallstreetbets. TLDR at the end.\n\n**Background:**\n\nI have been on paternity leave for a little over 5 months now. I live 20 minutes away from 3 different malls and thought I walking around them for an hour or two every day would be a great way to kill some time while also letting my newborn see new things. Around the same time I watched a video on how a Chinese coffee shop got outed for fake financials by people literally watching the store and counting the number of people buying things. That gave me the idea to track how many people were in stores and how many shopping bags I saw around the mall from each store indicating a purchase. Obviously there is a major difference between dozens of people watching stores vs just little old me but the data I gathered has been spot on for earning beats on what I considered to be outliers. The stores that have surprised me with their high volume are Gap, Abercrombie & Fitch, Urban Outfitters, Sephora, and of course Bath and Body Works.\n\n**Method:**\n\nAll in all I have 124 days worth of data so far. I usually only visit one mall a day but sometimes two. Any day of the week and usually between 12pm and 5pm. I try and park at different entrances so I don’t get biased in my counting of bags because I park right next to one store or another. I go to three different malls each catering to a different economic class. Pretty much lower, middle, and high income. I do 2 passes, about and hour apart, of each store I am tracking. I count the number of customers in the store. While I walk around, I also count the number of bags I see from each store. This is a bit harder to trust though as people with multiple bags usually condense into one. So stores with small bags (looking at you Sephora) are underrepresented. I would occasionally go into BBWI and count the items in people carts too but only did this a handful of times.\n\n**Data:**\n\nThe average number of people I have seen at BBWI is 9.82 on weekdays and 23.68 on weekends. This crushes the average from all the stores I tracked which was 2.98 on weekdays and 8.2 on weekends. The only store with a higher average was Sephora which was 10.36 and 25.25 respectfully. All three malls had similar numbers with the higher income mall being slightly higher but not enough to note. I think this was due to young girls traveling in packs of 3 or 4 which I didn’t see at the other two malls.\n\nThe average number of bags (aka purchases) for BBWI was 4.1 on weekdays and 11.67 on weekends. Which again crushes the average of just 1.45 and 3.11.\n\nFor some context here are pictures of the check out line Saturday 30 minutes apart. Wanted to hide people because I think it is rude for a random stranger to snap pictures of people and post them online. There are currently multiple tellers checking out customers with 5 more people in line.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j7utbegx6d4d1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=66905e26bba9ebd5134ef3e817efaaf26b45b8cc\n\n30 minutes later and still 5 people in line\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dbjon4ep6d4d1.png?width=1493&format=png&auto=webp&s=3ce85d8724ee99cd47b3e79a3b0bbaa7112b79bc\n\n**Other Things to Note**\n\n**Male Skin Care** \\- Something I didn’t track, but surprised me, was the number of males in the store alone or with another guy (this goes for Sephora as well). Doing a bit of research on the topic of men's skin care shows a 6.2% year over year growth and a 389% increase in TikTok videos on the subject in the last year. I think it is actually going to be higher based on what I am seeing at the stores and Gen Z starting to come into their own money. That generation has pushed the needle on male beauty standards much more towards the feminine astatic (think Timothee, Lil Nas X, Brady Potter, Jungkook) and with that comes skincare. This is a huge expanding market that is just getting tapped into and based on what I am seeing in person they are capturing the market well.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cnqrxy5s6d4d1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b67bd389c4be5640f80f193f0e128ce3ba71d4e1\n\n**Dupe Culture** \\- This has been on the rise over the last year but it is starting to snowball now. Gen Z and Millennials are finally starting to push back on the, “buy the brand not the product” mentality. This was evident with E.L.F.s recent earning report and will be echoed in BBWI. Their house products have been praised for matching much more expensive fragrances. Paulreactss is one of the most popular fragrance TikTokers with 1.5 million subscribers and he has videos identifying BBWI scents that dupe much more expensive variations. Seriously just google Bath and Body Works dupes and you will see tons of people gushing about what BBWI has to offer and people saying they bought tons of their new product line that came out in the end of Q1.\n\n**Subreddit** \\- The Bath and Body Works subreddit has 86k subscribers. Just yesterday there is a post from an associate saying they are flooded with orders from their summer sales and people are buying literally entire lots of items. [https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from\\_an\\_associate\\_to\\_customers\\_we\\_love\\_you\\_but/](https://www.reddit.com/r/bathandbodyworks/comments/1d6t0dr/from_an_associate_to_customers_we_love_you_but/)\n\nNotable quotes from the thread:  \n\"It’s just been the second day of SAS and already we’ve gotten over 100+ BOPIS orders placed\"  \n\"...and bringing in 2 or more baskets of items is just not only exhausting but also unfair to the other customers who would’ve wanted to get certain products but now can’t because someone else decided to buy all 10 sprays that were JUST put out...\"  \n\"Yep I felt so bad for my friends because everytime they went on break or even took a second to look away from the bopis, the number would go back to 99+\"\n\n**TLDR** \\- I have been to a Bath and Body Works over 250 times in the last 5 months to count the number of customers in the store. It has crushed my expectations. This coupled with male skin care rising and dupe brands like E.L.F. crushing earnings leads me to believe BBWI is going to kill earnings.\n\nPosition - 20k in stock and 8k in various calls expiring this week and next week.",

Tons of things are 50-75% off.  Other products that normally sell for $12-14 are on $3.99 specials.   Happens every year for the last 20 years.   \n\n Traffic over May is due to Mother’s Day crazy sale.  In May, they send out hard copy coupons via mail for free full size $16 item and 20% off purchase to get you in the store.  This isn’t even including their online deals.  They send us addicts free coupons in mail and via email each month, and also have insane sales at certain points of year (you should see what happens Black Friday).   \n\n Also, they have a rewards program, and every so many purchases, you build points for free full size products.  Also, since the dawn of time, it’s buy two, get one free, and buy three, get three free items.   You should have walked inside store and looked at these things and maybe asked a staff member what is up.  It’s honestly been slow in my bath and body locations near me (in physical stores) compared to prior years when I have been in there cashing in my free product coupons.  \n\n Just actually got another mailer for June .. free gift and percentage off again.  But  anyways, I love the place.  Sure, buy the stock.  Just chiming in to say as a fan since like 1999, nothing you are describing is anything even remotely new, and there is very clear reasons for certain foot traffic on certain days.  ",
