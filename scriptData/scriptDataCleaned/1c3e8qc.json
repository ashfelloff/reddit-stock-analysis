We show that the lows in US consumer sentiment \nthat cannot be explained by unemployment and official inflation are strongly correlated with \nborrowing costs and consumer credit supply. Concerns over borrowing costs, which have \nhistorically tracked the cost of money, are at their highest levels since the Volcker-era. We then \ndevelop alternative measures of inflation that include borrowing costs and can account for almost \nthree quarters of the gap in US consumer sentiment in 2023. Global evidence shows that \nconsumer sentiment gaps across countries are also strongly correlated with changes in interest \nrates. Proposed U.S.-specific factors do not find much supportive evidence abroad.\n\n\nTLDR if you don't borrow money inflation is nbd, if you do (young, poor, or stupid) then effective inflation feels way, way worse than CPI.",

Commodities markets keep great records, housing markets should have clear sales records if not rentals, but it would be easy enough to scrape Craigslist and Facebook marketplace to get rental estimates. \n\nAll of this can be done really transparently, like we can show our work and demonstrate it is accurate to anybody who wants to ask questions (except obviously for the information credit card companies have which would be proprietary AF)\n\nI guess it's naive of me, but it just seems like there are some questions that are really hard to answer with data, and there are others that should be really easy. Inflation should be a number that any citizen can independently confirm, and any institution presenting inflation data should be able to clearly show their data and how they derive their inflation number... This just shouldn't be a number that is so controversial. \n\nI realize there is a problem with getting quality data that is representative of diverse experiences... And that it could differ significantly depending on region as well as economic brackets. The inflation at high-end grocery stores could differ from grocery outlet and Costco, etc. but all of that could at least be quantified with reasonable accuracy. A single number is obviously not possible, but a weighted average of a composite of different inflation numbers, and then let people play with the weighting to generate numbers  applicable to their experience (upper class in Maine?
