      "body": "Thinking, fast and slow. Kahneman.\n\nI've never found a good finance book. They're all dull or wrong or self aggrandising, mostly all three. Anything written before 1990 has little practical value today though the psychology might still hold. Clash of the Financial Pundits by Jeff Macke is short and has some interesting interviews with successful people (though probably a little dated now). It's interesting rather than seminal though.\n\nRemember that if people were any good at investing they'd be actually investing instead of writing books about investing.\n\nYou need to work it out yourself really but it sounds like you're halfway there. Most people who make large wins lose it all very quickly because they become overconfident. \"My idea worked so I must have cracked the system so I must be really good at this\"...and... it's gone.\n\nYour strategy needs to work for you as well as the markets. You need to be able to analyse your own knee-jerk emotions as you can use them to calibrate off. I found that if I can't come up with at least three reasons to buy a stock it rarely works long term. If I'm supremely confident in something working for no reason I check myself I look to see why I'm thinking that and what could have influenced me. Generally I don't do what I was going to. I also found that overthinking doesn't help: it's a game with binary outcomes. You will be frequently right for the wrong reasons and visa versa. Just gotta roll with it.\n\nDiversify and lower your expectations. Long term returns of 10% above CPI are extremely good and while megacap tech exists it's hard to consistently beat SPY. However every indicator of any kind points to them all being severely overvalued now so it would probably be prudent to avoid them. Trade less.\n\nWe don't know what you mean by a very large amount, that's very subjective. If it's millions buy a new house and take a long holiday, stick what's left in VT or SPY. If it's $100k, still stick most of it in VT and have a few punts on the side (this is what fund managers tend to do with their own money btw). If it's $10k still put most in large cap etfs but maybe consider continuing to do whatever you were doing. \n\nUnless you're running a HFT operation and have $100bn invested options are just a casino. Someone wins big every day: in the long term the house always wins.\n\nFinally remember investing is really a way of staying rich, not getting rich.",
