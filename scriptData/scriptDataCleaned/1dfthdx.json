My wife can’t produce no matter how hard she tried, and they used Similac 360 at the hospital, so we stuck with it on rec from our Pediatrician. I think OP was referring to a 70s movie called Soylent Green that had this formula shit made from human flesh in a dystopian future. Nestle is awful in regards to formula though because it nefariously marketed formula specifically in developing nations specifically to target the times it takes mothers to stop producing breast milk. This caused the death of many many babies because formula is expensive and mothers had to dilute it with water to make it last longer, usually dirty water, and they could no longer produce breast milk. Nestle knew this, nestle didn’t care.",

Leaving social media would be the cure, but the vast majority of the users need the dopamine hit and aren't reasonable.\n\nIf someone had more than half a brain and saw that social media brings more harm than good, then they'd leave it immediately (or never even created any account in the first place, unless e.g. out of curiosity or peer pressure), and then the issue wouldn't apply to them — only the addicted ones stay for the rush, and they're the affected ones we're talking about.\n\nIn conclusion, it's more about the person than the tool that brings out the worst in them.",
