It went up because the demand of buyers was greater than that of sellers - TA helps by giving clues as to when this power shift is happening before price action fully reflects it. \n\nYou obviously have never taken any time whatsoever to understand TA. Let me give you a simple, easy example: \n\nA stock experiences v heavy buying volume for whatever reason for a period and the price movement is bullish but overall price movement is minimal relative to the massive buy volume. This tends to lead to more bullish price movement in the future. The crowd liked the stock/felt it was valued less than it should be and so the new holders are likely to hold until the price reflects what they deem to be fair market value - less available sellers leads to bullish price action. \n\nThere are numerous indicators which give clues as to the balance of power. When understood and used well together, these indicators can be v effective - for me I use TA solely to get good entries for investments.",
