Buy the dips, enjoy the rewards!!\n\nSaylor's thesis is just now starting to be proven legitimate, so he has quite a runway ahead of him. \n\nCan't wait to see what comes from the Bitcoin bank/incubator he's working on. The industry really needs this.  Imho, it will be the next Silicon Valley but focused on bitcoin and layer 2 utility/services to allow a pivot away from the current unicorn pump and dumpers who really stalled out innovation for a near decade. \n\nCheers!",

Using hedges strategically has really increased gains and protects profits. It's also much easier to let things ride as you're not watching 100%+ positions dwindle away in a pullback.",
