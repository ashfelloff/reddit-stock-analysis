  "selftext": "Has anyone else notice this current market pullback started when Neel Kashkari opened his big piehole?  After some deep thought it dawned on me.  This is the guy who worked with the Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson during the 2008 banking crisis.  I'm not usually superstitious, but I'm old enough to remember their fuck ups that led to TARP and the bank bailouts being the only option left on the table.  We were on the brink of 1930 and got lucky.\n\nI don't know man.  I get nervous when that guy starts talking.\n\nAnyways, I think this market still has further to tumble and SPY 480 is definitely in play.  ",
