  "selftext": "It sums up my feelings regarding intel.  They already had their turnaround attempt and completely missed the boat.   I had a few thousand shares with cost basis mid 30s and sold on the bump up last year.\n\nThought about getting back in at 18 but I ain't giving them any more chances.\n\nGood luck to you brave souls who decide to invest or ride it out. NVDA was in the 200s at the time I bought INTC (20 post split). Would have killed it had I just seen the light on NVDA.\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/tech/how-intel-fell-from-global-chip-champion-to-takeover-target-3017d779?mod=saved\\_content](https://www.wsj.com/tech/how-intel-fell-from-global-chip-champion-to-takeover-target-3017d779?mod=saved_content)",

      "body": "Intel is akin to Kodak in some ways. Over-invested in the proverbial golden goose, makes attempts to break out but can't/won't succeed, doubles down on the core. \n\nIn the  meantime, upstarts without the legacy baggage succeed in growth areas. \n\nIntel _could_ have been Nvidia or Qualcomm, technically, but its own size and momentum made it trip over its own feet. \n\nThere were _minor_ warnings when it failed to break out of x86, back in the day. Louder warnings when it lost the 64-bit standard to AMD. The penultimate blow was Apple's 64 bit ARM super chip (in fairness not only Intel was off guard). Nvidia's success was in contrast to Intel's decade of under investment in parallel computing, unfortunately just as AI broke out of 40 years research labs and into something that could be a product. \n\nImho Intel was just too big to recognise _and, implement successfully_ the scale of change necessary. They're definitely aren't the first in that hole, and won't be the last.",
