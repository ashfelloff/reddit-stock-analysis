  "title": "Why I'm shorting the entire bronze market with the rest of my life savings ",
  "score": 1677,
  "selftext": "Ever since the horrible quality of the bronze Olympic medals has been going viral on [social media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/09/nyjah-huston-paris-olympics-bronze-medal-quality/74746725007/), i decided it was the perfect opportunity to short the bronze market. I have about $7k saved up and I used all of it to purchase shorts on the entire bronze market as soon as this news broke. My reasoning for this is because as this news becomes more and more mainstream, more athletes will win bronze medals and complain about how low quality the material of bronze is (bronze is about 80% copper and 12.5% tin), which will cause bronze shareholders and copper/tin mining companies to lose revenue and decrease the demand for bronze, thus lowering the cost of it and sending my shorts to the moon.\n\nI'm a strong believer in using the current news/hype thats happening in our world right now to make my investment decisions, and I think this move will play out nicely.  I also plan to go long on gold and silver, because I believe that once bronze declines in value, these commodities, which are heavily supported right now by the Olympics will increase in value.\n\nAlso with more and more government officials pushing for the abolition of the penny, i feel like this is a pretty much no brainer.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lkfg7xrf1cid1.png?width=2268&format=png&auto=webp&s=5252658bb77ba6d23e64594e76fe9573ebb7e6fb",

It's a LatAm based COPPER play followed by other residual minerals/metals from zinc to silver. \n\nBronze is a fucking alloy made from copper. SCCO makes the majority of it's money via extraction and refinement to pure metals rather than alloy creation. OP buying puts on SCCO because of the quality of bronze, within a specific subset of olympic medals, of which the source alloy is unknown, for a medal that was designed by France and specified for France, that they think is of apparently shoddy quality because of some shit they saw on Tiktok, AND they incidentally completely disregarded any actual new about how the French were skimping on a lot of things like the gold medals too.\n\n>[For the Paris 2024 Olympics, the gold medals weigh 529 grammes, with only 6 grammes of 24-karat gold plating, while the silver medals weigh 525 grammes. Bronze medals, on the other hand, are an alloy of copper, tin, and zinc, weighing 455 grammes.](https://www.firstpost.com/explainers/all-that-glitters-is-not-gold-whats-the-real-value-of-an-olympic-medal-13803664.html#:~:text=The%20International%20Olympic%20Committee%20(IOC,92.5%20per%20cent%20pure%20silver.&text=For%20the%20Paris%202024%20Olympics,silver%20medals%20weigh%20525%20grammes.)\n\nIf you work in the jewelry/metals/PMs industry then you'd know seeing the word \"gold plating\" equals to an instant massive downgrade than say any numbered K gold. In this case even Paris' \"\"\"\"\"gold medals\"\"\"\"\" it's around 10% real gold. 24K would be pure gold, 14K is popular for jewelry in the states, and 10K is usually where the cutoff line is for most K jewelry in the US.

In that sense France's metals aren't go so much as a thin layer of gold with the insides are filled with non-gold metals.\n\nOP's best chance at winning out on his play is if SCCO has some sudden unforeseen issue or if we go into a hard landing recession which could crash copper prices.
