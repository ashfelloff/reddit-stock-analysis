  "selftext": "Okay so listen. India is now home to 1/6 of all humans. 4x the US population. It‚Äôs a free market democracy, run by relatively sane, pro-growth people. They speak English and are hungry to kick ass, economically speaking.\n\nQ3 growth blew out expectations at 8.4%. Will the US ever see that kind of growth again? I doubt it. And who cares, because India is going to do it for the next 40 years. In the last 20, they have maintained an average 8% growth rate vs 2% in the US.\n\nIn 2025 when all the dumb elections are over and with rates falling globally, India is going to emerge as the global economic powerhouse. An estimated 53 millions people are enrolled in college this year, a huge amount in tech/engineering. By 2035 that is expected to be 92 million.\n\nThese students are going to come out of school with valuable tech skills and they are going to want luxury goods, cars, good housing, personal electronics and travel. They are going to fucking innovate like a motherfucker.\n\nThis is already happening. The middle class is growing rapidly. Per capita income has increased 140% since 2014. They will soon be the third biggest GDP, blowing by Japan and Germany.\n\nCheck this stat: ‚ÄúBy 2030, close to one in two households will belong to either high- or upper-middle-income categories with growing disposable incomes.‚Äù (Deloitte)¬†\n\nMeanwhile fewer Americans are going to college every year, a trend that started in 2010. Our rampant anti-intellectualism is going to finally screw us in the 21st century.\n\nLet‚Äôs face it, America is a dying empire. Our leadership are all clueless octogenarians. The Boomers have ruined everything and are not going anywhere anytime soon. We can‚Äôt build housing, our bridges and roads are collapsing, our population is decreasing and fewer young people are going to college.\n\nMeanwhile, half of India‚Äôs population is under 30. That‚Äôs two USAs just right there.\n\nSo I‚Äôve got exposures with the EPI ETF. 2687 shares. It might be a little sleepy for this sub, but it‚Äôs been a rocket since 2020. I‚Äôm just jumping on now.\n\n[EPI](https://preview.redd.it/68j313ogyr6d1.jpg?width=2584&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9d5177953ce3a7e4f22c7b418bdee59f3891035)\n\nI‚Äôm not smart to know about other stuff. Apes, what are other ways you are getting exposure to this juicy ass market?\n\nTL;DR - India is a damn juggernaut. Buy India.",

An estimated 53 millions people are enrolled in college this year, a huge amount in tech/engineering. By 2035 that is expected to be 92 million.\n\nThese students are going to come out of school with valuable tech skills and they are going to want luxury goods, cars, good housing, personal electronics and travel. They are going to fucking innovate like a motherfucker.\n\n\nLOL dude where do you think they‚Äôre going as soon as they get out college? AMERICA. and they‚Äôre not going back until they can buy a nice fat house and the maids that come with them, EVEN THEN, they prefer the US. The highest income per household average in America are Indians. And that‚Äôs not going to change anytime soon.  Yes India may become a powerhouse economically but they are being used and abused by the Russians. America will always be THE superpower. Also quality of life is still arguably better in the US. I‚Äôm Indian and many of my friends who still go back to India say the same thing. After they get their degree many of them my age would never go back only to visit once or twice a year. This a great post but as a 31yr old I don‚Äôt see this happening in my lifetime and not in my kids either.",
