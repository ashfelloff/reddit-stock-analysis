In this publication, the PRC takes a realistic approach to closing capability gaps and modernizing outdated equipment and processes? Speed, deception, and coercion will be critical to China's strategy for a forceful unification.  \n>  \n>If China cannot achieve a rapid seizure of Taiwan, its forces run the risk of a prolonged armed conflict playing out on the world stage, a cost that will cause a severe impact economically and certainly put China in direct conflict with the United States. To mitigate this risk, China will need to delay as long as possible until its defense modernization and strategic economic goals are achieved.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/byiqhu06f7sc1.jpeg?width=1108&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91135a10fab04b1f958e58cddc874436a40b5dca",
