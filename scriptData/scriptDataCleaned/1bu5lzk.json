Total cost basis: 8.21\n\n“Thanks for saving TSLA”\n“New ATH coming thanks to you”\n“Way to late for this”\n“Obvious inverse”\n\nRegards to all of those who inversed and argued that “TSLA is not a car company!”\n\nSpecial shout out to u/fakeyfaked13 who did actually inverse and somehow we both came out big winners, wtf?\n\nMay buy in again today or in the run to earnings.

Elon has many faults but he is a fantastic overpromiser and in shorter time frames that can make a stock do weird things. \n\nTLDR don’t take my word for it, only make bets you can afford to lose, have an exit strategy before you buy even if that changes. \n\nIf I HAD to guess, TSLA 145 by end of month, but I am not making that bet",
