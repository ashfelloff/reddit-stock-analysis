  "selftext": "There has been a good amount of hype around these aerospace stocks in the past weeks, and some of it is not undeserved. From successful launches to scoring $4.9 billion dollar NASA contracts, these companies have made very impressive advances and their stock pricing reflects that. I would like to ask for your opinion on the possible futures and advances of these companies, will these be the stocks to look out for in 2025? Or are these Stocks doomed to fail?",

It takes a LOT of money to get mass into orbit, let alone all the way to an asteroid. Then, you have the logistic challenges of getting the mined material back to earth, which also takes more fuel. \n\nThe unfortunate reality is that, our most effective method of transportation in space is to burn rocket fuel. And fuel has mass, so it takes more fuel to carry the fuel needed to do anything (such as returning mined material to earth). Yes, there are other way slower methods of propulsion, but again, those aren't viable if you want the mined material to reach earth in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nSo, until we get some crazy breakthrough technology, mining asteroids isn't financially viable.",

The technology is pretty limited though, basically you can send a computer into space, but getting actual humans and other heavy payloads back and forth has been way too expensive and risky for anything other than research purposes until recently.\n\nAdvances in rocket tech have completely changed the equation in the last 5-10 years. Now, there‚Äôs a viable path to established settlements on the Moon, which means that interplanetary activities just got a whole lot more realistic. Launching from the Moon is dramatically cheaper. Going to the Moon is cool and all, but its commercial opportunity is as a gateway to the rest of our solar system.",

          "body": "You have provided nothing more than comically shallow feelings.  The growth model is the fact that with launch cost per kg dropping faster than these things get into orbit means the market entry point is so so so much cheaper than it was.  Earth observing/servicing, space observing, interplanetary, human rated, tourism.  All of these benefit from lower cost to orbit.  Further, your flippant reference to ‚Äúgovernment contracts‚Äù is laughable.  That‚Äôs fucking ENORMOUS revenue potential.  Fucking lol.  The US defence market is ‚Äúgovernment contracts‚Äù and last I saw, that has made plenty of 3 digit $billion companies.\n\nBut to give you something to look at.\n\nRKLB: \n- own constellation.\n- space systems business.\n- multi-continental and multi-coast launch.\n- full-stack space company.  You can buy anything from a ride to a managed satellite.  Basically satellite as a service.\n- they‚Äôll be the launcher of choice for anyone competing with SpaceX / BO (eventually?)\n\nLUNR:\n- for a $400m cap company to so confidently win a contract worth up to 10x their public valuation is enormous.  Guaranteed funding to see them through to be the premier infrastructure company on the moon.\n- they‚Äôre lead by a great team of experienced professionals.\n\nASTS: \n- big contracts and backed by industry titans that have way, way more clout than SpaceX.\n- first to market with IP protections.\n\nBesides, this whole thing is a ‚Äúall ships rise with the tides‚Äù situation.  Starship success?  Fucking awesome for everyone.\n\nStarship will carry LUNR.  Rocketlab will build parts for satellites going up.  ASTS will compete with Starlink for terrestrial services.  \n\nAlso, the new space companies have one huge advantage.  They are not absolutely bolted to the hip of a wildly unpredictable founder/CEO.  It‚Äôs widely known that there are teams at all of his companies that spoon feed him ego pumps to keep him from going off the deep end on the weekly.  Everything going on in his personal life is now directly tied to the business matters of all of his companies.  If he falters, goes too far down a rabbit hole, or straight up OD‚Äôs while trading g handjobs for horses, SpaceX could be affected in a very negative way.",
