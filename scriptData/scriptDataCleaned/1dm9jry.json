I would get bills for like $20 for going to the hospital.  It cost almost nothing out of pocket.\n\nNow I make $100k and I have to pay much higher taxes and pay $3k a year for shitty insurance from my company just for me and my wife.  They don't pay for much until we hit our deductible, except surprisingly chiropractor.  We are going to start going because for like a $30 co pay they over charge the insurance and say we payed like $300 (what a racket).
