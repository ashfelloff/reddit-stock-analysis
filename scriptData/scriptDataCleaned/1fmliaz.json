The first sign of bear market was in May of '08, the actual bulk of the crash happened in Oct '08 when all the big players already exited. I still remember when IMF was screaming the global financial system is about to collapse then within 3 days Iceland went bankrupt, which led to a currency crisis and countries across the world begging IMF to save them. October '08 was essentially hell on earth for Wall St. So while you're right to imply it's a shit indicator since Phillies won AFTER the implosion of global financial markets, the actual crash did not happen an entire year before.",

So when fans stop spending that much team's go into a more conservative spending budget... Except the Phillies might be tracking things late. So they only become conservative spenders AFTER everyone else.\n\nSince the Phillies continue spending normally regardless of their income, they end up in a situation where they overspend in relation to the other teams and THAT gives them the advantage.\n\nThis would make sense for the 2008 recession, not necessarily the others.\n\nObviously it's an un-based theory with lots of holes and all I know about baseball is from Moneyball.",
