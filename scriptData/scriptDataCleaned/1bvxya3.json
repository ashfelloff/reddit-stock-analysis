He’s depressed right now and was crying on the phone because he’s in desperate need to make money back in the market and this was the perfect play he made, just horrible timing of the exit. I did this today too on $SPY myself but not a big position at all haha. Bought $520P strike start of the day only one contract haha at 0.12, sold two hours before closing at 0.18, now it’s over $6.00 per contract. It stings a bit because I ended trying to catch a falling knife and load calls for a reversal haha and it never reversed back up, so I got cleaned up, now had to make a deposit back in my trading account.",
