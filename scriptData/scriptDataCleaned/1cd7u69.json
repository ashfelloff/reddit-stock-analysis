The problem is I didn’t see any recovery or backing from Wall Street. I owned a few thousand shares when it absolutely skyrocketed last earnings and thankfully got out after it did a +30% and back to below pre earnings in like 3 days. That was nuts.\n\nI do believe they will post really good earnings Monday. The market is pretty pissy about certain aspects though so hopefully their guidance is strong.\n\nMy concern is their balance sheet. In comparison to HOOD they have a lot of debt to traverse in the coming years. If I had to pick between the two I’d say HOOD for the 6-12 month play. \n\nYou could be balls deep in something with deep value and you’re early. But you also could be bag holding while Wall Street pulls on this company’s heart strings for the next 18 months too",

      "body": "How dependent is Sofi on interest rate environment? I believe heavily. And/or how much impact do rates have on the stocks popularity hype? Lots, imo. Time and time again the market is teased with rate cuts while jpow then pulling back on previous cut hints. I think this will continue unless larger negative economic events occur. Which could then be bad for the stock anyway… that far otm is high risk with an already incredibly high risk position size. The leap component drops risk (a bit) but only makes sense if you’re not going to paperhands this play. If you plan to sell on +100% (say it hits 100% in a few months, or post earnings) you can buy a Jan 25 call with $10 strike for the same price… very hard to block emotions for a full year and a half when you see your entire net worth ride up and down month after month. Can you share link of previous DD?",

SoFi is doing well in this environment and keeps growing (30%+ revenue growth in this environment when Biden also made his student loan decisions and SoFi had to quickly adapt - and they did successfully). We don't know what will happen in the next 12-24 months from a macro perspective, but I believe/hope the worst for SoFi is behind us. Otherwise I wouldn't go all-in with a 20 USD strike price. I follow this company for 2 years closely and they just continue to execute well. Let's see Monday what they will present and if they exceed all expectations (again).",

Here is my DD: \n\n  \nI bought $20 strike calls for $1M on [$SOFI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOFI&src=cashtag_click) a couple weeks ago. They expire worthless if SOFI doesn't get over $20 by Jan 2026. Here's some of my DD (I leave out the obvious points like 30% revenue growth & 40% members growth), starting with sth not so serious, but interesting:\n\n  \n1. Risk-free: You get $300 if you open a SoFi savings account (and you get more bonus for referrals). Why not use this free money to buy shares of your favorite companies? And with new members SoFi stock would appreciate thanks to fundamentals, not because it's a meme stock.\n\n  \n2. Recession is the major fear not just for SoFi, but we had only 4 recessions in election years since WW2 - for a good reason. It's game over for Biden if we hit major unemployment this year. The establishment (including FED) will try anything to avoid Trump.\n\n  \n3. S&P 500 inclusion is on the table in around 15 months. That's also a reason why I have long-term calls. They were GAAP positive for the first time last quarter and plan to remain GAAP positive. Institutions currently hold only around 37% depending on your source.\n\n  \n4. SoFi retail community is one of the smartest and daily active (on YouTube and X). They go deep into the business and also call out BS that SoFi needs to improve (e.g. removal of inactivity fee). It's noteworthy that they keep talking about SoFi, even though the stock is down.\n\n  \n5. Alignment: CEO Anthony Noto and 2 other executives need SoFi stock to hit at least $25 by July 2026 to get part of their bonus. The rest of the bonus is paid if the stock hits $35 and $45, respectively and stays above these targets for 3 months. We are talking here $100M+.\n\n  \n6. SoFi is shorted with 18%+ of the float and if SoFi continues to outperform their expectations, this could get us into an interesting situation.\n\n  \n7. Fintech is not so interesting right now, but things are changing (Robinhood, NU Bank, maybe even PayPal with their upcoming stock purchases). We all know what a trendy sector (e.g. \"AI\") can do to all stocks representing this sector.\n\n  \n8. The management team is conservative in their estimates and hard-working, while consistently beating expectations. This is Anthony Noto, SoFi's CEO: \\[3 min video of Anthony Noto doing cool stuff and saying cool stuff\\]",
