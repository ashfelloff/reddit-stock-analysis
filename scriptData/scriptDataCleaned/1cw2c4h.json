  "score": 67,
  "selftext": "Good evening gents, writing to you from the EST timezone and dreading work tomorrow. Soon my option trading will free me from the corporate rat race.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) reported earnings last week: Actual EPS: $0.18 (expected EPS: $0.05)\n\nI recently bought HOOD shares before earnings and then again after EPS beat. I am so horny for HOOD and actually listened to the earnings call. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing Vlad & Co. talk about their recent success with Robinhood gold, IRA match, 24hr trading, crypto, RH Gold Credit card, upcoming futures trading, and more.\n\nWhat stood out to me was their recent growth in net deposits and gold subscription growth. What's funny is, that I recently bought Robinhood Gold and then bought HOOD shares thinking many idiots like myself probably bought gold as well (anticipating an increase in subscriber count on their earnings call)\n\nEPS call Highlights:\n\n* Robinhood Gold's credit card has over [1 million](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/1-million-users-join-the-waitlist-for-robinhoods-new-gold-credit-card-within-a-month) users on the waitlist within a month of announcement. The card offers 3% cash back on all purchases, RH Gold saw subscriptions soaring by 42% YoY to [1.7 million](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/robinhood-makes-headway-beyond-trading-2024-05-09/). The program's success reflects the company's diversified and robust subscription revenue​ strategy.\n* **Successful at transitioning from a net loss of $511 million to a net income of $157 million**\n* RH Gold subscription growth: \"In Q1 \\[2024\\], we grew Gold subscribers to 1.7 million, **up 42%**, or 500,000 from last year. This momentum has continued into Q2 as we added another 140,000 Gold subscribers in April, more than half of our Q1 growth\"\n* Net deposits up **65% YoY (130billion+ assets under custody),** with strong momentum going into next quarter\n* \"We are a technology company\" - Vlad\n\nMACRO: An estimated $68 trillion is expected to be transferred from Baby Boomers to their heirs by 2030, marking the largest wealth transfer in history.\n\n* Baby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, currently hold a significant portion of wealth in the United States. As they age, their wealth is increasingly being passed down to younger generations, particularly Millennials \n\nWith crypto and option trading volume at record highs, millennials are favoring more progressive (and \"instant\") fintech products such as Robinhood, Webull, Coinbase etc.\n\nI believe that Robinhood has a tight grip on the culture of investing – once millennials \"receive\" the wealth transfer they will be more inclined to deposit funds into Robinhood ((note: I'm sure a lot of folks will still keep their legacy (Schwab, Fidelity etc.) accounts open))\n\nPositions: Two option contracts I bought before earnings – \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/85g234gn3h1d1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95072b018afeb091a85f58c7fbf226738c4e05b5\n\n+ I own shares in my Schwab account at an average cost basis of \\~18$",

I know all the whiny fucks still talk about how they turned off the buy button 3 fucking years ago along with 10+ other brokerage apps no one cares about, but they’re the main target for the hate because they were the most popular app being used at the time *and still are*.\n\n95% of posts in this sub are RH screenshots because they let anyone with a pulse and a thumb that can press a “yes” button trade options, and the UI is tailored to making things easy for people who don’t know shit about anything to lose their money to the pros.\n\nI don’t have much of stake in this company but I do have three $15c LEAPs that don’t expire until Jan ‘26 I bought back when the share price was around $10 that I’m hoping will continue to grow in value over time  and at least get like $10k for them total.",

But they are making zero effort to do this basic shit correctly, opting for new features instead.
