      "body": "Article:\n\nDiscount retailer 99 Cents Only Stores LLC announced plans to wind down its business operations in a press release on Thursday.\n\nThe  firm has struck an agreement with Hilco Global to liquidate merchandise  and dispose of certain fixtures, furnishings and equipment at all 371  of its stores, starting on April 5, according to the release. Hilco Real  Estate is managing the sale of the firm’s real estate assets, both  owned and leased, in Arizona, California, Nevada and Texas, reads the  release.\n\n99 Cents has appointed  Alvarez & Marsal managing director Chris Wells as chief  restructuring officer, while Mike Simoncic, who is 99 Cents’ interim  chief executive officer and managing director at Alvarez & Marsal,  will step down. “Unfortunately, the last several years have presented  significant and lasting challenges in the retail environment, including  the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, shifting consumer  demand, rising levels of shrink, persistent inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic headwinds, all of which have greatly hindered the  Company’s ability to operate,” Simoncic said in the release.\n\nBloomberg reported last week that the retailer was mulling a bankruptcy filing as it grappled with a liquidity shortfall.",
