  "selftext": "This isn’t a technical analysis but want to hear others thoughts. Although Reddit isn’t profitable right now, I have really high hopes for it in the long term. I’m fact I think it is so discounted right now that I’m dumping money in every paycheck. It reminds me of when AMD was at like $9. I pitched it to my schools investment group and it got shot down because it had negative earnings. In this case Reddit has a lot of room to implement revenue generating features within the app. Advertising can be easier on Reddit due to the different sub communities and how the app is designed. And with the OpenAI Reddit partnership, it makes me even more urgent to throw my wealth into this long term. Please let me hear others thoughts. Interested if people have any technical analysis as well, as mine is based on what I believe. ",

So you have a good point as in I actually can’t make a perfectly straight call on this as an investment. On the flip side? When I can trade normally and not be emotionally envolved I can make some pretty good decisions.

I bought more that day. \n\nNow again to be perfectly fair, I have made some bad decisions. But that all ties in to how I cant trade this stock? I would be emotionally involved which I think is a poisoned chalice for me. I took 10 years off my mortgage with oil. Everywhere on here I was called a dope and oil is dead etc. thrown in my face?

Huffman then came along and ended the practice. A few years later, before the IPO, he pulled his stunt with crying about how the 3rd party apps were costing reddit money and locking them out of the API unless they paid laughably high fees for access.\n\n\nHuffman is the kind of CEO who literally cut off a revenue source then got angry that revenue was down, before antagonising his user base. (There's also a *lot* more controversies, but I'm keeping this related to income)\n\n\nThe biggest bull case for me is if Huffman gets replaced. He's about as much of a liability as Musk is for Tesla, but just isn't as well known.",

I think what reddit lacks is a competitive moat. Someone builds a decent competitor and people will leave. \n\nPeople have been saying this for a decade and so far nobody has built a remotely competitive site. Back in 2014-2015 when people were pissed at Reddit and Ellen Pao for banning subreddits, everyone acted like Reddit was going the way of MySpace. Last year everyone was saying GOOGs problem was that they have no moat too, but when your product is superior, that’s the moat. \n\n> IMO it should be non profit and simply avoid the sins of the past (don't fuck with the api, don't make the site able to host images, and consider alternative ways to display because phpbb boards were way better at fostering communities and relationships between people in my experiences).\n\nSaying a business shouldn’t make money is just.. weird. You think everything the founders/company built should be provided as charity??",
