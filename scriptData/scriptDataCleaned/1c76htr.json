We will have to wait and see if inflation continues going down but if it does, even .05 to .1% a month, the rates are going to stay unchanged, and there will likely be a slow bleed in the market until inflation nears 2% and rate cuts become expected. Outcome #2 is the inflation rebounding and the possibility of the Fed raising rates, in this case the market will likely crash. Outcome #3 is inflation decreases at a faster pace than expected, rate cuts happen earlier than expected, and the market goes back to its upward trend.",
