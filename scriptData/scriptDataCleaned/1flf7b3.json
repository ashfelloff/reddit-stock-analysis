If you're inconsistent with your sizing and risk management, they will invalidate the trades that made you profits if you try to withdraw. Check out my post where I comment on their Terms and Conditions and read that whole section of clauses. They can invalidate your trades at their own discretion. It's almost impossible to live up to the standards they're looking for. And I'm sure they do pay out, to smaller accounts and smaller withdrawals. But I bet they'll fight tooth and nail to stop larger withdrawals.",
