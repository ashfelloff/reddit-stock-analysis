Which are usually quarterly so the total amount of dividend you would receive is .04.\n\nMaybe you think the dividend is absurdly low and three shareholder gets a quarter of a penny and each share only pays .01 per year. \n\nSo you multiplied the dividend amount by 5, because each share got a years worth of dividends for 5 years. So over 5 years, (in your equation) each share earned .05. So you multiply that by 4000 because there's 4000 shares. So you get 200.\n\nThat's 200 dollars. Not shares. \n\nIf you thought the dividend of .01 was referring to the dividend yield, then your equation and your conclusion are even farther off the mark. A dividend yield of .01 would pay 1% of the share price over the course of a year. So you're multiplying by the number of shares, which doesn't make sense, and assuming that the answer is saying that the result is 200 more shares. \n\nMan I hope you just like commenting and you don't actually invest other than having a company directed 401k or something.",
