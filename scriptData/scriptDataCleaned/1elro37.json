I don't know if I've ever seen so much consistent \"common knowledge\" around any one company's future prospects before or since.\n\nOne of the main reasons I got in on the IPO.

Get 100 friends to buy a single share of a stock after hours at a 50% over asking.  \n\nThe algo will go berserk for about 10 minutes and if automatic  sells are executed, you'll have a dump of units that may provide an opportunity to buy the stock cheap for another 10 minutes or so.  \n\nIt's like when you're a kid and you temporarily block the rain gutter on the street.

At the same time, the cashflow increased by $82M.\n\nThat means 83% of their revenue growth went straight to free cashflow (Not EBITDA), cashflow. (Makes sense, their gross margin 89%)\n\nLets say they see growth slow down next year at 40%. At those margins, you have $27M free cashflow (this is their first time posting positive cashflow) turning into $376M\n\nMarket will open at $8B Market Cap. Thats means in 12 months, they have a P/E of 21.2 in a company with 40% growth, no debt, and $2B cash (16 p/e with minus cash per share)\n\nThats shockingly good. At this point, I'm praying this thing tanks because its actually worth the share price\n\nEdit: wait, that number is wrong, their guidance is going to put Q4 revenue at $310M. So that's a 19 p/e with a cash adjusted P/E at 14.4",
