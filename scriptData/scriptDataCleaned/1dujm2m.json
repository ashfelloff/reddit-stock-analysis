They were worth 2.8T stock around 180. Hopefully you know how market cap works. AI developments- AI is bare minimum 2-5T market. Apple gets 25% of 2T market is 500B to market cap = 3.3T market cap which would = a stock price of $210-$220 at MINIMUM. Ai development news all through April may, June wwdc was announcement. Bought strikes between 200-220 for a week after WWDC to a month out to take advantage of a AI based rise once the news came out. I ended up being 100% correct but I still sold on the way up for only 10k. If I had held that position till now I would be up 100k+ 🤷🏾‍♂️",
