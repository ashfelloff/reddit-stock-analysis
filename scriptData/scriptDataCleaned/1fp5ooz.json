The break even is 100.70 if bought at that price. Which means that investors are willing to pay for a $95 call option with a break even at 100.70 as the market is pricing in a move to 104.50 if the results are bullish. This would cause the calls to go up about 75%. Anywhere beyond 106 would be a 100% gain.
