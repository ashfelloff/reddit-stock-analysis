I think we are going to gain more insight on whether the AI-investment is efficient at this point and how its implementation can be utilized further, with future outlook & estimates on Q4 and beginning of Q1 being positive. \n\nAlso other issues are going to be addressed like the Port Strike issue in Jan. There also might be Fed cut rates down the line which I‚Äôm sure is not priced in yet since everyone is concerned over the Elect/ion results. \n\nI‚Äôm not holding very long though, I only need 15% gain from AMZN to make my year. I‚Äôm looking for $200-220 range but if I sense a deep pullback, I‚Äôll sell around my margin. I don‚Äôt usually like to hold through earnings for a play like this but the stock has been trade like shit lately. \n\nBut I could be wrong. However, considering GOOGLE mick doogle just reported positive news on their AI-investment, I think Amazon may also. Thoughts?",
