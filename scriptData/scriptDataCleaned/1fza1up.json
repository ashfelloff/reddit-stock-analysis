      "body": "Unfortunately, in December 2023, Florida‚Äôs legislature, in a persistent effort to protect the insurers, removed any entitlement to attorneys fees in litigating against insurance carriers.\n\nMeaning, if you‚Äôre an insured and your insurer doesn‚Äôt pay on a claim, eg a property insurance claim, but also other types of policies, then EVEN IF you win, and prove they breached the policy, there is no right to recover your lawyer‚Äôs fees in litigating that dispute.\n\nIt had been the case that insurers who denied legitimate claims, then lost in litigation, were required to pay both the amount of the claim, and the insured‚Äôs lawyer fees in litigating that dispute.\n\nWhy does that matter?\n\nIt used to be, insurance lawyers would sue insurance companies, and would have a contingent fee relationship with their client, the insured. So, the lawyer only wins when the insured wins. \n\nNow, however, it‚Äôs not viable for a lawyer to litigate property insure be disputes, premised upon denied coverage for claims.\n\nHurricanes, typically, would be a covered loss under most policies.\n\nNow, they can deny your claim, tell you to pound sand. \n\nIf you want, you can sue them still, but that lawyer is going to want $450 an hour for 2 years worth of litigation.\n\nThat doesn‚Äôt make sense for an insured who just lost their house.\n\nSo, these insurance companies will deny everyone‚Äôs claims because they know there isn‚Äôt a sufficient incentive for a lawyer to litigate these cases.",

My mistake.\n\nAnd insofar as you seem informed, I‚Äôd propose a solution to your assertion.\n\nAnd this is deep in the legal weeds.\n\nBefore the complete abolishment of attorney fees in insurance litigation, *in December of 2022*, the Florida legislature actually had a prior amendment to the fee statute, in July of 2022, that was a great idea.\n\nThey just didn‚Äôt keep it.\n\nGoogle:  Fla. Stat. 627.70152(8)(2022).\n\nIt didn‚Äôt last, it was only in effect for 6 months, before fees were removed. \n\nBut, that framework was actually very reasonable and clever. I‚Äôll briefly summarize, but you‚Äôd have to pull the statute for specifics: \n\nThe statute required:\n\nBefore filing suit against its insurer, an insured was required to send a pre suit notice and demand letter, where basically they would set forth an itemized breakdown as to the amount owed under the policy.  The plaintiff / insured was required to also provide supporting documents/invoices, etc.\n\nThe demand letter *required the plaintiff insured to demand a specific amount of money, inclusive of attorney fees.*\n\nWhy‚Äôs that matter?\n\nThe statute said that, IF, they end up in litigation, the plaintiff / insured ONLY wins attorneys fees depending on HOW CLOSE their judgment was, versus the presuit demand.\n\nIt was a sliding scale system.\n\nSo, basically, if I demanded $100,000 in my presuit demand, then won, and showed $100k in damages,  then I‚Äôm going to get my full attorneys fees.\n\nIf I only won, say, $50k, then I‚Äôm gonna get 50% of my claimed attorneys fees. And so on.\n\nIt‚Äôs all broken down by percentage in the statute referenced above.\n\nThat was a perfect solution bc it required plaintiff lawyers to be very reasonable in their presuit demand, otherwise they‚Äôll never get their fees. \n\nBut it still kept insurers honest with the potentiality for fees.\n\nWithout a right to recover fees against insurers, there‚Äôs very little appetite for plaintiff lawyers to sue insurers, unless the damages are some enough that the client can afford/justify paying the lawyer hourly.",
