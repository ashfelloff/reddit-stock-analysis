This represents a decrease in EPS QoQ by 22% and only a 3% increase in revenue. \n\nGoing forward they won’t report paid memberships, which clearly indicates that they’re shifting heavily in to the ~~free~~ ad-supported memberships and other forms of revenue. They reported that ad-tier memberships jumped 35% quarter over quarter, but that to me is a deceiving figure as the amount of people who downgraded their paid subscriptions to the free ad-tier probably make up the majority of that growth. I don’t think they saw an organic 35% growth.\n\nSeems like they’ve become a stable, money-printing business with more room to grow in parts of Europe, the Middle East, and Japan.
