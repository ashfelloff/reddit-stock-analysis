An AI application framework could be developed in conjunction with development of application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

Businesses fade and fail all the time, even if they hit epically high highs for their sector.\n\nOf course it is *possible*, I’d never say it’s not. But I do highly doubt Nvidia will land among those few over time considering their products. They are a shovel company during the discovery of gold deposit. They very well might continue innovating and successfully diversify their revenue streams; but historically they are likely going to end up along the same lines as the myriad of other companies who struck gold and begin to slide with each year further and further from relevancy. Perhaps at no fault of their own, just the whim of market conditions.  \n\nThat said I do see them continuing to do well enough as a company over the longer term. They might not even come down, but they likely will stay relatively stagnant. I do not see them consistently stand among the wealthiest companies without massive expansion and diversification shielding themselves against inevitable competition. I’m sure related conversations are being held left and right daily in their board rooms.",

      "body": "tl;dr - Hardware does not equal design/software\n\nI'm sure I'm nowhere near as smart as this nerd. But even someone with a double-digit IQ knows there is a world of difference between an IBM (Hardware in the heyday) and NVDA (Design/Software)\n\nAll nascent manufacturing industries start out with fat profits and a few players. This is immediately followed by numerous competitors that rush into the industry to get a piece of the pie, slowly forcing down profit margins in exchange for volume. And eventually, these industries become dominated by oligopolies. It is the nature of tangible products to become commoditized with time (aka - productivity)\n\nCars, TVs, Chips, PCs, etc. It's almost always the same. Go ahead and look up how many US auto manufacturers have existed in the US (Spoiler = around 3,000). 30 years ago, about 20. Today, a handful. And they focus on selling as many cars as possible and sometimes dont even make a profit on the ones they do.\n\nBut in this case, we are talking about computer hardware, so I'll stay on that. I do have a tendency to ramble:\n\nPeople had PCs in the 70s and 80s, but they were often for those in the highest income brackets, because the things were freaking expensive. It wasn't until the very early 90s for true mass adoption of the PC to begin (primarily driven by creation of the information superhighway). That's also when the number of PC makers exploded. Why did so many companies rush in to make PCs? Because a new Apple, IBM, HP, Compaq, NEC, computer with all the fixins was around $2,000 to $3,000.  Thats 30 years ago pricing - That's like paying $7,000 for a new PC today. There was lots of money to be made, hence the PC gold-rush.\n\nEventually you had upstarts that came in as the cheaper plays, Gateway, Dell, etc. Their claim to fame was getting a whole PC set-up for $1,500-$2,000. This led to the true cost-conscious builders - See: eMachines with their $499 computers. Today you can get a desktop equivalent powered laptop for $300. Something that would have been considered a ludicrous joke 20 years ago.\n\nThis race to the bottom leads to inevitable outcomes: Most manufacturers go out of business - Ex: Compaq (Once the world leader and introduced the first laptop). Some become niche: See Apple.  And some manufacturers dominate through their processes - Ex: Dell and its direct-to-consumer business. But even they remain beholden to volume and profit margins. And so, when the world has a mild PC slowdown, they struggle.\n\nAnd then some players pivot - which brings us to IBM. They sold off their laptop business to China and attempted to pivot to consulting/software. (Sidenote: Their mistake was selling their laptop business. They should have used it to sell ancillary services with higher profit margins - See: Dell). It wasn't a bad idea. They have incredible IP (Up until a year ago, they had the most patents in the world). They tried to do the AI thing before AI was truly feasible from a computational standpoint. Remember Big Blue playing chess vs Kasparov? Deep Blue, etc. In some ways, they were ahead of the game.\n\nUltimately, they didn't pull it off and instead focused on consulting.\n\nTo compare a company that produced hardware to become an industry titan (IBM started by making typewriters - hence the International Business Machine moniker) to one that produces nothing, save intellectual property, is quite silly.\n\nNVDA should be compared to MSFT or AAPL. They both rely on the production of hardware, but they themselves make none of it; the hardware is just a delivery system. MSFT doesn't give a crap who makes PCs. The only thing that matters is Windows, Office, and Azure are loaded onto it. AAPL doesn't care about which manufacturer/country produces their new iphone - whether it's in Vietnam, China, or India. Those phones are simply tools that allow you to access the apps on their appstore/ecosystem.\n\nAnd that is what NVDA does with GPUs. They don't manufacture anything, but their graphics cards go into every system on the planet. And those cards are simply a computational tool that allow you access to CUDA.\n\nCUDA is everything. If and when a truly viable competitor to CUDA arises, then NVDA will be in trouble. And that is when you can value it on being just another IBM.",
