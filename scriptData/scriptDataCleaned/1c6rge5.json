  "selftext": "Reddit has been flooded with bearish posts on Tesla recently. And the Musk hate boner is incredible.\n\nYes, Elon has been an absolute clown show of a CEO, and as a former Elon simp, I can’t defend him anymore. He spends more time shit posting on Twitter than actually running Tesla.\n\nNow, that being said, is it time to inverse Reddit?\n\nTesla’s energy division has quietly quadrupled its profits (https://cleantechnica.com/2024/01/24/tesla-energy-storage-solar-profits-nearly-quadrupled-in-2024/amp/). \n\nIn terms of self-driving data, Tesla boasts 3 billion+ miles of data. I can tell you that no other company comes close to having that much data. Tesla is literally sitting on a gold mine and none of you regards seem to understand just how valuable it is.\n\nIn my humble opinion, Robotaxis are likely nowhere near completion and the regulatory red tape is probably immense. I don’t foresee Tesla rolling robotaxis out anytime soon and hence, k expect a capitulation in their stock price near term. But 10+ years from now, Tesla is going to be ahead of the curve.\n\nAdditionally, projections are that 80% of new vehicles sold in 2030 will be electric. And if you think shitty Chinese cars will flood the American market, you’re dead wrong. The US would never let that happen. Also, Tesla has a monopoly on the charging network. As an EV owner, let me tell you that the current infrastructure outside Tesla’s network is hot doggie.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen Reddit and the media shit on Elon and he proves them wrong time and time again. Yes, he’s been a complete moron as of late, but the guy is still a visionary.",

That being said I would say at the end of the day the institutions were fine with the valuations as if they recognized their trading systems going haywire then they would probably re calibrate them, cause when it had the huge 2019 rally Tesla was able to meet certain metrics that resulted in that large rally in the first place. So its not just trading systems, but the human eye being fine with such price action , and now we see the opposite, Tesla lagging behind its peers. So the same price action is their but wall street is just not impressed, and neither is retail  ( besides those Tesla you tubers that keep shillings good news ). \n\nI do think that the markets share some cyclical relations just like in nature, the cycle of life from birth to start . I agree, we might see a large drop on Tesla like sub 100 due to a coming bad earnings call, and compound that with a short term semiconductor melt down. AMD is already down 30%, and then ASML which manufactures key tools for the advanced ai semiconductor chips missed their revenue expectations, so a larger pull back on the nasdaq is likely. \n\nGiven how much of the rally was driven by semiconductor and AI hype, we might see like a 15% pull back on the nasdaq. Tesla would likely implode if we combine another large earnings miss and then a subsequent stock market pull back. \n\nKepe in mind it went down nearly 45% while the indexes all rallied to new highs. So if its that weak in a bull market, imagine how bad it will get when the general markets fall.",

      "body": "Tesla has a lot of potential in the future from cars, energy, AI, and is in a position to be a leader in these sectors.  Now a big however.  The company as much as it has found love within the minds of a vast amount of people, is not functioning well.  Tesla has been on a downslide since late 2021. There are good reasons why investors are overall bearish on the stock. Personally I loved the company, I bought shares years ago and then sold them way too early (DOH) but as far as a long term investment at this moment, I wouldn't buy in now.  That being said, the stock does bring decent short term profits, sometimes as much as 50%, but you need to get the timing right.  My2Cents",

In 2022 I picked up shares at 180 and doubled my position at 165. The share price still dropped to 100 before rebounding. It was tough to bag hold and avoid letting all the negative headlines and WSB posts get the best of me. I Dave Gogginsed that shit until I exited at 270. But I’m back in again and ready for another battle. Though I think I got in a bit too soon this time but that’s the way it goes sometimes.",
