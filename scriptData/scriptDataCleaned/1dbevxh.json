There is still a lot of uncertainty.\n\n* **Inflation** has risen from its November lows (3.1%) to 3.5% in March. There was some improvement in April, but it remains stagnant.\n* In the **Labor Market,** there were 272,000 new non-farm payrolls in May, compared to the expected 180,000. Average worker earnings rose again to 4.1% year-on-year. These figures cast doubt on a potential rate cut in September. The strong employment and income data have altered interest rate expectations. This movement has caused the dollar to surge 0.5% against the euro and the 10-year Treasury bond to rise from 4.28% to 4.43%, an impressive jump of 15 basis points.\n* The **Non-Manufacturing PMI,** the US services sector recorded its largest expansion in nine months in May, driven by the most pronounced monthly increase in a business activity indicator since 2021\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\n* USD: **RANGE**\n\n\n\nSmartmassStrategy",
