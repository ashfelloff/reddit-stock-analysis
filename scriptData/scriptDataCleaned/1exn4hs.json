  "score": 39,
  "selftext": "The consensus seems to be that the 1Q jobs numbers will be revised-down ~950k at 10am.  That, in theory, should already be priced in.\n\nIf the revision is bigger than expected (worse economy a half-year ago) will the markets go up or down?\n\nI can see this being a bad-news-is-good-news situation: the pain of the bad job market has already rippled through the economy, but it still adds justification for The Fed to be more aggressive with rate cuts.\n\nBut on the other hand, conventional wisdom seems to be that bad news today would, in fact, be bad news.",

But if unemployment is rising at the same time, it throws a wrench into things. Sure, lower rates can boost businesses and spending, but if people are losing jobs, that means less demand and weaker earnings down the line.\n\nInvestors get caught between optimism over cheaper credit and fear that the economy is actually in worse shape than it looks. So while rate cuts can be good news, rising unemployment can make the market reaction a lot more cautious. It‚Äôs like a \"wait and see\" kind of vibe.",
