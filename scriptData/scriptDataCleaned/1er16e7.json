I am not super familiar with options and especially when I have a lot to sell but not that much open interest to sell into.\n\nI have bought 44 option call contracts on CORZ expiring 20/9/24. The P/L is +853%, open interest 1.17k, but hardly any volume (3-10, only every few days). The price per option is now 6.0, it was 7.5 a few weeks ago.\n\nWhat approach may be good for selling this to maximise potential gains?\n\nI assume that if I am not able to sell them, and let it expire (ITM), it means I will just get in-cash, the CORZ stock on the strike price of 4 which (x44 options x 100) is only worth $176 x 100 = $17,600? OR is it that I will end up getting 44,000 CORZ shares (?) at a price of $4 (not that I have to pay for it)?\n\nIs that how it works?\n\nMy current value of the 44 options is $23k; I assume that, if that is still the price at expiry, I will not be getting that amount, but $17,600?\n\nShould I try and place orders to sell 10 at 6.5 (I have already placed that but no transactions for a week), 10 at 7.0, 10 to sell at 7.5 etc? (and hope they actually go through)? Or is there a better strategy you could share?\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

I just wanted to transact at >6.0 because the last order was at that price and the stock price has gone up since then, so I should try and get it for at least 6.... but I guess what I'm hearing is, if I try for 6, and get no transactions for the next week, I should consider lowering the price closer and closer to the bid price? I actually don't know how exercising options work, I thought that was for if I sold (not bought) options, since I am supposed to be in 23k profit and I paid $5k for the options, why do I have to pay even more money to get the shares???... let me do some research sigh.",

                              "body": "I'm going to try to explain the jargon and answer this as clearly and thoroughly as I can.\n\nThe answer to your first question is entirely dependent on which broker you are using and how your account is set up.\n\nThe worst thing you can do here is nothing.\n\nYou are right that open interest means that there are 1700ish open orders for that call contract. However, the \"bid\" or the highest price anyone is willing to pay looks like it's about 20 cents below the \"ask\" or the lowest price anyone is willing to sell. \n\nIf you want to close your position immediately and the bid price is acceptable to you, you can put your order through to sell all of the contracts at whatever the current bid price is and they will sell/close almost immediately at that price. You will not be maximizing your profits, but you'll immediately end your position in this trade and make a nice profit.  Since you are very new to this, this is the choice I would recommend.  You are potentially leaving some additional profit on the table, but if you're happy with the profit so far, this strategy makes the most sense and immediately ends your risk of the underlying stock moving against you and the option price dropping.\n\nYour other choice is to exercise the contract and buy the shares.  Even for calls that are deep \"in the money,\" this is pretty much never a good idea. You will need to have the cash in your account, or if you have a margin account, you will need to borrow the money from your broker (and pay interest) to buy the shares.  You will be massively increasing your investment and your exposure to price movements. If you paid $500 for these contracts, the most you could lose is $500 if they expire worthless. If you buy the shares and the company goes bankrupt, you will have lost the total value of the shares you bought. \n\nYour last choice is to do nothing and see what your brokerage does. If you're even considering this, I would recommend closing your account after this trade and putting your money into a managed fund like a 401k or IRA. When you opened a brokerage account you decided to make decisions about your money. These are not managed accounts, we are the managers, we have to make these decisions. I don't know how anyone on here would recommend not putting an order in to your broker to do *something.*  If you don't tell your broker what to do, they would be completely justified in letting your calls expire worthless and you will lose your entire investment.  They may have a policy in place that they will try to close them for you at the best price they can get, but I wouldn't rely on that.\n\nYou should look into something called theta decay when you're done with this, basically the options market understands that huge fluctuations in stock prices are rare. So as a contract nears its expiration date, its value decreases even if the underlying stock's price doesn't change. When you're buying puts and calls, your profit potential is based on the uncertainty of the price of the stock, and as you get closer to the expiration date, the stock price becomes more predictable and the value of the options decreases.  You should consider this when deciding when it is best to close your positions.\n\noh, and can you do a cashless exercise? maybe, that's up to you and your broker. Again, that would not be my choice.\n\nAnd can you exercise your options (buy the shares) and sell them the same day - usually yes as long as you have not been flagged as a pattern day trader.  I think if you make more than 4 day trades (buying and selling an asset within one trading day) in a 5 day period and your account has less than $25k in it, then your broker will flag you as a pattern day trader and you'll need to wait a day to sell.",

Whoever sold you those call options, that's who's shares you'd be taking. Options are a zero sum game period, if you gain 100 shares someone else lost them. Secondly if your calls are in the money they will not expire worthless, period. The broker will either exercise for you (and immediately make you sell the shares if you do not have the capital) or in some cases they will sell the options for you. If this happens and volume is that low it's very likely you'll get a dog shit full price. I'd try to sell them before that, you need to lower the price and see if any will sell. Bid/ask spreads are usually ridiculously wide on low volume options. Even though their may be good opportunities on low liquidity options sometimes, this is exactly why nobody trades them.

But if your broker (not all of them do this) sees that you don't have enough funds to receive the shares from the settlement, they may manually place in the request to OCC to not automatically exercise. Find out your broker's policy. Call them and ask to speak with someone knowledgeable of the broker's policies (not some customer service intern). Good luck.",

But some brokers can have all sort of additional stringent rules around margin requirements. Regulators only set the minimum rules and brokers can go as stringent as they want and can also change them on the fly.\n\n>Some mentioned that the broker can even do it 'for me' (i.e. buy and sell at exactly the same time), meaning I don't need any funds to do so... is that a possibility for some brokers? (obviously I will have to call and confirm with them).\n\nYes, that's a possibility with some brokers. In reality, they still do take on a risk doing that, because there are several hours between when settlement occurs and when market resumes trading. For options that expire on Fridays, the settlement actually happens on Saturday (many hours after the market has closed) and trading doesn't start for more than 24 hours later. The stock can open with a gap up or down when trading resumes. That's the risk the broker is taking. The risk being that your account gets wiped out and the broker is left carrying the rest of the loss. Brokers with deep pockets can take those risks to offer smoother services to their clients.",
