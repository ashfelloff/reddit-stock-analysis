  "score": 363,
  "selftext": "Several people have reached out asking if I'm still holding my BABA and PYPL positions (original thread is here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1akti6m/down\\_730k\\_between\\_pypl\\_baba\\_still\\_in\\_for\\_173/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1akti6m/down_730k_between_pypl_baba_still_in_for_173/) ). \n\nI am holding! (though I did sell 2k of my 14k shares of BABA around $112, which realized some losses for tax loss harvesting purposes, which lowered the average cost basis of my remaining shares). Here are the current details:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qx8vhnybdjtd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=d918fdee1b3bf839d479d0a1c447262e55331aa3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8snzl1scdjtd1.png?width=1352&format=png&auto=webp&s=c6f797bda5a878733ae3f1264e65b0ae2dd9c9e5\n\nYes, I know BABA is down today. Yes, I plan to keep holding BABA to see how the stimulus plays out. I also still like PYPL quite a bit. \n\n  \nThe original post from 8 months ago showed I was down a combined $730k between those two positions. As of today, I'm basically break even on them. I know it hasn't been a good investment / thesis so far, but I still think these have some room to run. Time will tell. ",
