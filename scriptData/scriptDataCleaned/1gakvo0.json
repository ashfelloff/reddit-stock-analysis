Decorative gourd futures, that stuffedness oreo bear indicator, mattress company that is named after a color dude, the forbidden meme ticker,god I‚Äôm gonna miss yall.  But, I rode the face ripping meme stocks, tsla moons, nvda earnings, and have nothing to show for it. I realized I‚Äôm doing this for the feeling it gives me, other than trading nothing really brings me joy. But I‚Äôm not here to be a Debbie downer, just wanted to commemorate this somewhere. To all you in the red, remember-you‚Äôre only 10 trades away from being a multimillionaire. To those few in the all time green, **congrats and fuck you** god speed autists. ***to the moon***",
