However, having some vision into their dev process and support I really think as brands transition out of that initial growth/startup phase they look to a more mature checkout platform that handles the checkout and possibly the data catalogue, but doesn't have the \"please everyone\" package like themes, markets, etc. A lot of companies are coming onboard with microservices and finding the best provider for each need. eCommerce checkout market is definitely open for some competition and refining.",
