  "selftext": "Ay yo-  My mother has Alzheimer's so I've been immersed on AD and all things related to it.  We invested in $sava back in 2019 when it was a few dollars.   Since then, we've sold some but still have a large position (greater than $5m) of stock.  \n\nIf you're unaware of bio tech, it is a dirty and ugly world where big pharma (Eli Lilly, Biogen, etc.) will do any and everything to undermine the future viability of emerging companies.  Many medicine based journals/websites get over 95% of their revenue from Big Pharma; on top of this, many journalists work with hedge funds who short these stocks and get paid as contractors/consultants for their 'opinions'.  Due to this, it's relatively easy for these stocks to get shorted, ripped to shreds and lose money before they have the ability to introduce their data to the world.  \nThis has happened with $sava. \n\nThe results so far are extremely promising!  The current drugs on the market have huge side effects.  This drug, Simifulam, shows the most promise for a terrible disease.  \n\n$sava will introduce their updated data from the current test in December, likely.  The stock is currently at $21 with a high of $125.  The current market cap is $1b.  If their drug is approved by the FDA, it should be worth >$10b ($250 p/sh). \n\nShort hedge funds, shady bio tech 'experts' who have a Patreon and get paid by Big Pharma to post hit pieces, and journalists who use their voice have crushed the stock.  Eventually, data will shut these shorts up.  \n\nI hope that the FDA will approve this promising drug, and that the shorts will be crushed for not only trying to short a stock that could save MILLIONS of lives and families, but because they have slowed down the progress of a terrible drug.  This must be stopped.  Shame on the shorts.  SHAME!\n\n&#x200B;",

          "body": "> allegations of missing data\n\nJust to clarify, that allegation is related to a 13 year old paper that sparked further research into this drug. The allegation has nothing to do with any of the clinical trial data collected for this drug in the last decade.\n\nAlso worth noting, the allegation of fraud/fabrication has never been proven, despite years of digging by people with significant financial interest in proving that fraud.\n\nThe original western blot data IS missing, but the researcher involved did not violate ANY data handing or retention policies that were in place at the time. He's never once tried to hide the fact that those original data were discarded long ago for simple procedural reasons. There's no cover up or malicious intent there.\n\n> retracted papers\n\nSame researcher, and yes, he's had some retracted papers. None of those papers are related to Simufilam.\n\nTo play Devil's Advocate, the foundational paper could be 100% fraudulent and it wouldn't mean a thing. Nobody cares about that paper or what's in it at this point.\n\nIt's only meaning was as the spark that got the company looking into Simufilam and spending money on clinical trials.\n\nThe FDA isn't going to care about that when it comes time to approve this drug. The only data that matters is the phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trial data. The FDA has already heard these allegations a hundred times and has not once stepped in to stop or modify the clinical trials despite many opportunities (and jurisdiction) to do so.\n\nEven if you argue it says something about that researcher's integrity, it's STILL not relevant. He isn't a Cassava employee. He has no connection to the ongoing clinical trials. None of the current data goes through him or his lab.\n\nOne piece of phase 2 data went through his lab, but it was a secondary analysis and not related to that study's primary endpoints or cognition data.\n\nIf you think this drug is doomed to failure because of the existing phase 2 clinical trial data, fine. That's understandable (though I disagree).\n\nBut if you are evaluting this stock based on controversy around a 13 year old research paper and NOT based on the clinical trial data then that's just emotional investing.",
