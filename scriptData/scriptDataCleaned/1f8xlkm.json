  "selftext": "Nike stock has been falling dramatically the last few years, from what I understand mostly due to competition from On and HOKA, whilst it seems pulling out of retail chains such as footlocker cost them in revenues. It's P/E ratio is lower than its 10 year average at 21.6, which begs the question, can Nike continue to grow in the future?\n\nIt has a strong moat. although they are losing market share in running shoes, they still have a large market that they dominate in Basketball, Football and other sports. It's brand I'd argue also plays a big part in it staying relevant, it still seems to me that Nike is synonymous with sportswear. \n\nIf anyone has any downsides they see in Nike, please share here!",

The second problem is the quality of all of their products has went down considerably over the past 10 years, other brands like Asics are basically the same, Adidas, similar but Nike has had a serious loss in quality relying on the brand and people wanting to wear it just because. If we look at other premium brands like Lulu, they make nice stuff, really high quality product, Nike needs to get back to making very high quality shoes and very high quality clothing, directly market to athletics, make that their image, if they do this the stock will take off but it's a long-term turnaround and first management has to realize that this is the problem",

There's just too many moving parts and unknowns. Almost any thesis someone has is not based on hard data, but rather gut feelings. \n\nSo I treat a company like Nike as a momentum play. Right now the momentum is neither up or down... it probably trades sideways until it reports earnings (sept 26 i think), which will then push the momentum one way or another. \n\nIf it's at $74 before earnings, I'd buy just as a gamble.

      "body": "There are just so many better plays out there.  I don‚Äôt see a reason to buy Nike as an individual stock.  Seriously, why? \n\nIf you‚Äôre looking for some kinda bounce after it dropped, you‚Äôve missed it.  If you think it ‚Äúhas to‚Äù go up to where it was, you‚Äôre mistaken.  Nike is closer to fair value now than it was before.  \n\nIt‚Äôs such a massive brand that the upside is very limited in terms of what we KNOW (shoe sales, apparel sales, branding, etc); if something NEW or UNKNOWN were to come along and impact the stock price significantly to the upside, (branch out to new territory; start a new revenue stream, etc) it would be dumb luck.  \n\nWith increasing competition and Nike‚Äôs proven ineptitude to quickly adapt to the changing landscape, I only see challenges ahead.  I believe the risk is bigger than the reward.  Even if it sits pretty flat for the next few years, it‚Äôs dead money that could‚Äôve earned you 10% just sitting in an ETF.  \n\nI just don‚Äôt see the major upside potential to make it an enticing buy.  Maybe I‚Äôm missing it.  If I am, I‚Äôd love to be enlightened.  But for the projected gains IMO (recapturing ATH within next couple years potentially as it recovers and they drive increased profitability), the risk of it sitting flat or declining is just as likely IMO.  Would rather buy an ETF than Nike.  So many better stocks to pick as an individual stock than this one.  Like hundreds.",
