  "selftext": "\n\nOkay, I know there is alot of good financial advice on the internet but I also know there is alot of bad stuff too. So that's why I'm making this post. So sorry if it's popped up 100 times before.\n\nBasically I'm currently a cybersecurity student in college. I have 2 more years to go, and through scholarship and a 20ish hour job at the dorms I have tuition, housing, and food covered. Basically I'm not losing money, not making it. But at least I'm not in debt compared to my peers. \n\nI have about 1000 dollars in savings, and I'm looking to begin leaning how to slowly invest in slow and safe ways. Does anyone have any good references to look at for decent investing advice / places I could start throwing tiny bits of cash at to start learning without risk of doing anything stupid and somehow taking on debt (idk being on reddit I've been very much scared bc of all those \"I made a short (idk what that is) and now my house is gone posts)\". \n\nBasically I want to learn but atm the whole thing looks terrifying, hard to navigate and a bit scammy atm. Like at this point I'm fine with a 5 % yearly return. Or should I aim for more ? \n\nEdit - Thanks so much for all the advice guys ! I've definitely learned that unfortunately 1000$ really is not much in the grand scheme of things. I guess some context is that the main goal of this is to gain financial literacy / perhaps make something of my small hoard ( to which many have said the best option is for it to remain as savings). Unfortunately I grew up in an area with little financial literacy and many of my peers live paycheck to paycheck / are in debt, so I maybe perhaps felt a little too good about my meager holdings. \n\nSome extra context - I work as a \"RA\" for my college so as compensation for a relatively easy job (aside from dealing with the police at 4 am) is that I don't make traditional rent payments as my rent and food expenses are waived. \n\nI'm located in the US \n\nAnd I'm so grateful for all the amazing advice yall have given me ❤️",

              "body": "They gave you the best advice to put that in an emergency fund. But you might be wondering why? Why put it in a savings account when it could be in an ETF earning more money? The reason is simple.\n\nWhen the stock market crashes, people get laid off. When people get laid off they need an emergency fund in order to continue paying their bills. If those people don't have an emergency fund, then they are forced to sell their ETFs and/or stocks at a loss to pay their bills, because remember, the stock market went way way down, the economy is doing poorly, and that's why you lost your job (hypothetically speaking of course).\n\nSo what happens is the poor lose their job *and* take a loss on their investments at the same time,  whereas people who have an emergency fund can ride out the storm without selling at the bottom.  I cannot emphasize enough how important the emergency fund is before you start investing.",

                      "body": "Yes the stock market is volatile because the economy is volatile. But if you are sufficiently diversified you should buy and hold. Never try to time the market. Buy ETFs and stocks that you believe in the long-term future of. Ask yourself would you buy the entire company if you had the money? If the answer is no then you probably don't want to buy the stock. You shouldn't be asking yourself \"is the stock price going to go up tomorrow?\"  \n\nWhen you start actually investing, *after* you have the safety net of an emergency fund, buy and hold long term VOO.  I recommend holding it for 20 to 30 years . You will invest in other stocks but just never sell your S&P 500 ETF only keep buying more every month if possible.\n\nOwning a share of VOO is like owning a tiny piece of the top 500 companies in the US.  This allows you to significantly lower your risk by diversification.  Have you heard the phrase don't put all your eggs in one basket? That's what I'm saying here, put your eggs in 500 baskets.  This is what Warren Buffett advises to any new investor who is not extremely skilled at picking stocks, and unfortunately that goes for most people.  My strategy is to bet on the long-term future of America economically speaking and that's exactly what the S&P 500 index fund does.  Of course we could have a recession here and there and it usually happens roughly every 10 years or so. That's why you absolutely have to have that safety net. If only someone had told me this I would have many thousands of dollars that I lost as a result being too risky.",

Events such as when covid happened, when war in Ukraine happened, when inflation and unemployment rate was going up, the economy went down and so was the fund.  But the strength of the US economy keeps the stock market up.\n\nIf you are aiming to see a long term result, typically 20 to 30 years into the future, you can definitely try VTI. If you want to get short term results with stable growth, nothing better than a High Yield Savings with 5% annual yield, which is about $4 a month, and the account is insured by FDIC. You basically do nothing to earn that $4 a month.\n\nYou can also try a combination of both, buy 1 share of VTI(you can also just buy $50 or $100 of VTI in fractional shares) and keep the rest in the HYSA. Individual stocks require both knowledge and patience to be studied to see if they have the potential to grow, and studying them requires time, and time is invaluable to a young person, as you can focus on your current study in College and excel at the skills you acquired from that particular study and find a better job or having more backup plans than others.\n\nWhen you have other options to earn income without risking your savings, you will be able to make better choices than others, and that's when your so-called investments begin.",

      "body": "Everyone seems to be ignoring the fact that you have no essential monthly expenses rn bc of your job. While it’s possible you could lose your scholarship (if your GPA falls) or your job (HIGHLY unlikely as an RA though, at least at my school), those scenarios are pretty unlikely and have very little to do with what happens in a stock market crash (RAs don’t get laid off like that). So here’s what you should do…\n\n1. Open a Roth IRA with Fidelity to contribute however much you can toward your current annual limit. (This is tax-free money for you in the future that you can’t go back and make up for later. Also I recommend Fidelity bc they have no fees for so many things most other brokerages charge for.)\n\n2. In the Roth IRA, invest 50% of your money into either FXAIX, VTI, or VT. Invest the other 50% into something that is not correlated at all with equities, examples being bonds, managed futures, and cash equivalents. I personally would do 50% into the leveraged stocks/bonds ETF NTSX and the other 50% into the managed futures ETF DBMF, but it’s important to only invest in what you understand! So for you, I’ll recommend FXAIX and a cash equivalent (SPAXX, SGOV, BOXX, etc., all with very nice yields).\n\n3. If the worst case scenario happens, you can take your contributions (not your earnings) right back out of your Roth IRA penalty-free and tax-free, and since you’re invested in different uncorrelated assets, you can start with only withdrawing whichever one is not at a loss/is losing less. But the worst case scenario seems very unlikely in your situation, so just keep letting that money grow and trying to earn more money to put into that account. This will function as a back-up emergency savings account.\n\n4. Open a credit card and start building your credit score if you haven’t already. Credit cards can buy you up to a month in most cases (or longer if you are willing to take on interest, which I don’t recommend) of extra time to pay off your expenses in that worst case scenario. There are so many good student credit cards out there; let me know if you need recs.\n\n5. Focus on keeping your GPA up and getting the most you can out of your education, and build your financial literacy. There are so many resources universities give students access to. At my school, there was a part of the tutoring center dedicated to teaching students about money management and financial literacy, and that was so incredibly helpful for me. And as an RA, I know you’re already aware of a bunch of the resources students at your campus have access to, so please don’t hesitate to use them yourself!!",
