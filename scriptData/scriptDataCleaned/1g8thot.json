              "body": "that's incorrect. Most, if not all, recessions in the last 60 years occurred AFTER the yield curve un-inverted.\n\nThe yield curve un-inverting merely means starting at the point of positive yield curve (3 month - 10 year = positive number), it is NO LONGER putting stress on the traditional banking system. However, the lag from the negative yield curve can still hit the economy  2 years later and tip it into a recession. The only reason why the yield curve would still be negative when a recession start is if there's an existential shock occurring that the Fed had 0 way of sniffing it out and couldn't have even tried to cut overnight rates before recession happens (something like COVID)\n\nAlso, the 2 year/10 year yield curve inversion is not the metric for recession prediction. It is the 3 month/10 year yield curve, and that's how the guy who did the research coined it. It is because banks don't borrow money with 2 year CD, but at overnight rate set by the Fed. Well at least this is what used to happen. Nowadays, people stopped expecting banks to pay them acceptable interest for their savings account.\n\nBanks borrow at overnight rate, lend out at 10 year rate. If 10 year rate is lower than overnight rate, banks are losing money from lending. Then they cut back on lending, leading to credit crunch, then economic recession.",

                              "body": "Just think about what causes yield curve uninversion. Fed cutting rates. Why does the Fed typically cut rate? Because the economy is getting weaker, on a decelerating path. The difference between a recession and a soft landing is with the soft landing, the deceleration stops before GDP tips negative. Also, it's worth noting that recession starts at the PEAK of economic strength, so using things like current GDP estimate doesn't mean much. Q4 2007 GDP was estimated to be 2.5%. The labor market would lead GDP here, and from past recessions, nonfarm payroll can go from 250k to negative in 2 months.\n\nThe Fed is gonna avoid talking about weak economy and instead talk about lower inflation allowing them to cut rate quicker because what they say affects consumer confidence, and if they say they're worried about the economy, consumers will get worried, and it'll cause a self-fulfilling prophecy. What's fact is in their latest FOMC dot plot, they have increased the risk from mostly higher inflation to higher unemployment rate. They also revised up the peak unemployment rate.\n\nSo think about what happened this summer. Unemployment rate kept going up every month. We got close to 100k nonfarm payroll and was still on a downward trend. Had that continued for a few more months, we would've definitely tipped into a recession.\n\nThe labor market seem to have stopped decelerating for about 1-2 months now, but whether or not it's temporary is yet to be determined. It could resume decelerating within the next 6 months, and then we'd tip into a recession.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates, but how long those rate cuts take to affect the real economy is unknown. Most Fed officials believe between 12-18 months. So just because the yield curve uninverts doesn't mean we're out of the woods. It actually means we'll know the ultimate outcome within 12 months or so.",

That's different enough from your earlier comment \"Yield curve un-inversion says the recession is basically at the front door\" that I don't necessarily disagree with you.\n\nI agree a recession could still potentially be ahead of us, but given that we just showed GDP growth for Q3, we're a minimum of six months away from the old school definition of a recession.\n\nIt's also worth noting that every recession on record happened within 18 months of the earlier indicator of the 2/10 yr yield curve inversion, which last triggered 24 months ago.\n\nWe're already well outside of expected macroeconomic behavior, so I for one am skeptical in assuming expected outcomes in the midst of such unexpected behavior.

Its track record so far has been 100%, but doesn't mean it will continue in the future. But if it does ultimately end up with a recession, then that recession would be very near. In your original comment, you said we're out of the woods once the yield curve un-inverts by the way\n\n\"Once it goes positive the thinking is the risk is behind us and it will be blue skies ahead.\"\n\nWe're not 6 months away from a recession. Recession can start during a positive GDP quarter, as seen from Q4 2007 GDP. If we get negative GDP in the next 6 months, we've already been in a recession for 6+ months. We just couldn't confirm for sure until 6 months later. It doesn't mean recession starts 6 months later, and for sure corporate earnings guidance will start dropping way before the 6 months mark.\n\nOnce again, the 2 yr/10 yr isn't used to predict recession but you came back to it once again. Furthermore, due to consumers refinancing their mortgage and corporates refinancing their debt from 2020, there're good reasons to believe the lag of rate hike will take way longer than in the past. That means the time between yield curve inversion and start of a recession is likely longer, not shorter.\n\nAny companies that are forced to refinance their debt starting now will still get hit with rates that are 3% higher than their current rates. Any homeowners forced to relocate will get hit with mortgage rates that are likely 3% higher than their current rates. But these guys won't cut down on spending until the refinancing actually happens.",
