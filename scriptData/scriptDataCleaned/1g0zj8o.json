  "selftext": "Time is running out for Pepsi to buy Celsius (CELH) \n\nThe bottom is in on Celsius.  The news has been positive and todayâ€™s move up broke a pretty long downward trend.  They are down 70% off their ATH.  Everyone also saw Pepsiâ€™s recent earnings results which were not terrible but not great either.  \n\nPepsi owns Rockstar which tastes like carbonated piss with 8 drops of black licorice and 2 drops of patchouli essential oil.  Monster is owned by Coke and drank by hillbillies at monster truck rallies with un-neutered dogs.  Red Bull is for our exact opposites who work at Goldman Sachs until 1 in the morning everyday because Cramer says thats what they should be doing.\n\nCelsius actually tastes delicious and doesnâ€™t give you the shakes.  It is in every convenience store and grocery store, Walmart and Amazon, and the best store of allâ€¦.Costco.  They are very popular with the younger generation which is what you want to build on.  Most importantly, they have a ton of international expansion still to do.  \n\nPepsi already owns 8.5% of Celsius.  It is unlikely it will ever be this cheap again.  Itâ€™s the Black Friday sale for Celsiusâ€¦.Hopefully Pepsi steps up to drink a six pack of Kiwi-Strawberry and make an offer they canâ€™t refuse.\n\nPositions:  3k shares and $35 C 10/11/24",

I actually had a friend who entered their HQ in Florida to take a peek, empty, no one busy, no one cares. They invent horizontally (dilluting cash flow) - whilst I do agree CELH will eventuelly be bought; they are still WAY too expensive; and that youth who likes it now is nothing else but a 'period that will go away'.\n\nCELH broke various reporting/accounting rules; whilst their board has accounting degrees (LOL) - and simply uses the bottomless pit of supply pool (youth) to still earn. But due to higher competition CELH can't ever growth, they are cornered, will decline further, they are not actively engaged in hedging (anything!) - so this is a ploy as old as methusaleh where the big boy (Pepsi et al) will wait and butcher and blobber them up and throw group board of CELH out the window.",
