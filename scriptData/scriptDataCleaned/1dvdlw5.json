This allows him to capture a tax write off through the deduction, while deferring gains permanently through the \"charitable\" foundation that they only have to pay out 5% of the funds per year. Charitable foundations are nothing but a tax dodge for the wealthy.  The foundation is tax exempt, generates compounding gains at 10% avg based on long-term S&P returns, then only has to pay out half of those gains to remain tax free/compliant.  Most wealthy celebrities set up a \"charity\" so they can dodge taxes.",

      "body": "I've had several Amazon deliveries that have had issues recently. Groceries suddenly not being delivered, other random products getting lost in transit and no updates to indicate where it might have ended up. My son has had similar issues. This is all recent, so they've likely implemented some new software that is not quite working out.  If my personal experience is an indicator of a larger issue, they will likely have some sort of cost incurred for lost products and having to double ship items.  The stock has rallied a lot this last year and the chart looks positive, but if they end up with a hit to earnings, that could be bad. But the options look fully priced, so I'm not sure I can capitalize on it, considering I don't currently have a position. If I owned shares, I might look to trim a bit (like Bezos is doing).  But, I may just watch for a pull back and look to buy some if they get cheap.",
