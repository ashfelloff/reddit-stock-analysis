  "score": 116,
  "selftext": "The United States is projected to triple its semiconductor manufacturing capacity by 2032, following the passing of the landmark CHIPS and Science Act, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Boston Consulting Group.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe CHIPS Act, enacted in 2022, is aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing, and reducing reliance on other countries. It provides $52.7 billion for semiconductor research, development, manufacturing, and workforce development, which includes $39 billion in manufacturing incentives.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmerica's projected 203% increase in fab capacity from 2022 to 2032 contrasts with the 11% increase from the previous decade.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to the report, the U.S. share of world’s chip manufacturing capacity will jump from 10% in 2022 to 14% by 2032. Without the CHIPS Act, the U.S. share would have slipped to 8% by 2032.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe U.S. is expected to grow its share of the advanced logic (below 10nm) manufacturing to 28% of global capacity by 2032, up from 0% in 2022.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAmerica is expected to corner 28% of the total global capital expenditures from 2024-2032, behind only Taiwan's 31%. In the absence of the CHIPS Act, the U.S. would have only been able to capture 9% of global capex by 2032.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFollowing the passing of the CHIPS Act, companies have announced more than 80 new projects across 25 U.S. states, totaling nearly $450 billion in private investments, the report added.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe announced projects are expected to create more than 56,000 jobs in the semiconductor ecosystem and support hundreds of thousands of additional U.S. jobs throughout the U.S. economy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe U.S. is not alone in its efforts to bolster its domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity. The European Union has its own $47 billion Chips Act. India has approved $15.2 billion in investments for semiconductor facilities. Similar programs have emerged in China, Korea, Japan, and around the world.",
