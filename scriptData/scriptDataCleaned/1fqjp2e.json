          "body": "Regarding trading, this advice is misguided.  \nInstead of moving on from it and leaving it behind you asap... learn from it, instead. Improve.\n\nAs for your question, OP, understand that you will simply not be able to consistently time the best entry and the best exit.\n\nHowever, you need to know which side hurts you the most--which one affects your mindset the most.  \nSome traders feel worse when they jump out too early and miss out on gains.  \nOther traders feel worse when they stay too late and give up gains.\n\nBoth are annoying, but you need to identify which one bothers you most.  \nThen, develop your trading strategy to focus on avoiding the side that affects you most.\n\nIf you're not doing it already, try breaking down your stops/trailing stops into several chunks.  \nInstead of closing 100% of your position, close 25% at different intervals. That way, you'll feel you secured some of the profit, while still riding the rest. And ideally, you could evaluate which exit is more profitable over time, to help you decide on whether you need to hold more, or less.",

Move on as soon as possible \\[to the next play\\].\" And that is dangerous because many retail traders are unaware or unable to identify the overall market conditions.  \nTherefore, if we're going through a choppy or range-bound phase, forgetting about the last play and moving on as soon as possible to the next one is not a good idea because they will still get chopped. It's just throwing themselves down the meat-grinder over and over.\n\nGranted, unless you're a professional day trader and you weave in and out quickly. In that case, yeah, forgetting about the previous play, not letting it affect them (positively or negatively), and moving on to the next one is a good ability to have. But that's not OP because a professional day trader would have a pre-established setup for their exit strategy.",
