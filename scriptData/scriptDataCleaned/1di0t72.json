  "selftext": "Alright degenerates, hear me out. While everyone is busy FOMO-ing into Nvidia because of this AI surge, I’ve been looking at the unsung hero in the background: ASML.\n\nFor the regards who don’t know, ASML builds the freaking machines for making the chips. That’s right, those same chips that Nvidia produces and every other tech company out there relies on. Nvidia can’t do jack without ASML’s tech, so why aren’t we talking about them?\n\nNvidia has been printing tendies for us because of AI, but doesn’t that mean ASML is a no-brainer? More demand for Nvidia chips = more demand for ASML’s machines, right? Plus, with this tech war brewing, everyone’s gonna need ASML’s machines to stay competitive.\n\nSo, what’s the play here? Are we sleeping on ASML? Is it time to YOLO into ASML before the rest of the market catches on? Drop your thoughts! 🚀🚀🚀",

CVD. hundreds of products have to move forward.\n\n2nm is not enabled by ASML. it's enabled by teams like mine, at every step of the process, for every new node. my whole job is 2nm right now. I get tired of seeing you regards fall for the marketing like the entire fucking fab is ASML. yes, they are critical. so is AMAT. so is LAM. so is JX NIPPON. \n\neducate yourselves on the actual information instead of blindly following TikTok trends.",

Very high end machine intensive. Further fabs that these expensive solutions are destined for are hugely capital intensive and require very expensive buildings and infrastructure.   What is more likely to happen is their book to build will elevate and the backlog will take years to catch up to.  Be aware that not every market needs or benefits from bleeding edge 4nm or Angstrom capability that ASML provides. Just the CPU's, GPU, TPU, Flash, DRAM and networking markets. Huge markets but not 100% of the game.",
