It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel’s Ofer family.\n\nIran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.\n\nSo Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.\n\nOr as stated here.\n\nIsrael expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. \n\nThe Iranians “don’t want a total war,” said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. “So they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they’ve achieved a great victory.”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-miscalculation-retaliation.html\n\n\nNo direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?\n\nRegardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran’s best interest to keep oil prices elevated.",

Bush Jr delegated just about all his power to Cheney and Rumsfeld while he was in office … Most presidents end up delegating quite a bit of their authority to so-called experts. \n\nDont get me wrong, Trump would likely be great to hang out with - he says crazy stuff that is entertaining and would be a blast to hang with and have some drinks with (if only Trump drank beer) … But he isnt someone I would want to run any company I owned … he is too self-centered and would run it into the ground for his own self image - doesnt ever take responsibility - is the first to throw others under the bus when things go wrong. Just not a good leader in my opinion - great entertainer, not a good leader.\n\nI knew right away the sanctions were useless when India and China agreed to accept Russian oil and gas … Good thing though is that it just has rearranged the distribution of oil and gas … so really hasnt had as much impact on prices as people thought it would - China and India just get more from Russia now and buy less from other sources they previously relied on. Overall, still close to the same amounts being produced and sold in the world - just a rearrangement of who is buying from where. The market finds a way. \n\nYes, I agree that Iran and Russia are hoping to run out the clock … but even if Biden wins reelection - not much will change. They will just keep selling to China and India. \n\nRussia and Iran are hoping that if Trump gets elected they will get some short-term gains when sanctions are eased … even if that happens their benefit will be short term as the markets of the world will just readjust to new supply chains. But everyone loves those short-term gains - so that is what they will be reaching for.",
