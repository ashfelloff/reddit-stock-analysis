You search for something and navigate through results trying to find what you want, while you look at ads along the way.\n\nThat's going to be upended and we'll need to figure out new ways to fund content and ensure that it's not garbage. I don't know what the future will look like but I do know that Google's fundamental business model will be impacted and they'll need to adapt to it if they want to keep the money spigot flowing.",
