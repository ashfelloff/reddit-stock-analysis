I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.  \nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Carry Trade That Blew Up Markets Is Attracting Hedge Funds Again](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-16/yen-carry-trade-risks-making-comeback-as-hedge-funds-reload-bets)\n\n* [XHB](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=XHB&p=d) - News that Harris will propose providing up to $25K in down payment support for 1st time homeowners, with more generous support for 1st generation homeowners, watching housing ETFs/stocks on this. (DHI/LEN/TOL)\n* [RILY](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RILY&p=d) - Under financial probe- gave loss warning of markdown of $330M-370M, and this is the third time bank delayed reporting with SEC this year. Co-founder offered to buy rest of the company. ($7 a share). Also worth watching all the random senior notes (RILYT/RILYZ/RILYB/RILYN/RILYM/RILYG, etc)\n* [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - We saw ASTS make a massive move from $21 to $33 yesterday due to earnings, watching both the $30 and $35 level. Biased short on this but won’t take a position unless we make a sharp move to the upside or we hang above $30 for longer.\n* [FICO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=FICO&p=d) - Less of a liquid stock and high priced, but we’re seeing a large move from execs selling shares. Somewhat unusual due to the share sales being relatively small (4800 shares). Going to be very light in trading this if I do.\n* [AMAT](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMAT&p=d) - Reported earnings of 2.12 EPS (in line with expectations) and revenue of 6.78 vs 6.65B expected. Cited revenue growth, margin improvement and strong performance in key segments. Not sure why a sell-off occurred, but will update if I find out. (then again, it did have a pretty strong rally from the panic a few weeks back)",

      "body": "I’ve been trading OXY since last fall. Buffett likes them and holds 255 million shares. He’s been buying more recently when the price has been in the high $50’s. Buffett also has a huge cash pile, so it stands to reason that Buffett will continue to buy more shares if the price drops. That should help create a floor.\n\nToday I sold the $57 put with the 8/23 expiration date. I got $0.37 in premium and the trade lasts one week. So I divide the $0.37 in premium by the $57 strike and I get 0.0065. Then I multiply that by 52, because I’m risking the money for one week, and I could do a trade similar to this on this or another company 52 times over the course of a year. And I get an annualized return of 33%.\n\nI’m doing this with one tranche of what I’m willing to put into OXY, and I already have three tranches of OXY with a total cost basis of $52.74 per share. This put option reduces my cost basis down to $52.62 per share. If I get assigned the shares at $57 I’ll collect the dividend on 9/10, then sell a covered call at the $57 strike. Here’s an [example](https://inactiveinvestments.com/weekly-options-trade/).",

I know they blocked Nvidia/ARM  years ago but intel is a national security safety net to get it stateside, intel is at one of its lowest points price wise, lawsuits, etc. What do you think on a possible acquisition there and what do you think about intel as a short/medium term buy (6mos-1.5yr)?
