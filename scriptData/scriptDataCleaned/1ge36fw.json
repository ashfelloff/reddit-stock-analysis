  "selftext": "Big fucking week ahead guys, look at the earnings calendar: AMD, GOOG, SNAP, RDDT, MSFT, META, COIN, HOOD, ETSY, UBER, PTON, AMZN, AAPL, INTC—all reporting this week. Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.\n\nToday I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they’ll be in the TLDR at the bottom.\n\n1. **CROX** \\- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don’t care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don’t realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That’s what I did, and I’ve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.\n2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square—they're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hu87v4wtghxd1.jpg?width=4271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb91dc692518920b8eb71299312b68113b2e6be8\n\n**tldr:  PYPL go down, CROX go up**\n\n**bonus plays:** I'm shorting both **CDNS** (Cadence Design Systems), and **AMKR** (Amkor Technology). Smaller position.\n\nMy positions:\n\n[Using 5x leveraged CFD's \\(europoor\\). Total position of $28.5k](https://preview.redd.it/1phkmlps5ixd1.png?width=1351&format=png&auto=webp&s=137e122bb78552b0461de5f2dfc05ee759e88715)\n\n*This is not financial advice, do not follow these plays, you will lose money, pleas do not sue me*\n\nGod bless America\n\nEDIT: (3:20 PM EST)\n\n[Covered my PYPL short 40 min before close, not feeling confident anymore. ](https://preview.redd.it/eya5sklvrjxd1.png?width=635&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecf8a8b8181559d8842da41940f4501f13c997fd)\n\n[Only holding these now](https://preview.redd.it/fenv1628sjxd1.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=038f82ab4165d078d86d4af9322870d0a04027d7)\n\nResults\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hy230toc7pxd1.png?width=639&format=png&auto=webp&s=abffdbf773ec22133d2eeb77d149681b106f304c\n\n  \nEdit 2:\n\nIm very busy today so no post sry, ill be back tomorrow😈",
