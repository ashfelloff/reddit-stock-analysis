  "score": 96,
  "selftext": "Hello all, currently AMZN is a significant part of my portfolio because…\n\nThey are the biggest player in cloud serving. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the backbone for many companies. Look at Netflix: it would take them 3+ years to transition out of using AWS, so they probably won’t do that. Amazon can up their charges to these companies, much like how Apple can within the App Store. And the bigger these companies get, the more money Amazon makes.\n\nAmazon is a diversified company. When I buy an Amazon share, I am buying a technology, entertainment, and retail business. So to see it as one uniform business doesn’t make much sense.\n\nThey are investing so much into AI infrastructure that they could potentially be one of the most benefited companies from AI. \n\nTheir PE ratio instills doubt into a lot of investors; on paper it looks like an expensive company currently. However, the reason why that is, is because they underreport earnings. They reinvest so much into their business, and this expense hurts net income, thus high PE. However, they will gradually report more and more net income and the E in PE will look a lot better. Now is the time to buy, when investors are discouraged by the high PE. Just buy now and hold for 20 years.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",

Until AMD and Intel catch up or find their own niche nvdia is going to be top market. It's going to take one of those two to catch up in order to stabilize this area of the market. Then nvdia will really drop. \nIn the end they will all grow In value. Tech stocks dropped a ton but recovered by almost 50% already. I'm pretty sure most of it has to do with dividend payouts coming up and alot of people pulling out to influence others to pull out so they can buy more shares for less money yielding a higher dividend payout.\nWas also aware that in my portfolio, I hadn't lost a single day until Thursday. So it wasn't surprising to see it drop. Still came out green overall even with the sell off. So it is what it is. I buy and hold so fluctuations like that don't really phase me.

We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 10.6 billion and 10.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2023.\n\nThe board has to approve such dilutions, but they do this every year in order to continue to award employees RSUs. This is why employees are told at each compensation review that any RSUs granted are subject to board approval.\n\nAnd this is not necessarily a bad thing for shareholders: doing this allows Amazon to attract employees with 10s or hundreds of thousands (sometimes millions) of dollars of compensation without having to come up with the cash for it. It increases free cash flow, which allows for more investment. As long as Amazon can use the money they save to grow the company faster than they dilute shares (which they seem to be quite good at), the board and shareholders will be happy to keep doing this.",

I haven't accumulated since and instead put it in several other smaller companies.  \n\nPersonally I think AMZN is undervalued and will go up much higher.  My GOOG shares I bought around the same time are outperforming AMZN over 100% but at one point back in like 2019 AMZN outperformed GOOG (around that time)   \n\nI plan to hold these until i'm much older I've been through some crazy drops for sure but just kept it.   You can't go wrong.   (unless there is some accounting scandle)",
