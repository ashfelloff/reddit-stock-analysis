So far Elon has said they will release robots that are basically \"sentient\" by the end of the year and a cheap Tesla is coming (which has been promised as \"coming soon\" multiple times in the past). The company has fucked up huge multiple times recently like with it's rollout of \"Full Self-Driving mode\" which got recalled after causing almost 1000 accidents and killing a few dozen people. Their defense in the current government probe is that \"Full Self-Driving mode\" is not Full Self-Driving and the operator must have their hands on the wheel to take over at any time. They are basically claiming Full Self-Driving mode an advanced form of cruise control..... which is 100% not how they talked about it before this inquiry nor it is something which is evident in it's name being \"Full Self-Driving mode\".\n\nTheir latest car was Elon's pet project and we have no idea how much money was wasted in it's creation but it is a piece of shit that is unable to be driven through a car wash, corrodes it you do not constantly clean the surface of it and has many other extraordinarily stupid issues. The CyberTruck landed at the lowest spot on Consumer Reports list of trucks. \n\nSo is the government probe into Full Self-Driving mode priced in? Is the flop of the CyberTruck priced in?\n\nGiven Elon's past of making promises and under delivering or straight up not delivering the \"faster rollout of the model 2\" will either not happen or it will happen and somehow be a piece of shit.
