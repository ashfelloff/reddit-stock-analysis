That is the 12 month target by some analysts. It’s also a few weeks after the late December, 2024 earnings. No one can be sure of how much of an economic slow down we may be in for. Let’s see how the markets react to the likely FOMC rate cuts in September and December. If the market is jubilant, you may make a killing. If not, you may have to cut your losses. \n\nI am long NVDA and sell 30 covered calls every week at 3 different strikes. As long as their backlog remains huge, I am comfortable. It will take competitors a long time to be able to compare with the Blackwell GPU’s, and then it won’t be part of NVDA’s ecosystem, which all the mega caps are buying into. By the time anyone comes close, NVDA will come up with something 4 times faster. \n\nOh, and by the way, the Blackwell system uses so much less electricity than any in house chip the mega caps may build on their own, the Blackwell chip is essentially free over time with the energy savings at the data centers. That information is directly from Jensen himself. \n\nThese are my opinions only. Invest at your own risk. Diversity is best, but I’ll admit to gambling a bit.",

If you aren’t in a position to be on the market all day, I’m not sure it would be a good idea.

Most investors I know feel the same way. Tax cuts for the wealthy won’t help any of us if Putin starts using tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, or China blockades Taiwan. Our armed forces are currently ready to make a hellscape for the Chinese military if they attempt the blockade, but the idea of a war with China is frightening to the entire world. Under the prior head of the PRC, China was becoming a flourishing member of the world. Under Xi Jinping, they are going downhill in very way. He’s taken away hope. That’s what authoritarians do.
