Now that they are worth essentially nothing, funding will grind to a stop.

You just have to hope that they aren't going to be straddled with debt in the midst of all that and massively underperform their competition.\n\nAnd for that reason, I think you should not be going all in on a company that has no track record of success (i.e. profitability, not growing revenue at the expense of equity).",

Watching the stock fall for over six months must have been tough without any mental stop-loss or strategy in place. It's possible that the information you initially came across was influenced by paid advertisements, which can be misleading. In investing, it's crucial to set clear expectations about potential gains, but equally important to decide in advance how much you're willing to lose and how long you're prepared to wait for returns. It's unfortunate when money is lost so easily, almost like taking candy from a toddler. I hope, despite the negative outcome, this experience has provided valuable lessons in investment strategy.",
