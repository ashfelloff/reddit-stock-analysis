      "body": "The hole in the US balance of payments is slowly widening, in the second quarter the current account deficit reached $266.7 bln, over the last 4 quarters it amounted to $0.95 trillion. A large deficit of $1.1 trillion a year in goods is partially offset by the services sector (+$288 bln). The revenue situation continued to deteriorate (-$144 bln y/y). \n\nOne of the problems here in recent years has been the fall in US net investment income to 0.09% of GDP, which had been as high as 1-1.5% of GDP before 2020, but rising interest rates and a relatively strong dollar have brought it to near zero. More and more debt has to be paid, in this sense the dollar is a fundamentally unstable currency that if rates fall too quickly (risk-adjusted of course) will come under pressure due to reduced capital inflows, if rates remain elevated will remain strong in the moment but will continue to face further current account degradation and problems over the long term horizon. \n\nEspecially given that the commodity deficit is only growing so far: the last 4 months have averaged around $100 bln monthly, i.e. approaching ~1.2 trillion annualized levels. And this is despite the fact that over the last 15 years the US has shifted from being a net energy importer to a net energy exporter, but everything it has saved on that has been spent on something else. \n\nTotal external liabilities on the international investment position rose by $7.6 trillion to a record $57.1 trillion last year, while assets only rose by $3.2 trillion to $35.8 trillion, the net international investment position is negative at -$21.3 trillion, or 75% of GDP. At some point, this imbalance will have to be “unloaded” on foreign investors, but what form and when?",
