A year ago at this time of year, the three-month average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now it‚Äôs only 116k (142k in August), and the long-term norm is about 190k per month.\n\nAt the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30% or minus 86k (from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed).\n\nIt‚Äôs still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3-month average is 0.07% per month, the YTD average is 0.11%, and the 12-month average is 0.12%, while the medium-term rate before COVID (2017-2019) was 0.13% per month and the 10-year long-term rate is 0.16%.\n\nThe visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the long-term trend in job creation. It‚Äôs not a crisis (requires at least three months of job contraction) or a recession (a rate of about 0.03% per month averaged over 3-6 months), but the first clear signal.\n\nIt should be taken into account that BLS manipulates data and recently ¬´lost¬ª over 800 thousand employed, yesterday they revised the data for the worse by 30% and it is not excluded that soon we will find out that all this is a complete fake and the economy is in recession since spring 2024.\n\nIt‚Äôs important to note the structural degradation: \n\n- Native American workers have lost about 1.5 million jobs since the beginning of 2020, replaced by over 3 million migrants (mostly from Mexico).\n\n- More than 2 million part-time (low-wage) jobs have gained over the past year with nearly 1.5 million full-time jobs lost. \n\nWhere is the job growth concentrated? Over the past year, 85% of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment - mostly low-paying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services (the highest paying) have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008.\n\nAll signs point to a dip into recession soon.",
