I believe there is also a timing component you can elect to have as well. For example you could chose, I'd like to sell 100 shares from my award at $0.49 cents if stock reaches $100 before 2025. Once that criteria is hit the shares are automatically sold. \n\nThese plans are made years in advance and once they are made you typically cannot make edits to your elections until the plan is up for refresh (usually every few years). \n\nThe CEOs arnt trading on any inside knowledge from the day lol that would be inherent insider trading.",
