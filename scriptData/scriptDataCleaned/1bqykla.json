I was like at this rate you need a $500 bill because the buy in for these tables is a $1000 if you want a decent chance to play for awhile. Even more if it's craps with a $50 pass line. I remember when a lot of the ATM caps were $400-500 withdrawals, so it kind of baffled me. Didn't realize you could just pull out $20k now so easily direct to a machine.",
