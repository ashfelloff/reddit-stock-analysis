Somehow my post is deleted, honestly it was probably me because idk how to use Reddit really and I was finally able to comment because of something called karma, anyways. \n\nSome of you highly regarded people with funny comments have now given me the motivation to reload my account fr fr this time. It‚Äôs about to go down tomorrow on payday. OTM calls is the plan, and I mean OTM. Wendy‚Äôs or homelessandfailedtofollowmystoplossplandies \n\n‚≠êÔ∏èü´∂üèº",
