The regime legitimizes itself based on economic growth and has a very public 5% growth target it has committed to with no way to fulfill. \n\nTraditionally, they juiced growth with real estate and infrastructure projects (funded by land sales to build new real estate on). Now real estate is in the crapper, dragging consumer confidence (consumption) and government revenues down with it. Nobody wants to invest in them because of their constant saber rattling, so their last place to turn is exports. The government has been pouring in subsidies to boost exports, but all their trading partners (even developing economies like Turkey and South Africa) are imposing tariffs because they don’t want subsidized Chinese products destroying their local industries. \n\nAnd if that wasn’t bad enough, the one child policy also created an irreversible demographic death spiral.\n\nOn the plus side, they can always just keep cooking the books and try to pretend everything is fine.",

Why the F would anyway buy that when they can buy SF NYC or any other place? The only ones were those already rich and have disposable incomes and they kept the party going keeping prices high for no reason when the average chinese person cannot afford anything close to that.\n\nThen like what the diamond industry did to the US, capitalism made it so that if a chinese man wanted to marry a chinese woman you need to buy a house as a requirement. So these kids/parents of the groom would be mortgaging their own houses so that they can afford to give it to their sons to get married. Since the 1 child policy there are tons more men than women so the women made it a requirement to the relationship. Chinese women was never like this before, but they take their cues from western media and became what it was. So people are getting married because they have a piece of paper (or red book) saying they own a house even if the house is being built and not constructed yet. Why? Because capitalism, 1 child policy, social media and western influences.   \nSo what do these corps do? they follow the money and kept building as fast as possible. And what does the supplier do? make more building materials sometimes at sub par standards to crank out as much as possible. \n\nCombine that with the global cooling of economies and trade. Aggressive stance on their neighbors and predatory \"joint ventures\", belt and road, lending money/building infra for poor nations to entrap them and COVID. It was a thousand cuts, some deeper than others, but they all contributed to this. And technically unlike US 2008, China has not crashed yet but it is a slow moving train wreck. Could they save it? Yes but it would take a lot of capital and pain.\n\nI am not sure how to trade this, you need good builders but this crash will impact them as well... the only thing I can think of is maybe heavy industries and war/defense.",

      "body": "China’s consumer confidence chart looks like it straight-up fell off a cliff, and honestly, can you blame them? The economy’s moving slower than a DMV line, the real estate market is basically held together by duct tape and prayer (looking at you, Evergrande), and if you’re a young person trying to find a job, well, congrats, you’ve entered hunger games: unemployment edition.\n\nMeanwhile, the US and China are throwing sanctions and tariffs at each other like it’s dodgeball in middle school. Global demand for Chinese stuff? Dropping faster than my motivation on a Monday morning.\n\nOh, and let’s sprinkle some deflation on top of that dumpster fire people holding on to their cash like it’s going to magically be worth more tomorrow. Spoiler alert: it won’t help.\n\nAnd then you’ve got the government randomly smacking down entire sectors like it’s playing whack-a-mole. Tech? Bonk. Education? Bonk. It’s like every business is just waiting for the hammer to come down next.\n\nSo yeah, if you’re wondering why consumer confidence is doing the limbo under 90 points, it’s because China’s economy is basically trying to win an Olympic gold in “how low can you go.”",
