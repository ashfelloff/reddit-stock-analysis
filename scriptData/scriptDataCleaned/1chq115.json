  "title": "Starbucks CEO Gets Unusual Drubbing on CNBC Following Earning Miss and Guidance Cut",
  "score": 526,
  "selftext": "Starbucks CEO Laxman Narasimhan received an unusually cold reception on CNBC’s Squak on the Street this morning following an earnings miss and guidance cut. The hostile witness, erm, CEO, cited consumer caution (specifically related to downtrends in visits by the occasional customer), economic volatility, competition, and yes, the weather. Never seen Cramer so confrontational and critical of a guest. At one point, Cramer criticized Starbucks’ ongoing expansion in the face of declining sales as “perilous to the existential existence of Starbucks.” Yes, the existential existence. Following Narasimhan’s comment that Starbucks is gaining market share, Cramer cited Dunkin’ Donuts, Tim Horton’s, and McDonalds stating that Starbucks is losing share in the coffee/beverage space. Cramer ended the interview by noting that Narasimhan’s characterization of speed-of-service issues were “fanciful statements” and he doesn’t know how the CEO “could say it on our air.” Rubbing his brow in frustration, Cramer said “I think your through-put is awful, sir!” Apparently, customers are placing orders on the app and not picking them up because it takes too long. Been there, done that. Starbucks is down nearly 17% at 12pm EST today. Puts on Starbucks?",
