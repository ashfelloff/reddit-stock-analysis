At some point they will either be bought out, go bankrupt or simply become irrelevant. A good company will have paid in dividends and stock buybacks an amount that is more then they raised in capital plus some level in interest. \n\nBut they may be a good investment for some time yet.",

Google has TPU. Microsoft has their Maia chip. Amazon has Trainium and Inferentia chips. Meta has MTIA. Teslas has Dojo chips. Apple has their own silicon for on device inference and may be working on server chips (right now they use TPUs on GCP). Then you have AMD who has a competitive line up the next few years. You also have Groq LPU which is doing inference much faster. In the medium term I think Nvidia’s profit margins are at risk. Nvidia is only a chip designer not a manufacturer.
