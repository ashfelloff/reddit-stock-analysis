Before I knew it I was down about $110k. I have a pretty good paying job so it wasn‚Äôt horrible but I mean I would love to have a $110k back. \n\nNow I‚Äôve started a whole new method of investing. Dont trade short dated options with my entire portfolio. Instead I put about $60k into my account and decided to just invest like a normal human being and so far it‚Äôs worked out great for me the last 3 months. Still a long way to go but let‚Äôs see.\n\n",
