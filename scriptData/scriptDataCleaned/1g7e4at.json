Typically delays in this situation end up getting approval after a few more months but unclear how soon it’d be. The delay may be partly due to quality control violations the FDA found in April. Unclear. That’s the concerning part for me. But since that was 6 months ago so I’m waiting to see if they put out a press release about it. \n\nI think they’re still likely to be approved. The leak about violations in April is looking like a potential attempt to manipulate the stock price (/tinfoilhat) for a lower entry point. Their treatment is already being used Ukraine and other countries and it’s had a lot of success. It’s just such a big step I think FDA is doing extra DD and HUMA will be fine as long as they addressed the FDA’s concerns. \n\ntl;dr I’d guess within another month based on everything I’ve read but there isn’t a confirmed date yet after the delay in August.",
