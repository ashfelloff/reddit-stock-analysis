  "selftext": "The value of AMD stock since the 7th of March 2024 was $162 and it's going to be decreasing in value until at least a week before the earnings call on the 30th of April. Since Zen 5 is coming to market in roughly three months and there's going to considerable performance uplifts of a 20% increase in instructions per clock and 30% multicore performance. AMD processors are already dominating the consumer market in terms of performance and they've been delivering a beatdown in the server space with their more cores per core per CPU. As for TSM their foundries are coming online early next next year for volume production for all their advanced process nodes.\n\nThe stock prices are going fluctuate or decrease in value until at least first or second quarter before the sentiment shifts and every vaguely intelligent technology investor will buy in. The (delay or hold back in terms of progress or development) of this subreddit might be able to make a double play with AMD and TSM given that the average sentiment will be that AMD do good and AMD use TSM fab therefore invest in TSM despite the fact the primary operational fabs are in Taiwan. I think this should be a good play for you high functioning (delay or hold back in terms of progress or development) individuals. The lame ass automatic moderation is infringing on my ability to participate in high functioning gambling by discussing finances in the frame of esoteric shitposting.",
