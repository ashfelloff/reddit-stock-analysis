I would say they created comparable (and probably longer lasting) value compared with Musk, who is more of a hype man than an engineer (Jobs was kind of similar in this regard, I guess).  \n  \nSpaceX is really cool, and Musk was essential for Tesla at first, but he is bringing as much cost as benefit at this point. Let's look at some of his actions:\n\n* Cybertruck (early PR nightmare and likely failure)\n* Neglecting best selling models (Model Y and Model 3 designs are dated) as competition heated up (leading to significant price cuts)\n* Firing the SuperCharger team just as charging was becoming a cash cow\n* Doomed true FSD by ditching radar/lidar against the advice of his engineers. Waymo, Cruise and Mercedes have all surpassed Tesla in key areas (although *all* self-driving systems are still bad)\n* Tesla Semi (insufficient hauling capacity, orders appear suspended, destined for failure)\n* Has lied about upcoming FSD and robo-taxi functionality for *years*, to the point where there's now a fraud investigation\n* Roadster is still MIA after 2017 announcement (and pre-orders)\n* Pissing off older liberals (Tesla's core market) with his tweets\n* Sexual harassment allegations\n* Embarrassing distractions like humanoid robot\n\nTesla is the second-worst performing stock in the S&P 500 over the past year. Yes, EV sales are slowing overall, but Musk isn't helping the situation.\n\n>  \nEV/Hybrids have been around for a LONG time before Tesla yet Tesla is light years ahead of them.\n\nYou should test drive some more recent EVs. Tesla still has the best range, but they are falling behind when it comes to build quality, styling, and interior feel. Yes, Teslas have Autopilot and Supervised Full Self-Driving, but why would people pay extra for self-driving that requires you to hold the steering wheel?   \n  \nIf I can't drink beers in the back seat on the way home from work, it's not self-driving.",

Since then they’ve built mega factories in Austin-Berlin-Shanghai, made insane progress in AI/FSD, best selling vehicle of 2023 / top 5 of 2024, and made mind blowing progress on the Optimus humanoid robot program. \n\nThere’s absolutely no telling what the next 5-6 years will look like. Honestly if Elon has achieved the initial stages of mass deployment of a Robo-taxi network + $20-30k humanoid robot for sale to consumers & companies for labor by 2030, Elon should be quite replaceable from there tbh - - much in the sense Steve Jobs was for Apple or Bezos for Amazon. But Tesla - as it stands right now, is still not ready to walk without Elon. They’re literally in the middle of developing these revolutionary programs; what sense would it make for a CEO to leave a company he has devoted his life to when he is so close to laying the groundwork of his overall goal + shareholders are clearly on his side & just provided him a massive $50 billion paycheck lol?\n\n\nMy bold prediction is Elon massively backs off the politics posting if Trump wins the 2024 election and the media moves on from him. Wouldn’t be surprised if Elon sells Twitter too.",

Would you stay at your job knowing that not only are you not going to be paid in the future (he has no forward looking pay package, even now), but also knowing that they are going to take all the money you earned over the last 6 years? Elon worked since 2018 with the knowledge and motivation that if he could 10x the stock and hit these achievement milestones, he would be paid a massive amount of money. I mean, no wonder the guy slept at the damned factory. If someone was offering to pay me 56 billion I would be sleeping at the factory too! So imagine having worked for 6 years under the assumption that you were getting a massive payday if you performed at your absolute best, only to have it yanked away after you succeeded to deliver the required results. You would leave the company. And so would Elon. And Tesla without Elon is absolute garbage. If there were an Elon fund, I would invest in that instead of Tesla or SpaceX or any other single company. Elon is the man behind the magic at any of these endeavors, and if you don't understand that, you have been duped by fake news or are completely delusional.\n\nFor shareholders the offer was this: 10x the value of your shares, or Elon gets paid nothing. Are you kidding? There's no share dilution there! That's an incredible deal for shareholders. Imagine you own GM stock, and I became CEO and said I will 10x the value of the stock, and if I do, you pay me 1 of those Xs. 9x for you. And if I can't do it, I get nothing. Doesn't that sound like an incredible deal to you? Sounds like a dumb deal for me.
