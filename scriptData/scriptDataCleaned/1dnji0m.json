The most recent year was in 2022 and the next one will be in 2029. Here is the data:\n\n\n\n|Year in Cycle|Average Total Return (Stock Market)|Standard Deviation|Count|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Year 1|6.34%|16.98%|33|\n|Year 2|12.50%|15.91%|33|\n|Year 3|9.81%|16.24%|33|\n|Year 4|12.28%|15.94%|33|\n|Year 5|12.06%|14.32%|33|\n|Year 6|5.62%|17.14%|33|\n|Sabbatical Year|-0.35%|20.00%|33|\n|Average (All Years)|8.23%|17.34%|231|\n\nThe data is significant (ρ = 0.0157)\n\nFor context, these are the market results from several sabbatical years.\n\n* 2022 saw the great bond correction\n* 2015 saw several flash crashes\n* 2008 Housing Crises\n* 2001 Tech Bubble\n* 1994 The Great Bond Massacre\n* 1987 Black Monday\n* 1973 The Golden Bear\n* 1966 A massive correction\n* 1931 The worst year on record\n* 1917 A massive recession\n* Panic of 1910\n* Rich Man's Panic 1903\n* 1882 The first year of the Long Depression\n* 1854 saw a correction\n* 1833 The shutdown of the Second Bank of the U.S.\n* The Panic of 1819\n\nThis cycle affects bond markets too (ρ = 0.0069)\n\n|Year in Cycle|Average Total Return (Composite Bonds)|Standard Deviation|Count|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Year 1q|6.38%|8.61%|33|\n|Year 2|5.94%|8.06%|33|\n|Year 3|8.51%|8.37%|33|\n|Year 4|6.36%|5.65%|33|\n|Year 5|6.38%|5.91%|33|\n|Year 6|4.14%|7.34%|33|\n|Sabbatical Year|1.19%|7.44%|33|\n|Average (All Years)|5.53%|7.72%|231|\n\nBeware of 2029.",

Calculating forward to 99 years (which is 9 cycles), the date is 2028. Maybe solar radiation affects the commodities (crops) production which in turn affects the market in general. When the 7 years cycle coincides with solar cycles, there will be some major events. \n\nSunspot cycle in economics is an actual term, look it up.

You picked the worst year of the great depression but not the year when the downturn started, which was 1929. Ok fine, but why pick the year when the dotcom bust started (2001) and not the worst year of decline in the downturn (2002).\n\nThe panic of 1907 was much more significant than the panic of 1910, but that doesn't fit in. The panic of 1907 ultimately led to the establishment of the Fed,\n\nWhat so special about flash crashes in 2015? The real original flash crash was in 2010. Why does some flash crashes belong in the same list as the Great Depression anyway? \n\nAnd what about euro crisis, the asian financial crisis, the russian debt crisis, the oil crises of 1973 and 1979? And all the other major economic and financial events which appears in the middle of the seven year cyles which are far worse events than what happened on the seventh year.\n\nThe point is that without some underlying theory, how do you know that cycle you found isn't just the result of p-hacking?
