The level of commitment and effort invested in providing insights to benefit countless individuals does not receive the recognition it deserves. In just a month, I've made half my yearly income since I've begun options trading. While I've encountered my fair share of setbacks along the way, the guidance provided by these DDs (and comments) has empowered me to make more informed decisions and recover. It's truly remarkable to live in an era where an average Joe like myself can work an extra full-time job and profit from the markets. The majority of us would not have been able to do this 5-10 years ago on our own. Thank you, gentlemen, for your invaluable contributions!\n\nSpecial shoutout to the DWAC/DJT (u/kk7766) and PAA (u/PuzzleheadedTear5969) guys!!!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ac8oxv21w9tc1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=53b08b13542105b5335db50ad61f9782ab989db6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mjmyzxd1w9tc1.png?width=1402&format=png&auto=webp&s=c390753dffe6301e82c685e0d4b4494ca6742e3f",

      "body": "Same here - thanks for everyone who posts Due Diligence posts. They are fascinating and interesting reads.\n\nAs for me - haven‚Äôt got a courage to spend more money on options (although I have investing in stocks for 10+ years). I bought just a single SZU option (just to try) and it is loosing money. Well, spend like 40 euros for it, therefore not much harm.\n\nWill need to have more courage and buy some US options for like 100 or so USD. Need to educate myself.\n\nThanks again for DD posters!",
