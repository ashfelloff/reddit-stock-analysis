  "score": 679,
  "selftext": "Microsoft shares fell 7% in extended trading on Tuesday after the software company reported disappointing cloud revenue, overshadowing stronger earnings and revenue than analysts had predicted.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion vs. $64.39 billion expected\n\nMicrosoft’s revenue increased 15% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $22.04 billion, was up from $20.08 billion, or $2.69 per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nRevenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% during the quarter. Analysts polled by CNBC and StreetAccount had expected 31% growth. Microsoft doesn’t disclose revenue from the category in dollars. Last week Google parent Alphabet said revenue from its cloud business, encompassing Workspace productivity software and Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, went up by about 29%. \n\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter, Microsoft started selling Surface PCs with AI features that can run certain models locally without the need for an internet connection. Dell, HP and other device makers also touted their own so-called Copilot+ PCs. CEO Satya Nadella said at a press briefing in May that “we’re bringing real joy and a sense of wonder back to creation on the PC.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/30/microsoft-msft-q4-earnings-report-2024.html",

But those expectation have to be delivered upon at some point. Not delivering on those baked in confidence will inevidently lead to SOME investors wonder if it's the best use of their money. After all, if the growth of 2 years is already baked in the price, why hold it. Holding it now means you expect much further growth on top of existing baked in growth. In today's tech market, growth could split between multiple players very fast. Just look at the entire cloud ecosystem where so many companies are trading at more than $25B. These mega stocks are victims of their own success as they face targeted competition in their growth streams from people who know the most - exemployees. \n\nThe argument of social embedding is moot to some extent. No company is truly embedded in our lives long term. Everything can be replaced pretty fast. Just look at the success of Google office suite compared to MS's cloud suite offering. Google killed MS at their own game with just a small twist - being on cloud. Look at past examples like IBM, Intel and Cisco who were deeply embedded into society just 10-15 years ago and are now scraping for growth.",
