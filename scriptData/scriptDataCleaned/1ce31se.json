  "selftext": "Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.\n\nHere are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now\n\n* Fall in phone sales especially in China\n* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \\~9% for the year.\n* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.\n* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)\n* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)\n* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense\n\nHowever, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.\n\nInstall Base & Great Product recognition\n\nBefore I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.\n\nApple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?\n\nAI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.\n\n~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~\n\nApparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)\n\nThe fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. \n\nAs much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.\n\nOther hardware, such as \"The PIN\" and \"the Rabbit\" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.\n\nEdge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.\n\nSamsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.\n\nAll for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.\n\nLook for Apple to begin that story this June.\n\nMy position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time.",

The most they ever do is say there’s something interesting in a space and they’re looking into it. Then a few things may leak, like the Vision Pro project out the apple car project. \n\nApple is the most valuable company in the world. It doesn’t need to justify its future plans with anyone, at least not now. They the writing on the wall about China years before you did. They knew the Vision Pro was going to be an overhyped stepping stone into future technologies that wouldn’t pay dividends for many years. I’m not saying they’ve got it figured out, because they obviously don’t. But they aren’t worried about the things you’re worried about. They aren’t seeing Nvidia as a direct competitor or competition to beat because see themselves in a whole other space that just happens to overlap in a few places.\n\nThat being said, I think Apple has a LOT it needs to improve on. Siri hasn’t evolved in a decade, Vision Pro strategy needs to rethought, Apple car project was a major flop, iPhone updates have been lackluster for years, the Mac space was a huge jump in 2020 but needs improvement now (especially with base configs, there’s an article how that hasn’t improved at all since TC took over), and much more.\n\nTim Cook is an amazing operations executive, but not a visionary. So I think that, plus the fact that Apple makes nearly all their decisions in the small bubble of a world that is Silicon Valley thinking, is affecting their products and trajectory.\n\nIf Apple was mainly concerned about stock price, they would care to talk more about their AI strategy or make splashy announcements. But like I said, that’s not their style. They could destroy the markets in Monday if they announced they were focusing on building chips for AI based on what they’ve learned making chips for iPhones and Macs, but they won’t do that even if they were doing exactly that. \n\nTLDR; Apple is Apple and doesn’t care what you think or anyone thinks about their stock price. They don’t make announcements reflecting that.",

With google, search is the obvious one that has continued for almost 2 decades. The iphone also launched in 2007 with google maps and youtube baked into its OS. Apple benefitted from being able to tailor the maps and youtube experience to its own users for years, and google benefitted massively from exposure that contributed to their continued dominance today. Same thing with microsoft and office in the 80s. Apple outsourced office to microsoft for the macintosh and is why MS exists as a company today. And same with apple card and goldman sachs (but maybe not as good for goldman). There are many examples of this. Cutting great deals is what apple does. Would you prefer apple rush development of an in house LLM like it did with maps and tarnish its reputation further in this critical time for the company? Surely given the time constraints and the fact that apple isn't pouring as many billions into H100s, any in house LLM released this year won't exceed let alone match the competition offered by GPT, anthropic, google, etc. But I doubt apple will have any issues 1. cutting a great deal with any existing LLM to integrate into its ecosystem and 2. integrating this LLM to the ecosystem and its local AI efforts in a way that is innovative or at least easier to use than existing AI solutions in windows, android, etc. Steve chose Tim Apple for a reason. I think it's reasonable to still have some faith in this company.",

No. It's going to be integrated into your OS. And not just on your phone, but on your computer. It'll help you manage your home automation and know your music/tv preferences. It'll plan your schedule out for you. It'll keep track of your health via daily biometric measurements provided by your watch and offer recommendations to stay in shape. What is the one platform out there that incorporates these across all your devices under a single account? Apple. Apple is by far the best positioned company out there that can bring consumers a jarvis like AI. All this AI hype around chatbots in the browser or suggestions baked into your OS translates to a clunky experience if your windows machine has a different AI than your android phone and your amazon echo. Imagine having to think about which AI to listen to or telling the other AI what it missed out on every day because it doesn't have access to your other devices. It isn't going to work. Apple just needs to pull it off.",

Inventing a new category such as the smartphone results in a “dominant design” and from then one innovation is more incremental than radical.\n\nApple is leading the world in almost all categories they play in - claiming they are not “innovative” just because they haven’t pushed a stupid 2 display phone or whatnot to the market is just pure BS.\n\nAlso - you want some examples of innovation at Apple? \nApple Silicone pretty much changed the game for notebooks and blew everything else out of the water in terms of performance / battery.\nAirPods by itself defined a new category - Apple Watch did the same.\n\nAnd no - I am not a fanboy, I am just not a basement dweller who claims a 2.x trillion company that leads globally in everything they touch is “not innovative”",

But good luck to you trying to afford to move out from your mum's.\n\nInnovation isnt reselling the same phone for the last 10 years, or charging other companies huge fees. The Apple M1 chip was 4 years ago, and designed by ARM, not apple. Apple *used* to be innovative but haven't innovated for 5 years, and now just relies on fanbois like you who won't buy other brands. \n\nWhen they go back to wowing the market then I'll be the first to say that they're back to their best.",
