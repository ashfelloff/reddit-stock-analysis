  "selftext": "I was thinking of some oil leaps, considering the demand should keep the price up throughout this summer, and I want to exit some of my leveraged tech for now. Does anyone know some good etfs or tickers? I saw PAA mentioned earlier, but I want to go with multiple. ET, EPD, WES? XLE, VDE, XOP?\n\nDoes anyone work in the industry and see a push towards greater production or profitability? If the fed cuts less than 3 this year, wouldn't some oil stocks drop as well due to debts? Is there an oil play that should go up even if rates are not cut right away?",

      "body": "natural gas prices in the permian are very low or negative.  firms that have transport and handling capacity are getting their raw material for free, or better yet being paid to take it.  means that profit margins for some of the firms are out of this world.  Oil companies can't flare or dump the gas - frowned on by the biden administration, but the profits from oil are such that they will pay the fees to get rid of it.  Russia, a major supplier of natural gas to europe, is currently having its oil refineries and infrastructure destroyed in a systematic attempt by ukraine to hurt the russian bank balance.\n\nI think you're right to look in this sector.  If the war in ukraine heats up and russia oil product is further damaged we should see higher prices worldwide as a result.\n\nthis is one of the reasons that berkshire hathaway owns a lot of OXY.",
