The other ad was from toyota, it has a guy saying he bought a car on the spot at a dealership because the salesman was saying they were 'going fast' so he new he just 'had to have it'. In the carvana ad the guy was saying he bought the car on the spot not because he researched it but because he 'liked it'. It's so weird hearing these ads so overtly promoting impulsiveness. But i get it. People seem to be more impulsive than ever....",
