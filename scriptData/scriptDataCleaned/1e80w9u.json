              "body": "If you had followed Warren in then you should be fine. I bought mine at around $24-25 when Warren got his for $25. If he's selling some then I might think about it but I don't know what he's switching to. The way I see it is unless he's totally out then it's fine since I use BRK 13F as a \"free homework\" for some of the individual stocks I own. If BRK totally dumps then it might rise a red flag for me too.\n\nIt could be that BRK folks see rates coming down and are loading up on bonds. However any normal small investor under 55 might not want to do that. Much less someone trading or under 35. Also [BAC has become BRK's largest 2nd largest holding so it might just be a rebalance.](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/berkshire-hathaway-inc), with AXP (another financial) as it's 3rd largest being overlap, and plus AAPL which does fintech as well as behaving like a bank in downturns due to it's large cash pile being it's largest holding. \n\nRemember that as small investors we can do things he can't/wouldn't and vice versa. Warren got really good deals on GE/GS/Banks during the GFC since he went out personally to offer liquidity in the form of direct purchases or share+cashinfusion/loans where he got favorable terms. On the flipside, folks were shitting on Warren/Charlie/BRK being washed boomers because they sold the airlines at the bottom in 2020 (I personally bought DAL even after hearing he sold), but what was the most likely scenario is that ALL the airlines needed bailouts but BRK ownership probably created hiccups. Not sure what since it's behind closed doors but I would assume the government might not be as willing to give, might not give as much, or might have wanted something from BRK which got in the way so BRK just dumped. Also BRK tries to buy and hold forever while airlines are usually trades or semi-long investments at best where the ideal situation is to dump before the economy sours or goes into recession since the air travel industry is a bit of a \"feast or famine\" type sector as opposed to say AAPL, AXP, and BAC which weather downturns pretty well. I mirrored BRK into AXP and BAC since 2020. I bought a lot more AXP and less BAC because I thought AXP does well even with inflation. Turned out I did pretty well but Warren probably didn't buy more AXP because it was already one of his largest holdings even before 2020.",

What was it three years ago Joe Biden sold a lot of the strategic oil reserve at over $100 a barrel now that’s a hell of a trade. Fortunately Biden is not a traitor like Donald Donald J Trump and the Republican party. Believe them. I remember when gas went to 564 a gallon in Washington state. All I heard from my friends is that’s why all of the inflation and it’s all Joe Biden’s fault today I paid 364 a gallon after all of the taxes and bought 2 pounds of copper River salmon fresh for 12.99 a pound. not even on sale less than I paid in 1995. You won’t hear that on the news though.",
