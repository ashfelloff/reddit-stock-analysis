It takes a couple days for the brokerage to settle funds with whatever the process is and technically if you don't have enough cash in your account you can't day trade with unsettled funds you'd need to wait. Any option expiring out of the money you'll lose whatever you invested and if it settles itm they will execute it for shares or sell the contracts.",
