  "selftext": "4 times a year the biggest announcement comes upon us and yes here it is again this week!\n\nNeedless to say the price action the next few weeks is going to ruin some of you and make others of you want to call nana.\n\nHow can you make money on options this week? Well, I’ve written you a helpful guide to do so.\n\nPrior to Wednesday market close:\n- puts $3-5 OTM 8/30 expiry until NVDA crosses $125 or lower\n- $130 calls 8/30 expiry if NVDA falls below $125, then drop calls dollar for dollar (ex: if NVDA hits $122 buy $127 calls).\n- swing trade the shit out of this and close out all these mofos prior to earnings.\n\nWednesday market close:\n- stay the F out. This stock will move a bunch AH but it’ll open no more than 3% higher Thursday and IMO will trade 3-5% lower. I think the channel for this is tightening up to really shake some branches in both legs of the options chain.\n\nThursday Morning:\n- let that IV deflate and enter a long call position. What I am uncertain about is how quickly it will recover n rally. I would not be the least bit surprised if you see some downside Thursday Friday.\n- I will be watching closely and guess it will fall to below $110 very shortly after earnings. If it opens $125 or higher it may take 3 days for it otherwise I expect the downside to run its course by the weekend.\n- calls $5-10 OTM for 9/13 expiration. Of course that’s LEAPS to yall here so fine go with 9/6 I just don’t know how long it will do nothing before the do something meme no longer applies.\n\nTL/DR: Market makers will screw both sides of the options chain on earnings. Play puts leading up to ER if NVDA > $125 and calls if it falls below $125. Look for calls after ER timing Thursday might be tight wait until Friday go $5-10 OTM 2 weeks out.\n\nYou’re welcome 😘",

I may pick up a few lotto puts around 90 if they are cheap in the next few days.  My take is a grand slam is  priced in, so there isnt much upward movement potential barring something phenomenal (which absolutely COULD happen, we're still in the begging phase of AI, they could announce new significant partnerships or developments, etc), mostly downside as profit taking / selling hits hard regardless of the earnings (if it tanks, people will want out ASAP, if it runs, people will want to take profits and algos are set to sell at certain % gains or loss, exacerbating the impact)  I may stay out of it for a while, as the whole market would shift dramatically if NVDA comes in lukewarm.\n\nit should be an interesting week for sure.",

Either stock rises and you make 5% profit in 3 weeks or it doesnt rise and you made 5% profit in 3 weeks but still have shares, and then you will do the same for the other 3 quarters to make 20% extra per year. If you want to hold the stock after it gets exercised just buy back lmao. \n\nWelcome to thetagang. \n\nEdit: the atm call right now is 6.3% of equity for sep 06 calls. Legit 25% per year.
