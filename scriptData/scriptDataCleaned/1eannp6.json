Like the local bank taking out a commercial on the 10 o’clock news listing everyone late on their car payments lol. \n\nCertainly banks know that the majority of cardholders pay off, and the interchange mostly covers those.

Subprime card issuers, like credit one (not to be confused with capital one) targets subprime borrowers; they are probably more likely to carry a balance. According to this lending tree article citing the federal reserve, it’s a slight majority that don’t carry a balance (53%) in total https://www.lendingtree.com/credit-cards/study/credit-card-debt-statistics/\n\nWe did point of sale cards too, the things you see at Home Depot \n/lowes/Best Buy that are like “0% interest on this bbq if paid in 12 months!” And those are incredibly likely to pay off before accruing interest, our stats would be like 70%. But Home Depot has to pay a huge percent for that. Like 5-10% of the purchase price to offer it! The idea being that Best Buy makes more sales than it otherwise would, so they are okay with that amount. That is how affirm works; when you select a 12 month no-interest plan, the bike shop you are purchasing from pays almost double what it would for a 6 month no-interest plan. Again, the idea is that it lets the shop sell more bikes. This is the base argument for why credit cards (and really the banks behind them) charge merchants that fee. Theoretically, credit cards were taking the risk of non-payment (they still do) and allowing more customers to shop at the merchant by extending the customer’s purchase power. The fact that 53% of people don’t actually need the credit to shop kind of hurts that argument, which is why merchants get pissy about paying interchange fees, because the customers might shop there either way. That being said, the counter is that 47% of consumers seem to need credit cards to continue buying stuff, so merchants do get a benefit that they don’t like to admit.",

I was on the AMEX blacklist (which DOES exist) for a hair over 20 years. \n\nAfter 20 years (and after building up my credit score), they gave me two new cards with \"Member Since 1996\" printed on them. \n\nI wasn't mad when they cut me off and I wasn't mad when I was on their blacklist (again, which DOES exist). \n\nPay the bill, stay out of trouble. \n\nNot judging your situation.",

      "body": "Lots of banks are taking realized and paper losses (which require additional capital reserves) on their commercial real estate loans, particularly office and floating rate loans made prior to the run up in rates. Banks are kicking the can down the road as much as possible, but it can only be kicked so far. Many borrowers are throwing in the towel or extracting significant concessions. Appraisals are coming in below loan amounts, so Borrowers that feel zero'd on their equity are just handing back the keys and not throwing additional money away.",
