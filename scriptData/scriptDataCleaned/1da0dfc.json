This could be to make a quick buck or to help offset any losses from shorting the stock.\n\nAn even more conspiratorial answer would be hedge fund A knows hedge fund B shorted the stock and is going to lose money so hedge fund A wants to drive the price up to further hurt their competition. \n\nSome combination of all or none of these could be true, but one thing remains certain - the graph will continue to move to the right.",

          "body": "One thing to note is that the effect of retail direct registering shares effectively shrinks the free float.  So a large portion are held by insiders like Ryan Cohen which aren’t being bought and sold on the stock market (without it being reported), another large portion are direct registered which means that although they can be bought and sold they aren’t.\n\n\nSo it takes RK’s position and really magnifies it.  The effective free float is not 350 million, it’s much smaller with 12% held by insiders and nearly 25% being direct registered.  This means that the free float of GME is only about 200 million of which RK has his fingers on almost 10%.\n\nTo put this in perspective RDDT IPO’d with only 10% of their float, so RK can absolutely move the market with his shares and options.\n\nNow how does he do that?  He bought calls which give him the right to purchase the stock at $20 which if the stock went below $20 would be worthless.  Those shares might not exist if they were sold naked, so as the price gets higher the entity is more and more likely to need to buy those shares if they don’t already own them.\n\nSo between when he bought the calls and expiry some entity (maybe ETrade owned by Morgan Stanley) will have to purchase 12 million shares or 6% of the float.  Shorts are much less abundant then they were but there is a chance that they will have to cover 20 ish percent of the float if they want out (without even getting into hedgies never covered conspiracies).  Then add it retail with a hundred thousand people buying 200 shares each (just a random number I pulled).  Gets you to 50% of the float being purchased this month.\n\nThat doesn’t make the stock go up 50% because each share needs to be bought from someone else.  Technically the price could jump a hundred dollars on one sale if nobody sold, but this is the type of true math that suggest retail and RK can easily move the market.",

At the same time, you have other retail investors that are buying puts, short selling or just focusing on other money making opportunities like the Semi industry and big tech. Now all of a sudden the esteemed leader of the GME movement posts a massive position, and now there’s a psychologically driven momentum to buy. Puts are closed, shorts cover, and tons of retail investors that have been looking elsewhere see an opportunity to make a quick buck and jump on the train. Everything points to “buy”. Then RC issues earnings early and dilutes, which is a far more powerful market mechanic than 1 man who got rich showing that he’s all in again. Now the psychology shifts to “i should sell before everyone else sells”. I really can’t wrap my head around why so many of you think there is malignant forces at play when it is simple psychology over jumping into an opportunity forming, riding momentum, and then reading the room to find an exit. The wise like to make money and don’t have a ridiculous, artificial price target set like $1000 a share, and aren’t interested in fighting some revolutionary battle meant to redefine market operations. They just see the rollercoaster rising on the tracks, and get in and out before it plummets from the peak. Good luck to you. Hope all the conspiracies are correct and you lead us into a market breaking MOASS where your shares climb to tens of thousands a piece, and you and all the apes can somehow sell them so that everyone in the cult can make their hard earned millions and nobody gets hurt, in a now broken market environment.",

This sub Reddit doesn’t allow YouTube videos so you’ll have to look it up. \n\nThe channel is called folding ideas. It’s dense though. The video about GameStop and meme stock took me a couple of rewatches to understand a few things. The basic concept is not hard but the different layers and understanding all the nuance is very complex as it’s both how the stock market works and how these social groups work. \n\nThe video is called “This is Financial advice” and it’s a spoof title related to All these financial YouTubers that \nHave popped up around the stock market and specifically meme stocks. \n\nThe other more famous video is called “The line goes up- the problem work NFTs”.\n\nI tried adding the YouTube channel link but got a message that’s not allowed  But just google “folding ideas this is financial advice “\nAnd you’ll find it.",

So even if retail bought 10mm shares in a day, most of those would not actually affect the price, and 5mm shares spread out throughout a high volume day would barely affect the price because of the entire \"not yet purchased\" system. Market makers can accept your \"buy\" buy never actually find those shares, so that would also have 0 effect on the lit market price.\n\n\nLong story short, there are numerous ways that market makers fuck with the price to keep it right where they want it to be.
