The only thing they can really do now is RD and optimize production - which seems to be pretty darn close to its ceiling as well. The EPS isn't great and most of the S&P is overinflated, not tied to any realistic valuation but pumped instead by speculation. There's no way the MC lines up with the earnings, free cash flow and dividends in any rational analysis, that's why I'm saying the next couple decades are already priced in.\n\n\nRight now they own the space, but if they can't continue to meet 80% of demand they will bleed market share. Their prices will have to decrease and their insane margins will shrink. The aren't a \"Zero to One\" company, they are just ahead of the game and, as more specialized chips become produced, they will lose that lead. Right now you *have* to get NVIDIA, in 5 years there will be dozens of alternatives in different niches around AI. \n\n\nI just don't see any realistic scenario where they return more gains than an index fund from here. Wall St will play with it, like every other stock, and drop it down while buying puts, then flip to calls and bring it back to this range. The massive gains are already earned, there's better opportunity elsewhere IMO - like emergent cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\nWhat do you think their ceiling is for MC? How can they realistically get beyond 10 *trillion* dollars in 20 years? How about 5 trillion in 10 years? Those returns are fine, but there's much smarter money out there",
