  "selftext": "It seems all the Hype on Rocket Lab has died a death, just as things begin to shape up. I know a lot of people on here were bullish around 12 months ago, yet a lot has changed in the landscape since then.\n\nThe CEO of $RKLB Peter Beck recently stated in an interview that.\n\n1. He expects 50% of Rocket Lab launches to contain their own payloads.\n\n2. He’s focused on providing “services IN space”.\n\nAccording to Quilty Report Starlink is expected to revenue $6.6b this year and to post its first FCF quarter. \n\nThen ASTS comes along with news regarding the AT&T deal for their \"direct to mobile service\", a company with practically no revenue and one that still relies on launch vehicle providers such as $RKLB.\n\nSo what do we think happens when Rocket Lab announce plans of their own broadband constellation. Essentially de-risking the investment by bringing in recurring revenue and consistent FCF. (Whilst this is just my theory, I’m pretty sure that’s where he’s heading). If this is the case then Rocket Lab suddenly becomes investable for a LOT more funds and given how many people are short I can expect a big move.\n\nNot to mention that Rocket Lab considers itself \"They keys to space\" for good reason, they have the income, know how and the launch vehicles themselves to move quickly on this opportunity.\n\nWe’ve already seen what $ASTS did. In my opinion we get a PR soon and it will seem so obvious after the fact. It feels as though the longs from a few years back may regret not keeping onto of their positions.",
