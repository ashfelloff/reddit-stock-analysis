Wouldn’t they have been better to have just sold the put and sold the stock on the open market?\n\nOr maybe the market messed up briefly and they saw a quick arbitrage play where the price for the stock + put < strike ?  \n\nThe only other reason I can think is if they are able to assign after hours?  The underlying stock was moving up after hours so maybe in response to that but I thought options were strictly reg session..\n\nThat’s the only two reasons that make any sense to me but I’m here to learn.\n\n",
