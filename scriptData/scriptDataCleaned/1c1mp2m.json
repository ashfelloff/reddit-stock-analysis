  "title": "🚀🌕 SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! 🌕🚀",
  "score": 89,
  "selftext": "Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it’s time to tune into a stock that’s been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I’m talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here’s why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that’s expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.\n\n**🔥 The Lowdown on $SOF**I:\n\n**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain’t no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company’s financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn’t scream growth, I don’t know what does. Did I mention they’re forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? 🤯\n\n**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi’s positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.\n\n**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let’s not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI’s lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.\n\n**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it’s like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn’t need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they’re now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm…I’d bet my wife’s boyfriend’s car that we hit record new members this quarter.\n\n**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI’s about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they’ve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year’s going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that’ll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.\n\n**🌟 Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n 🌟\n\n**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They’ve been beating expectations like it’s their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don’t want to miss.\n\n**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn’t just the future; it’s the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It’s a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \\*\\*cough\\*\\* CITI Bank \\*\\*cough\\*\\* going through a proof of concept. They’re being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.\n\n**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.\n\n**🔮 Conclusion: Don’t Sleep on SOF**I 🔮\n\nIn the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn’t just a good investment; it’s a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.\n\nSo, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It’s time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! 🚀🌕\n\nmy positions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x0lf1phvawtc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47db7c82502f5aedc3fe287416d165d69c89ef51\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ovxwpmwwawtc1.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da0b7fa1ce9f0e8db40c79b0ef1b495b8ade4e52\n\n***Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.

                  "body": "the company makes money. institutional investors are already buying in and with a second profitable quarter even more will.\n\nThe stock has been on a slide for 5 years because it's been retail controlled. The share price has been moving against earnings because it's being traded by a bunch of regards.  Sofi used $800 million in convertible notes to avoid paying higher interest rates. Long term smart move, short term it's diluting the share price...but after they announced the deal, the stock lost 2.4 billion in market cap. The market overreacted by 300%.  Because apes. \n\nthey've consistently beat projections and been downgraded by companies that see them as a direct competitor. But institutions don't ignore a company that's making money forever.  If they beat projections in their next earnings at the end of this month, I think we are looking at smart money buying in, percentage of retail/trader control dropping, and the stock becoming more predictable and following earnings.  it will be at $15 a share by the end of the year. Double up if you buy in today.",

[Their leadership even threw extra money into the company](https://www.barrons.com/articles/nycb-stock-buys-insiders-f76215d3) but they were about to get completely fucked. In comes Steve and he tosses them a billion dollar lifeline.  \n>  \n>How  does this affect SOFI? I'm getting to that. This move means Steve  thinks rates are going to come down a LOT. That is the only way the debt  on the NYCB balance sheet will get back to profitability. The reason  the company is in trouble in the first place is because commercial real  estate loans only last about 5 years before you have to come back to the  table and renegotiate the rate. High rates coupled with NY rent  controls means the portfolio is bleeding. The billion dollars buys them  time. Also remember that Mnuchin was Trump's treasury secretary, so he's  well connected and probably has pillow talk with JPow every Tuesday and  Saturday.  \n>  \n>That brings us to SOFI.  SOFI has two areas it is concentrating in for profitability growth:  Student loans and personal loans. Personal loan growth is strong but  student loan growth hasn't recovered since the moratorium and then the  high interest rates. Once rates start dropping their flagship sector is  finally going to get back on track.  \n>  \n>  \n>  \n>Just  look at the difference the moratorium caused. That's all coming back  and more. As rates come down it makes more sense for people to  refinance, and SOFI is where a LOT of people were doing that before  covid and the fallout.  \n>  \n>SOFI is already profitable with huge growth  \n>  \n>[They also just refinanced high interest debt at a 1.5% rate](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sofi-technologies-inc-prices-750-022300994.html).  CEO Anthony Noto is already planning for such high member growth and  product demand that he's loading up the war chest. He sees what Steve  and JPow are doing and is lining up his financial strategy to take  advantage. Mnuch on that.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Whatever  dumbass degenerates are scrolling through ‘new’ on  WallStreetBets  right now are in luck because I’m about to make you rich as fuck!  \n>  \n>Let  me explain a thing or two about what just happened with SOFI stock this  week. It’s complicated stuff so I’m sure you tards won’t understand but  here’s the jist of it:  \n>  \n>SOFI  announced a proposal to issue $750 million of convertible senior notes  due in 2029. Convertible senior notes mean the institutions who bought  them have the right to covert them into SOFI stock instead of being paid  back the principal in cash. The conversion price is $9.45 and they  can’t convert until later 2028. This is all bad news for SOFI  shareholders because it means dilution in the future if the stock is  above $9.45. So, Mr.TickleMyPickleSir we should short SOFI?  \n>  \n>WRONG!  There’s a few key things missing from this picture. First off, SOFI  bought what’s called CAPPED CALLS. Now these are fucking confusing but  they are essentially just a form of insurance against dilution. They are  arrangements SoFi enters into with other financial institutions to  mitigate potential dilution. Essentially, these deals enable SoFi to  elevate the conversion price of the notes into stock, thereby decreasing  the required shares for conversion and mitigating dilution. The cap  part just means there’s a cap to how high they are protected (in this  case up to $14.54 per share). Okay so that mitigates the bad news but  this still isn’t bullish right?  \n>  \n>This  is where the bullish play comes in and where we will all double our  money. The terms of the conversion price were set based on the closing  price of SOFI‘s stock that day. Meaning the lower SOFI’s stock falls the  better the conversion price will be for the Senior Note Holders. Low  and behold, SOFI had its worst day EVER the day the offering was  announced. It dropped 15% meaning the Note holders got a 15% discount on  their conversion price. And the reason for the 750m raised is to pay  off preferred shares that have an interest rate charge of 15% that would  jump to over 17% if not paid off by May.  \n>  \n>The  interest rate on the new convertible notes is 1.25%!!! SOFI is paying  off debt charging 15% soon to be 17% with new debt @ 1.25%.(Remember  SOFI sold off 15% on this announcement!) This move is going to save them  40million per year and flow to earnings immediately. Meaning SOFI is  going to beat expectations by a good margin next quarter AND now the  institutions who obviously manipulated the stock down to get the best  conversion price want SOFI stock to do well. They are only getting 1.25%  in interest on this loan so they obviously think SOFI will do well and  the conversion will be the payoff.  \n>  \n>Not  to mention the float is almost 20% short!!! This thing is so obviously  ripping after its next earnings and has the potential for a serious  squeeze  \n>  \n>Long shares and calls (position in comments)",
