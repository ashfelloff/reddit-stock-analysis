  "selftext": "**Previous Post:**¬†\n\n[~https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my\\_dd\\_advocating\\_a\\_long\\_position\\_of\\_gemstone/~](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/xqubya/my_dd_advocating_a_long_position_of_gemstone/)\n\n**Summary:** For the last four years I have been buying rocks, a lot of rocks. My hypothesis is that these rocks will dramatically appreciate in value due to an increased market awareness, combined with geopolitical and socio-economic transference.¬†¬†¬†\n\n**Introduction:** In March 2020, when the entire world was preparing for a global pandemic, I decided it was a good idea to take a vacation to Cambodia. At the time, everyone around me was telling me, this was perhaps not a very good idea. A risky idea, an idea with more downsides than up. A poor investment. I rejected this advice, and convinced my girlfriend to come with me. Four days after we arrived, the world was locked down and all the hotels in the country were closed. Our new home for the foreseeable future was in an empty resort in the most remote corner of Cambodia.¬†\n\nIt was here where I [~discovered Blue Zircon.~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17_BOLj3xlWDkaT2rC6LCi1RqpgBHG4iu/view?usp=sharing)\n\n**A deep value asset:** With all the time in the world, nowhere to be and nothing to do, I spent every waking moment learning everything I could about this curious rock. I came to the conclusion that [~Blue Zircon was woefully undervalued and primed for exponential growth.~](https://youtu.be/kwprPvO-YD4?si=biaxx0hxBFFeIr9g)\n\nAt the time, you could visit the mines outside of town and buy a fist full of raw unfaceted blue zircon for around $0.30 per stone. This was to be my cost basis moving forward.¬†\n\nWhat initially got my attention was:¬†\n\n1. [~Blue Zircon is the oldest gemstone on Earth.~¬†](https://www.science.org/content/article/oldest-piece-earth-discovered)\n2. [~Blue Zircon is rarer than diamond.~¬†](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Z0FkxZjwPKFcKSd_3wnflcyFUIom8Cj/view?usp=sharing)\n3. [~Blue Zircon boasts double refraction~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12_tiQU9XtBlTrCnt7ObjHCCZetDqepM2/view?usp=sharing) compared to [~diamonds single refraction.~¬†](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gMaUCJ1I7Rgzqzhipq_OZycxS1zFk0Ho/view?usp=sharing)\n\nWhat compounded my belief, was that:\n\n1. [~Tiffany and Co attempted the same idea more than a hundred years ago.~¬†¬†](https://www.palagems.com/kunz-reminiscences1#block-yui_3_17_2_11_1430500935587_16406)\n2. [~Oscar Wilde was a huge fan~¬†](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GCaAyN55a_id7iGd-oWw-wyT7v2dySRQ/view?usp=sharing)\n3. [~There is a precedent of niche gemstones going exponential~](https://www.theraregemstonecompany.com/gemology-articles/tanzanite-prices-and-value-current-and-historically).\n4. [~Cambodia is the primary source of the world supply of Blue Zircon.~](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325661388_Blue_Zircon_from_Ratanakiri_Cambodia)\n\nWhat finally convinced me to go all-in; was a decree from the Cambodian government; which [~outlawed mining and began closing the vast majority of gemstone mines.~¬†](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B6_ILoea_0DCc3OH3kRJKJAvjB_1S_xp/view?usp=sharing)\n\nOther factors, though less obvious at the time, are what gave me the confidence to begin work on a much longer term play. Specifically [~The rise of Asia‚Äôs middle Class~](https://www.futuresplatform.com/blog/asia-growing-middle-class-reshaping-global-consumption#:~:text=THE%20MIDDLE%20CLASS%20OF%20ASIA,technology%2C%20wellness%2C%20and%20infrastructure.) and [~China's pivot away from diamond~](https://rapaport.com/analysis/whats-causing-chinas-diamond-slump/), towards assets that are ‚Äòcloser to home‚Äô.¬†  \n  \nNow that I had convinced myself of the value of the underlying asset, I secured the required permits, [~filled my bags~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16I_XYf6bQnLHJHrsT014jaj6I6GPcqwp/view?usp=drive_link) and [~headed back to Australia~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lSG4NsaNuNh76qMnebBqoKGedDuMCkSc/view?usp=sharing). Where I formed a ltd company with the primary strategy of acquiring a controlling interest in the world‚Äôs supply of Blue Zircon, the only problem was that I didn‚Äôt have enough capital to do it alone, [~so I put up an advertisement, in the only place where I thought I could find other people foolish enough to help.~¬†](https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/350095914/#350095914)\n\nFrom here, we started buying; online and offline, for years we set about attempting to buy every spare blue rock we could find. We bought directly from the mines until they ran out due to widespread closures, then focused our attention online. During this time, I increased my combined holdings of raw & faceted stones up to [~more than 1 million carats~](https://canadianjeweller.com/nyblue-pty-ltd-spearheads-global-acquisition-of-rare-cambodian-blue-zircon-eyeing-market-leadership/).¬†\n\nSince my previous post, the average market price per stone has increased 10X [~Our plot was exposed, however the asset is still unknown.~ ](https://medium.com/@NellieBly_Official/secret-group-plotting-to-dominate-global-gemstone-market-4bb54f4e9085)  \n  \n**Updates:** Since I last posted here, the price per carat has surpassed $300 however it does still fluctuate a bit, though this is before we‚Äôve initiated the global marketing campaign.¬†\n\nI‚Äôve noticed more celebrities wearing blue rocks, such as [~Reece Witherspoon~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pAL4wfR9GD_8iullVD7i3oCEC_VWiWlG/view?usp=sharing) and potentially even [~Taylor Swift~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TAS3dy6p4Hs7vY7ngw7TiWnWYbT3Qmu7/view?usp=drive_link). Both signify a potential market rally.¬†\n\nThe next step is to set up a way to facilitate a ‚Äòspot price‚Äô as currently, I rely on a web crawler to monitor changes in market price & depth. Additionally, I‚Äôm working with some interested parties to develop an international social & mainstream media campaign, along with a dose of [~weaponized memes~](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WaIY28J6-Y8AkG99YpC8dx8yRTef7WCh?usp=sharing) to raise awareness of this wonderful rock.¬†\n\n**My current position:**¬†\n\n~1,000,000 cts of~ [~Raw~](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16I_XYf6bQnLHJHrsT014jaj6I6GPcqwp/view?usp=drive_link) & Faceted Blue Zircon \n\nAvg cost per ct: $10\n\nCurrent price per ct $150 - $300\n\nTarget price per ct $10,000¬†\n\n\n\n~Total Cost Basis~: $250k AUD\n\n~Total Unrealised Gains:~ $250m AUD\n\n",

Even \"Forever\" diamond which are marked (engraved) are only marked past a certain point in the chain and the true origin can't be known for sure.\n\nSo basically, my take away from that conversation intended to convince me to not care about the issue was that lab grown diamonds are a better quality anyway, cheaper, and that's a nice way to vote with your money.",

Although zircons have a respectable hardness for jewelry stones (6 to 7.5), that falls well short of diamond's famous 10. Zircons are far more susceptible to scratching than diamonds. They also have a very brittle tenacity, lower than that of most gemstones. This means their facet edges tend to chip and wear easily.\n\n>...However, any zircons in jewelry should be worn carefully to prevent damage. As ring stones, they need protective settings due to their very brittle tenacity. Pendants, brooches, and earrings are safer jewelry choices.\n\nSource: https://www.gemsociety.org/article/zircon-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/\n\nThese things aren't replacing diamonds",

Blue Zircon can be found in many localities and white zircon can be treated.  \n\nThe price and comparison should also be measured against a basket of similar gem material which you will find a similar trend in pricing that many mid tier gems have moved up in value over the last several years. This last year in Tucson anecdotal discussions with gem dealers and purchasers indicated some level of inverse pricing from mine to consumers, (it was more expensive material at the mine source than what was being sold in Tucson, mainly due to cash buyers paying premiums for large lots at the source).   The price to reach $10K per carat is unrealistic in a lifetime term. This material is just not that rare to reach high grade ruby and sapphire pricing. if you can get $300 you are good, if you get $500 for high quality large pieces great, but the average is lower and there is a lot of material that is treated flooding the market some show up directly at the mines.  \n\nA good resource on pricing and markets is GIA field Gemologist Wim Vertriest who has written many articles on sourcing stones and the market in general and has a large focus in SE Asian markets. \n\nSeparately if you are looking to have large high quality pieces cut please reach out, I have some experience in faceting :)",

Their hardness is a 6 on a scale of 10, where diamonds are a 10. The reason ppl can wear diamonds on their fingers is bc they don‚Äôt chip when abused. There‚Äôs also the fact that actual big money can just re-open mines at scale if these were to ever actually appreciate substantially in value, which they won‚Äôt, because they suck as precious stones and don‚Äôt have any industrial use. No one cares about how old and sparkly they are if they can‚Äôt be effectively cut into a particular shape because they‚Äôre prone to shattering first..\n\nAlso, the math isn‚Äôt even correct. 1m carats at $10ea is $10m, not $250k. Also, current price per carat appears to be nowhere near $150-$300 after a brief google search. Also, OP appears to be trying to spin this investment failure into an even farther fetched plan by creating a crypto token and ‚Äòtokenizing‚Äô blue zircon into a ‚Äòreal-world-asset‚Äô‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs already a real world asset, just not one that anyone wants.
