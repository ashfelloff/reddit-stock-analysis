  "selftext": "I know, I know. Many have lost their asses betting on a China rebound. Like, so many. WSB idiots: dead. Value investors: dead. Macroeconomists: dead. Currency speculators: dead. Commodities traders: dead. But here's why I'm different: I don't pretend to know anything. \n\nI don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.\n\nI know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?\n\nI also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?\n\nWhat matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale. \n\nThe shitty, wretched, Oliver Twist sad pussy orphan that is BABA will rise from the ashes like a goddamned phoenix and make us all rich. Why now, you ask? WHY RIGHT NOW? Again, people, seriously. I don't fucking know. \n\nPosition:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bkp1rylvluwc1.png?width=176&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18ff1c47c15609b71660db27076108dc144b246",
