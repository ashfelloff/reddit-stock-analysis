There's a couple of good documentaries on Netflix.  \n  \n95% of a town of 27,000 was wiped out. Completely destroyed like a nuke went off. You can't imagine....  \n  \nSo here's the story, DD, TA, and some fucking rage for those corporate criminals  \n  \n**Fire**  \n  \nPG&E was supposed to turn off the power due to weather conditions - they announced this 4 days ahead of time. But they didn't, to turn an extra dime, and go figure: it started a massive fire. Soon, chunks of bark were flying miles across the sky, due to the high winds, igniting the town from all sides. Spreading at a football field a minute, they'd say.  \n  \nBut that's not even where we stopped get fucked over by these assholes  \n  \n1. **The Trust**  \n  \nAs compensation for ruining our lives, destroying our community, and murdering loved ones, they were liable for some 17.1b in damages. Of course they deserve to go bankrupt, dissolved, jailed, but California votes against this option. They issued a trust, funded with 13.5b for the settlement - but not in cash  \n  \nin fucking $PCG stock  \n  \nafter destroying the town and dropping over -93%  \n  \n.....  \n  \n2**. waiting**  \n  \nfiguring life out, homelessness, clothes etc. The money was supposed to help with all that. It would be a few years before getting any of it, though, leaving survivors SOL. All the while, the lawyers and admins in charge of distributing the trust rack up $98 million in fees.  \n  \nAnyways here's the kicker, and why survivors struggled without this money for years. The stock that funded the wasn't enough to make the payouts. We would have to wait, [FOR THIS CHART](https://imgur.com/uMA1GOB), to recover. We saved NOTHING, none of our belongings, home, car, clothes nothing escaped from this fire. And we were holding our breath on a setup that needs years of accumulation. They seriously paid the trust in worthless stock and said wait for it to bounce.  \n  \nLet's just say PG&E had better lawyers than whoever was representing survivors.\n\n**3. Trust sold out**  \n  \nWe're all sucking hopium that PG&E, the company the ruined all our lives, gets a nice rally in. So we can buy shoes. But finally they start making payments.   \n  \nAt some point they had to sell. Couldn't tell everyone to \"just wait another couple of years for recovery\" while a large percentage of survivors are \\*still\\* homeless.   \n  \nIt won't be 100% of what the lawsuit entailed, but 3.5 years later, we got something. You know where I'm putting it.  \n  \nAs of December, the trust has sold all of the stock. 5 years to sell 477 million shares, nearly a quarter of the float.  \n  \n4, Chart  \n  \nSimple idea - main resistance is top of relief bounce. The trust was finishing a sale of 67.7 million shares in december into that first rejection, check CVD. This time it should blast straight through  \n  \n\n\n[target: higher tomorrow](https://preview.redd.it/dvvvbc62yn0d1.png?width=3104&format=png&auto=webp&s=7680c5356c521349aeb893398495ac66121b94e7)\n\nit's time to gap up as from $12 to $15. The market is in a perfect place and it's showing the momentum it needs on ltf  \n  \nYou guys probably wouldn't get it, but I've been waiting 5 years for this setup. Take the trade  \n  \nBlack Scholes simply isn't pricing in that it will pump after they sell my shares  \n  \nNow that none of the families they hurt benefit, it'll full send.  \n  \n[The trust sold?](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/036/119/cover6.jpg)  \n  \nFuck PG&E. $18.5c 5/17",

Black Bear diner came in and I thought to myself \"Man this town is done.\", that was literally a few months before the fire. I drove up the night it happened, and spent a week working on getting my lung cancer certificate getting my grandparents somewhat settled at a random person from one of the local churches.  When we finally got up to their house it was just... Nothing.  Trees burnt to the ground, house just gone, only foundation left...

This final sale marked the end of the Trust's efforts to liquidate its holdings of PG&E stock, which were originally provided as part of PG&E’s bankruptcy reorganization plan. In total, the Trust sold 477 million shares of PG&E stock over several years to fund the compensation for fire victims.\n\nAs of the final sale, the Trust has disbursed over $11.21 billion to fire victims, addressing claims related to the 2015 Butte Fire, 2017 North Bay Fires, and the 2018 Camp Fire. The sale of these shares added significant liquidity to the Trust, enabling it to increase the pro rata payment percentage to 66% for all claimants​ ([Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240312613317/en/Fire-Victim-Trust-to-Increase-Pro-Rata-Payments-to-California-Fire-Survivors-to-66/))​​ ([Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231213203932/en/Fire-Victim-Trust-Announces-Sale-of-Remaining-67.7-Million-Shares/))​.\n\n  \nwas pcg trying to keep the price low while the trust held shares? \n\nChatGPT\n\nSearched 5 sites\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that the activities of hedge funds and the structure of the Fire Victim Trust (FVT) may have contributed to keeping PG&E's stock price lower during the period when the trust held significant shares. After PG&E emerged from bankruptcy, hedge funds collectively dumped 250 million shares, which put downward pressure on the stock price. This affected the returns for the fire victims, as their compensation was heavily tied to the value of PG&E stock​ ([IJPR](https://www.ijpr.org/wildfire/2021-10-13/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pg-e-stock-california-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11891626/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pge-stock-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​.\n\nMoreover, the intricate arrangement of the trust, which included a significant portion of the settlement in PG&E stock rather than cash, created a complicated situation for the fire victims. They became major shareholders in the company and had to bear the risk of stock price fluctuations​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11872328/survivors-stuck-in-limbo-as-pge-fire-victim-trust-pays-out-50-million-in-fees))​​ ([Home](https://www.capradio.org/articles/2021/05/06/survivors-stuck-in-limbo-as-pge-fire-victim-trust-pays-out-50-million-in-fees/))​. This situation was exacerbated by the hedge funds' sell-offs, which further depressed the stock value, making it difficult for the trust to fulfill its financial obligations to the victims promptly​ ([IJPR](https://www.ijpr.org/wildfire/2021-10-13/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pg-e-stock-california-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​​ ([KQED](https://www.kqed.org/news/11891626/hedge-funds-cash-out-billions-in-pge-stock-fire-survivors-suffer-and-wait))​.\n\nIn summary, while there isn't explicit evidence that PG&E itself directly manipulated stock prices to keep them low, the actions of hedge funds and the financial structure of the settlement likely contributed to the stock's underperformance during a critical period for fire survivors awaiting compensation.",
