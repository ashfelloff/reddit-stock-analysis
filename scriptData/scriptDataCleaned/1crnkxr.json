You give lower and middle class people more money and they spend it and pay taxes, not to mention the overall boost in economic activity which results in more taxes being collected.\n\nI genuinely believe that the way to solve our country’s $35T debt is by taxing the wealthy their fair share, paying people a fair and livable wage, and cutting down on wasteful spending. Do those three things and you can’t help but have a healthy, vibrant economy. Alas our government would rather cater to a few rich fucks and let them have literally everything.",
