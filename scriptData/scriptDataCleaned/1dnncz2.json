  "selftext": "NVDA goes on amazing runs, but it also has had its fair share of corrections. It‚Äôs such a hot stock that their corrections have usually a bit more volatility than a standard defined 10-20%. \n\nBelow corrections I could note in between their epic run:\n\nNov ‚Äò21: $32.98\nJan ‚Äò22: $22.84\nCorrection: -30%\n\nMarch ‚Äò22: $27.69\nMay ‚Äò22: $16.69\nCorrection: -39%\n\nAug ‚Äò22: $18.71\nOct ‚Äò22: $12.08\nCorrection: -35%\n\nEdit: Aug ‚Äò23: $49.36\nOct ‚Äò23: $40.50\nCorrection: -18% \nthanks for checking user u/cchud\n\nMar ‚Äò24: $96.77\nApr ‚Äò24: $75.61\nCorrection: -21%\n\nJun ‚Äò24: $140.76\nToday: $118.11\nCurrent correction: -16%\n\nI could see NVDAs current correction still having 500 bps of downward movement. If the investor relation event wasn‚Äôt this week I‚Äôd be even more certain of it. \n\nPositions: I recently scalped $1000 off NVDA with 6/21 Puts, and sold 10 shares at $138. \n\nIn short, I think NVDA corrections usually will be greater than 20%. Not financial advice - do what you will with this. Cheers\n",

So I can‚Äôt really say with a high degree of confidence what will happen if I‚Äôm being totally honest. \n\nBut in simple terms I see tomorrow as a red day. And I could see a pretty strong amount of buying pressure on the 26th if the meeting goes well. \n\nAt the end of the day the fundamentals for the market capitalization we are seeing with Nvidia are based in reality. \n\nI see the market cap of around $3T as fair given the data we are seeing these past quarters. But my concern is that the market cap was reached too quickly and it has spooked a lot of investors causing the selloff. \n\nThe biggest risks to its price are geopolitical events (China invading Taiwan) and AI being a bubble. If either of those things happen everyone is cooked. \n\nTL;DR: $110-115 tomorrow, strong correction up or down after the SHM on the 26th.",
