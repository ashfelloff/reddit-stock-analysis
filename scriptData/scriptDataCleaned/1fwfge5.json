If ChatGPT can do whatever their products can do but in a different way, I‚Äôd pretty much consider those products useless, no matter what the valuations are. Like, if you see big tech companies, none of them are fully invested into AI (except Google to an extent) and only a small portion of their core products comprises of AI. So, I believe companies whose products follow that model would be safe. The bubble bust would only impact ‚ÄúAI companies‚Äù and not the ‚Äútech companies that have some AI features in their products‚Äù",
