  "selftext": "I've been getting a lot of extremely different information from people today. Could someone answer the following questions for me?\n\nFirstly, what are fed cuts anyways? I know that the \"cut\" refers to lowering interest rates, but I'm still confused -- interest rates for what??\n\nSecondly, does the market typically go up or down during these cuts? Do large cuts typically bring the market up?\n\n  \nI'd really appreciate some help! Thanks in advance :)",

Maybe I should have referred to it as “still intact.”\n\nAnd while hiring has slowed yes, and job openings are falling. The unemployment rate is still historically at a low level currently at 4.2% \n\nAlso, layoffs are still at a low level, I’m not seeing where your getting “there hasn’t been this many layoffs for 15 years” if you look at the data https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTSLDR we are still historically at a low level of layoffs offs.\n\nHow recessions typically go is the consumer weakens. Then businesses cut costs such as capex investments and other G&A spending to preserve margins. The consumer weakens further, companies then stop hiring and cut job openings. Consumer weakens further, and lastly you see mass layoffs as a last resort to preserve margins. That’s why the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator, you don’t see it spike until we are already well into a recession.",

In my opinion, all the FOMC meeting will do is give us clarity on the size of the rate cut (25 pbs or 50 bps). What it will NOT bring is clarity on whether or not we are heading into a recession. \n\nThe Fed will give us their updated projections on GDP and unemployment, as well as their dot plot of future rate cut expectations, which will shed light on whether or not the Fed thinks we are headed into a recession.  But the Fed’s economic projections are typically flat out wrong to put it lightly. For example, they estimated that unemployment at the end of 2025 would be 4.2% and we already reached 4.3% unemployment in July 2024. So ultimately, I would say no, by Wednesday we will have no further REAL clarity on whether or not we are heading into a recession, and that’s really ultimately what matters the most right now. And something that no one truthfully has the answer to.\n\nYou will need to monitor the economic data as it comes out on a monthly basis such as jobless claims, unemployment rate, consumer spending, retail sales, services and manufacturing numbers, and corporate earnings reports. Reading the beige book can also be a helpful tool.\n\nIf we have a soft landing and unemployment never spikes and labor market remains intact, rate cuts will be very beneficial for the economy and subsequently the stock market. If the Fed is too late with their cuts (which many people seem to think they are and should have started cutting in July), then you will see unemployment rise, corporate profits and margins get crushed, and we will subsequently enter a recession and rate cuts won’t save your stocks from declining profit margins and missed growth expectations.\n\nIf someone had a crystal ball and could tell you with 100% certainty we were NOT going into a recession, I would go full margin triple leverage call options into IWM (Small cap ETF) on the back of these incoming rate cuts. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone could tell you with 100% certainty that we WERE going into a recession, I would go full margin triple leverage call options into TMF (long duration bond etf) on the back of these incoming rate cuts.\n\nBut, no one has a crystal ball unfortunately, so that’s why you hedge your portfolio. As for me, I’m about 60% long equities, 30% long duration bonds, and 10% cash ready to deploy if we have any serious declines in stock prices.",

      "body": "You're getting extremely different information because fed rate cuts can be interpreted as either good or bad.\n\n\"Interest rates\" in this context refers to the benchmark interest rate, set by the federal reserve, which plays a big role in determining the interest rate that you'll get if you go to a bank and get a loan for starting a business, or getting a mortgage. Cutting rates makes money cheaper to borrow, which is good for businesses, and by extension, stocks. So rate cuts are bullish, buy buy buy. Cheaper borrowing costs stimulates the economy, which is a good thing, right?\n\nRates were cut to zero or near-zero in 2020, to stimulate the US economy as we faced down what we thought might be the great depression 2.0, due to COVID being a new and unexpected threat. Did it work? It's hard to say what would have happened in an alternate timeline. But we do know that low rates are inflationary, and from around late 2021 to 2023, we faced high inflation, which can be said to have been due to rates being kept too low for too long. So in response, the fed raised rates and has held them at around 5% for some months now. This helps temper inflation, but also acts like a depressant on the economy, slowing it down.\n\nNow there are questions on if interest rates are being held too high for too long, which could be overly stressful on the economy, and result in a recession. The fed cutting rates could be a sign that they see weakness in the economy and that a recession is on the way. More aggressive rate cuts signal even more clearly that they are swerving to avoid a recession. So are lower rates good for stocks? In a vacuum, sure. But are rate CUTS good for stocks? Now it's not so clear.\n\nThis write-up is a little dense but I hope it's easy enough for a newbie.",

      "body": "The Federal Reserve (Fed) sets the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend to each other overnight. This rate indirectly influences many other interest rates in the economy, including the rates at which consumers and businesses borrow. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Banks’ Borrowing Costs**: When the Fed raises the federal funds rate, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money. To compensate, banks often raise the interest rates they charge consumers and businesses for loans like mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards.\n   \n2. **Consumer and Business Loans**: Higher federal funds rates typically lead to higher interest rates on loans, which means borrowing becomes more expensive. This can slow down spending and investment because consumers and businesses may hesitate to take on expensive debt.\n   \n3. **Adjustable Rate Loans**: Many loans, especially adjustable-rate loans (like adjustable-rate mortgages), are tied to market interest rates that are influenced by the federal funds rate. As the Fed rate increases, these loans’ rates often rise, leading to higher monthly payments for borrowers.\n\n4. **Long-Term Interest Rates**: While the Fed directly controls short-term rates, long-term interest rates, such as those for mortgages, are also influenced by market expectations about future Fed actions. If investors expect the Fed to raise rates further, long-term rates may increase in anticipation.\n\nIn summary, when the Fed raises or lowers the federal funds rate, it impacts borrowing costs across the economy, affecting consumer and business loans, and thus influencing economic activity.",
