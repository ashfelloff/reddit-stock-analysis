The only way this company is making any cash is by authorizing the sale of new shares and diluting their market value.  The all-time chart looks great until you realize that they're de-valuing their own currency more than the US Govt.  And they're in the hole to the tune of 1.8B in shareholder equity.\n\nFrom a fundamental standpoint this company is dead in the water.  \n\nI hope you're not holding for the long run.  Maybe?

      "body": "OP, you allude to the dilution, but you don't account for it in your price analysis.  AMC's market cap is not at 1/4 of its pandemic low, it's trading pretty near the pandemic low.  It's hard to find accurate data on this, every site I look at says something different for the current market cap, but every chart I look at shows a similar market cap today compared to 2020.  They massively diluted multiple times in 2020 and 2021.  \n\nThe last time I tried to calculate the relative pre-pandemic price, which was prior to the split and whatever dilution had happened since, the pre-pandemic price of ~$8 adjusted for ~9x dilution was $0.88, but this was before the most recent reverse split, further dilution, and the $APE stuff, so I don't know what it should be now, and again the market cap today is similar to 2020.",
