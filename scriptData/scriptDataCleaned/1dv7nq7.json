  "selftext": "Yes, I know the metallic taste lingers in everyone's mouth from the recent earnings decline. While this downturn may have impacted your portfolio, I believe the current bottom floor is an excellent opportunity. I honestly think this could be the biggest trading opportunity this year.\n\nFirst things first: Nike has faced a few obstacles that need to be addressed. Nike's expected revenue fell short in Q4 2024, coming in at $12.6 billion compared to $12.9 billion. The 2% year-over-year decline is driven by an 8% drop in direct-to-consumer sales (Nike-owned stores). This decline, paired with less-than-ideal guidance, dampened investor spirits, leaving us with NKE at a price **unseen since 2020**. Rarely do we see a blue-chip stock present an entry opportunity like this. The best part? We have a worldwide marketing event beginning in 22 days. **Hence, I believe this is an ideal position to springboard towards 50x, perhaps even 100x profits**.\n\nNike is an elite shoe and sportswear company. The market overreacted to EPS reports and oversold. Now, we can take advantage of the largest single-day drop in the company's history to secure an excellent position. Nike isn't going anywhere. While Hoka and ON footwear are currently outperforming Nike, the latter remains head and shoulders above these companies. Nike boasts half a century of experience in this industry and is known for continuous innovation with products like Flyknit, Air Max, and React. The company has a significant global presence, reaching over 190 countries, and extends its influence beyond sports into popular culture through high-profile endorsements and sponsorships. This global influence is what I believe will yield the most profits.\n\nThe Summer Olympics are around the corner: July 26 - August 11. Nike has long been a prominent sponsor and supplier of the event, dating back to 1972. This enhances its global visibility and prestige. Comparing Nike to Hoka, ON, or even Lululemon is like comparing Coke to Dr. Pepper. You will never see these companies come close to replacing a giant like Nike in sponsoring major global events. Historically, Nike's stock has responded positively to the Olympics due to increased brand exposure and elite athletic association. Specifically, with every NKE earnings release preceding a major sporting event, the stock declined 75% of the time. Before the 2012 London Olympics, Nike shares fell 9%. Before 2008 Beijing? Yep, fell 10%. During and after the Olympics, we can expect to see positive movement. As such, I believe a price target of $90 is reasonable. This will boost investor confidence and transform this challenging period into a golden opportunity.\n\n  \nNOT Financial advice; please trade at your own risk.\n\nPositions below: 8/16 85c x 12 contracts\n\n[https://ibb.co/nknyDZ1](https://ibb.co/nknyDZ1)\n\nEDIT: Added positions picture into a link.\n\nEDIT: Very clearly, as known, this advice is not financial advice. Just discussion and speculation and sharing where I am at with this.",

          "body": "You can buy it at $75 and hope for 50% return to triple digits. Or you can buy deep in the money calls, good through 12/2026.  The $50 strike is $31, which means there's only about $5 premium versus the current stock price. (Difference between current share price vs option premium = $25. You pay $30 = $5 \"speculation\" premium). If the stock rallies in the next 2.5 years to $100, the shares increase 50% but the option will be priced at $50, plus \"speculative premium\" of $X?  Likely price would be $60 for the option, which means 100% gain.\n\nThe deep-in-the-money calls are basically a proxy for owning the stock. You could go even lower if you want more safety, but I went with the ATM calls at $75 (exp 12/2026) for $16.71.  I believe it will return to $100 over the next 2 years because the management cannot afford to have it under that value. They will do share buy-backs and anything else they need to do to push it back up.  So if the share price returns to $100, my options will be valued at (100 - 75) + \"speculative premium\"... Should be something in the range of $25 to $40, depending on how much time is left on the option when it gets there.  So potentially 100% - 200% potential gain.  If they somehow get back to the highs of $150 - $170, the option will gain up to 600% versus only 100% - 125% for the actual shares.\n\nSeems like this is exactly the opportunity everyone waits for...a massive selloff at 2x the highest volume in the last 5 years in a premium company that is not broken, just stumbled.  I'm picturing that girl who tripped in the race with less than one lap to go and she came back to win.",

I don’t. \n\nThey’re making a commodity at this point (are Nike shoes *really* that different from a Nike ripoff brand?) and it’s a race to the bottom. They can’t race to the bottom bc that fucks their margins, so it’s entirely on marketing to carry them. I personally feel like Olympic ads are a waste of cash, and for that reason I’m out.",

Also, the new CEO shit the bed with his idea to become more e-commerce focused, sell direct to consumer and leave retail, like footlocker. Guidance is they hope to recover end of next year and they don't seem confident in that even. Best of luck. I'll watch from the sidelines for now.",

There will be a lot of pressure on the management to fix this fast. It's a Dow 30 component, so very high profile company.  At this moment the management are having a series of those \"come to jeezus\" meetings where they make insane new goals and fire anyone who is not on board.\n\nSo, you are getting a premium company at an insanely low price at a time when management has a very hot fire under their asses.  You can buy the LT Call at the money for $16, good until 12/2026. That gives you 2.5 years for them to roll out new product lines, announce share buy backs and anything else they can think of to get the stock back up and off the radar.  CEO's know they cannot just sit on their hands when the market is at all time highs and their company stock is at lows.  There's a lot of pressure there.  Seems like they will do whatever it takes to get it back over $100 by next year.\n\nI don't have any specific details...just betting on the likely behavior of management after I had spent 20 years in fortune 100 companies and watched the behavior during the 2001, 2008 & 2020 economic disruptions.",
