But also if you can get a job, and save up 100 bucks on the side, then use that to trade spx/xps for 5x-20x+ gains. But you need to learn at least more than basic charting and fundamentals. Got a homie in one of my trading that does it daily using mostly the 2 tickers mentioned about, and he only risks 50 bucks or less for 5-10x plus gains. His highest in the past couple weeks was 37x (8c play to 300 dollars profit) and he sold for 10x on a play that closed 90x. I can't with him I'm fucking dead just talking about it.",
