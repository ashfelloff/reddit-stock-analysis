  "title": "10 stacks on CAT calls to run up before earnings",
  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "Caterpillar (CAT) reports earnings between the 25th and the 30th, with most estimates being the 29th. (They haven't announced the date yet.) I bought 7x NOV 1 CALL 390 contracts to profit from a run-up in IV.\n\nBased on my model of historical pre-earnings IV, even if CAT stays flat or dips a little bit, these options should move up in price. They're at 29.8% IV right now, with vega of 0.46 and theta 0.24. Here's a monte carlo simulation, where the horizontal axis is number of days remaining until earnings are released.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2r8tpd0z1zrd1.png?width=1885&format=png&auto=webp&s=907aa6ffabe68795bd4938e63c9e659a4aa1ae03\n\nFrom top to bottom, the red lines are the 90th percentile, mean (expected value), 10th percentile, and 1st percentile of the expected contract price. Because of the way that IV increases as earnings get closer, the distribution of daily log-returns of the stock, and the relative values of vega and theta, I think it's likely that the price increase from delta and IV will outpace the price drop from theta.\n\nI think the stock will rise over the next few weeks as folks prep for earnings, because:\n\n* They've been giving conservative guidance this year, which has been accurate re: revenue and customer inventories, but they are still outperforming in terms of profit.\n* Forecasters have consistently underestimated CAT EPS, so they consistently post an EPS beat.\n* Only one of their major competitors reports in the next couple weeks, so there's little risk of a big shock to the stock price. The rest of their competitors all report around the same time they do.\n* The fed rate cut and pre-election favorable oil prices may soon increase customer heavy equipment purchases, as customer purchase and operating costs will be down.\n* The stock market often runs up prior to an election, so the overall trend should be up.\n* CAT also has a strong drift component this year, so there's not much reason to expect a drop.\n\nI'm planning to hold for the next few weeks, taking profit at +25% or loss at -25%. If IV doesn't rise to 30% over the next two weeks I'll probably close no matter what.\n\nImportant - this model is new, and might be buggy, so keep in mind that you're on WSB and I'm probably an idiot.\n\n**Edit: closed on 10/7/2024 @ 19.10 for +25% profit.**",
