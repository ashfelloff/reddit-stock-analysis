  "selftext": "Biden came out today officially announcing plans for the DEA to ease Marijuana restrictions at a federal level. While several states have already taken action, reclassifying the drug federally could have monumental effects on the industry. I am going LONG on this industry. What are your guys plays?? \n\nThe TOKE etf is a great way to play industry wide. But I'm in the mood to hear some insane bets from you degenerates. Let's hear the good stuff. The best you got. I want maximum overdrive, extremely well regarded stuff. One name with over one hundred percent of float shorted is BCAN, and I think the price action today was the beginning of something potentially remarkable.\n\nLet's light up, get our ape on, and reach new all time highs babyyy\n\nNothing I say here is financial advice.",

First... the packaging and regulations have increased the price and sliced into profit margins.  Next is just basic supply and demand.
