  "selftext": "It may have come to your attention that the price of gold and silver has increased significantly over the last month.\n\nThere has been some reporting on the issue, but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the \"usual suspects\" - geopolitical  tensions (check), reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check), and fears about the banking system (check).\n\nAll these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.\n\nGold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.\n\nIt is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.\n\nSince around September of last year, **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently, silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.\n\nNow, price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before, but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7inuxtbq02uc1.jpg?width=2801&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5696d8b58e71dbe171a2c4f62866c00a7b4a6d7\n\nArbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.\n\nMarkets are carefully, and sometimes tightly, \"managed\" by the Chinese government.\n\nFor some reason, they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**,  as miners in South America, Mexico, Poland, South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.\n\nThis is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China,  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. \n\nRaw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note, these are in yuan/kilo, so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).\n\nPOSITIONS: A bunch of AG, PSLV, KGC, and FSM, as well as some \"barbarous relics\" I can throw at people.",
