  "title": "Why Coca-Cola will be $KO",
  "score": 103,
  "selftext": "A decade-long dispute between Coca-Cola and the IRS has escalated to the point that the company could owe $16bn back in taxes, enough to wipe out a year and a half of profits, with the figure rising by more than $1bn a year. The company is planning to appeal later this year.\n\nCoca-Cola is also facing challenges due to currency fluctuations and structural changes that are creating headwinds for revenue.\n\nMoreover, Coca-Cola is experiencing low-end consumer pressure in developed markets and a slowdown in 'Away from Home' sales, alongside the expectation of lighter margins in Q3 due to lower volume and challenging market conditions in developed economies.\n\nI don’t think that the market priced in the possibility that Coca-Cola may have to pay this much in taxes, because they are visible only in the fine print of their earnings report.\n\nTLDR: Coca Cola may have to pay lots of taxes and revenue might go down.\n\nI will enter my position tomorrow. It will be $70 Puts expiring 1/17/25.\n",
