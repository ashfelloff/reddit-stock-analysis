  "title": "Is Palantir just a \"glorified\" consulting company?",
  "score": 414,
  "selftext": "Like a lot of you, I was bullish on Palantir (PLTR) for a long time. But after spending more time looking into it, I'm starting to feel less optimistic. Here's what feels off to me:\n\n* I've spent a lot of time with data science and AI, but I rarely see Palantir products in the wild. Snowflake's products, for comparison, are pretty ubiquitous for data engineering.\n* The AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform) looks great on paper, but it'll take a lot of resources to implement it. Just picture trying to integrate all the production and logistics details of even a small-sized company‚Äîit‚Äôs a huge task that requires a lot of Palantir experts and thus money.\n* This brings me to the next thing: Palantir was often called a \"glorified\" IT consulting company, not a real software company. From what I know, Palantir doesn't have its own foundational AI model. AIP is \"just\" a platform for implementing models like GPT-4 and mirroring a company's internal networks. Such customized software solutions must be a huge effort to create and maintain. But what's the moat here? That doesn't mean that the resulting software is bad, but how does this scale? To me, this sounds like a consulting business...\n* Palantir has a great reputation thanks to its government contracts. But this mainly comes from the days when it was hard for government organizations to find good programmers - perfect conditions for an IT consulting company. \n* Palantir's bulls often say that the company's most advanced technology is top secret, which makes it hard to see how they're ahead of the game. If these cutting-edge technologies are only for the military and intelligence, then Palantir is basically a defense contractor, which also doesn‚Äôt justify the current valuation.\n\nI'm looking forward to a productive discussion :-)",

There's no way to fake the measurable, critical success that Palantir continues to deliver. Palantir would not keep winning huge contracts if they weren't delivering results. The fact is Palantir continues to grow at an impressive rate and have great products. I would say right now that Palantir is in a king maker's position for any company that wants to dominate their industry. Why? Because many companies realize the importance of AI but just can't wrap their head around it. Those who hire Palantir get a company that understands AI (they've been doing it for 20 yrs) and harnesses the massive power of AI implementation. In a sense, Palantir gives companies First Mover status within a given industry because those who harness AI first leave their competition in the dust. There was a recent article in Yahoo Finance that said that Palantir could become a Trillion dollar company and I totally agree.",
