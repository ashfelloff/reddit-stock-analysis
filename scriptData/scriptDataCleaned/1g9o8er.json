  "selftext": "Cannabis stocks will be a dividend empire, mark my words. I made a post before christmas predicting the drug schedule change would happen soon. This means, more companies will be able to create a stronger revenue for multiple reasons. BTI one of the largest tobacco companies (also one of the best dividend stocks) bought a SHIT ton of msos before christmas. When a leading dividend company this large buys a lot of msos, theirs a strong reason. \n\nCannabis like tobacco is a very easy thing to produce, create addictions, and profit hella. This allows companies to give back dividends a lot more than other markets. The hard part is finding the right cannabis company, which is like picking a needle in a hay stack. My advice is to eyeball these foreign countries, and go heavier into ETF’s. Cannabis has insane potential for long term holders. \n\nMy guess is around election time (after it) will be the reschedule of cannabis. The election does have a part to play in legalization, but both parties are now coming out in support of cannabis. Florida, California, and more states will soon decriminalize and legalize the use of cannabis.",

      "body": "I’m in Canada where we’ve had free recreational use and growing since 2018 and I’ve grown my own most years. Normally just 4 plants tossed in the ground in my backyard with 20 mins weekly of watering/tending. It’s quite literally as easy as growing tomatoes, and there’s thousands of vids on YouTube of growers showing you advanced techniques if you want to get fancy with it.\n\nI get 0.5-1.5 lbs per plant, and average around 3 lbs per season. That’s conservatively ~$5k worth of weed each year for 20 mins of weekly watering and tending. No hydroponics, no fancy setup. Just a small ass backyard garden in the suburbs. My friends downtown literally grow on their apartment patios. I don’t know anyone who’s been inside a dispensary in years. \n\nLast year I spent a single afternoon prepping the oil to make weed butter and baked/freeze-dried ~$3,000 worth of cookies. It cost me like $24. \n\nThis is why I’d never invest in weed stocks. Living in a place where it’s been recreationally legal I see how irrelevant the publicly traded companies are. It’s SO easy to do yourself and you’ll save literally thousands of dollars. Feels like most people invested in the industry live in places that haven’t experienced this yet, and are simply unaware or misinformed how low the barrier to entry is. It’s not like tobacco where 99.9% of users are buying from stores. Most routine and occasional cannabis users are either growing themselves or know someone who grows and can sell to them for extremely cheap.",

Stories about how far down cannabis stocks have come as a predictor for future performance is not super relevant.  They traded at stupid valuations previously, reality caught up, now they trade at reasonable valuations with good upside.\n\nThe near term upside comes from two major events.  A move to schedule three and adult use legalization in Florida.  Federal decriminalization exists and has bipartisan support but buy 20 year LEAPs if you want to bet on that happening.\n\n\n\nSchedule three is a change with massive tax savings implications that is estimated to be $700M – $1B for the top ten MSOs alone.\n\n  \nThe top US cannabis companies like Trulieve and Green Thumb have a major presence in Florida, which is a completely monopolized market (normal Florida stuff).  Adult use will skyrocket revenue for companies there.  At the end of the day, nobody wants to go on an app for a fake tele doctor visit to get a prescription just to walk into a store.\n\n  \nLast note about Tilray:  Nobody wants that Canadian boof.",

Cannabis can we gotten easily both legally and illegally. Legally most states of medical laws now, you can buy THC at most gas stations because of the 2018 farm bill, and illegally the prices are absolutely dirt cheap. Cheaper than I’ve seen them in 15 plus years since I first smoked. \n\nThe problem with uncapping demand is that there are tens of millions of people prohibited from smoking due to drug tests. Goverment and military, truck drivers, equipment operators, construction, security, mining, oil and gas, manufacturing etc. \n\nI personally know, in my small circle, several dozen people who would smoke regularly, including myself, if we weren’t drug tested for it. \n\nNow you’re thinking “if it’s legal they can’t drug test for it” and that’s simply not true. With insurance costs at all time highs, agencies always reward additional drug testing policies, and employers aren’t going to care unless mandated. \n\nThere are 2.2 million CDL holders alone who can’t smoke unless DOT regulations are changed.",
