  "selftext": "Cannabis stocks will be a dividend empire, mark my words. I made a post before christmas predicting the drug schedule change would happen soon. This means, more companies will be able to create a stronger revenue for multiple reasons. BTI one of the largest tobacco companies (also one of the best dividend stocks) bought a SHIT ton of msos before christmas. When a leading dividend company this large buys a lot of msos, theirs a strong reason. \n\nCannabis like tobacco is a very easy thing to produce, create addictions, and profit hella. This allows companies to give back dividends a lot more than other markets. The hard part is finding the right cannabis company, which is like picking a needle in a hay stack. My advice is to eyeball these foreign countries, and go heavier into ETF‚Äôs. Cannabis has insane potential for long term holders. \n\nMy guess is around election time (after it) will be the reschedule of cannabis. The election does have a part to play in legalization, but both parties are now coming out in support of cannabis. Florida, California, and more states will soon decriminalize and legalize the use of cannabis.",

      "body": "I‚Äôm in Canada where we‚Äôve had free recreational use and growing since 2018 and I‚Äôve grown my own most years. Normally just 4 plants tossed in the ground in my backyard with 20 mins weekly of watering/tending. It‚Äôs quite literally as easy as growing tomatoes, and there‚Äôs thousands of vids on YouTube of growers showing you advanced techniques if you want to get fancy with it.\n\nI get 0.5-1.5 lbs per plant, and average around 3 lbs per season. That‚Äôs conservatively ~$5k worth of weed each year for 20 mins of weekly watering and tending. No hydroponics, no fancy setup. Just a small ass backyard garden in the suburbs. My friends downtown literally grow on their apartment patios. I don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs been inside a dispensary in years. \n\nLast year I spent a single afternoon prepping the oil to make weed butter and baked/freeze-dried ~$3,000 worth of cookies. It cost me like $24. \n\nThis is why I‚Äôd never invest in weed stocks. Living in a place where it‚Äôs been recreationally legal I see how irrelevant the publicly traded companies are. It‚Äôs SO easy to do yourself and you‚Äôll save literally thousands of dollars. Feels like most people invested in the industry live in places that haven‚Äôt experienced this yet, and are simply unaware or misinformed how low the barrier to entry is. It‚Äôs not like tobacco where 99.9% of users are buying from stores. Most routine and occasional cannabis users are either growing themselves or know someone who grows and can sell to them for extremely cheap.",

Stories about how far down cannabis stocks have come as a predictor for future performance is not super relevant.  They traded at stupid valuations previously, reality caught up, now they trade at reasonable valuations with good upside.\n\nThe near term upside comes from two major events.  A move to schedule three and adult use legalization in Florida.  Federal decriminalization exists and has bipartisan support but buy 20 year LEAPs if you want to bet on that happening.\n\n\n\nSchedule three is a change with massive tax savings implications that is estimated to be $700M ‚Äì $1B for the top ten MSOs alone.\n\n  \nThe top US cannabis companies like Trulieve and Green Thumb have a major presence in Florida, which is a completely monopolized market (normal Florida stuff).  Adult use will skyrocket revenue for companies there.  At the end of the day, nobody wants to go on an app for a fake tele doctor visit to get a prescription just to walk into a store.\n\n  \nLast note about Tilray:  Nobody wants that Canadian boof.",
