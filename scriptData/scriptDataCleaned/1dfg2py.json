      "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nIf your post essentially boils down to trying to recruit others to buy into your stock so that it can squeeze, then your post is not welcome here.\n\nThe truth is, we get a lot of \"squeeze plays\" or \"the next GME\" type threads, and honestly, they never pan out.\n\nIf you really have an interesting play, it should be able to stand on its own merits, without necessitating a whole bunch of retailers (kek) to buy in after you and pump up the price.\n\nLook, this isn't a pump and dump forum. For that, try r/ponzischemes.\n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",
