So I stand by my assertion that about mid December I was hearing news reports on TV about a potential outbreak in China. \n\nI will agree though that most of the coverage does begin in January as it wasn‚Äôt until December 31st that China seemed to officially acknowledge they had an ‚Äúinfectious pneumonia ‚Äú going on. So I may have been a month or two early in my retrospective. It was December/January not November/December",

Both articles are from December 31st 2019 though, not nearly as far out as you‚Äôd said originally. China keeps things fairly quiet when the news is negative so I‚Äôm not surprised that we didn‚Äôt hear much until then.\n\nJudging by what you sent, it looks like December 8th is when China reported it to WHO, and that didn‚Äôt hit the news until the end of the month, the 31st. So I‚Äôm gonna stand by what I said: yes, the market knew before COVID before March, but the news really only got started in the beginning of January. Also, at that time it looked like standard news that pops up dozens of times per year. It‚Äôs pretty common to see news of pneumonia or flus in localized areas. We‚Äôve even gotten used to scary things like Ebola or Zika hitting some places but never really making the rounds in the western world.\n\nI‚Äôd say though it‚Äôs technically true that COVID was known by markets before March, the fear really didn‚Äôt start ramping up until mid February, and didn‚Äôt truly scare most people until a few weeks after that.",
