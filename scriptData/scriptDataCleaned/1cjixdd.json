  "selftext": "I've lurked here for a long while, always asking myself \"why are all these broke regards trading options and not buying real stocks?\"\n\nI've been in the market a long time but mostly buy/hold and some trading of only stocks for 20 years. Well yesterday I bought AAPL calls (10 @.70) and sold them today for $5.05.\n\nSo I finally get it, and I'm sure I'll gamble away the rest of my port now that I have found a new fun thing to be obsessed with. I mean, it can't really be this easy can it?\n\nThanks!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/az3yedqqz9yc1.jpg?width=1270&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15ed73109a1534575b67257cc2e4280dc05966fc\n\n",

              "body": "This is the hard part about options, just because your analysis is correct does not mean you will earn money. Great example recently was amazon. Both sides of option holders got IV crushed despite beating earning. The next day, it was up by like 3% yet if you bought calls before earnings , you'd still be in the red because options were pricing in 8%+ movements.\n\nThe correct play would've been selling calls/pulls, but i can imagine that it's extremely scary to sell calls on stocks you know whose price is going up. With stocks you just need to get the direction right to make a profit, with options, time and amount of movement matters.if you went in big and apple didn't announce a massive buyback, you'll be in a lot of pain",
