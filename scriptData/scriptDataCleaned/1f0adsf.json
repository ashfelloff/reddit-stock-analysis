What struck me though is when I started adding other variables and eventually ended up with the combination you see now. Since the 70s, the intersection of falling interest rates and increasing unemployment have occurred around 6 months before or 6 months after each recession. \n\nIn 2023-2024 Slowly and without garnering much attention, unemployment has risen .9% over the last 7 months or so. While this doesn't sound like a lot, if it continues, there will be a major problem. This is because in the last 70 years, a 1% increase of unemployment in a time frame less than 1 year a recession followed. While this wouldn't have been case closed, with the addition of the interest rate there is an even more clear trend. \n\nInterest rates have a very clear relationship with unemployment that when looked at more carefully show a bleak picture. What is also very interesting is the timing of everything is eerily similar to the 2008 interest rate and unemployment numbers. In September of 2007, interest rates were initially lowered, which is almost identical timing as today. At the same time unemployment started to creep up from 4.4% to 4.7% which is where they eventually intersected, and the great recession was triggered. \n\nInterest rates have held steady at 5.33% over the last 9 months or so, but with the announcement from the fed and Powell that they are going to start lowering the interest rates, the trend that has occurred over 6 times (excluding covid) is starting to play out. \n\nUnemployment is currently at 4.3% and all it needs to do is increase another .5% while interest rate are cut down to 4.8% which would only take around two .25 cuts to intersect with each other. \n\nThere is NO example in the last 55 years in which when unemployment rate increases to interest with falling interest rates that a recession was not triggered. I also suspect with the revision of 818k jobs creation that there are more false numbers being reported. I think there is a chance that the entire economy is being propped up on false numbers until after the election. \n\n  \nSo with high regards, do with this is information as you will, I'm almost certified Illiterate so there are bound to be mistakes and typos but I personally found this interesting and wanted to share. I can feel the downvotes in my nuts already but it is what it is.",

The government is running massive budget deficits of let's say $1.5 Trillion per year. That's more borrowed money propping the system up. But, the Fed has been doing QT the last 2 years, and the M2 money supply has decreased. So, I'm glad you're having fun, but once corporate profits drop and banks stop loaning money, the whole system is set to take a nose dive. We all know the Fed has printed $8 Trillion since 2008 to keep the system going. I don't know why you're mocking people who point that out.  Now you're in Checkmate. Either the Congress comes in with Trillions more to prop up the system, which will cause massive inflation as we just saw, or they let it all go down in a deep recession. Let me know the other choice. You're so dumb, saying people have been calling for recession since 2021. Yeah, the Congress passed a $1.9 Trillion stimulus bill in March 2021. Was there really any Bears when that passed saying, I guess a recession is starting today? You're so out of context, it's stupid.",

That¬¥s what the current discussion, if the FED is cutting to late is all about.\n\nBasically what it means is, if your boat takes on water (unemployment) and you start pumping agains that (reduce interest rates) but there is to much water and it keeps rising, your boat will sink.

Everyone here will continue to screech that stocks only go up, they‚Äôll buy the dip, etc etc. But no one realizes this isn‚Äôt going to be like Covid. No one was allowed to fail in Covid and that‚Äôs not how a recession works. \n\n-People will take a 40%+ portfolio trimming\n\n-Jobs will be slashed left and right\n\n-Overpriced assets will lose value\n\nThere‚Äôs not going to be anything soft about this landing. Do you know how many people overpaid for homes the past few years? How many people bought way more car than they could really afford? Added debt to take fancy trips? Took on jobs with companies that have never made money in their history? \n\nThe only thing propping things up was the labor market and that has cracked and is blowing up. But no one is going to believe things have gone south until the market drops or they personally lose their job. \n\nThere aren‚Äôt bulls right now, there aren‚Äôt bears right now. It‚Äôs the pigs that are running around pretending that the good times will continue on. Those are the ones that will be slaughtered. \n\nI‚Äôm about 75% net worth in U.S. treasury money markets because this is going to go majorly south soon in my opinion too. \n\nBack in 2007 the fed was many months ahead of the curve when it came to cutting rates. It was WELL before the labor market began deteriorating. About 1 year before the Sahm rule triggered. The Sahm rule triggered last month and we‚Äôre just now looking at a cut in September. They are painfully behind and the sudden flip shows the major concern now.\n\nIt will be just like a theatre fire.

There is a bubble in assets and equities, but it always takes a combination of bad events to trigger it. A China/Taiwan confrontation, Israel/Palestine escalating to a full conflict, etc. Anything that engages the US directly, more directly than proxy wars, would be the ignition.\n\nUntil then, US labor and investments have been rather consistently appreciating, with cyclical downturns and rotations. The 2008 crash was a significant one, and a strong argument could be made that the ‚Äúreset‚Äù and deflation made for under-valuation of real estate and wall st between 2010-2016.

The FOMC can reduce FFR as quickly as it needs to. Many of the central banks top economists believe a soft landing is possible under the current conditions. They are watching labor intensely at this point for the reasons you explained. Considering an incredible amount of variables they must consider in their models, it is prudent to gather as much current data points as they can before moving. The way I read Powell‚Äôs Jackson Hole speech, there is some confidence that inflation is going down without a significant disruption in labor. Much of the stimulus money has been spent, and there is a greater labor participation rate. Labor supply and demand id becoming more in balance. No one knows what the future holds, but I am bullish. As far as geopolitical issues, that stuff happens every day. Hopefully in the long run, China becomes a more cooperative member of the world community.

I might be biased toward the thinking of the FOMC. Their consensus appears to be more likely now to have a softish landing. Just technical analysis alone tells us we have hiccups coming, but a hiccup won‚Äôt cause me to bail. I can only hope program trading doesn‚Äôt screw things up. Lately, like with the Yen affair raising the VIX to 65, I bought a bunch of bargain stocks. It was known early that it was caused by the ‚Äúcarry trade.‚Äù That may happen again. The greed is still there and the Yen is still cheap. So far I have been lucky to have scooped up cheap stocks on a quick dip. When funds rebalance or huge stockholders have to sell millions of shares, you can see the price tank a bit. I always try to nibble down until it starts going back to the proper market value. \n\nI also make money when the market moves either way. I sell weekly covered calls on volatile companies. When things go down enough, I buy back for very little. Some weeks I can reset once or twice if the price spikes high enough fo me to get a decent premium, then resell, rebuy, repeat. I just don‚Äôt like hedging with put spreads because that gets expensive. My soft hedging with covered calls works for me. Recently, I got stuck rolling some of my short calls, so my weekly income is down, but, if the market tanks, I‚Äôll make a killing on my $42,000 in shorts, then perhaps reset at closer expirations. So, I don‚Äôt care if the market goes up or down in the short run. I tend to stick with my underlyings consistently because I trust fundamentals over technical analysis, which to me observes market behavior, which I don‚Äôt need graphs for on companies I know very well. I do look at graphs, but I don‚Äôt live by them. Resistance levels get broken, and you just never know the timing or a meteoric rise.",

It would also be interesting to lay out the SP500 on the same time axis on a log scale above these two lines (not intersecting) to see the relationship between historical recesssion indicators (crossing of unemployment and fed fuds rate) and market returns.  I don't think the crossing of the lines is sufficient evidence to predict recession; what is the narrative around each recession? In 2020, it was COVID-19. In 2007-2009 it was the housing bubble. In 2001-2002, it was the dot com bubble. What would be the narrative now?",

Could have qualified that as a recession. Now we've got decreasing rates headed our way because the economy is slowing down.\n\nThere is nothing normal about this market.
