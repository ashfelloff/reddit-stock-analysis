So basically right on par, except when you consider that her trades are leveraged options meaning her actual choices trail the QQQ by quite a bit.  If you compare shares vs shares or options vs options you'd have made a lot more money just buying QQQ vs whatever she buys.\n\nShe made most of her money on long term leaps in MSFT and AAPL that she held for a long time.
