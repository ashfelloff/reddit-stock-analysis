  "score": 335,
  "selftext": "Tesla‚Äôs hyped robotaxi unveiling posed a threat to Uber‚Äôs ride-sharing aspirations, but it has turned into a boon for the stock instead.\n\nUber shares had been falling on the initial investor excitement leading up to Thursday‚Äôs event ‚Äî particularly slumping in early August and mid-September ‚Äî but surged more than 9% on Friday on renewed enthusiasm that the company is well positioned to advance its autonomous vehicle offerings. The move pushed the stock to a 52-week high and it was leading the S&P 500 higher during the session.\n\nThat is a massive turnaround for Uber‚Äôs stock, which is now up nearly 22% over the past month and about 38% for the year. Lyft, another major player, is also surging about 10% on Friday. By comparison, Tesla‚Äôs shares are plunging during Friday‚Äôs trading session and are down more than 11% this year, vastly underperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq, which have each gained around 22% so far this year.\n\nThe buzz around Tesla‚Äôs highly anticipated cybercab has largely dissipated due to a lack of detail on its latest full self-driving technology advancements and the company‚Äôs failure to provide insight on its ride-sharing service strategy or economics, among other expectations investors had.\n\n‚ÄúTSLA‚Äôs toothless taxi is a best-case outcome for UBER,‚Äù Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni said in a Friday note, noting that the electric car maker provided ambitious targets but little signs of feasibility.\n\n  \nSource:  [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/ridesharing-giants-uber-lyft-jump-after-teslas-toothless-taxi-fails-to-excite-investors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/11/ridesharing-giants-uber-lyft-jump-after-teslas-toothless-taxi-fails-to-excite-investors.html)",

His shitty actions have led people to stop believing in his rhetoric and to stop investing in his companies. Those are his consequences. If you want to whine about it, you can feel free to flock to ex-twitter with all the other hateful bigots spewing bullshit left and right. \n\nInvestors are no longer fooled by his grand gestures and ideas. We see through his grifting nonsense and see him just as another lackey pushing bullshit.",
