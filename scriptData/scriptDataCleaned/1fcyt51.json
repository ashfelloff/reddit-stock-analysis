              "body": "So the reason that happens is because of Apple refusing to use the RCS protocol for messaging like everybody else or to release iMessage to anybody but themselves.  It means that anybody texting between Android and iPhone defaults back to SMS which is an older standard that doesn't support \"rich\" texting features such as multimedia (or pictures larger than like 100 kilobytes.)  \n\nThe good news is that Apple finally caved and announced last year that they will be adopting RCS for iOS 18 meaning the blurred images and videos thing shouldn't be a problem anymore.  \n\nThe bad news is that Apple's entire mobile device identity for a period of years was based on \"blue bubble vs green bubble\" which made them delay this adoption by an extra 5 years or so.",

Also the newest iPhones used to be like $600-$900, whereas now they are like over $1k, so it was a lot more affordable to buy a new phone every year if you really wanted the newest one.",

Guess I better start making more cold calls lol.\n\nWhat I will say about innovation is this.  Apple is not materially innovating at the velocity they did when the smartphone was first unveiled.  I don't even think you can call it \"innovation\", it's really just \"improvements\" ... like a better camera or slightly different case.  If there's an OS change, it's almost always an annoying reshuffle of random things like emojis, settings menus, etc.  \n\nWhen you really get down to it, there hasn't been anything materially innovative since the iphone 5.  Until they can produce a truly compelling breakthrough in design or function, the only ones that are going to play the voluntary apple hardware subscription service model are the apple fan boys and fomo'ers.",

They need to improve battery life  or make it super lighter on their flagship model. Maybe make a phone where u don’t need a case and the camera does not protrude out where it’s obvious it’s meant to have a case? Why have different colors or show it’s made of titanium when it’s originally designed to be use with a case? Across the board, there isn’t much new and the weight and battery life seems to be a constant across generations of devices which I find disappointing. In fairness, I just don’t think there is much left to innovate on the hardware side, but I don’t see much happening on their other product lines either.
