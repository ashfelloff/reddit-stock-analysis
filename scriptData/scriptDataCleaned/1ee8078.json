People use laptops for general productivity and the real users of AI, game designers or 3D artists do not render or process real workloads on their laptops? I think the general public are miles away from understanding real world use cases but absolutely no one on earth would do any sizeable rendering/AI workload job on a portable device. It just isnt practical. Theres a reason why game designers use 4090's and massive Imacs or do work in the cloud. Local processing on a laptop is just never realistic. Therefore charts are fun but meaningless.",
