  "selftext": "So Thursday evening that HUGE spike was a 101% gain to 72k.. I had some options that I bought for just $2k, there were worth $20k at the end of the day. I did not sell, because they had a high chance of turning into $60k-$300k\n\nUnfortunately, they took a nose dive and were deemed worthless by Friday evening. I told myself $20k is nice, of course, but I would have forever hated myself if I woke up the next morning and saw the real $300k actual potential pop off…\n\nEither way, making this post to show everyone you really can start from fk all, I had only $1.5k that I deposited originally, hell I think I put like $150 here $150 there.. to get to that amount. In less that 1 week (technically) I made it to the $30k. Now nearly scraping back and fourth on that $40k\n\nBut as you can see my buying power, I’m going to deposit that right into my bank. Iv already taken back out like $3.5k as it is.. I’m not going to play this all crazy like, each $10k marker I plan to take out at least $1k\n\nThanks for reading, I hope this brings yall good hope and good vibes!",

Shit, same with ATST, as I stated on someone’s comment.. this isn’t my first go around. I learned (over time of course) holding bags is the FIRST mistake people make. \n\nSome stocks will keep climbing and grow, yes, that’s beautiful.. but the earnings you could make on small movement from heavy stocks is worth WAY MORE in a quick movement\n\nTake intel kid for instance.. that guy bought $600k worth of shares.. wtf was he thinking, he already had $800k\n\nThe number is EASILY where I would take $500k from it and distribute to some growth stocks / dividend paying stocks ~ then I’d take $150k out to use on my life, then the next $150k THAT I’d play with… only real logical thing to do\n\nThat being said, I’m working with scraps still. So, I place logical orders, with willingly 10% of my growth going to ‘bet’ options / growth potential \n\nI hope this answered the question👍🏻\n\n(Quick edit)\n\nRead up on ELI AND LILY before their earnings report, tell me if what you read wouldn’t make you buy calls for their ER. They will continue to climb up, however, I took my earnings and move it around. Look for next ER or news that makes sense and then I’ll place puts or calls towards it again",

I do got some small ‘bets’ placed with other stock options - example: I have some options for Dutch brothers, do I plan on buying the stock, do I plan on holding till I make 100% +.. nope, I just use a few $100 to buy some options, if I make 20-40% I move on out\n\nDoing that with any stock is where you need to play it safe. It really is that simple. You don’t need to be greedy, you don’t need to just constantly ‘bet’ / throw away money.. you let some plays make you some money, and you move on.\n\nOf course, that being said, if you see something great (like lly’s ER) you go with whatever you feel and you go hard at it! My way of doing that, I had only $7k at that moment before ER, I used $4.3k right into 4 options… they made me $16k over night ~ I moved out and went on about my day.\n\nWhat I didn’t post is TECHNICALLY, if I had held the position for just 1 more day (seriously, it expired the next day) I could have made $45k\n\nWas I bothered by that… sure, but that’s not the point in this game. You take your winnings and you move on. Not every play is going to X10, and not every play is going to X10 if you just hold for one more day (as the post stated.. my one hold that I kept I actually lost the $20k gains)\n\nEvery day there is opportunity out there.
