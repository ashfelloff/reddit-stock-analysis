It was tightness in the labor supply combined with possibly the most sudden and deep  supply crunches (talking about physical goods) that we have ever seen.\n\nDoes no one remember how hard it was to get a new car or a graphics card due to supply chain disruptions? We temporarily switched from a service economy to one that biased goods as more people opted to spend more time indoors. Then in 2021 and 2022 businesses were begging for workers, this was especially prevalent in low wage jobs like fast food workers. Businesses had to pay more for their labor as nobody wanted to work those jobs as the workforce reassessed their worth. \n\nBlaming inflation solely on money supply is an extremely miopic view. It's like everybody forgot about the chaos of a worldwide pandemic which killed or injured millions of workers and led to seismic shifts in peoples buying habits. \n\nThe fed only has so much power. They're not gods. Their actions are a comparatively small piece of a much larger puzzle.",

Then they added bonuses to unemployment checks allowing teenagers who had been making less than $150 per week to draw $1000.00 per week.  Many areas $50k a year WASNT a lot but across the Midwest and most rural areas in the country that WAS a decent salary. This attempt to help caused a mass walkout on companies and then the extension of years of unemployment benefits created this very strange place where ice cream shops literally couldn’t get people to show up for $20 an hour.  \nCompanies that had been on the upper realm of wages couldn’t fill in much needed positions paying above anything they had ever paid.  Because $50k a year sitting on the couch doing a few side hustles off the record is better that $75k a year and having responsibilities.  Shortages on labor and shortages on people willing to work equaled bigger shortages on supplies and suddenly the cost of all things skyrocketed.  As supplies began to return companies held much higher prices stating that they had been undervalued for decades.  Although prices have come down they have held at 25%+ prices across the board with many closer to the 75-120% price increases.  \nSame with the higher wages as people started to loose unemployment benefits trying to return to a job having not worked for a number of years it’s weird on all sides.  Experienced people are off rhythm and having to relearn and frustrated with not being able to get back to the pay they formerly had because they spent 2-4 years not working.  The money supply was a huge factor but the way they managed it was absurd and the billions upon billions squandered on nonsense was beyond terrible.  \nCVS Walgreens and others got billions to put into infrastructure in order to “be able to keep vaccines cold enough”. I saw how some of these ran down inner city dump stores had multimillion dollar renovations from tax dollars.  This was repeated across the map.  The worst of the stores were fully renovated.  They needed this work but billion dollar companies gained hundreds of billions in assets from tax dollars and continue to make billions from the vaccines now.  Seems like perhaps some percentage of return should have been paid.  \nMy own small hometown got 8 million to use to fix roads so that emergency vehicles could respond quicker.  Once again this is good for back home but it was not part of what should have happened.  Just more pumping of money when we are broke as a country.  You can’t borrow money to go on vacation when you’re unable to pay your mortgage or else you are gonna be homeless soon.  It’s irresponsible and there will be consequences to these actions as we see.  Feds raise rates and talk of pulling them back but they won’t because they have no idea what to do aside from wait it out.",

It's really frustrating that people in my area made $9 maybe $10 an hour working entry level jobs and are now making nearly double in the high teens yet at the same time those in my field, with a college degree, went from maybe 30 to 35 at most. They completely devalued us and now wonder why we are pissed off. Not to mention we as nurses worked thru the whole pandemic and had to earn our money while risking life threatening disease. While a large majority of the town sat at home making a fortune compared to what they were making and all while relaxing and watching Netflix. Now post pandemic everything costs a damn fortune the poor are still poor and I'm effectively making less due to inflation. Fuck this government.",

There's no way the next 100 years is going to see the same magnitudes of growth. Like, not even anywhere NEAR. World population grew by a factor 4.5 from 1.7 billion in 1924 to 8 billion today. You think in the next 100 years we're going to see the same trend, so 4.5 × 8 = 36 billion? Nope, it's projected to peak around 11 billion or so and then decline. US GDP grew a staggering 25 times, adjusted for inflation. For the next 100 years, a 25-fold growth is laughably rediculous. At 2% real growth it's more likely to go x6, and imo 2% is very, very optimistic. We'd be lucky to see any real long term growth at all. Technological advancement? We'll see. I'm very skeptical about AI's practical uses. But the theory of humanity being close to reaching a general limit to tech/scientific advancement is gaining ground. Moore's law might soon end.\n\nTL/DR: past S&P 500 performance is very likely to be waaaay better than future performance",
