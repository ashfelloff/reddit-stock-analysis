              "body": "Interesting.  When I wrote this, I was thinking of economics and money, not politics. India saves money, but funds the invasion of a country. The invasion has caused a lot of economic havoc. Tariffs are also about money.  \n\nDon't kid yourself, the US is involved in Ukraine largely due to oil, nat gas, etc. The stories of old school fighting Russia, second cold war, blah, blah, blah distract you.  The US is involved, as they always are (see the Middle East) when energy disruptions are involved.  No energy, or other significant economic impact, then the US does not get super involved. Think Crimea, genocide in Africa, etc, the US did not and does not take action. \n\nThis is all about money, economics, etc.",
