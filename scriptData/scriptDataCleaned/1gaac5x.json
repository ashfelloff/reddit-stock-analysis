On that basis alone to me ACHR stock has a lot of run rate.. and given the substantial difference in value currently you might say it has a clear vertical take off in the near to mid term.  Another point, $1b value is a rounding error in today's valuation of companies.  For a company with a solid heli model out there, full pro staff and, a huge factory buildout in progress and tangible interest with millions already invested and many more committed by blue chip companies and governments of many countries.... $1b is a joke.",

I'm not dumbass, you just have 0 concept of how derivative markets work. Someone buying 100k calls isn't just going to lift the hard offer (the ask). They're likely to place a bid, which market makers will then hit. Sure, they all trade on the bid, but someone still bought 100k calls. You don't just lift the hard offer. Well maybe you do, but someone buying 100k calls has a brain. The OI went up 100k overnight, they're still 0.15b for 15k today (the price it traded at yesterday). The calls were bought. Does it mean the stock will go up? Nope. But it certainly doesn't make me a moron, that would be you",
