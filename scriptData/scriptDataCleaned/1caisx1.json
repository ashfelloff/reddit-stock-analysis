So you’re hoping that the stock will be below $141 by Friday. But you also have the premium cost of $655 so really you need the stock to be below $134.45 by Friday to not lose money.\n\nOf course the best thing to do is not hold to expiration and just sell as soon as you have a significant gain.",

Then you can risk less than 100 on a contract. And see how everything works. See how theta will wreck your ass if you think of options as “investments” etc. Don’t kid yourself. Options are 100 percent gambling. Do calls when starting out. 1 less thing to fuck you up when calculating everything. Lastly. Use a profit tracking chart for your specific call option.

But there is a catch, this thing cost $655 at the time you took the screenshot that you will pay upfront to get the right to sell at this $141 price. Now it become worth it once you cover the cost of the contract too. \n\nThankfully the app does the math for you. It become worth it if tesla shares drop until $134.45. If you believe this can happen then you could try, but if it doesnt you should be ready to lose the whole $655. \n\nThe best is to try to sell the contract you bought before the expiration date. The price of the contract increased as tesla price drop, but the price of the contract also drop every day you are approaching expiration day or if tesla price go up, or the stock price is not expected to move anymore (like after earnings when big move is over).",
