This isn’t my full port or even my half port.  Nothing has changed in my lifestyle or future plans from this loss.\n- The stock market is irrational in the short term. Big earnings beat, tepid forward guidance but negative price movement? Makes no logical sense. I do think this stock will go up in the long term but I was not expecting a 25% drop from the top.\n- Don’t post any large numbers to WSB cause it really brings out the sickos. Please stop DMing me asking for money.\n- I’ll never buy a burrito again\n",

Yes it was a hit piece. Don’t even need to read it (I still did) to know that. There are so many factors that impact this and it felt like stick espionage.\n\nHere is where I went wrong in my thesis. They are driving down the price because earnings are going to be great. And they were. It’s funny how media outlets can take one cautionary remark and use it to explain why the stock is still dropping. \n\nI heavily debated $55c and then $52c day of earnings and passed. Something still seems off, and I usually don’t grab the falling knife by the handle. So I stayed out. \n\nYour play seems to be based on a good earnings and recovery from the BS portion size article and other bullish things the stock is doing. Not wrong, but it just shows how much the market can remain somewhat irrational.\n\nThe hit piece could actually have been spun as bullish. Holy shit investors chipotle is selling the same burrito bowl with 1/3 less product in it! It’s not different than company layoffs driving a stock price higher.\n\nWHEN this recovers it’ll pay great on calls. I just don’t know when that will happen.\n\nSorry for your loss.",
