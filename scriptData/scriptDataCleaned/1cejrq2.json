              "body": "It’s all marketing anyway.  The SAE levels of classification are the only thing that matters.  When Musk goes on about robotaxis and such it would require them to leap towards level 4 when they still haven’t shown they can get past level 2.  Level 4 is where waymo basically is, it’s operating in warm climates, and is still having issues (ie see SF).  It’s absolutely absurd to believe that any sort of meaningful “robotaxi” would be ready for Tesla by end of summer anywhere you currently drive a Tesla.  It’s probably a desperate attempt to attempt to keep the stock price afloat and to distract from these NHSTA findings and any pending regulatory action.",
