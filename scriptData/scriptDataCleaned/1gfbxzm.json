With present trading, people expect 50-500% in weeks/months and it simply isn't sustainable. It's a fantasy.\n\nConsider that _every single bit of the entire tech industry_ is an interwoven web of spending between tech giants and the smaller tech companies, of which there are presently thousands, that have IPO'ed in the last decade. They're all pushing the same narrative simultaneously - AI is going to revolutionize everything and you best get onboard or you will get left behind. Their balance sheets are wholly dependent on each other.\n\nIn short, the end of this present AI bubble would cease the ongoing promise of catching up to P/E ratios these companies are probably literally _never_ going to see.
