  "selftext": "Learned my lesson after years of loss.. March 20th, 2020 deposited most of my bonus into 10 stocks, since then only added, never sold except once when I needed $200k for a property purchase. 5 years of working 12hrs a day, 80%+ of pay goes to investing, no stupid consumerism! Currently own over 15 stocks. Long term, no timing, no bs, just buy and hold and be very calm, very patient.. closing in on 5 years in March 2025, then will sell slowly and retire happily with $60-$70k a year for next 20 years, no mortgage, no debt, simple living.. fuck employment.. fuck luxury.. fuck rat race.. calm mind and heart.. back to basics.. \nwhat a big scam this life / economy / rat race is.. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è \n\n",

The I watched as my P&L kept falling, I thought for sure we hadn‚Äôt hit bottom. I sell my puts for a huge profit but lot as huge as it could have been.\n\nThen I flip to bullish at SPY $520 after it ripped to about $530 and I got my chance.\n\nI lost betting on a China recovery twice this year that never came. ThenI said ‚Äúfuck, I‚Äôll kick myself if this is the one time it happens.‚Äù It was also roughly the time Chinese stocks rallied and I had this theory that there‚Äôs a political reason Xi makes big policy decisions in October. \n\nLost money betting on Israel and Iran fucking up oil supplies. \n\nMade money with a day trade that day NVDA fell what, like 10% or more in a day? That was insane! \n\nBought $100 30 DTE options on NVDA like a month ago.\n\nMy other big money sinks have been times where I was sure this was a trend day on SPY and it was NOT a trend day. Yesterday was one of those. When I think it‚Äôs a trend day I get the 0 DTE options \n\nI mostly play big geopolitical events.",

Before that I was always looking for a trade and would get into bad positions just because I wanted to trade something, and learned that was not the right way to do it, for me at least.\n\nI also only use a very small amount of my portfolio for options gambling (it's also the only type of gambling I enjoy lol).",
