  "selftext": "RCL is significantly undervalued The noobs are buying CCL and NCLH since it is down more without noticing the companies have 2 to 2.5 more shares outstanding and 2 to 3 times more debt with similar earnings. RCL has nearly double the earnings/double the debt and 30% more shares. NCLH has 20% more earnings, double the debt and 2.3 more share out. CCL has the same earnings, triple the debt and double the shares outstanding.\n\n**Royal Caribbean**: has a market cap of $37.4b an enterprise value of $59b or $140 a share. It projects to earn $11 (likely to beat). RCL had $11b of debt before COVID and $3.4b of EBITDA with $21.4b of debt. This year it should have $6.2b.\n\n**Carnival:** has a market cap of $21b (using 1.4b share count), an enterprise value of $52b. It projects to earn 98 cents. CCL had $11.2b of debt before COVID and $5.6b of EBITDA. and $32b of debt\n\n**NCLH**: has a market cap of $9.8b, and an enterprise value of $24b. It projects to earn $1.23 this year. NCLH had $6.8b of debt before covid and $1.8b of EBITDA. This year it has $14b of debt.\n\n**Valuation Metrics**\n\nRCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.5  \nRCL: Current PE 11.67\n\nCCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.3  \nCCL: PE ratio of 15\n\nNCLH Enterprise value to EBITDA of 10.9  \nNCLH: 15.4 PE\n\nThe way valuation works is companies with less debt should have higher PE’s. RCL has better growth prospects then these companies and lowering its debt. I know people are confused because NCLH and CCL are still down a lot since COVID. But both companies have a lot more shares outstanding.\n\nRCL has 280m diluted shares vs 209 pre covid  \nCCL has 1.40 b shares vs. 686m shares pre-covid.  \nNCLH now has 516m shares outstanding 224m shares outstanding\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a3045ng2c9xc1.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=40c12bf11809072b6e96bd5c5ff6a29cb5579037",
