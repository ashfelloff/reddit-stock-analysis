  "score": 142,
  "selftext": "After Intel's disastrous report yesterday and ARM's solid earnings beat (but cautious guidance), let me make a prediction:  The era of Intel's x86 processor architecture for personal computers is over. \n\nThe age of power efficient ARM-based processors for all personal devices, from PCs to laptops to cell phones, has begun. Apple led the way with its M1-M4 processors, and with Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, ARM-based Windows laptops are now available. Even if Snapdragon is underwhelming today, its time will come.  \n\nThe software industry will follow, releasing more and more applications in ARM-optimized versions. We are already familiar with this kind of duality in applications for MacOS, where two versions of an application, one optimized for Apple Silicon (ARM) and one optimized for Intel (x86), are now almost always released.  \n\nFuture applications that rely on AI on the edge will require ARM-based systems. One day there will be an AI application that blows everyone away and forces the last users to ARM-based systems, dealing the final death blow to Intel. \n\nThe only way for Intel to survive (or even thrive in the long run) would be to stop developing chips and become a TSMC-style foundry on U.S. soil.",

This might also not be completely true for all types of software engineers, if you work with embedded systems you will most likely need a Windows computer as well.\n\nYeah sure, but that doesn't bode well in general for all companies, usually laptops are bought in bulk and they just buy the same 2 models for everyone, one 15 inch and another 13 inch. I have a hard time believing a lot of the IT offices will want to offer more options than they already do. It doesn't make sense to give different Windows computers to people that are only using office suite + teams, and even then a lot of companies already give Macs to these people as Macs are a lot more user friendly and have less problems for IT to deal with overall.\n\nAgain I'm pretty sure ARM will take over x86 eventually, I just don't expect it to happen as fast as it did with Apple computers for Windows machines.

I am an Intel investor. \n\nSome ARM processors might be better than some x86 processors, but its a misunderstanding that you can't achieve the efficiency of ARM processors with x86. Modern CPUs all run microcode, so the architecture is pretty much irrelevant, the performance and efficiency depends on the design of the chip and the manufacturing process.\n\nApple Silicon is great because they allow very big dies and the most modern manufacturing techniques, which results in expensive and very good chips. Every chip manufacturer has its own go at those decisions.\n\nAI is overhyped. \n\nThe PC architecture (that includes the use of x86 processord) will NOT die. Take a look at the number of attempts that have been made, including from intel! I'm writing those lines from an ARM device, that is - for me - a lot more attractive than any PC notebook can be. But it doesn't replace the consistancy the PC platform has offered, and which is oftentimes critical for the applications PCs are used in. Be realistic.\n\nIntel splitted up in 2 parts now: chip design and manufacturing. Both are shit at the moment. All 12th, 13th and 14th gen products are inefficient as hell and pretty much defective. Meteor Lake is most obviously a stop-gap. But they heard the call and the next design (manufactured by TSMC) looks very promising. Manufacturing will take a little bit longer to recover, but the investments have been made, they do have all the best stuff coming up again.\n\nThose were my objective arguments, now to the stuff I don't understand and probably will never: Investors\n\nIntel itself has big challenges at the moment. Their recent chips are essentially dying. They are trying to lie themselves out of the issues, but a complete recall of not only desktop chips, but (at least the more powerful) notebook chips is very possible. I can imagine this takes a dent into the stock again in the coming months, this is when I will buy more stock.",
