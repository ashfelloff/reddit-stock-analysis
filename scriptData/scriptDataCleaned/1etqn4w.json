If the puts expire worthless you keep the premium on top of what you've made already and if your call contracts go ITM you can exercise them with the money made from selling your gains and selling the Cash Secured Puts.\n\nYou went from a lotto dice roll to having a chance to build a solid position around a shitload of shares, don't be actually regarded.",

              "body": "OTM is Out the Money aka your option has no intrinsic value (ie the stock is trading at 7 a share and your calls are for 8 a share at x date). These are the options that will expire worthless if they do not become ITM and are considered lotto tickets, especially if they have a short date to expiry (looking at you 0DTE SPY options aka FDs).\n\nITM is the opposite. It is In the Money. These have intrinsic value. If they are ITM at expiry the option will be valued at the difference between your strike and the actual price of the stock (ie a 5 dollar call on a 7 dollar a share stock is worth 200 dollars because its a difference of 2 dollars per share for 100 shares).\n\nOTM shares have greater gains based on percentage, especially if they become ITM from a stock runup like we saw with ASTS and RKLB and you can get a profit from flipping these instead of making money off the underlying.",
