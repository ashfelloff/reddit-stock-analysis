  "selftext": "Been trading about 6 or 7 years off and on now, about hallways though you can tell…. I found out options. Yes it says I have 900ish dollars left to play. But I am so exhausted from this. Maybe when I’m in a better place in life I will revisit but. I’m officially quitting… again! As you can tell I have before. So this time I’ll quit for a little longer. The big drop at the end was last year and the last drop was this past 10 days revived of trading. It really really sucks so much knowing I have lost this much money. Over about 5 years. I could have had a vacation with my family instead I failed them. I am feeling really down about it on top of some really crappy life events that have been happening. But here’s the silver lining guys… my manager just told me a few years back him and his husband paid 10k each to fly to another state and be hypnotized into losing weight. He said that was years ago and he has since GAINED weight 🤡 no matter how bad you have it someone is worse off. ",

It's easy to get caught up in the losses of life, but the biggest thing I've learned in my recovery (2 years sober in July) is that it does you no good to regret every poor decision you've made. Reflect and learn your lessons, but don't beat yourself up over it. At the end of the day, it's only money and more will come. Focus on the positives in your life, your family, etc. and regain your focus on your priorities. Stay strong brother 🤙",
