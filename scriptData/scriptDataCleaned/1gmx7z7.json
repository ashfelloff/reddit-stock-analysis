  "selftext": "Everyone piling into Tesla, Bitcoin, DJT, etc. and no one ever mentioned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These two companies have been orphaned ever since their conservatorship 15+ years ago. During Trump's first presidency he implemented steps to re-privatize the entities and with him back in office the market reacted accordingly. I started building my position in the junior preferreds a little over a year ago.\n\nShould mention that there is still room to run. Most of the junior preferred issues are trading at around 30% of their face value. I only hold the junior preferred shares as the common will most likely get wiped in any recap and release scenario. \n\nIt will be interesting to see who Trump picks as his treasury secretary in the coming weeks. John Paulson is one of the names being floated around - he famously bet against subprime mortgages during the GFC and holds a large amount of Fannie and Freddie junior preferreds. \n\n[Ignore other financial company holdings - virtually all gains coming from Fannie and Freddie JPS](https://preview.redd.it/q6o6mipgprzd1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=880dad11ef1c86ff4ed5d4820b8d206e1d20ab87)\n\n  \n",

Plus the rapid growth of china forcing US domestic capital into nontradeables. Fannie/Freddie involvement was mostly some loosened regs around what they could underwrite - aimed at reducing racial inequities in credit worthiness but badly done so it backfired.
