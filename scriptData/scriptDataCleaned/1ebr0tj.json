There was a lot of positive gamma coming into it that was hedged off by dealers buying shares going into earnings that then evaporated from the post earnings implied volatility crush. There have been no downward earnings revisions this quarter so they have an excuse to sell off on good to inline results based on outrageous expectations. This shit is all rigged. All these same analysts that keep raising their price targets are the same ones that keep the expectations ridiculously high. It's all just to use retail as an easy foil. That's why these guys spend ridiculous amounts of money on Bloomberg terminals and deep market data that really tell you what the market is positioned to do. What they publish for us plebs is just to manipulate us into being their exit liquidity. \n\nFollow Mott Capital on YouTube, Michael Kramer, and watch some of his recent videos.
