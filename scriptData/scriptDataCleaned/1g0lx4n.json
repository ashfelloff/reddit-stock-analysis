That destabilized the country which allowed these religious extremists to take over. Just like Germany, just like Russia, desparation and war is the perfect environment for hard right conservative governments to thrive.\n\nI constantly hear about how the “Middle East is constantly in turmoil” yet there hasn’t been a single time in their entire history that we haven’t been poking and prodding at at least one or a couple of countries over there. Even present day we’re doing the same shit with Israel and we’ll feel even deeper repercussions down the road. \n\nWe can’t just fuck shit up and awash our hands of all responsibility. Only people inside the US are brainwashed enough to believe that and the entire rest of the world is waking up to the actual reality. It’s time for us to actually GET OUT of the Middle East, own up to our shit and just never involve ourselves there again. Then, and only then, can we just say “hey the Middle East is fucking up again” and be at least somewhat truthful.",
