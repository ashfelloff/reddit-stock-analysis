Feel like it‚Äôs been so beaten down, with this news and recent decent earnings reports it has room to run, possibly to the $4-5 range quickly.  To add to that, it has 15% SI w/ 3 days to cover which might make things interesting.  Jumping on some calls Monday morning.",

That said, It's just an injunction and I doubt they'll win it in the long run. It's a turd of a stock and I don't see them being around in another 10-15 years, if that. I imagine some people will make some decent money in the coming week or 2 by shorting this one.",
