Also accounts receivable increased 400 million YoY, and prepaid expenses increased 200 million YoY.\n\n* Tesla paid a lot of cash for items, which it has not yet sold as finished goods\n* Inventory discussed on page 16: Finished goods 6.75 Billion vs. 5 Billion YoY\n\n**Stock Based Compensation on page 19**: Notably higher levels for R&D, reflecting compensation for AI work.\n\n**Update for 2018 compensation package lawsuit on page 19**: Plaintiff‚Äôs counsel have filed a brief seeking a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50.¬†*Tesla‚Äôs opposition to the fee request is due on June 7, 2024, and a hearing is scheduled for July 8, 2024.*¬†On April 17, 2024, Tesla filed a preliminary proxy statement which included a number of proposals, including a proposal to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award.\n\n* Note the dates in June and July 2024. Any decision on how much the Delaware court will award plaintiff's attorneys is months away at earliest.\n\n**Geographic distribution of revenue decreases: p. 23**\n\nUS revenue in Q1 '24 was 0.8679 YoY (decline of 13.23%)\n\n* The US market accounts for 45.8% of Tesla's worldwide revenue, so declines in the US business arm revenue disproportionately affect Tesla's earnings.¬†**US revenue decline was noticeably steeper than anywhere else in the world.**\n\nChina revenue in Q1 '24 was 0.9388 YoY (decline of 6.12%)\n\n* China accounts for 21.6% of Tesla's worldwide revenue\n\nRoW revenue in Q1 '24 was 0.96606 YoY (decline of 3.394%)\n\n* Rest-of-world accounts for 32.6% of Tesla's worldwide revenue\n\n**Restructuring Costs p. 24**: In April 2024, we initiated certain restructuring actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a result, we expect to recognize in excess o*f $350 million of costs primarily related to employee termination expenses*¬†in the second quarter of 2024.\n\n**Cost of advertising and marketing, page 29**¬†: $41 million increase in promotions, advertising and other marketing expenses.\n\n**Potential director sales of stock p. 34**: On February 5, 2024, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, one of our directors, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement for the potential sale of up to 280,000 shares of our common stock, subject to certain conditions. The arrangement's expiration date is February 28, 2025.\"\n\nTLDR:\n\nSince you're all geniuses and knew it would rip after earnings I'm sure you'll all figure out what plays to make",

It can happen in the opposite direction too.  Musk pumped the stock, but Tesla's financials IMO don't back that pump.
