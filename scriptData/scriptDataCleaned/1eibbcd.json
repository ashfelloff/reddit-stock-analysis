  "title": "10 Year Treasury is Crashing - Jerome Powell Made a Mistake Not Cutting Rates",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Clearly, the 10 year is crashing and this is not good. The unemployment rate came in at 4.3% and best believe this marks a significant turning point. \n\nJerome is also wrong signalling a 25 bps cut. It needs to be 100 bps at this point. At this point, if consumer pricing doesn't come crashing down this will be viewed in the rearview mirror as a colossal economic failure by Jerome Powell. \n\nFor months and months and months the Fed was looking at a situation that never matched up with the reality on the ground. Levi jeans pricing was not the key indicator one should have been looking at as why they should be considering cutting rates. \n\nJPow was asked directly, point blank, if job data was weak would you consider cutting rates. Ever since that woman asked him that question job data has come in very weak. So weak we are now driving right off a cliff and into an economic recession. \n\nForever and ever, in the annals of history, I will never understand WHY THE HELL a home interest rate is tied into the overall rate situation by the fed. We're subsidizing Elon Musk's paper empire with EV rebates but one doesn't think to solemnly save the housing situation by letting folks in high rate periods buy into homes at lower rates so the normal cycle of housing can continue unabated. \n\nMoreover, there should be a mandatory housing single family home build requirement for each state that requires housing be built (to a certain percentage) before subsidies are levied out to each state and municipality. This can be managed by location and housing costs. \n\nThere is a way to fix this and the fed holding rates absolutely hostage is not the way. There is nothing being done to actively fix blatantly broken shit. We can't continue to let tech and new emerging market receive every subsidy while the rest of the country suffers. ",

Companies will be more likely to finance projects if the cost of capital is lower which leads to more investment and in theory more innovation. On the consumer side, the 10 is closely linked to mortgage rates so we should hopefully see them come down now too and more activity in the real estate market. \n\nWhat is unsettling is that the market is saying rates will be lower in the future. We’ve known this for a while because the curve has been inverted and rates would have to normalize at some point, but now it seems there is fear that real rates might need to be negative to stimulate the economy. Meaning we could be in a recession in the future.",
