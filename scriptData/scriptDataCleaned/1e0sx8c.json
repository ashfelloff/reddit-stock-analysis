But, in reality, it's a MASSIVE surveillance technology. Here's my logic: NATO works a lot on \"counter insurgency\" which is a military word for \"mass surveillance\", and now that everyone has phones that are always connected to the internet, they can monitor everyones life using large language models to parse their opinions on chat apps, social media, even their TVs (yup, smart TVs are the devil), combined with GPS from Google, and more information from other data aggregators, governments with access to big-tech data can monitor everything about citizens. EVERY THING!Â  \"AI\" is the new oil... China uses it for military, theNATO is a bit behind and Nvidia is selling shovels in a gold rush, actually at this point, Nvidia is the ONLY PRODUCER of shovels, the US paid Intel to make shovels, but Intel is so regarded and so far behind it won't be catching up in the next 2 years\n\n\nEdit: TLDR, government is paying, and they have deep pockets forÂ \"national security and defense\"",
