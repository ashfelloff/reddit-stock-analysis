They only pay a small premium to have this insurance against loss. \n\nAlternatively, eventually they think Apple has peaked, and it's going to fall, so they sell their shares.  But just in case they are wrong, they buy calls to guarantee an entry again at a lower price just in case the price goes up. \n\nThis way they guarantee for a small premium that they can get back in at a price they're okay with. \n\nBonus: volatility allows them potentially to cash out their insurance bets without even being wrong about the longer term movement of their holdings.",
