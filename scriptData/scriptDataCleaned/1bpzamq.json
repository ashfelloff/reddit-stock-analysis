              "body": "There is some interesting literature around that outlines how meritocracy is flawed and unresolvable as such because it is an incredible tool for the likes of your clients to wield in mentally/emotionally justifying their “success.” \n\nBasically, they know everything is unfair and massively stacked in their favor from before birth, but can’t come to terms with how that positions them in a society. So, instead, they preach meritocracy and simultaneously use their current state to illustrate how “hard they worked” without giving concrete examples of how the work or “work” done was the factor in their “success” compared to someone ending at a lesser station. They are lesser because they didn’t work as hard as me. But no actual quantification of any of it. But reality, daddy set up a trust fund and paid for Ivy college, they got the best network with zero debt, and now have infinite resources to tap into for whatever their heart desires vs some kid born to laborers who didn’t eat daily.\n\nAnyways, yeah, without the illusion of meritocracy they’d have to admit that they don’t actually deserve any of it, but just sorta luck of the draw got the right parents. It’s a bit of an existential issue for them. \n\nAlso great for keeping the working class down. “Hey, you work just as hard as me but you aren’t voting right. You can one day be wealthy like me by just working harder and voting in favor of my initiatives. Don’t worry, they favor hard work because I’m the product of merit and you can be too if you vote in favor of my meritocracy!” ",

Sam would be giggling and laughing as the waves of methamphetamine pleasure seem to harmonize with the droning herbrew verses. He runs through the bean bag maze fat and portly, with his viagra powered penis a driving rod for the weasel. Sweat gushing down his face around his unfocused eyes he laughs and chortles until he gasps “Found you!” . The Mathweasel screeches defensively but Wankman Bankman is upon her in seconds. His penis thrusting blindly into her flank, leg, stomach and ribs unconcerned about anything but the motion.

From the NyTimes article:\n\nAt the sentencing, Judge Kaplan pointed to testimony from Mr. Bankman-Fried’s trial that showed the FTX founder’s extreme appetite for risk, saying it was his “nature” to make colossally dangerous bets. “There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad in the future,” he said.\n\nJudge Kaplan also said Mr. Bankman-Fried had lied on the witness stand and failed to take responsibility for his crimes. “He regrets that he made a very bad bet about the likelihood of getting caught,” he said. “But he’s not going to admit a thing.”\n\n…\n\n“When he wasn’t outright lying, he was often evasive, hairsplitting, dodging questions,” Judge Kaplan said on Thursday. “I’ve never seen a performance quite like that.”",
