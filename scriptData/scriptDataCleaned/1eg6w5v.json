  "selftext": "‚Ä¢ Tech stocks saw a selloff, causing both the¬†S&P 500 and¬† Nasdaq to decline ahead of major earnings reports from the Magnificent Seven due within the next day.

The tech giant also revealed that its AI models were trained on Google's custom chips.\n‚Ä¢ AMD ($AMD) reported better-than-expected revenue, driven by robust growth in its data center segment.\n‚Ä¢The hottest IPO of the year is an $18 billion cold storage facility operator.\n‚Ä¢ IPO proceeds year to date have already surpassed $23.2 billion, outpacing the $19.4 billion raised in all of 2023.\n‚Ä¢ Synchron, a Neuralink rival, allows patients to control Apple Vision Pro with their thoughts.\n‚Ä¢ President Biden unveils a Supreme Court reform plan, including term limits for justices.\n‚Ä¢ The U.S. has delayed the implementation of new tariffs on China by at least two weeks.\n‚Ä¢ BYD's first electric supercar has entered production.\n‚Ä¢ Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) will begin offering premium seating options for its passengers.\n‚Ä¢ McDonald's ($MCD) reported a 1% drop in same-store sales, marking its first decline since 2020.\n‚Ä¢ Starbucks' ($SBUX) Q3 revenue and same-store sales growth fell short of expectations.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs Cloud Rain on Earnings Parade\n\nIn a classic case of ‚Äúso close, yet so far,‚Äù Microsoft ($MSFT) reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations, only to see its stock plummet over 5.79% in after-hours trading. Why? Investors fixated on the company‚Äôs disappointing Azure cloud revenue.\n\nEarnings Beat but Cloud Disappoints\n\nMicrosoft‚Äôs revenue soared 15% year-over-year to hit $64.73 billion, topping the expected $64.39 billion. Earnings per share (EPS) also nudged ahead of forecasts, coming in at $2.95 versus the anticipated $2.93. However, the real drama unfolded around Azure‚Äôs performance. The cloud segment grew by 29%, missing the 31% growth analysts had penciled in. This is the first time Azure has fallen short of expectations since 2022. The broader Intelligent Cloud division, which includes Azure, Windows Server, Nuance, and GitHub, reported $28.52 billion in revenue‚Äîjust shy of the $28.68 billion consensus. Despite GitHub‚Äôs impressive $2 billion annual run rate, it wasn‚Äôt enough to quell investor concerns.\n\nBy the Numbers\n\nRevenue: $64.73 billion (up 15% YoY) vs. $64.39 billion expected Earnings per Share (EPS): $2.95 vs. $2.93 expected Intelligent Cloud Revenue: $28.52 billion vs. $28.68 billion expected Azure and Other Cloud Services Growth: 29% vs. 31% expected\n\nMarket Reaction and Future Outlook\n\nWhile the Azure miss stole the spotlight, Microsoft‚Äôs other segments performed admirably. The Productivity and Business Processes unit, featuring Office and LinkedIn, brought in $20.32 billion, beating expectations. The More Personal Computing division, which houses Windows, gaming, devices, and search advertising, reported $15.90 billion, also surpassing forecasts. CEO Satya Nadella highlighted that AI services contributed significantly to Azure‚Äôs growth, adding 8 percentage points. Yet, this AI boost wasn‚Äôt enough to soothe investor nerves. Microsoft‚Äôs shares had climbed 12% year-to-date before this report, outpacing the S&P 500‚Äôs 13% gain. However, the post-earnings dip reflects the market‚Äôs laser-focus on cloud performance, especially as Microsoft vies with Amazon and Google in the lucrative AI and cloud sectors. As Microsoft recalibrates its cloud strategy and continues to push AI capabilities, investors will be watching closely to see if the tech giant can turn its cloud fortunes around in the coming quarters.\n\n  \nChips Ahoy! AMD‚Äôs Data Center Sales Surge 115%\n\nAMD ($AMD) just dropped some serious mic-worthy news: their data center sales have more than doubled in a year. Investors are loving it, with shares spiking 7.59% in extended trading. Let‚Äôs break it down.\n\nEarnings Breakdown\n\nAMD's second-quarter performance outshined Wall Street‚Äôs expectations, fueled by the surging demand for AI chips. Here are the key figures: Earnings per Share (EPS): 69 cents vs. 68 cents expected Revenue: $5.83 billion vs. $5.72 billion expected Data Center Revenue: $2.8 billion, up 115% year-over-year MI300 AI Chip Sales: Over $1 billion for the quarter\n\nAI Chips and Data Center Dominance\n\nThe tech giant's data center segment, which includes their MI300X AI chips, posted an impressive 115% increase in revenue year-over-year. This surge helped push the company‚Äôs overall performance above expectations. AMD's CEO, Lisa Su, highlighted that AI services significantly contributed to this growth, and the company now projects data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the previous $4 billion forecast.\n\nOther Segments and Market Reaction\n\nWhile the data center segment stole the spotlight, here are some other parts of AMD‚Äôs business: Client Segment (PC Chips): $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year Gaming Revenue: $648 million, down 59% year-over-year Embedded Segment: $861 million, down 41% year-over-year\n\nAMD's shares have faced a 6% dip in 2024, but this latest earnings report has turned things around, putting them back in the spotlight as a key player in the AI and data center markets. As the tech world eagerly awaits Nvidia and Intel's upcoming earnings reports, AMD has set the bar high.\n\n  \nOn The Horizon\n\nTomorrow‚Äôs labor market reports, including the ADP report and the employment cost index, are on deck. But let‚Äôs be honest, they‚Äôre all playing second fiddle to the big star: the FOMC announcement. The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's decision-making arm, has one job: balancing inflation and employment. With inflation in the spotlight, the Fed's moves on interest rates will be crucial. This week‚Äôs job reports matter, but the real focus is on how close the Fed is to easing up on rate hikes.\n\nBefore Market Open\n\nBoeing ($BA): Trouble in the skies and on the ground. Sales of the 737 Max are nosediving, and China is distancing itself from Boeing. Despite this, Wall Street remains optimistic, with an average price target 15% above current levels. Expected: $3.51 EPS, $6.85 billion in revenue.\n\nMarriott International ($MAR) : The hospitality giant thrived post-pandemic with revenge spending, but the travel boom is slowing. Investors are eager to hear how Marriott plans to attract more budget-conscious travelers. Expected: $2.47 EPS, $6.48 billion in revenue.\n\nAfter Market Close\n\nMeta Platforms ($META): Next up in the Mag 7 parade, Meta‚Äôs spending spree on AI, including the new Llama 3.1 model, is under the microscope. The focus will be on how these investments impact cash flow and margins. Expected: $4.72 EPS, $38.30 billion in revenue.\n\nArm Holdings ($ARM): With a staggering 94% rise in 2024, Arm‚Äôs valuation is in question. Shareholders are keen to see continued strong demand for semiconductors without sacrificing margins. Expected: $0.34 EPS, $903.57 million in revenue.",
