Here‚Äôs the breakdown:\n\n- Received $100.05 credit\n- Max profit: $100.05\n- Max loss: $9,900 ($10,000 spread width - $100.05 credit)\n\nCurrent SMCI price: $457.95\n\n**Outcome:** OP is looking at max loss. Why?\n- Both puts are deep ITM\n- Will be forced to buy at $1060 and sell at $960\n- Net loss: $99 per share \n\nTotal damage: $9,900\n\nIn conclusion, OP received a $100 credit, but his own amount of $10k collateral will disappear by Christmas because SCMI will not be above anywhere near $1060 by then. He effectively donated $10k to market makers with the click of a button. \n\nFor people saying he can just exercise his put, no he cannot. He sold short the $1060. Unless anyone sells it back to him, which they won‚Äôt, he will just lose the max value of his credit spread of $10k.",

If this is true, you win $9,985\n\n\\~\n\nAssuming you bought at the prices indicated on your first picture, you bought a $960 put for 502.60\\*100 = $50,260 and sold a $1060 put for 100\\*602.65 = $60,265. Congrats. You now have a $60,265-50,260=$10,005 credit in cash. (Your second picture says the prices you actually bought generated a $9,985 cash credit)\n\nThese contracts are super far in the money and their values will move pretty much in lockstep, so you're not going to be gaining or losing much money.\n\nIf SMCI solves literally every global problem before December 20th, their stock value could skyrocket/double, and then you would have contracts which would be worthless or near worthless, so you could by them back for $0 each and keep that $9985 credit. But that won't happen.\n\nIf SMCI stays at below $960.15 on 12/20 then you'll close the contracts back at their intrinsic value (I hope you held on to that $9985) and lose the extrinsic value you paid for ($15).\n\nIf any of the words I said don't make sense to you, you shouldn't trade options.",
