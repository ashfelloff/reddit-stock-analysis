I won't sell Redfin until they start making big money. \n\nHonestly, 2 important conclusions I get from the earning are:\n\n1 - Redfin needs to invest more in marketing. It has the best app, but they have been underspending on TV ad compared to Zillow or Homes.com. Glenn said they will increase ad by becoming more efficient aka fire more people and cut more cost. This worry me a bit because they pretty much already cut to the bone. Though they annouced that they closed home repair service and layoff sale managers. I wonder if this hurts their efficiency. More to see\n\n2. I am less worry about missing estimate. They have been growing really fast with Next and integration of Rent, so bump along the road is expected\n\nObviously Redfin won't make money until market pick up again. They only charge 1% listing fee so they need volume to make money. The market has been crap but I believe it will pick up again. \n\nIt does suck cause both Compass and Zillow have blowout earning. I were hoping the same for Redfin, but well, win some lose some\n\nJust have to wait until 2025! Good luck!",
