The two basic options are calls and puts (buy or sell). You would want to buy a call option if you believe underlying stock will go up and buy put if you believe the underlying will go down. \n\nOption contracts have strike prices and expiration dates, the strike price is the price you‚Äôre signing up for re the underlying. If you‚Äôre buying a call, you would be interested in the underlying price breaching the strike price by gaining value. Buying a put is the opposite, you‚Äôd be interested in the underlying breaching the strike price by losing value. The strike price effectively represents the fixed price you‚Äôre paying for the 100 shares x contract count. \n\nThe expiration date will determine the value of the contract against the underlying price and the strike (see the Greeks), if you hold options to expiration then they will either expire worthless if they did not reach the strike price (as you would be at a loss if you had the shares) or, you could choose/enable auto exercising in your brokerage app. If you have the buying power you can (or be forced) to exercise the option into taking the shares at the strike price, while still losing money you earn the coveted title of bag holder as you now have something of value, but less value than you had awaiting developments. Usually you‚Äôre best advised to sell the contracts you bought before expiration when you believe they‚Äôve hit maximum value or otherwise have made enough returns to take and run. ‚Äú**If it‚Äôs good enough to screenshot, it‚Äôs good enough to sell**‚Äù \n\nI recommend stop loss setups to avoid your shit plunging when you‚Äôre not looking to at least cut your losses \n\nMake sure to do 102 and learn about implied volatility or you will still lose even with 101.",

This should in theory increase price stability by providing extra liquidity and dampen the small price movements in a stocks price.\n\nIn reality, some of them have gone rogue and now appear to be using their privileges as special market participants to move the price of stocks in a direction that is either expedient to them, or a partner in crime. It's speculated that they do this by selling shares they do not own and bouncing the \"IOU\"s around so that they never get caught out. These are called \"Fail to Delivers\" and they can basically be recycled every few days.\n\nA surprisingly large amount of official infrastructure has built up around this counterfeiting process, such as massaging vote counts when 120% of the stock owners vote for a proposition, and yet another 76% manage to simultaneously vote against it.",
