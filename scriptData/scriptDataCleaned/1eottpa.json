I made 85k on gamestop overnight. I was doing okay kind of going even then  Oct and early Nov 2021 I got off my meds and went on a 0dte option spree.

Then it happened. I basically was on 0 sleep for 2 days and lost all but like 80k. 380k to 80k. Fucking hurt bad. I quit options for the most part but I'm a degenerate so I'd throw a few gs here and there. Well beginning of this year I had a couple hundred k saved again and decided to play options again (dear God why?) Except this time I decided to take profits and not touch 0dte (which I've done a few times admittedly. Nobody is perfect. \n\nI wish I could remember all my trades but I think the first half of the year was smci shares and soundhound shares. Then nvda calls. The big drop in the middle is me taking out 75k to invest in a decently established business. The big increase is me depositing the 90kish I turned my last 10k in robinhood into (meme stocks baby). The 40k drop right after is me investing more into that business. Then this past week and a half or so I went on an absolute tear. Approx 60k gains idk fidelity sucks at tracking that shit. My biggest winners by FAR. GOOG calls and shares. Next is prob NVDA or HOOD. I made about 20k on CAVA shares . And probably like 20-30 other stocks. \n\nI'm so grateful that despite being a regarded degen I was able to recover this money. My main changes were buying mostly 2+ months out. Only holding 2 weeks tops. Taking 30-70% profit depending on how long I'd held it. Cutting losers. Not chasing(well I did a few times) and lowering my position sizing way way down. My largest position was like 60k before nvda earnings that if I held would have been like 500k+. I'm not here to say I'm good at this or everybody should try to make their money back but after seeing the intel guy and the dude that lost 1m+ in 3 weeks I wanted to finally share my story. Only 2 people in my life know I've lost and gained this much money and I can tell you it is not fucking worth it. I'm lucky to have decent savings and almost 0 expenses so I could take risks. I've been insanely fortunate that this bull run has gone on this long. I have about 100k on the sidelines and 100k invested in a business that'll pay me dividends yearly now. Idk what the fuck I'm saying now but yeah I got lucky. \n\nAlso the idiots who said go woke go broke when google dropped to 130 thanks for buying my mom and dad a trip to Ireland for their 40th anniversary and me a trip to Japan end of this year. BTW you should be loading the boat on google. It's gonna go back to 190-200. Just buy for Nov/Dec. Okay this post was waaay too long. Also if you lose a lot and feel suicidal PLEASE REACH OUT. TO ME. TO ANYBODY. It feels life ruining for a while but it gets better. If you read all this you must be bored as shit so I salute you.",
