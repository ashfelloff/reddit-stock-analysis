It’s not like Mercedes/BMW don’t already have Level 2 tech, but the reason Level 3 is a significant step is because the liability is no longer on the driver as in Tesla’s system.",

Apples to oranges. \n\nTesla is trying to solve FSD across all driving types and locations. Merc is not, they have to geo locate in a way that makes it unusable, it’s just marketing.\n\nAnd then with Waymo, while their efforts are impressive, are hardly scalable. The cities they are in they geo locate to only the easiest location and it avoids taking the fastest route (avoiding left turns for instance). Sometimes it will take you 25-30 minute out of the way, vs simply getting on the highway. This method is good for some locations, but is going to take a lifetime to scale.\n\nSay what you want about Tesla, but I’ve yet to see anyone solving the problem in a similar way they are. Have they missed estimates? Sure…but this is a problem no one has solved, and they currently have the most data backing them up. \n\nFSD 12 is currently the best autonomous system you can get.
