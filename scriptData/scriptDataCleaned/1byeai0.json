Wtf are you talking about, btc fell after every halving in the short term. \n\nThe “largest pullback” is also not that important, MSTR dumped from like 200 to 30 in a day in the early 2000s when SEC found out Saylor was cooking the books. It also dumped from 1000+ to ~400 in 2021. What makes you think the dump stops at measly 11%?",

Cowen and BTIG both believe the premium is related to a lack of options for many in advised and tax deferred accounts.\n\nJMP believes the advised market is a half a Trillion dollar opportunity for Bitcoin and it’s only beginning to come online. They don’t cover MSTR, but it illustrates the point that even a fraction of this blocked money will go into MSTR until they can access real spot ETFs.\n\nYou saw a similar occurrence with GBTC back in 2017 (before it was black listed by a ton of wire houses). It had like a 200% premium to Bitcoin and no creation units to remove the tracking error. The difference being GBTC was a real fund that aimed to track Bitcoin prices. They weren’t a private company with a balance sheet it can change at any given moment.\n\nEventually, this will likely trade at a discount to Bitcoin, but that’s not happening until all the wires let clients and advisors allocate to the ETFs.",

Effectively people say they are working as a call option, because they are leveraged by borrowing dollars to buy bitcoin, and a few years in the future they have to pay back the dollars.\n\nI get that. I don't understand WHY would this make the company more valuable. For me, they are literally increasing risk with zero reward when compared to pure bitcoin.\n\nI mean, why would I pay double the price of bitcoin for a company that is leveraged with borrowed money? Even if as times goes on they keep doing this smartly they can increase the number of bitcoins per share, they would need to more than double that number for the current price to make sense. It's madness, on top of the added risk of the proxy itself.\n\nIt's also nonsensical to trust Michael Saylor over bitcoin itself. Michael made his fame by buying and talking bitcoin... you can literally buy the thing he's talking about instead of his company, he's inherently more risky than bitcoin.",
