Bought years ago only because I couldn’t afford a decent graphic card for gaming on a PC and was a dedicated apple user. Will definitely buy more for sure when it dips, if it ever will. Don’t have the heart to sell it to reinvest in other stocks because everyday gains are bigger than my paycheck. Should I sell now and reap the rewards? \n",
