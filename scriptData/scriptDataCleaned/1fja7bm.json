What that means is the umbrella contract (the IDIQ) can have up to $4.82 billion dollars of orders under it, but individual orders will be in the form of task orders, which will be worth much less. So it's potentially worth that $4b figure over the 5-10 years of the contract, but $4.82b is not guaranteed, and it could turn out NASA doesn't use it as much as they think and only end up ordering some smaller amount (say $1-2b) under it.
