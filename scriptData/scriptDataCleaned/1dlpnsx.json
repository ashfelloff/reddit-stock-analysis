  "selftext": "So I just excel'd a very basic hypothetical investment strategy based on these rules:\n\n- VIX < 20 : buy ~~FXAIX~~ VOO\n- 20 < VIX < 30 : sell ~~FXAIX~~ VOO\n- 30 < VIX < 50 : buy ~~FXAIX~~ VOO and ride it whatever direction until VIX < 20\n- 50 < VIX : sell ~~FXAIX~~ VOO and wait until VIX < 50, then buy and ride down until VIX < 20\n\nIf these rules were followed since November 1, 2019 the performance would look like this: https://imgur.com/5XXjJie\n\nIt doesnt avoid every downturn but it avoids enough to vastly outperform the market.\n\nI'm obviously an idiot and there are no free money glitches. What did I do wrong?\n\n---\n\nI had to wait til my wife woke up since she's better at excel than me.\n\nWe ran the calculations all the way back to 2004 (largest dataset I could download easily) changed the VIX thresholds from 20,30,50 to 20,30,46. These new thresholds seem to create the best results after toying with the numbers up and down. I even added \"action\" to the graph in green to show where the strategy makes it's best gains over SPY.

So you should adjust for that vs a buy and hold strategy (also note short term vs long term gins).  Another thing to do is to run this same strategy on the data but for a start date of each year from 2004 to today.  That will let you know if you are taking any Ls in there.  It's hard to see where the actual divergences are happening with this chart.  Also when you say \"sell VOO\" do you mean take a short position, or just unload what you have and go to cash?",

Because if you are this analysis may have problems.  e.g. if the vix spikes past 20 and you are going to sell the next day, you need to make sure to use the opening price the next day and not just the closing price the day the vix hit 20.  This is especially problematic because when VIX is high is when you tend to get large gaps up or down overnight.",

Low VIX means going (mostly) up; shouldn't you wait for higher VIX to get a discount?\n\nAnd why sell when VIX > 50 â€” doesn't it mean high volatility, so likely something unpredictable happened (like a war), so SP500 is falling? Shouldn't you buy at the bottom instead of selling at it?\n\nBtw. VIX has hit 50 only two times in the last 20 years: in 2008 and 2020 (so during crashes). I wouldn't sell at those points. And the 50 seems like an arbitrary threshold (unless it was supposed to be some kind of black swan protection, but then why sell at it?); it's hard enough to get it to 30 without some major macro event happening.\n\nDidn't you mistake SVIX for VIX?",

Not getting too greedy.

Due to the fact that the charts are so similar (offset by a factor if you look at certain parts; especially between drops), returns from your chart seem to be very similar to buying at the bottom and selling at the top (which you could also more or less do, since you can time the bottom pretty well), but again it depends on the size or your positions.\n\nIn conclusion â€” it seems to be pretty much the original chart *if it wasn't for bigger drops/crashes* (in that case you could buy at the bottom and sell at the top). So it appears to have very similar returns if you can time the bottom during a crash; without a crash, the charts seem to almost coincide (or maybe it's not the case? We'd need to see a straight bull run chart as well to verify that)\n\nBut you may be on to something, so definitely work on it. I'd be interested in seeing your results and the spreadsheet",

Whether you have ten or a thousand the performance is the same; triple your money rather than doubling it just leaving it in there. \n\nWhat this math says to me is that VIX between 20-30 means SPY is probably correcting. Above 30 means the bottom is probably in already. Just look at how it handles October 2021, April 2022, and September 2022. \n\nPractically this strat would just be an overnight decision; what was ~~VOO~~ VIX at close? Ok put in a trade to buy all in or sell all out at open tomorrow. No intra day trading. \n\nI'm going to try to make a script that runs this since 1995 and see if it still works.",

The backtest is not based on rules that would give look-ahead bias if that's what you mean. What do you mean by static data? Ofc the price changes in backtests",

These new thresholds seem to create the best results after toying with the numbers up and down. I even added \"action\" to the graph in green to show where the strategy makes it's best gains over SPY. Lemme know your thoughts. You too u/GPTRex I'd appreciate your input.\n\nI can't figure out how to upload the sheet but here is another screencap: https://imgur.com/f5Anrls\n\n---\n\nEdit: 1993-2024: https://imgur.com/dQclBJ7\n\nExpanding to 1993-2024 the optimal thresholds change to 20,33,46. These thresholds are definitely worse if used for 2004-2024. No loss just not as much gain.\n\nIt seems different eras have slightly different optimal numbers.
