You literally proved my point. This alone tells you that Deflation is more beneficial to consumers. \n\nThere are many issues when discussing deflation. I can make up some many hypotheticals but like you pointed. Most of the time when it comes to both inflation and deflation the private sector can not be trusted to be reasonable. Greed is always the case. \n\n>rather than spending it on growth (which lead to more jobs)\n\nThis is not always true. Companies can spend more on growth without creating jobs. Example is building a factory or plant in another state and transfer half your workers from an already stable plant to the new one. Companies do this. Or replace workers with software and/or specialize folks who can do more than one task. \n\n>It wreaks havoc across the job market in the private sector, especially jobs that are market condition based like tech and consulting. \n\nA hyperbole much. Actual essential companies or businesses even under inflation or deflation will still use their cash on hand to find ways to grow or optimized. While you have the non essential companies or businesses like consulting or \"tech\" companies who have the liberty and luxury of having cash on hand with doing the bare minimum to optimize or find ways to grow.",
