                  "body": "Well what I really wanted was an explanation of why it’s good to do OTM\n\nOptions are hard, so it’s difficult to give a one size fits all answer. But ITM is typically viewed to have more safety. \n\nFor instance the ITM contract I talked about here had a like 1.75 premium at a 50 dollar strike or something, so the break even was like 52ish\n\nThe OTM at 55 was much cheaper, only like 25 dollars, but the break even was still far above bc it’s OTM. So you need like 55.25\n\nSo let’s say we do the damn thing, earnings passes, and we get to 53 dollars \n\nMy ITM contract is profitable. My OTM is fucked. \n\nBut the premium is going to dictate a lot here. So there may be edge cases where this isn’t true.\n\nWhat it feels like to me is people around here buy options not based on what’s best but rather what they can afford. they buy cheap options bc the premium is cheap not bc they did some math and figured out they were best. \n\nYou can buy like 6 55 strike calls for the price or a single ITM call, but those 6 calls are far less safe than the ITM. so there is some risk reward analysis you could do. \n\nretail has been proven to routinely buy OTM call options outside the normal or expected volatility of the markets. google the barclay retail\noption strategy. they realized this and essentially sold retail these shitty options while hedging that bet so they pretty much couldnt lose. \n\nso you should consider stuff like how historically volatile is this stock etc before you start making short term plays on 10% moves on earnings.\n\ni would also advocate longer dated calls for mostly same reason - safety - but again those calls have higher premiums so it feels like people dont like them bc they feel expensive.\n\nBtw those ITM calls would be profitable right now and earnings hasn’t even happened.",
