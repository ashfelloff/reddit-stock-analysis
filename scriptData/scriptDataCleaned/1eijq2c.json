Both inflation and deflation build on themselves like a ball rolling down a hill, and after 15 years of ZIRP and money printing, we are way over on the inflationary end.

At this point, it takes wartime level govt spending during peacetime with allegedly full employment just to maintain the status quo. \n\nThat status quo will change.

Or Middle class today\n\nIn 1950 you will own your own home, a single car. You will have a radio with a few stations , and black and white TV with 3 channels . Your home will be drafty and probably have heat, but AC probably not. \n\nUnless you live in a big city your entertainment options may be limited, you live in a small town you basically go to your high school football or baseball game for sports or listen to it on the radio. Travel was either slow (Train , bus, driving on dirt roads) or SUPER expensive to fly .\n\nMaybe you catch a show on friday / saturday night on tv or radio\n\nIn the summer you just sweat your balls off \n\nIf you're now middle class you probably have AC, more than one car, a TV that has almost an unlimited collection of tv shows and movies, phones.\n\nTBH I would be miserable even if I had money in the 1950s unless I was living in like NYC or LA or a large city with more entertainment options",
