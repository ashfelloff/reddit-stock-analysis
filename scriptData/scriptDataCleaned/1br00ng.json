      "body": "LOL no. I process stock certificates. Please read carefully\n\nFirst of all, there is nothing YOU can do with this certificate without a notarized or Medallion Signature Guaranteed  Third Party release from YOUR broker, completed by the registered shareholder (the name underneath the sticky note)... is this guy even the shareholder?? In addition, a stock power form that may need an MSG stamp as well signed by the registered share holder as well\n\nSecond, even if you can get this paperwork from the client with proper stamps etc, if you deposit this in your account. You are depositing one share. Not 15 shares considering the splits since issuance. One share. ONLY ONE. When these splits happen since the issuance of a stock certificate, the additional shares from a split are held in book entry form with the transfer agent under the holder's name. To get  book entry shares from the transfer agent to a broker, the holder would have to DRS the shares to the broker which contains more paperwork, approvals, stamps, whatever may be. \n\nThis certificate will never be worth more than the price of one share of Tesla at market price, no matter how it continues to split, minus the pain and hassle of getting paperwork to make the deposit possible.... and if the transfer agent ever loses record of this certificate, gets escheated to the state, amongst other things to invalidate it, you would be SOL at that point\n\nThis is definitely scam of some sort.
