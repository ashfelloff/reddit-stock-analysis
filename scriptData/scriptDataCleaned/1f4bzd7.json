Slowly coming back up. Only down 11%. Not a bad hit. Expected move for this guy was $25 which it hit and bounced up due to share buy backs. Gonna keep this until EOD and move to BRZE. Sold at $26.5. Down 11% \n\nThursday: BRZE. 2700 shares at $43.50. Will probably lose on this one too. And at 5% down.\n\n1/3. If things hold up with BRZE, I will have ended this week at what I began with.
