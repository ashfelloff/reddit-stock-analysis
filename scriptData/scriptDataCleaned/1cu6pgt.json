  "title": "What happens to TSLA earnings if 56 billion to Elon?",
  "score": 157,
  "selftext": "There is a vote on June 13, regarding 56 billion dollar pay to Elon Musk, which was called into question by a judge in Delaware.  All over the news so let‚Äôs assume you already know and don‚Äôt need the link.  \n\nEither:\n\n A) shareholders vote yes and board gives Elon musk 56 billion.  In this scenario, TSLA earnings go down by 56 billion.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock drop accordingly?  \n\nOr, \n\nB) shareholders vote no and the board gives it to him anyway.  Or maybe the board sided with unhappy shareholders and face the wrath of an epic Elon musk tantrum? In this scenario, TSLA shareholders are unhappy and jump ship either way.  Is this already priced in or does TSLA stock crater to more realistic numbers?\n\nI‚Äôm very interested to hear if there are alternative scenarios where the stock price isn‚Äôt impacted by this vote on June 13?  \n\nIt seems the June 13 vote (I think they need to report results within 4 days) will be more consequential than any earnings report, right?\n\nEdit:  you have to see this link to consider the gravity of the June 13 shareholder meeting\n\n[https://electrek.co/2024/05/20/elon-musk-confirms-threat-give-me-25-of-tesla-or-no-ai-robotics/](https://electrek.co/2024/05/20/elon-musk-confirms-threat-give-me-25-of-tesla-or-no-ai-robotics/)\n",

Currently, about 46% of TSLA is institutional. Getting retail to vote is like getting ... people to vote. With the near-term issues surrounding TSLA, especially of a manically-distracted CEO, it is conceivable this does not pass. \n\nHowever, and more important, is the reincorporation of TSLA to TX from DE. That requires a majority of *all shares to vote* in favor. If the first succeeds and the second fails, then another trip to DE Chancelry is in the near future. Since the DE court voided the $50 B version, I can see the institutions saying \"thank you, we will stay here and not move to the wild west where \"he needed killin\" is still a defense under the law.\"",
