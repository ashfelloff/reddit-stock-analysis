      "body": "TL;DR - Google will not be broken up, and unless some other events were to take place, this specific action will enhance the value of Google, making them stronger.\n\nFor the deeply invested or interested, read further:\n\nI think that Microsoft set a precedent in the 90's that the word \"monopoly\" and antitrust cases now tend to be positives for megacap (tech) companies.\n\nLook at Facebook for example. They have, for the last 5 to 10 years benefited from the illusion that they are a monopoly. What happens is this draws the government closer to the company. But the net result tends to be that the company in question ends up aiding in writing new legislation that they benefit from, eliminating more competition.\n\nMostly, people don't really understand what anticompetition is anymore. The reason Google lacks competition is less Google's doing than it is the broader tech investment industry restricting access to enough funds for startups to truly compete against Google or whoever you could name: Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc.\n\nNotice how Bing is not really a competitor to Google even though Microsoft is 1.5x larger by market cap. You think they are incapable of making a search engine that does the same amount in digital ad revenue? If that were actually true, confidence in $MSFT would probably crater.\n\nThe fact that these two companies aren't locked into a celebrity death match style competition should show you something. It's not any (1) of these companies that are technically creating an antitrust situation. It's all of them working together at the highest levels to keep the pretense & facade of competition alive so they all continue to enjoy the spoils of having no true competitor.\n\nSo, the government lacks a) the intelligence and knowledge required to break up a tech company, if they were actually technically anticompetitive, and b) the political will to enforce something that would destroy a multi trillion dollar enterprise like this.",
