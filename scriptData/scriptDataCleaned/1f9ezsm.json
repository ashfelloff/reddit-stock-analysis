It’s not a great recreational combo, at all. The best thing to do is not be addicted to drugs, but until you’ve done that work on yourself to free you from your trauma and break the cycle, you can do that in the meantime to stem the neurological damage to some extent. \n\nAs for research on the effects of chronic K abuse on the brain, there isn’t a ton of literature than can control for confounding effects of other drugs of abuse that K users often do with it, but China has the unique position of having lots of K produced domestically and barely any other rec drugs for ppl to do. I saw a paper out of there that imaged brains of numerous subjects who did only K habitually for years, and that study rocked me when I found it. Here it is.\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23882190/\n\nEdited for wordiness",
