  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "Hey guys, so H5N1 (bird flu) isn't going anywhere right now, which is concerning considering what we all dealt with just four years ago. Recently it jumped to mammals (cows, cats, and people). \n\n[https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/11/bird-flu-human-transmission-prepared-pandemic](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/11/bird-flu-human-transmission-prepared-pandemic)\n\nWhile it hasn't spread much, I'm beginning to grow concerned. I know this is a terrible thing to bet on, but I'm seeing the writing on the wall.\n\nNow put on your tinfoil hats. Sanofi paid $1.2 billion for their deal with Novavax - why? Couldn't they have easily bought the company for that amount or less when it was trading at $4.00?\n\nI think Novavax has something up their sleeve related to H5N1, and if it becomes more widespread (which I think is inevitable as of right now), Novavax could jump up. \n\nUsually I'm not this pessimistic, but this is what I see...\n\nI'm a student, so my position is one singular $12C EXP. 2026, but if I had money to spare, I'd have many more calls.\n\n[A look at Novavax's stock price response to past disease outbreaks.](https://preview.redd.it/s03snqt84c0d1.png?width=2132&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba3ea6f5e3717b1f487614b87f02e7dccf3302e9)\n\n",
