No way to tell unless you are regarded.\n\nOr become a US congressmen and be immune to insider trading\n\nEdit: obviously if you get a tip on a company, you dont yolo your profile only on that company and make it look fucking obvious.

Or if you want to be even safer just buy 1,000 front month ATM straddles unhedged as they would be close to zero delta, sure you won’t make as much but there isn’t a court in the country that would convict you.",

Go back to any stock that was acquired and check out the price movement and volume within the last 10 trading days. When I was trading on the CBOE my clerk used to caddy a an exclusive golf course and after one round of golf caddying for the CFO of Eastman Kodak, instead of a cash tip, the CFO told him that Kodak earnings which were 4 days away were expected to be $.13 but the CFO told him that they would not only miss but they would come in at -$.06 and he told him to short the stock. Well my clerk told me the story and I was looking at the the stock which was trading just under $77 and I could have backed up a truck and bought the 1DTE 75 puts for $.05 a contract the day before earnings. I did nothing and sure as shit when earnings came out they were -$.06 cents and the stock got crushed down to $66. So yeah it happens all the time, haven’t you ever heard the saying that “two people can keep a secret as long as their both dead”. MAQ",

Of course somebody has to write them, so the number should be limited... although 2/300 like in this example is still quite a lot. And not focusing only on single stocks... At very high level, talking about central banks, there should be quite a lot of people knowing in advance if interest rates will be cut for example or other similar type of information. That has an obvious influence on the movement of certain assets.

The most you can lose at this point is $D x 100 + contract_price, since you'd need to buy the stocks at that price. The most you can make is the contract price (if CYZ stock is worth more than $D, the person wouldn't want to sell it at that price so thus it becomes worthless to them and you come out all ahead. \n\nSelling call contracts: You are selling someone the contract to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $D. If you have 100 shares of XYZ (called a covered call), the worst you can lose is having to sell the 100 shares of XYZ at $D plus you'd get the contract money. If you don't have the shares (called a naked call), then you could lose 100 x XYZ price + contract price, which is where you can get screwed badly. If the stock soars and you don't own it, sucks for you",
