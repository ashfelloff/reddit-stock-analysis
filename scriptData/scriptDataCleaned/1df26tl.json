  "selftext": "In light of ARK's recent price predictions for TSLA I thought I would post this as a reference to some of their prior predictions for TSLA. \n\n  \n[ARK’s Price Target for Tesla in 2025 is $3,000 Per Share (ark-invest.com)](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/tesla-price-target-2)\n\n  \nIn 2021 ARK posted the above article. They predicted that TSLA would hit $1,400 in 2024. Adjusted for splits that would be $466. Actual value today $184. \n\n  \nThey continue to predict that by 2025 the stock would hit $3,000. Adjusted for splits that is $1,000. Their worst case scenario for 2025 is $1,500 or $500 adjusted for splits. TSLA would need to almost 3x in the next 6 months to hit their bear case and approx 6x to hit their prediction. ",
