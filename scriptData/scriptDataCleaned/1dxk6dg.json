I would imagine these firms know a bit more about it than John Smith on Reddit. It obviously doesn’t work all the time. It helps by giving clues as to what the masses are doing/thinking and the balance of power before that power/or power change is fully reflected in the share price. If you actually study each indicator and examples of situations in which they are effective, you would understand. Real TA is logical. The shite you see on Stocktwits/Twitter from noobs gives it a bad rep. I’m no expert but I’ve read into it and I can distinguish good TA from nonsense.\n\nIn flows the downvotes from spoons who have no clue but because I’m not waving the gay ignorant astrology flag..",
