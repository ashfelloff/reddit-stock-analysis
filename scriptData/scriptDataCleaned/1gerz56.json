Once they finish loading up, they will probably publish more positive outlooks and price targets**.¬†\n\nThe¬†**50 bp drop in September drastically increased**¬†the chance of a¬†**softer landing**¬†and¬†**the probability of SoFi emerging with explosive growth**.\n\n**If you find a stock that Customers love, and as long as the company continues to execute, Wall Street will eventually catch up to the Customers' mindset, and the stock will rise from the ashes. SoFi stock is at that pivoting point with a positive sentiment shift and institutions' accumulation.**\n\n* **SoFi Technologies Reports Net Revenue of $697 Million and Net Income of $61 Million for Q3 2024, Demonstrating Durable Growth and Strong Returns**\n* **Record Adjusted Net Revenue with Growth Accelerating to 30% Driven by 64% Combined Growth in Financial Services and Tech Platform Segments, representing 49% of Total Adjusted Net Revenue**\n* **35% Growth in Members and Strong Product Innovation Remain Key Drivers of Growth**\n* **Company Recorded $174 Million in Capital Light, Fee-Based Revenue, Reinforcing Strength of Increased Mix of Higher ROE Revenue**\n* **Management Raises FY24 Guidance**\n* **Anthony Noto, CEO of SoFi Technologies, Inc. commented: ‚ÄúThis quarter was the strongest quarter in our history. Our results reflect how SoFi is consistently achieving durable growth, how our innovation and brand building are attracting more members and clients to our platform than ever before, and how we are delivering strong and improving returns.**\n* **‚ÄúOur Financial Services and Tech Platform segments now make up a record 49% of SoFi's adjusted net revenue, up from 39% a year ago,\" Noto continued. \"In the third quarter, these businesses grew revenue by a combined 64% year-over-year, a testament of our continued execution and deliberate shift towards capital-light, higher ROE, fee based revenue streams.\"**\n\n# Some Highlights of recent SoFi developments:\n\n* **SoFi recently expanded its loan platform business with a $2 billion agreement with Fortress Investment Group.**\n* **SoFi Technologies to Adopt Galileo‚Äôs Cyberbank Core for New Commercial Payment Services Sponsor Banking Program**\n* ***SoFi's Galileo recently introduced GScore (a transaction risk score) to protect clients from fraud early on, especially since fraud is rampant in our society.***¬†This could potentially increase the number of Galileo clients very rapidly. It would decrease fraud substantially, elevating Galileo's secure reputation. It could save clients from millions to billions in fraudulent charges that could translate to saving clients thousands of hours of grief trying to fix their credits and protect their identity.\n* **SoFi ranked #69 largest U.S. Bank by Assets as of 6/30/2024. It was #449 in March 2022.**\n* **SoFi Stadium will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, Super Bowl LXI in 2027, and the opening and closing ceremonies (as well as soccer and swimming events) of the 2028 Summer Olympics.**\n* **On February 26th, SoFi's CFO said it delivered a proof of concept to a top 5 U.S. bank that used SoFi's Fintech technologies.**\n\n**SoFi's Fintech mainly consists of two core technologies powered by Galileo and Technisys which form the \"AWS of Fintech\". This Tech sector of SoFi should significantly contribute to SoFi stock's deserved multiples way above a bank in the near future.**\n\n***1.
