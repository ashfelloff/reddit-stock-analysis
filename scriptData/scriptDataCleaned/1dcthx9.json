  "title": "Musk Pay Package is a lose/lose for TSLA",
  "score": 850,
  "selftext": "I believe the upcoming TSLA shareholder's meeting could be a lose/lose for the company.  At issue: whether shareholders believe Musk should receive his $56B pay package (originally agreed in 2018 and struck down by a Delaware judge earlier this year).  Proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended against approving the package, and many institutional investors have followed their lead.  Still, a majority (56%) of those [surveyed](https://www.teslarati.com/morgan-stanley-survey-tesla-investors-will-ratify-elon-musk-2018-comp-plan/) said they expect the proposal to be approved.\n\nHowever, whichever way this vote goes, I expect a negative outcome for TSLA.  There's one of two outcomes:\n\n**A) Musk Pay Approved**\n\n* If the pay package is approved, it would bring Musk's ownership of the company close to 25% and dillute all other shareholders by 10%.\n* For many shareholders I expect this to be the last straw for them.  Those who vote against the package will see this as musk trying to extract as much value as he can from a dying company.  Especially after this year's sales slowdown (Hertz is [selling](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/06/ev-sales-slump-hertz-dump-take-used-tesla-to-no-haggle-25000-price.html) off its Tesla fleet, admitting the move was a mistake) and axing of the entire supercharger team.  Not to mention Musk's continued shitposting [alienating](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/elon-musk-turned-democrats-off-tesla-when-he-needed-them-most-176023af) desperately needed democrat buyers.\n\n**B) Musk Pay Denied**\n\n* If the pay package is denied, I think it would indicate the beginning of the end for Tesla.  Musk has already said that he would shift his focus to his other companies if he doesn't get his $56B.\n* He has threatened to develop AI at one of his other companies instead, and has already admitted to diverting Nvidia GPUs from Tesla to xAI and Twitter.\n* Musk has been the primary driving force behind Tesla, and without his presence and constant hype I think his diehard supporters will begin to reevaluate their ownership of Tesla stock, leading to a major selloff.\n\nMy position: I own 6 contracts of the TSLA 175p expiring 6/21.  Not financial advice.",

Built the Falcon9 and was able to make it reusable with land based or drone ship based landings (not like the space shuttle boosters that fell in the ocean and needed to be refurbished each time because of seawater damage)... built the first LEO high-speed internet constellation that has given millions of people already high-speed internet at a reasonable price wherever they are and has changed the course of war (e.g. in Ukraine).... and now has successfully launched and did a \"soft-landing\" of the new Starship.\n\nI can give you examples with Tesla, but the stuff with SpaceX is clearly pushing the boundaries of what anyone else has done before.\n\nSo I will take that 5 year old making regarded ideas as CEO.",
