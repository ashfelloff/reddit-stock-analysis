AI market had overlooked INTC (for a good reason), but now they are about to make a comeback with their gaudi3 chip.\n2. from 2021 Pat Gelsinger is CEO, which is not some regard salesman, but an engineer, previously chief architect in intel.\n3. everything is SOOOOO chip (pun intended). i saw this post here of 2 years from now 43 calls cost less then for 4$.\n4. P/E is great, but u guys never look on such things\n\ncurrent position is 14k in stocks and 600 in september 40 and 50 calls. think im gonna load some more of those 2 years cheap options.\n\nnow you get to roast me.\n\nEDIT: just bought 1k more worth of stocks and 1k worth of 43 calls for 2026. Ill attach this post in my gains post titled: \"to all the üåàüêª, i won\"",

They will even be sold to fabless companies opening up a new revenue stream.\n\nSo 2027 for fab is a way more pessimistic outlook than you make it out to be. It is realistic however that fabless companies will take a while to move some of their products to Intel nodes, so there won't be big fab revenue till 2026, even though they can deliver up to date nodes way earlier.",

      "body": "Things are not looking positive for them on either the CPU or GPU side. x86 CPUs will be replaced by ARM chips in the coming years. So the architecture that Intel has built its legacy on is soon going to be legacy architecture. This is years in the future, but should see revenue dropping as a direct result of the transition. On the GPU side, both AMD and Nvidia are eating their lunch, and there's no reason to see that changing. It's one of those situations where catching up is very difficult, as GPUs have steered heavily into AI. AMD is already going to have a tough time catching Nvidia, and Intel is pretty significantly behind AMD in terms of what it's brought to market.\n\nShort-term plays are interesting, since I believe analysts have universally been negative on Intel's long-term prospects. It might allow you to beat the curve short-term, by bucking the trend. I'm not so optimistic. I see Intel falling further and further behind, as AI helps Nvidia and AMD accelerate their own chip designs. It's a bit of a feedback loop that puts Nvidia in a very comfortable spot right now.",
