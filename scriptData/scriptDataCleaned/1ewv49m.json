I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.\n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion.

Interested in the $45 level, otherwise going to be hands off unless we see something interesting at $40. To me, the longer it stays at the high price, the more “valid” the price is. Currently long but nominal amount.\n* [**HA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=HA&p=d) **/** [**ALK**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ALK&p=d) - Hawaiian Air/Alaska Air reportedly given approval from DOJ to merge, still needs approval from DOT to finish.\n* [**LOW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LOW&p=d) - Earnings released premarket. Not much movement but still interested to see where this goes at the open. LOW cut full-year outlook, expects home improvement sales to weaken.

          "body": "Hiya- when I say \"watching $45 level\", that doesn't necessary mean I think it will go there- it means that I'm interested in a trade if ASTS gets to that price depending on how it trades (a steady move up vs a spike from 39->45 within 15 minutes, I'd be more interested in trading the spike)\n\nAlso, when I say \"going to be hands off\", I'm usually not interested in trading it unless it reaches whatever price levels I'm mentioning unless something different from what I'm watching happens- for example, ASTS was selling off the open instead of going up like I expected.\n\nI actually ended up shorting the stock around 36.25->35.50 (tried multiple times) and covering 34.60 because I saw a consistent seller come in and price action on the book. Being extremely flexible with your thinking and positioning is EXTREMELY important in trading.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/XbtaaXc](https://imgur.com/a/XbtaaXc)\n\n9:55 AM: Even now, we see the stock bouncing a point and a half and it's at $35.85.- so I missed the bounce on that. **Overall I think a 10% move in a stock that's gone up literally 75% in the past 4 days isn't that crazy of a move.**",
