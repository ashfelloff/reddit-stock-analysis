Only the Saudis could reach low to our prices and it could be they were losing money. That’s a false statement you wrote and I can educate you. \nI do believe the Republicans will bring down inflation, ease commodity pricing and hopefully bring down mortgage costs. I trust them any day of the week over the current administration to take action. \n\nYou’re a fool if you reward the current admin. They destroyed the middle class and destroyed the chance for the poor to have upward mobility.
