So you always have the opportunity to cash out in 90 days 1/3 of you money if rates tank and another investment comes along.  I Bonds interest for the last 3 years have been any where from 9.6% to 5.2%.  Another solid investment when inflation rises.  Also they are tax free if you cash them in for your education.",
