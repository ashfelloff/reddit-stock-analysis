  "selftext": "Best believe you‚Äôre going to get wrecked come Monday. The market had 6 red days in a row and collectively more than 5% within that time. It‚Äôs the worst trading week in over a year. A dramatic drop like this is always followed by a decent size bounce up. Also, huge earnings are this week with also PCE. If you zoom out, charts show we‚Äôre still in a bull trend.\n\nNow, I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre going to bounce back up and hold over, but we will most definitely see a bounce on Monday at least, unless some more stupid shit happens over the weekend. What happens during the big earnings and PCE data will decide where we go from now on until NVDA and SMCI earnings. \n\nY‚Äôall are going to get wrecked.\n\nEdit: I‚Äôm fully expecting Tesla to shit the bed Tuesday, so I‚Äôd expect sideways trading until then so the market can pad the beating it‚Äôs gonna get then.\n\nEdit 2: seems like all of the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª are out and thinking im a üêÇ they‚Äôd like to penetrate. I don‚Äôt pick sides, I just like to play trends. All I‚Äôm saying is the market has been making lower highs and lower lows at a high rate. Almost 1 TRILLION of market cap was evaporated today alone. All I‚Äôm saying is we‚Äôre due for a bounce, regardless if it holds or not and I would‚Äôve sold my puts at EOD and not have made any new positions.\n\nEdit #1: checking in on put holders. How‚Äôs your new short positions doing? üòÇ",

I don't get your point here... nothing suggests that this is just a simple correction, it's a re-evaluation of the overall market and economy for the intermediate future. You can also see this in bond yields that have skyrocketed over the past couple weeks. \n\nAlso, earnings don't mean shit without good guidance. Look at the earnings that have been posted in the past couple weeks: JPM, LULU, NFLX, TSM, SMCI just to name a few. The problem today was that SMCI did not give guidance on their expected numbers like they did previously when things were good especially since it came in right after TSM. This led investors to draw the conclusion that the entire semiconductor industry might be hitting a slowdown, which caused today's tech selloff. Maybe people will have more hope for AMD or MSFT, but that won't prop up the entire S&P500 because AAPL has poor expectations and NVDA doesn't report till June.\n\nI'm not saying there won't be a bounce next week. I'm just saying your logic is wrong. The market has dropped harder than this in a 7 day period before (it's only down \\~4% since last Friday compared to \\~8% down Jan 2022 or \\~7% Aug 2022), it can happen again.",

Bank of Japan is losing control of the Yen.  They need to start selling treasuries to shore up thier weakening currency.   Inflation risk are increasing as hundreds of thousands of workers across japan have won major salary increases this and next yr.  They will raise rates.\n\n\n2. Middle East BS.  Iran, for now, has said they are done and i believe them.  But if the US places any sanctions on them, they will not be done.  I expect this to happen as our gov loves to show how powerful we are.\n\n\n3.  So far earning have been a disappointment with lower guidance.   I expect this to continue \n\n4.  Rate cuts BS talk has dissipated and pushed to 2025.  There is even chatter of a rate hike.\n\n5.  If bullet one occurs and Japan starts selling our treasuries it will drive up yeilds.  Our gov will be paying massive amounts of interest as demand for long dated bonds weakens.  Its all ready happenin as the 2yr 5yr 10yr 20yr 30yr have all gone up over half a point this yr alone.  I expect these to go massively higher if BoJ does what I expect.",
