  "selftext": "I am a international student in the states and I was a day trader( thought I am), betting money everyday on the market. The first month was good and I made 4k on SPY QQQ DIA options and one mcd put option. Until 2/23/24 I bought 100 put options on SPY, that was a misclick. Then the market went up I was down 4k immediately. All I was thinking is I cant afford the loss but the stupidest thing I did was I double down and prayed… then lost 7k. At that time I knew I was gambling but I cant not control myself because I didnt want to accept the result. All in and lost totally 28k or something. Sorry for the grammar mistakes and nonsense, I just want to remind people if you wanna go yolo, it’s fine but before that better learn anything possible to increase the odds of winning. That’s it check out the pics. ",

Again, I'm not one of these option gangs yolo all the time and gain as big as the sky, a few thousand percent/day, it's not me.\nWhen I first started my trades, I went over all the derivatives such as options and futures, I used to be up a few hundred percent in 2 days of the weekend. But I couldn't control my greed, I blew my account, after that I took revenge trades, I blew my account 2 more times. \nI made a lot of mistakes during my trading days. Now, before I place a trade, I always look at the downsides first. My account started increasing bit by bit, my recommendation for you is do not gambling, don't trust anyone about their technique, especially Youtubers and coaches bla bla. You have to figure out your risk appetite, find your own way to make money that aligns with your own time, don't try to be an outlier such as WB or BNF. Getting rich gradually will stabilize as the mountain.",
