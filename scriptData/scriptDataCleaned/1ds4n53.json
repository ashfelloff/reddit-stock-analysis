Their primary business is providing market liquidity and hedging risks for a fee. While some individual branches and funds will certainly hurt from adverse market movements, the company overall will be fine. The company positions itself to win regardless of which way the market moves. Sometimes this means missing out on potential extra gains, but it also caps the downside risk while remaining profitable.",

But after watching the last 18 months, I think a lot of that money is going to start flowing if any dip occurs and the recovery begins, or if BTC starts its bull cycle etc. \n\nThere's just too much money to be made. Especially if rates start dropping simultaneously.\n\nHell, I was even moved into cash in Sept 2023, worried about a recession brewing, but decided to jump back in a month later and that turned out to be a very good decision. Even after a rocky last few weeks on some big positions I'm at like.... +60% on the year?",
