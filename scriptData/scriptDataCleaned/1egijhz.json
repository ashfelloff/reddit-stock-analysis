  "title": "Are NVIDIA's AI chips still \"so good that even when the competitor’s chips are free, it’s not cheap enough,\" as Jensen Huang said in March? ",
  "score": 195,
  "selftext": "TL;DR: Probably yes (just my opinion)...\n\nOn Monday, July 29, Apple Research [published the scientific background of its \"Apple Foundation Model\"](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/apple-intelligence-foundation-language-models) (AFP). According to the paper, this model (AFP-server) was trained on 8192 of Google's TPUv4 chips, and apparently no NVIDIA GPUs were used for training (although this was not explicitly disclosed). So are Google's TPUs serious competition for NVIDIA's GPUs? Let's crunch the numbers...\n\nAccording to the [Google Cloud website](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing?hl=en), a TPU v4-Pod (4096 x TPUv4) costs $32,200 per hour on demand. So the compute capacity to train the AFM-server cited in the paper costs about $64,400 per hour on-demand. 8192 TPUv4s have a combined computing power of up to 2.25 ExaFLOPS\\* (8192 x 275 TeraFLOPS\\*).\n\nOne of NVIDIA's H100 SXM (up to 3958 TeraFLOPS\\*) costs about $3-$4 per hour on-demand, according to my research. So for $64,400 USD per hour, you could rent between 16,100 and 21,000 H100 SXMs with a combined computing power of 64 to 85 ExaFLOPS\\* (16,100 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 63.72 ExaFLOPS\\*; 21,466 x 3,958 TeraFLOPS\\* = 84.97 ExaFLOPS\\*).\n\nAccording to this calculation, using clusters of NVIDIA's H100 SXM would be **28 to 37 times cheaper** than using Google's TPUs (please correct me if I am wrong). So yes, NVIDIA's chips might still be \"so good\". And I haven't done this calculation for the upcoming Blackwell generation...\n\n\\*FLOPS (floating point operations per second) is a measure of the computing power of computer chips and correlates to the performance of matrix operations such as those required for AI training.",

      "body": "It depends on many factors.\n\nOne thing you need to consider is that different software favors different vendors. Nvidia had the intuition of investing heavily in research, they have sponsored many university labs for a decade gifting their hardware. That meant that many now important softwares have been developed and built around maximizing Nvidia's hardware and CUDA, while Nvidia software like drivers was also tested to run great on these libraries (such as NumPy or PyTorch or TensorFlow).\n\nOn top of that Nvidia's hardware is genuinely great and arguably the best in their class, especially combined with their software and optimization for customer software.\n\nThat gives Nvidia a very serious headstart and competitive advantage in ML/AI fields.\n\nThose that mean that Nvidia has a lock up on the field forever though?\n\nNo. First of all, customers that spend billions in hardware, do not like buying it at such ridiculous margins, even though they have kind of no choice now when the race is to get products on the market first. And those ridiculous margins eventually attract competition that has the financial incentives to build great hardware and software.\n\nSecond, the biggest buyers have lots of cash and knowledge to build their own accelerators. Google has their own, Apple can build their own, AWS and Microsoft can build their own.\n\nIn other words, as soon as the fight to get products in front of users and capturing market share will be fading, the fight for operating at the lowest expenses will start. And at that point you can assume that such players with such deep pockets can write their own software and drivers and even hardware (or collaborate with the like of ARM/AMD/Intel) so that instead of spending $20B they will spend a fraction of it and avoid getting gouged quarter after quarter. And, they can also build their own ML pipelines to run best on their own hardware.\n\nIn the end I believe that anybody thinking that a company with basically only one product (GPUs), as great and hot as they are now in 2024, in a very cyclic market like hardware is worth trillions, let alone among the 2/3 biggest in the world, is out of their minds imho.\n\nPeople extrapolating current trends in decade-long growths are committing the same mistakes Tesla investors did (and keep doing), not realizing that eventually good margins will fade, that there isn't an endless queue of customers with infinite money, and that competition at some point will have their own offerings.\n\nI believe that Nvidia will keep being a major player in the field for a long time, but margins at some point will start to get back to normality with increased competition from other manufacturers and big tech building their own stack.",

Chips can only get so cheap per flop and so the models can only get so big. Don’t know what those limits are. But in 10 years maybe we all have a chip that is 100x as powerful as the ones today in our laptop. Or they’re so cheap we can rent all the power we need for $5/month and it’s like buying extra storage for our photos. \n\nThe latest chips will still yield cost improvements, but on the order we see today with CPUs - 5-10% per year. The older chips are fine for most applications. It becomes a cost optimization analysis where alternatives are relatively close. ",

That means NVDA is about to lap some very very tough comps and won’t be able to guide to high growth in the next quarter or two. By that, I mean that 30% YoY realized growth will be meaningless unless they can guide to 30% next year also, and hand wave line of sight beyond that even.

Even if they’re behind this year I don’t worry about them being ahead in a few months is the train of thought and that matters when you’re scaling a business. It matters in hardware especially because the investment for businesses is twofold in both hardware and software that leverages specific hardware.
