As the story goes, the futures that midwest sold had to be delivered and it was a squeeze. to make sure the squeeze against the midwest was a lock, the guy from the Merc and 2 other fellows, drove all night towards Maine, found the loading terminals for the rail cars and did a hatchet job. No trains to deliver potatoes.  \n\nLong story short, the guys from the midwest paid big money in fines and penalties for the losses.
