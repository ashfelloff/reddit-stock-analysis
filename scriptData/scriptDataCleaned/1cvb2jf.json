Buying SBUX calls now is literally free money. If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôll let a random user that comments below fuck my OF girlfriend for free. ",

If he thought it was going up to $100‚Ä¶ a $97.5 call is probably the dumbest possible position i think.  \n\nHe will make 150% on a super high risk play at MAX of he is completely right.  Slightly wrong, and he loses 100% of his money.  \n\n97.5 call + $1 premium is $1.5 on $1 if correct.  150%.  \n\nBuying ITM $75 calls are $885/contract so he could get 10 with a break even of $83/share and make $1700/contract at $100‚Ä¶ or over 200%.  With the $75s, he makes money above $83 and makes more at $100 than with the $97.5s‚Ä¶ if he is wrong but it goes to $90, he still almost doubles his money.  With his, it could climb 30% this year and he lose 100% of his money",

Because you paid $1 for every call, and they‚Äôre $97.5 calls.  \n\nSo if it hits $100, you make $1.5 on your $1 per share. 150%.  \n\nAn ITM call at $75 for is $885/contract so you could get 10 for same price.  Your break even is $83/share and you make $1700/contract if it hits $100.  So‚Ä¶ you would make over 200% if you‚Äôre right. \n\nNot to mention, if you‚Äôre wrong on yours, you lose 100% of your money.

In my local area the majority of the stores from pre-pandemic times are gone. Many of them were in great locations in signature buildings that they‚Äôd occupied for a long time. And they also gave up their retail partnership with Indigo - Canada‚Äôs biggest book chain.\n\nAll of this to say - they‚Äôre a fraction of what they once were. To get back would require large capital investments on top of leases that are going to be much more expensive. And they now face intense competition from local independent chains.  As an example - my local big box bookstore replaced its Starbucks with a local indie coffee shop that also sells fresh bread and other local specialty goods. Starbucks with its bagged lemon loaf can‚Äôt compete with freshly baked bread and cinnamon buns out of the oven.\n\nThe one advantage Starbucks had - a dominant number of locations is gone. I can‚Äôt see them making a big comeback. Customers have moved on.",
