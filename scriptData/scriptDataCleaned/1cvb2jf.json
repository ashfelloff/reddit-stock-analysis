Also this time of year is always a  weak season for Starbucks. Usually fall and winter months business picks up quite a bit because of popular seasonal drinks and items. Buying SBUX calls now is literally free money. If I’m wrong I’ll let a random user that comments below fuck my OF girlfriend for free. ",

If he thought it was going up to $100… a $97.5 call is probably the dumbest possible position i think.  \n\nHe will make 150% on a super high risk play at MAX of he is completely right.  Slightly wrong, and he loses 100% of his money.  \n\n97.5 call + $1 premium is $1.5 on $1 if correct.  150%.  \n\nBuying ITM $75 calls are $885/contract so he could get 10 with a break even of $83/share and make $1700/contract at $100… or over 200%.  With the $75s, he makes money above $83 and makes more at $100 than with the $97.5s… if he is wrong but it goes to $90, he still almost doubles his money.  With his, it could climb 30% this year and he lose 100% of his money",

It doesn’t have any direct affect on their lives, nor the lives of anyone close to them. A *ton* of virtue signaling from all sides.\n\nIn the context of this specific conversation, I’m looking at this *purely* from a financial standpoint. My opinion is that the vast majority of the supporters for either side will move on to another topic soon enough, and that the people *directly* affected by the conflict will be too small of a minority to continue a substantial impact.\n\nThat may not be the most “woke” comment possible, but it’s just the reality of how American markets work.

      "body": "My favorite part of this is you would make substantially more money buying in the money, or slightly OTM calls then way OTM calls if you’re right and it hits your price target. \n\nIf you’re right… you basically double your money.  Because you paid $1 for every call, and they’re $97.5 calls.  \n\nSo if it hits $100, you make $1.5 on your $1 per share. 150%.  \n\nAn ITM call at $75 for is $885/contract so you could get 10 for same price.  Your break even is $83/share and you make $1700/contract if it hits $100.  So… you would make over 200% if you’re right. \n\nNot to mention, if you’re wrong on yours, you lose 100% of your money.  If you’re wrong on mine but it goes up to, say, $90… you made money in the long term vs 100% loss.",

In my local area the majority of the stores from pre-pandemic times are gone. Many of them were in great locations in signature buildings that they’d occupied for a long time. And they also gave up their retail partnership with Indigo - Canada’s biggest book chain.\n\nAll of this to say - they’re a fraction of what they once were. To get back would require large capital investments on top of leases that are going to be much more expensive. And they now face intense competition from local independent chains.  As an example - my local big box bookstore replaced its Starbucks with a local indie coffee shop that also sells fresh bread and other local specialty goods. Starbucks with its bagged lemon loaf can’t compete with freshly baked bread and cinnamon buns out of the oven.\n\nThe one advantage Starbucks had - a dominant number of locations is gone. I can’t see them making a big comeback. Customers have moved on.",
