They won’t say no to TSMC factories because bringing back Advanced technology manufacturing is the smartest thing to do in the long run. No matter what anyone thinks, if China said, “You know what, we are taking this fucking island back.” WW3 wouldn’t happen over it. TSMC would become American-controlled or abandoned. Intel is American, and as long as they produce chips in America, they are more American than almost all automotive companies. You don’t let that fail, not because of the economy but because it’s the future. Government pressure will continue to increase on other American companies to support Intel. In some areas, you need to consider the future more than short-term profits. The future is advanced technology, and now that most of the world has a computer of some type, it’s time to bring home the manufacturing of said technology. It made more sense when America's plot armor was weak, and China had a lock on rare resources. But fortunately, whatever crazy author who’s writing this fucked up story Magic’d up the largest source of precious resources we needed. Thus the story continues. Plot armor is great 👍🏼",

While it will take some time for them to navigate through the regulatory system and start producing, it stands to significantly reduce our dependence on Chinese rare earth metals.\n\nThen we have our southern continental neighbors. People wonder why the U.S. is always involved in Brazil, but it’s obvious when you consider their extreme potential to disrupt the gallium market—if they had the infrastructure to actually extract it from bauxite processing. This would, again, reduce our reliance on Chinese gallium. CHIPS Act isn’t going to be ignored. It really is a national security threat to continue to produce things like advanced technology outside the US.

America needs to wake up and stop supporting foreign interests. If Intel needs to be gutted and restructured, then so be it. Qualcomm and Intel are key to this. Whether they merge or Intel gets restructured is a separate issue. Either way, TSMC isn’t American, even if they’ve got an American division. This should be seen as a matter of nationalism, even if the market thinks otherwise.\n\nCall it a tin-foil hat take, but it’s traitorous to keep backing foreign interests here.
