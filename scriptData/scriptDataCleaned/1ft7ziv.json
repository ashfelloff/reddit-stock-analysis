              "body": "I certainly wouldn’t say that “P/E doesn’t matter”, but it’s foolish to compare the S&P 500 earnings multiple of today to the historic earnings multiple. Why? There are two reasons.\n\n1. Interest rates. Interest rates have moved up quite a bit from the post-GFC ZIRP era, but are still historically low and expected to fall. When interest rates are low, valuations on stocks go up.\n\n2. Quality of companies in the S&P 500. The earnings growth and margins of the top stocks in the S&P 500 are so much higher than they were in most of history. From the 1950s to 1980s, the largest stocks in the index were things like GM, GE, Exxon, Chevron, maybe some IBM. They were not companies that were growing earnings at 20-30%, with 60-80% gross margins. P/E multiples are useless without considering the growth of the company. If a company was growing earnings at 1000%, and that was expected to continue, paying 500x earnings would make perfect sense.\n\nSo yeah, when someone tells you that the S&P 500 traded at 8x in 1980 or whatever, consider why that was? Was the 10-year treasury at 3.5% and were the top companies growing earnings at 20%? No, the 10-year treasury was at like 12% and earnings were growing by 5%. For stocks to make sense in those kind of conditions, the valuation needs to be extremely low.",

Trends do change with time, in the late 90s you could have decided a PE of 20 was crazy and you should sell and wait for it to come back down, and you would have bought back like 7 years later, only to sell again when the PE hit 20 a short year later, and you'd have missed the entire 2010s rally...\n\nMy point here is there's an argument to be made that historical average PEs don't make sense in today's world anymore. Not with growth being fueled by businesses that have incredible ability to scale with software -- when you invested in a steel company in the 50s they couldn't just come out with a new product using a few engineers and sell it to everyone in the country overnight, they'd have to build up tons of new factories.
