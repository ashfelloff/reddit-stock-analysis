                              "body": "Not really - the source you provide excludes 80% of the data because it is non-US. Which is somewhat ironic given this incident cited occurred in Turkey. The person writing that article has greater amount of manipulation of the data to produce a result while casually citing the Seattle times to say their data is similar. Except it’s not. \n\nBy wholesale excluding the majority of the data without analysis is disingenuous at best. The article also attempts to throw FUD because there was the inclusion of a very small number of non-airline Boeing aircraft as reasons to discount the data.\n\nThe aggregated data provided by the Seattle Times still shows 2x the incidents after normalization of the data between the two companies. \n\nSo… three sources. \n\nOne includes a data set that reflects 7% of the total for non-commercial airlines that inflates the numbers. Fair. (Linked image above)\n\nOne excludes 78% of the data set be cause it isn’t in the US. https://weekly.visualapproach.io/p/does-data-show-boeing-is-unsafe\n\nOne takes the aggregate of all data, scrubs and normalizes for volume, and shows Boeing has more than 2x the rate of incidents to Airbus across all categories of incident. https://www.seattletimes.com/business/boeing-aerospace/have-boeing-planes-really-had-more-problems-lately-look-at-the-numbers/\n\nBoeing themselves admit that they have not focused on quality and have prioritized revenue over the highest safety and quality standards. \n\nThe commentary to exclude failures like a failed landing gear as a “human failure” or an airline problem rather than a Boeing problem also fails to examine the data. When you examine the NTSB incidents you will find within that cases where Boeing had incomplete or inaccurate technical bulletins that required amendment and subsequent roll out to the airlines. If someone fails to follow the amendment, it’s human error. But what about before that? Was it a Boeing issue or a human error. It depends. One such example is the deicers on current 737 Max which require pilots to manually adjust the duration the deicers to not exceed 2 minutes. This is a design flaw that Boeing has stated they will address, and in the meantime pilots must follow the technical bulletin. Through the NTSB categorization, a pilot failing to follow this is considered a human error. But is it? Boeing admits it’s a design flaw and not one found in the Airbus equivalents of A3xx. \n\nLastly, I am not a whistleblower. I repeat, I am not a whistleblower. ☠️☠️☠️",
