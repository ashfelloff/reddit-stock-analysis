Like I mentioned in my last post, I bought the dip by selling VOO/VTI to buy NVDX. I sold 50k shares at 16.75, I think NVDA was at like 128 at the time. I'm extremely happy with the gains and I don't want to overstay my welcome going into the print. I strongly believe NVDA will continue going up and then eventually lose 75% of its market cap. This is not at all an investment, just a momentum trade for me to capitalize on companies attempting (and eventually failing) to capture AI gains.\n\nOne year, two years, or five years down the line, NVDA will fade as companies realize their large investments in GPUs will be for nothing as it's just not possible to make money off generative AI. I will never short NVDA, but I'll never hold it as a long term investment. I expect NVDA to do 160b in revenue in the next fiscal year with a 50% net margin. At a 50 PE which will give it about a 0.5 PEG which is extremely cheap imo, that gives it a valuation of 4.0T or $162/share which is my exit price. I will sell at 140 and 150 a share and finally fully exit at 162- I don't believe this revenue growth to be sustainable and fully expect the cycle to bust once people realize AI is impossible to monetize. MSFT is losing money for every subscriber, META has no monetization strategy, and GOOG/AMZN's cloud growth numbers are exactly the same pre-capex.\n\nI derived 160B in revenue based on TSM's revenue forecast. They expect to do almost 90B in revenue with half of that being attributed to NVDA. NVDA has a mid 70s gross margin, call it 70 for simplicity. By working backwards, we can get 150B in revenue from data center. We also have about 20B revenue coming from other segments of NVDA. I then subtract 10B to account for discrepancies in my assumptions.\n\nAm I wrong? Most likely. But that's my thesis and I encourage everyone to have their own.",
