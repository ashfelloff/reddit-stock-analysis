This is exactly what musk was told would happen by hundreds of experts. You cant just throw wires and electrodes in the human body without the human body fighting back with scar tissue. This is why we havent pushed augmented implants for blind people, itll work for a few years, and then scar tissue will destory the implant and make it near impossible to put another one in.",

It was very possible back then, but the issue was always that after a couple months the area the electrodes were implanted in would start to scar up and encapsulate the implant as a defense mechanism to the irritation. \n\nThe 100 day update seems to indicate they are starting to run into the same issue. Theoretically the smaller threads, as opposed to the spikes we were using, should cause less irritation and thus cause the brain to react more slowly, but as far as I know they haven't solved the immune response issue, so I would expect to see continuing hardware issues with software tuning until it passes a critical point and they can't boost the gain any more. With Michigan and Utah arrays which were the gold standard back when I was in undergrad, that point was about five years from implantation to when scarring would render the array unusable and we would have to remove it. Without having access to the actual array and materials Neuralink is using I couldnt provide an estimate for how long it would take those to reach the same point.\n\nI really hope that Neuralink and SpaceX succeed (and indeed am invested in SpaceX), but until we have a year period with no scarring or hardware issues, I'm not confident the real issues are solved.\n\nI'll take my wendy's order behind the dumpster.",

The reason why there hasn't been a ton of investment in that space is that the brain generally begins to build up scar tissue around the site of the implant, which leads to the degradation of its ability to read signals. Scientists have generally switched to people wearing weird head gear (which can't catch signals nearly as robustly, but is non-invasive) because the scarring problem is unsolved. If Neuralink has also not solved the scarring issue, which may in fact have no solution, the product is not much more than a modernized version of something already demonstrated.",
