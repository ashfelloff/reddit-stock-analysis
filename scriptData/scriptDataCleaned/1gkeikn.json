Realistic returns to stop that year, or realistic money for which I am just retiring? \n\nRealistically 200% is possible on small accounts on SPX (if they allowed you to do SPX).

It's all perspectives. \n\nRealistic level by which I could see myself if I ever got $X through gambling or job or inheritance, that I would stop? \n\nSure. $1M for me means I would just wheel 80% SPY (NOT SPX or XSP), and 20% TLT.... Super conservative 30-delta puts, and only short calls on very sharp 5% weeks. Think about those data days. Sell on those spikes. No deviation, no protection, just straight up wheeling the two...
