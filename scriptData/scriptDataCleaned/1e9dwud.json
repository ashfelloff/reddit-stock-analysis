If an option contract is priced at $2 a share and I’m still OTM or barely at breakeven by expiry, the low upside will make the option unattractive unless they expect some mid day news to bolster the gains. Your profits essentially get eaten by theta rot are time works against you. \n\nAlso, the closer to OpEx you are the more shares that are offloaded by in profit taking and general rebalancing so for highly volatile contracts like Nvidia you are likely to see a big sell off at the EOM. Generally, if you set options for the first or second Friday of the next month, and the stock has genuinely high conviction, it will keep moving positive for the next week or two, giving you a better chance to land you ITM without a ton of negative short term movement. \n\nLong story short, if you buy a reasonably priced contract, avoid big expiry days, and give yourself enough time for strong upside in an option contract you should be able to sell it for a decent profit far before expiry.",
