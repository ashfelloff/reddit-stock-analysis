  "title": "Apple Intelligence won't launch in EU in 2024 due to antitrust rules, company says ",
  "score": 431,
  "selftext": "Apple said Friday it won’t release three recently announced features, including its flagship “Apple Intelligence” AI product, in the European Union in 2024 due to “regulatory uncertainties” stemming from the bloc’s Digital Markets Act antitrust regulation.\n\nApple said in a statement that the features — Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring, and enhancements to its SharePlay screen-sharing product — won’t be available to EU customers due to Apple’s belief “that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security.”\n\nThe EU passed the DMA in 2023, spurred by concerns that a handful of major technology companies such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and TikTok parent ByteDance were acting as “gatekeepers” in preventing smaller firms from competing. Among other things, DMA requires that basic functionalities work across competing devices and ecosystems.\n\nThe interoperability requirements apply to iPhones and iPads. But Macs are affected by the DMA because iPhone Mirroring allows users to replicate the screen of an iPhone on the screen of a Mac.\n\nThe loss of the company’s AI product could be a disappointment to consumers. Apple Intelligence can proofread writing or even rewrite it in a friendly or professional tone. It can create custom emoji called Genmoji, search through an iPhone for specific messages from someone, summarize and transcribe phone calls and show priority notifications. The company also announced a partnership with OpenAI and a roadmap to other models being added to the platform.\n\nApple shares were largely flat on the news. Apple saw 2023 net sales of $94.3 billion in Europe, just under a quarter of its worldwide net sales. Apple Intelligence also won’t be available in Greater China, which accounted for $72.6 billion of its 2023 sales.\n\nThe company said it will work with the European Union “in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/21/apple-ai-europe-dma-macos.html",

I do and I have spent countless hours on Crusader Kings, Hearts of Iron, Stellaris and so on. All made in Europe.\n\n>Also, nice job ignoring that I said japanese games along with American games.\n\nI haven't ignored them. We know Japanese games are good and have always been. But many Americans as you are proving have trouble admitting that Europe too can make great games.\n\nLike I said, I'm having trouble remembering any AAA game I played in the last few years that was made in America. Only Jedi Survivor (which was good) and Starfield come to mind (a disappointment) . Oh yes Last of Us 2 but I found it more of the same (and a lot of your fellow countrymen \"for some reason\" absolutely hated it).",

The regulation is necessary... but also increases the threshold for market participation.\n\n\nThis is a pattern that repeats all over EU in other industries. Regulation overhead that is necessary, but still undeniably leads to higher costs. Meaning startups spend more time with obligations as opposed to new features. And why companies in US have such a big advantage over EU companies. When a company can prove their new feature's success first and worry about regulation later, it's much easier to establish yourself on the market.\n\n\nI don't have a solution for that problem.",

Something you did not consider is higher education. In Europe (continental) university is either very cheap and affordable or free. Some countries even pay you to go. Do you want to check the American tuition fees? \n\nOther stuff like food. Europe's cheaper and better quality. Property taxes that don't depend on the sale value of the house. Transportation costs: in many European cities you can live without a car if you want.\n\nPlus the immaterial costs of never living further than a few hours of train away from a cultural centre. In the US there are very few cosmopolitan centres. If you live in the middle of nowhere, that's it. You'll have to plan for and fly everywhere, using one of your very precious and limited leave days. Where I live I have Paris, London, Bruxelles, Amsterdam, Koln within 1-2 hours of high-speed train away.",
