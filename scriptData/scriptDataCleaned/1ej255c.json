      "body": "Few facts:\n\nThe market rallies during QE cycles, of which we're just about to enter.\n\nRecessions are measured by GDP, not employment, and July's GDP numbers smashed expectations. We're not going from 2.8% in July to -X% anytime soon, as regards in reddit forums seem to think.\n\nThere's a difference between a slowing economy and a recession. A slowing economy is exactly what the fed wanted to engineer, and is all we're seeing here. Just because the market is pricing in some small % chance of a recession does not mean it will happen, or is imminent.\n\nThe VIX is basically already at it's non-black-swan typical high. Look at the 12 year chart on the VIX and tell me how often it stays above 30 (it's intraday high on Friday) for more than a week or so. Covid, a black swan event, is really the only exception, and it sustained 30ish a bit during the sharpest QT cycle we've seen since the 1980s back in 2022. We're not in a black swan event, and we're not in a QT cycle. When the VIX drops, there will be a squeeze.\n\nUnlike the large correction we saw in 2022, Credit Default Swaps are barely moving. Hell, they're lower than they were in April. Smart money is not concerned with this current aberration.\n\nThe S&P, on average, sees three 5% and one 10% correction per year. The 10% correction is obviously inclusive of one of the 5% corrections. We saw one 5% correction in April, and a second one in August here. This correction is now just a smidgen bigger than the April event, another 'end time' event according to redditors, that saw a ferocious recovery....when? When the VIX crushed back down.\n\nOpinion:\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in stronger than expected, or even in line, we'll see a huge squeeze in the market, just like last Wednesday. Bulls flipped to bears and calls flipped to puts so drastically, yet frivolously, that the slightest hint of good news will cause a squeeze.....puts are just a compressed spring right now. AMD having decent earnings last Wednesday caused NVDA to surge, and the entire market squeezed as a result given it's massive weight in indices. That's how slight the good news has to be for this correction to be old news.\n\nIf Thursday's payroll report comes in soft, we could see another leg down towards....what? A completely natural 10% correction.\n\nThere's absolutely no current impetus for a larger pullback than 10%. We're not going into a QT cycle, GDP is healthy, there's no black swan events on the horizon. I'm not saying people should leverage themselves to the tits to buy this dip on margin, but I also wouldn't panic sell anytime soon yet.",

Unless of course it’s a hard landing, then some pains gotta be felt first.\n\nThe only bullish case with regards to the interest rates I see right now is rate cut prompts investors who are currently enjoying the unprecedented risk free rate in the money market to seek higher returns in the stock market, therefore pumping up the market with more capital inflows. In a way you could say because how much money we printed in the last few years, valuation models gotta adjust, in other words, everything is currently marked cheaper than it’s supposed to be because the dollar is now worth less",

Just don’t get caught up celebrating every dead cat bounce. Employment numbers are a lagging indicator and once it moves down it does it very fast, from month to month even. Yes this slowdown was manufactured but the whole point of easing off the gas is to avoid a recession(rate cuts)…except the fed is always to late to react and it’s not cause their dumb it’s just that the bad data usually comes out when you are already in a recession. So at that point rate cuts become reactionary and that causes the crash. Or inverse me and load them calls, anyone’s guess really.",
