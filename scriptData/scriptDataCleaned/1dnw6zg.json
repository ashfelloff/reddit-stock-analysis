(No dividend means it's easier to short.)\n\nEmbrarer shares are up 70% at an all time high, in part because Embrarer is expected to move in on Boeing's turf.\n\nThere is more wrong with the Starliner than Boeing admits.  The latest is there is no return date for the astronauts ...\n\nBoeing has significant cultural rot.  It's not just a matter of replacing a lousy CEO.  Bean counters and consultants destroyed Boeing quality culture.  Boeing needs to fire every single employee who is not an engineer, test pilot, or assembly line worker.\n\nThe only thing that could help Boeing stock right now is a big war, or an activist investor who forces Boeing to fire all the dopes in management.",

He is going off on random twitter storms against the left, trans people, the economy, and a basket of other things the base consumers of his company are for. This alienated people with money who he needs to buy his shit cars.   \n2. Build quality of Tesla is atrociously bad compared to other vehicle makers. Panel gaps, shit steering wheels, faulty mechanisms etc. have cause people to stop buying the cars because when you spend 40+ grand on a base model, or nearly 100k on the dual motor you expect a good build quality not shit that feels like it was built by Dacia ( look it up - for the europoors, you know what I speak of).   \n3.

Boeing's current issues are due to cutting corners in builds. Older planes are fine. Shit started going down hill after the McDonald Douglas merger and it took several years to a decade for that company's bad habits to penetrate Boeing's solid build quality.     \n   \n\n\n>At one point, Boeing had a stellar safety record and was the crown jewel for America\n\nSo was Sears, what's your point!?",
