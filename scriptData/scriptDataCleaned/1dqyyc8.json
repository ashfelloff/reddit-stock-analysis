  "selftext": "These gains are just mini compared to the $1000 price this stock will hit after earnings. (Projected to be July 26)\n\n\n- With Salesforce struggling, ServiceNow stands to be a market leader in the ITSM space.\n\n- ServiceNow is already integrating AI in extraordinary fashion due to their platform metadata allowing LLMs to have huge amounts of context within the system. Anyone familiar with LLMs like chat gpt know that context is everything.\n\n- Servicenow is very popular in the gov‚Äôt space gives this stock room for risk, even during tumultuous economic times.\n\n- In recent years, Servicenow has implemented the Now Experience UI Framework into their platform allowing for easier creation of custom UI. This was formerly a downside of ServiceNow‚Äôs robust data framework, limitations in UI. Developers who typically have to stay within the framework can now implement custom UI akin to traditional apps with popular tools like React and Vue.",
