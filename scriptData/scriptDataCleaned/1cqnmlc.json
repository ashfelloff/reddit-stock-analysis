Because the first worker strike in the US happened in 1768 when the journeymen tailors protested a wage reduction.\n\nAlso:\n\n> Winning gains for all workers and citizens, such as a shorter workday and a minimum wage, has been a key part of union activity. In 1866, the National Labor Union was created to limit the workday for federal employees to eight hours.^[4](https://www.loc.gov/item/today-in-history/august-20/) However, the private sector was much harder for unions to penetrate.^[9](https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/news/all-things-work/pages/unions-struggle-to-gain-a-toehold.aspx)\n\nDo you think all those Federal employees were in a “hazardous job”.

IF it was worth what you think it is, and the pay was $40/hr, you’d have a flood of tech savvy people applying for that position. This would increase the supply of applicant, and push the wage down since people would actually be willing to do this for less than $40/hr just so they got the job over someone else. \n\nWhat other careers do you know of that make $40/hr? \n\nI know of two, one I do, one my brother does. \n\nI got a bachelors in nursing. The first two years at community college for breakeven price. I didn’t pay a dime for that degree because I maxed out my financial aid, and I worked for the school in all of my off time to get another scholarship that footed the rest of the bill. I then completed my bachelors, but only because my CC partnered with a University to provide the 4 year degree (at a 35% discount). I still worked for the school 5 days a week. I still maxed out my financial aid (Pell grant, merit scholarship, work study position. And still had to take federally subsided loans to the tune of $12k by the time I graduated  to get my BSN). Most people with my degree paid $60-80k for it. Straight out of college, I passed my licensing exam and got my RN and was hired to the best paying hospital in my city. I was hired for $37.90/hr. Within 1 year I got a cost of living raise and merit raise for my work, bringing me to $40.10/hr.  \n\nMy brother went to a 10 week crane operator course after 5 years doing manual labor in the construction business. He paid $5000 up front, made no money for 10 weeks, to learn how to hold 20 ton pieces of metal above 3 workers heads while they welded it into place without killing them. It took him leaving his home, working in the most desolate environments in the world, in a 5th wheel travel trailer, bracing the harshest weather that Mother Nature has to offer, working 12-15 hour shifts 6 days a week, just to make $50/hr. \n\nWe both have jobs where human lives are at risk. We’ve both sacrificed a lot to have the skills we have. \n\nLittle Apple Genius IT boys deserve $22/hr at best.",
