  "selftext": "Why don't I see more talking about lilly here? \n\nThe obesity problem in America alone should justify calls. They make such insane margins on insulin. \n\nAll the fat fucks that can't control themselves well enough to prevent shoveling food in their mouth lead to a constant shortage on ozempic. They can't manufacture enough to meet demands and it's only becoming more popular. \n\nTiktok influencers and overall social media presences are talking about ozempic and its ability to cure your fat fuck-ness. \n\nAm I truly regarded or does lilly have room to run 1k+ in 24?",

          "body": "NVO is a very solid option as well. I don't think it's a bad bet to bet on either of them. \n\nLilly is just the company I have the most positive experiences with using as a type 1 diabetic. Their products have a very premium feel when compared to the other ones I've used in the industry. The insulin pens and customer support in particular. \n\nThat being said, I will reiterate I do not think nvo is a bad bet whatsoever.\n\nEdit: I found an article comparing the weightloss drug NVO has vs LLY. Here is my key takeaway (copy pasted) \n\nUnlike Novo Nordisk’s single-agonist drug compounds Liraglutide and Semaglutide which only work to affect one “hunger hormone,” e.g. the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), Lilly’s new weight loss drugs are a new class of “dual-agonist” weight loss drugs, which act on two hormones: the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP).\n\nThis dual combination may give Lilly an advantage in the marketplace. Clinical trials showed that adults taking these dual agonist class drugs from Lilly lost 21% of their body weight (when taking the highest dose) compared to 15% weight loss among adults taking Novo Nordisk’s Wegovy.\n\nLilly’s first entry in the market using this new dual-agonist mechanism was Trulicity, a daily injectable medication (with the active ingredient Dulaglutide) for use by type 2 diabetic patients. \n [source](https://formaspace.com/articles/pharmaceuticals/will-eli-lilly-beat-novo-nordisk-in-the-weight-loss-drug-game-in-2024/#:~:text=Research%20Furniture%20Page-,Novo%20Nordisk%2C%20Maker%20of%20Ozempic%2C%20Became%20Europe's,Most%20Profitable%20Company%20in%202023)",

You lose weight because you don't feel like eating as much and that appetite comes back as soon as the drug wears off, meaning that if your habits don't change, you'll gain the weight back.\n\nAnyone that manages to permanently lose weight from ozempic even after getting off the drug would've been able to lose that weight just as easily without it. Their achievement is a result of lifestyle changes, not a physiological change induced by ozempic.\n\nThis effect was highlighted by [the step 1 trial](https://dom-pubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/dom.14725) which does show a statistical improvement even after a year off the drug but also shows most of the lost weight gained back.\n\nAfter a year off, everyone's metabolism was back to their initial point and the average net loss was 5.6% with a standard deviation of 8.9% over 2 years of trial (68 weeks of ozempic and 52 weeks off). This shows that the drug does seem to induce a psychological effect in patients, motivating them to lose weight but, with a SD of 8.9%, the best you can conclude is \"results may vary\".",

Moreover, there are really NO sufficiently long term results that are considered definitive at this point. The entire field of GI hormone receptor drugs is still in its infancy. Semaglutide was the first to clear its hurdles and make it to market, but tirzepatide appears to be a strong competitor in terms of results. Currently, I'm invested in LLY and NVO.
