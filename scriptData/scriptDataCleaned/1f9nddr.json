I always see people talking about pulling this off, but short term gains tax this year looks to run between 10% and 37%. If you are going to take a 20% hit on the first sale then you are barely ahead on the 16% drop. If that drop would have only been 10% or less than you lose out on this move. If you believe enough to buy vack in then the risk isnt worth the reward.

Plus, you have locked in the tax amount while holding a stock that will continue to fluctuate. All of this is on just a 16% gain. A lot of people are up more than 100% on this stock. If they remain bullish, then the tax implication means they would most likely need to perfectly play a drop of more than 20-25%. It just seems that these moves are rarely beneficial if you want to be long in the stock.",

As well as a few 100M from prepayment clauses from other MNOs like what Verizon did, or the teeny bit of revenue these 5 will collect.  \n\n  \nThis ATM is fucking great because they're selling at market prices and not incurring any debt to these banks.  Deutsche just gave them a 63 dollar price target while working out this contract with them.  They're basically saying yeah you'll probably drop 20% tomorrow but in the future we'll still pay 63 bucks a pop for these bitches.  \n\n  \nASTS is on a fucking ship to the moon they just need to lock it in and execute.
