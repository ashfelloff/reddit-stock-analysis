I did buy TWTR during the 2020 dip which Elon bought off me at $54.20^blaz^it a share. I have been selling puts on it and slurping up that nice premium. Current strikes are around $110. That is what I think is a fair price for the company. Upvoted OP because WSB Frontpage/OPs are always wrong. Seeing this on frontpage reaffirmed my sold puts will expire worthless and that I should probably gap down and sell more when they do.",

Plus there’s so many Teslas from previous years it doesn’t stand out as wealthy or successful to drive a Tesla and people care about those perceptions.\n\nNot to stereotype but successful Indians and Chinese immigrants seem to be driving these cars in my area and they’ve kind of lost the average white buyer because who wants to be associated with Elon and buy his products. It’s like trying to buy a Volkswagen in 1938 or something lol. \n\nMy roommate was a huge Tesla and Musk fan and owns a model 3, but he’s much less excited about it and it’s technology after owning it and seeing the owner publicly defend Nazis and promote great replacement theories, so he doesn’t brag or talk about his car to people like he used to because the conversation often turns to the racist ceo and that’s awkward depending on the person.",

I can get a used 2013 Tesla S P85+ around here for about 15k-18k, but if something is wrong with the battery or drive unit then I'm out \\~8k to fix or I have to scrap the vehicle. I just couldn't stomach that risk. Used EVs need to be a lot cheaper or the batteries a lot cheaper to repair.\n\nWhen I start looking at newer used EVs, the price are competitive with brand new cars (especially with the state and federal tax credits) so it's like...why get something with no/less warranty?",

Also now that we know what the Model Y facelift will look like, a lot of buyers are holding back.

I mean the Cybertruck is a fucking joke and was just recalled because the accelerator pedal would get stuck down when the shitty cover falls off of it. Combine the shit ton of problems  with the Cybertruck with the fact that Elon Musk is not a well liked person anymore and Tesla probably isn't going to be expanding to new markets anytime soon.\n\nUnless Elon makes that cybertaxi announcement as \"Cybertaxi's are hitting the street right now and they work perfectly\" the stock will probably continue to shit itself. Given the track record of Elon's big announcements it's hard to think that the cybertaxi event will say anything other than something stupid like they are \"6 months away\" or something then they will be perpetually \"6 months away\" for a couple of years.",

The whole vibe I was getting was \"who the hell there actually produces anything tangible \". Just so much bloat all around and refusal to listen to industry experts, wasting tons of capital trying to skip pilot phases of projects only to end up a year later back where you started and forced to do a pilot stage bc stock price was falling and you had to justify your expenses now. \n\nI told you guys to your face that you should just abandon cars and focus solely on energy production and storage.
