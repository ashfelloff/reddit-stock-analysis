  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.   Some stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Global Markets Ramp Up After Rally Attack](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-14/global-markets-ramp-up-the-trump-trade-after-rally-attack)\n\n* [**DJT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DJT&p=d) - You know what the news on this is. Watching the $50 level and $55 level. Odds that he wins the election have gone up (Reagan surviving his made him win his election in a landslide).\n* [**RUM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RUM&p=d) - Same news as above.\n* [**GEO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GEO&p=d) - Private prison stock- same news as above.\n* [**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - This has bounced so strongly from the down day we had from the announcement of the delay of Robotaxi, leaning somewhat bearish towards it. However, the markets will likely be bullish today so will remain agile in this. No position right now.\n* [**SEDG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SEDG&p=d) - Company announces second wave of layoffs, cutting 400 jobs to restore profitability.\n* [**BITO**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BITO&p=d) / [**BITF**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BITF&p=d) / [**RIOT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=RIOT&p=d) / [**MARA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MARA&p=d) / every other ETF and miner tracking CC - We saw these spike due to the ex-President’s recent outspoken support of CC, and the likelihood that he would win the election has spiked.",
