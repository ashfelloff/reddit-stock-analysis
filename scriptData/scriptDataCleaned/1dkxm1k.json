  "title": "Why is there no sober analysis on NVIDIA and AI?",
  "score": 210,
  "selftext": "I've been following the AI craze for months now, and the discourse generally falls into two extremes. On one side, there's the unbridled optimism predicting that the AI market will reach an $8 trillion valuation within the next two to three years. There is a whole sub where some enthusiasts are even urging everyone to go all in on NVIDIA, extrapolating its past performance to predict future gains. On the other side, there's the intense pessimism, with warnings of a bubble that could burst at any moment, driven more by paranoia than by solid data.\n\nI've been hearing these warnings since NVIDIA was at $640 (or $64 post-split), yet the stock has only continued to grow. I invested $200,000 and saw a 90% gain. Currently, I don't have significant stakes in NVIDIA directly, except through ETFs. While I believe NVIDIA might be overvalued based on current numbers, I think its future potential is appropriately priced in.\n\nNVIDIA and other AI stocks are likely to experience accelerated growth over the next few years, though perhaps not at the same rapid pace we've seen recently. The most extreme optimistic and pessimistic predictions about AI may not materialize, but AI is undoubtedly the current big thing. Right now, AI's growth is highly concentrated in big tech, but it will gradually decentralize and spread to small businesses and everyday applications.\n\nOf course, there will be corrections along the way, and some of these may be significant. The potential for growth remains substantial, but like any market, AI is subject to risks such as major world events, pandemics, or wars. However, these risks are inherent in the stock market, whether AI is involved or not.\n\n",

It’s likely that AI will have an impact but how much, where, what the downsides and what are the surprises still remain to be seen.  \n\nBut already AI is quite disruptive and it will only get more significant.  Both journalism and TV/movie industries have been shaken by AI.  You can come up with countless uses and you’ll still miss it all.  There are just too many possibilities that no body can give any sober analysis.\n\nThere is just too much unknown right now.

                      "body": "Basically when people see a disruption like internet they go crazy on the valuation of some companies. Some of them are pure gamblers. They don't invest really on a rational take of the company value but more on the idea that they think the value will continue to grow.\n\nNow the problem is that when a market get much bigger you have competition. Most of the network gear didn't end up being Cisco. Competitor took the main share. And also there always a big rush when you need to build up the infrastructure. Once it is there, you only need to replace stuff and the investments are much lower.\n\nFinally there the question of who made the most money out of it ? Who made money from the internet ? Was it really Cisco or AOL ? Or was it Google, Facebook, Apple ?\n\nYou could not invest on Google until 2004. Facebook didn't exist. Apple was a niche company at the time that could had been almost bankrupt.\n\nIf we go back to Nvidia, Nvidia chips are a cost center. Like the networking gear of Cisco. There no interest to buy any except if you hope to make money using them.\n\nThe big players, Meta, Google, Apple, Microsoft are fighting to make AI free for the general public and include in their offering. The bet is not that most people of the general public will pay an extra 10-20$ a month for their chatbot. Companies like Meta, Microsoft with Bind and Google with Google search and Android. They will offer it for free and finance with advertisement.\n\nStill an AI query cost about 15X more than a google search query. A big part of it is the cost of Nvidia chips + the datacenter electricity consumption, A/C. That's a cost center.\n\nFor sure at least MS and OpenAI invest to get this kind of monthly plan, but from corporation. But people will not select their AI plan for the company with the most Nvidia chips, but for the company with the best AI or the one that is the most useful. \n\nAnd chances are the general public AI will be as good and free. Big corporations will pay the big money to protect their Intellectual property. Not to have necessarily a much better product.\n\nThe biggest cost still will be the general public that will have it for free. And to be sustainable, all the big players will want the cost to be as small as possible. That's why Meta has its own model that is being open source (so anybody can use it) and that's why for the same performance it tend to consume far less than openAI models.\n\nThat's why Apple invest to put more advanced AI chips in all its computers and smartphones so that the consumer pay the AI chips... And they are not made by Nvidia. That's also why Apple again also invest in its own data center with Apple home made chips and not using Nvidia because now they can only pay the cost to build the chip and not pay 10X more to finance Nvidia. And because they had been doing such chips in their iphones for the past 15 years, they should be decent at it.\n\nAnd Microsoft is doing the same pushing that new computers will have their own AI chips. Intel will provide CPU with AI chips. Samsung is doing it and all other smartphones players. None of that use Nvidia chips.\n\nEven OpenAI funder created a startup for optimized AI chips. And everybody with a stake in the chip business want a share of the business. They will all try it.\n\nIn computer science, one of the most active research topic is to make AI model smaller, lighter and if possible run on commodity hardware like a laptop. I tried it, I could run some more models on my PC... One of the current optimization being that each parameter would be stored in 4 bits instead of FP16 or FP32. Nvidia chips are great at FP16 and FP32 but are not designed for 4 bits.\n\nThe whole world of the tech is betting against Nvidia.\n\nAnd now we see that basically Europe want to prevent full AI integration in Apple phones. This kind of legal issue will reduce the demand and slow down the adoption. \n\nChina is yet another beast. Legally the USA has forbidden China to buy Nvidia chips. So China government invest massively in making their own chips. They consider it a priority for their homeland security and the sovereignty of their country. They wont even care if it is profitable.\n\nMaybe Nvidia will have the same problem Cisco had. Everybody started to buy at a competitor.",

Most of them were at best things you *could* do with the technology but could more effectively or efficiently be accomplished in some other more standard way that already existed. The unique functionality the technology brought to the table was decentralization, which is just not something most businesses actually need or want, and not something most consumers actually care about.\n\nAI seems like it’s currently going through a very similar hype cycle. I do think it’s at least slightly more justified because the unique functionality that it brings to the table is something that is actually valuable if it can be made to work at a high enough level. The question is when and whether we can get it working at the level it needs to to do all of the things we want it to do, rather than whether those things are valuable or whether there’s a better existing way to do them (because, by and large, they are, and there isn’t).",

They plan is that apple chips will have improved AI unit, that their cloud will use Apple chips with AI units and that in borderline case if all failed, and the user confirm it each time, openAI may be used\n\nMicrosoft plan the same and Intel work on provided CPU with AI features. And most non apple smartphones already have AI unit on boards. Most manufacturers rely on that. And almost none use Nvidia.\n\nWhy ? Because AI is expensive. The consumer will not pay a $20+ plan or more for AI features. So everybody want to provide it for free, so basically there not an extra cent being made with the AI features we get everywhere for the consumer. If AI finance itself with advertisement like Google, there will not be more money. People will not watch more ads and buy more products from watching ads.\n\nSo tech providers don't want to increase their cost, they want most of the computation to be done by consumer devices. On top that's a reason to upgrade.\n\nThe main use case to make money with AI is to have customer that accept to pay for it. Like corporation that will pay for the Adobe AI integrated in its creative suit of tools or like the pro version of Windows and Office that will come with a 20-50$ monthly plan per user to use copilot.\n\nAnd yet everybody will try to use the least expensive hardware for them to achieve that. \n\nFor example the model are run in 4 bits instead of FP16 or FP32 so that the models can run on cheap CPU. This doesn't work for training but for using the models. Running the model is predicted to be 80% of the usage in the future. Training the model would be only 20%...\n\nI am not sure neither that once everybody has brought a bunch of Nvidia chips and can do all they need that they will be the same demand to just replace/upgrade what is there.",

Alexa has millions of users who like it but its business model of being free and making up for it with ads and increased Amazon purchases never worked (and I'm shocked anyone thought it would) so for it to stop being a money pit users need to start paying for it.  I'm looking forward to seeing how that goes.\n\nApple's plan is brilliant and they are uniquely positioned to pull it off - Give consumers the features they want but at a trivial additional cost because the models run on the consumer's device, where the consumer's data is, using the consumer's electricity.\n\nIn terms of model execution capability *per user*, Apple's footprint dwarfs every other player in this game because they're putting high end multicore CPU+GPU chips with unified memory into every user's hands and they aren't even paying anything to build this footprint because *their customers are paying them*.",

Nobody knows how it’ll pan out for sure, not even me, so you can make an estimate now but nobody truly knows where this will go. That’s why the quality of analysis leans toward opinion. \n\nWhat are the actual profitable products these chips enable? Who are the customers? Are they going to succeed building their own chips instead? What are their profit margins like? How are they affected by AI? How much better are the new chips and how likely is it that they’ll keep improving at the same rate? Will CUDA remain the dominant framework? How much of a risk is it that they are completely fabless? The questions are endless. \n\nTry and come up with a valuation for Nvidia in a year. It’ll probably be off by a long shot, either way. Just depends on demand for new *Nvidia* chips, it’s that simple - but very hard to estimate accurately, and you can’t get that information by looking at Nvidia’s balance sheet and forward guidance.",

This industry does indeed have long lead times, but those are getting shorter. Google has its own AI chips, as do Meta, Amazon and Apple.

If you’re able to design a chip that can perform 70-80% as well as an Nvidia GPU, for less than half the price, that is a competitive option. \n\nIf Nvidia have indeed created a market for AI accelerators with profit margins this big, you’d be out of your mind to think that only Nvidia will be in on that party. \n\nThis fantasy that nobody can get close to Nvidia is just nonsense.

But still most of the cost will be the general public using the free products.\n\nToday the cost of a gen AI query is 15X what the cost of a google search is. But Google and Microsoft or meta will not make more money from the general public there. They live from advertisement and advertisement revenue is tied to consumers expenses. It will follow growth and can't finance expensive AI.\n\nSo they all have their plan to get rid of the high cost of the hardware and especially Nvidia hardware and they are going to do it. Apple is an example. No smartphone will use Nvidia. They data centers will use Apple chips. This will be 99% of the usage. For the remaining 1% they will use openAI that will use Nvidia. And the customer will be able to pay their own plan to access open AI. Apple will not pay.\n\nAnd once all that is done by the big players, Nvidia will not have that huge market anymore.",

All chatGPT is is a statistical model to predict what word is most likely to come next, and the rest of generative AI just basically does the same with pixels, notes on a song, or whatever other set of data you want to pick and then predict what’s most likely next. \n\n It has its value but it’s massively overhyped because it’s not going to magically take over productivity and creativity like everyone thinks. 99% of the research going on in this subject is done due to the aforementioned optimists with money just throwing funding at it like crazy even though the research coming out is 99% garbage.

We already have ML/AI models everywhere, or memory hungry algorithms/data structures (which are related but not quite the same thing), in everything including robots. \n\nIt's not a new phenomenon, everyone just became aware of it with LLMs. The reason why GPUs weren't selling like crazy before a few years ago is because extremely large models are impractical for most applications. You either need to host it somewhere else and make an API call for inference (slow, requires internet, adds privacy concerns like security considerations that non-internet devices don't worry about), or you need a model small enough to perform inference on a local device that likely doesn't even have a GPU, or has a small one. \n\nNeither of those limitations has changed, and for both reasons, there's an obvious ceiling to the applicability of very large models for most applications. Also, most applications really don't even need the wheel reinvented with a large model, there's smaller ones that are extremely effective at a lot of tasks already that don't need to be replaced by something expensive and bloated to do the same thing.\n\nI think the hype has grown beyond what those of us on the ground actually use the technology for.",

              "body": "So, one thing you should know is that large models train better. It's easier to train a very large model and then shrink it down through distillation and/or pruning than to train a small model directly. You also need a lot more compute for training than you do for inference. You can do a lot with a small GPU or neural accelerator like what is found in an iPhone. You can absolutely run a useful LLM with limited compute inside your phone, even though you yourself couldn't possibly afford the amount of compute it took to train said LLM.\n\nThat being said, the amount of data needed for training is still huge. We have a lot of textual and video data, but we don't necessarily have enough data available for every use case we might want to train models for.\n\nI also think the current models are not quite good enough. Apple would really like to have a much smarter version of Siri that runs on your phone... But personal assistants are kind of useless if they misunderstand you and make dumb mistakes. They need to be very reliable to be useful. We're maybe not quite there yet.\n\nThere's also other issues wrt scaling datacenters. The power consumption is enormous. It's going to become a bottleneck. At some point, governments might start taxing power usage for datacenters, because we can't have them use power that's needed for legit use cases like your home. We also don't want to start increasing greenhouse gas emissions just to train bigger LLMs. It seems likely that demand for nvidia GPUs could start to fall and nvidia stock could rapidly crash. I could be wrong but I don't think that Google is going to keep building new massive datacenters every single year. At some point, they're going to say \"we did that last year, what value is being delivered by our past AI investments?\"",

That ML has been around since spam filters, that the thing in Netflix recommending movies, or when eBay suggests a category is just the same stuff. All an LLM is doing is picking the next most likely words.\n\nHere's my general problem with all of this stuff. It's really all a trick. Often quite a useful trick, one that can help but a trick that can also yield crappy results. Like you can build a categorisation NLP thing that takes text and says \"this is most likely a builder/chef/programmer\" but it isn't properly smart. It's just scoring word counts, maybe prioritising order or words. And that trick can help pare down a giant data set to get a few results, but you still need a human being to check if the results are sane or not. And it really doesn't matter than if it's 2% or 5% inaccurate, you still need the human. You're always going to need the human. So adding more data or more processing doesn't add much more value.\n\nPeople are talking about AI factories or self-driving vehicles, but the value of a self-driving vehicle is zero intervention. That you can get drunk and it drives you home, or read a book as you travel. If you still have to watch the road, the value is tiny. And factory robots are about machines that just keep on doing the same thing very reliably all day.

I only see this because their GPUs use AI to render images quicker (think unreal engine 4K quality and various other things) than it's competitors. That means it's huge in the VFX/Gaming space. \n\nNext you have the AI boom which is their GPUs but also their infiniband product line. (Which is getting overlooked by people not in the IT space. Which I get, it's my career so I have to stay up to date on it.)It's basically switched that process data quickly using fast switching and probably a data center architecture (I'll keep it simple so we get gains quicker). Here is the link to their spec sheet if you're interested in knowing more: \n\nhttps://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/products/infiniband/\n\nNow these GPUs paired with this infiniband technology all through a single pane of glass for ease of management is definitely going to change how data processing works. Yes it can support LLMs. But imagine what else it could do as time goes on and new features are implemented. Yes AI isn't true AI and more or a better version of a search engine right now. But there are also AIs that produce music off of prompts. Hell open AI just released a video generation engine too. \n\nAll I'm saying is that these companies are going to be paying hand over fist for their own AI architecture regarding this. Nvidia is the only one that can offer the whole SDN to run it (SDN stands for software defined network(ing) for those chads that want to know). Anyways Nvidia's biggest competitor off of a quick google search is drivenets. However, they don't make their own devices but use a white box solution (basically a bunch of other vendors or basic switches that they put their branding on and use it for their own solution. Kind of like white labels for those in the know). It's not created from scratch in other words. That's why Nvidia is sailing high. Also a quick google search showed that one infiniband Nvidia switch from Dell is like 40K. Depending on how many servers are running GPUs (think 3K GPUs and 10 per chassis. That's about 300 servers and I'd you have switches with 48 ports that's about 6-7 switches for TOR. But you want redundant connections so it'll probably be moreso 12. Then you need a 3:1 throughout cost on the spine side so that fight there is about 36. So in total 48 switches and that's not including licensing. In total just for switched and the base price is 40K that comes to 1.92 million dollars ). \n\nSee how they're rolling in money. That's probably one tiny data center for a small company just on data center equipment. Sorry for the long winded rant but working in IT makes Nvidia a buy still. They are going to keep going up till a better solution is invented or if real AI becomes an actual thing.",

Have you considered that despite the considerable growth already, that the analyses that you see might actually be right? Or at least very realistic?

Some believe, some don't - and neither side is going to agree until time passes.  Add in the advent of quantum computing and I certainly am a believer. The earnings reports, the projected earnings, etc show NVDA at a much cheaper valuation on traditional rule-of-thumb metrics like p/e ratio than at any point in the past couple years. \n\nI think what most are missing is the new addressable market for sovereign AI. There is already an arms race between the west and China/Russia over AI. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are already building data centers to run government-controlled AI. Every government with the means is going to want sovereign AI, and every military will correctly see it as a necessity. When you add the untapped potential of 40 - 60% of world governments trying to build such systems throughout this decade you can further justify what may seem to some as overly optimistic outcomes.\n\nI'm a believer.

Stock begins a downtrend but to the common eyes is still looks like growth is doing well. 3 months later you're going to find out growth has been decelerating. How long that happens? Who knows. \n\nSince the beginning of financial markets there has always been a risk like this. In America it really started with the railroads which were the original AI trade. We had the industrial boom and the nifty 50. The original tech boom in the '90s which most closely correlates with this one. I think what really sunk that one was just the lack of real earnings which oddly enough might correlate with this one because right now the real earnings are coming from building up which were also the thing driving the '90s early on. Laying all that fiber, building fabs, all that stuff was fine. By 1999 or 2000 you had all these startups and all these ideas and the profitability was, well there wasn't much. So the whole question with AI is going to be how profitable is it when everything is up to scale because in the beginning, it might not be. A lot of new inventions take a while to really figure out how to maximize the profit models \n\nSo what's all that mean from an investing standpoint? Not a lot really, it's just something to keep in the back of your head and remind you to manage your risk appropriately. If you have an account that is full of nothing but arm and Nvidia and ASML.

News suddenly said otherwise, breadth narrowed again and NVDA ran back up.\n\nSo what I expect is that NVDA will see a serious plunge when rates cut and the market decides the smaller stuff is worth investing in. As breadth improves sp500 will probably drop a bit or go sideways for awhile but it will NVDA going down and other stuff going up. I suspect the same will happen to the other big tech. \n\nOnce that runs it course NVDA will probably be down 20-60% down from where its at and then it will begin to grow back over time.

Personally, not financial advice, I give it maximum until next earnings before a downturn.\n\nThen you have the accounting practices where significant buyers being shell companies and some of the revenue is cloud credits - it does not smell right. Some say \"shady\", others say \"accounting fraud\"... remains to be seen. But, a well timed thoroughly researched short report could leave a lot of bag holders behind, and cause a significant drop.\n\nWith the new production processes of 2nm, it's rumoured Apple will buy all production capacity at TSMC. nVidia is just a 10% customer and have far less money in the bank to compete with buying the capacity. They don't control production and is thus beholden to another company for it. How are they then going to maintain margins, revenue and deliver on the growth that investors expect?\n\nSemiconductors in general is a bubble though. ARM Holdings has a Market Cap of 180 billion, the 90% owner of ARM Holdings, Softbank, has a market cap of 95 billion. With that, the market is obviously pricing semiconductor companies as a temporary spike in evaluations... or we would see Softbank rally, right?",

AI is going to increase that 8%?  What does it give us?   What value has AI provided for your life?\n\nAI has been around for decades.   It's solved some little problems, like speech recognition, that's nifty.     It's added a little value.  It is not the be all end all.   This is nothing new, it has just been noticed.    There is not a new thing here that is going to change everything.\n\nLet's say, optimistically, that AI can tackle and solve hard problems, like designing a better chip for AI to run on.    Is Nvidia using that AI? They are chip designers, not AI designers.    Is their AI better then their competitors?     Nvidia doesn't have much for physical capital.   It's all in it's intellectual property, the design of it's chips.      \n\nThe whole hubbub about AI is it is going to increase the amount of intellectual property, which could potentially make Nvidia's little sliver of it, their chip design, worth that much less.   A quick rise means there could mean they can be usurped quickly.\n\nNVDA the stock is relying on the next bigger sucker,  like TSLA before it, or tulips.   It's value is more as a stock than as a company.  As a company, it's better than it was 3 years ago, but not 5x better like the stock says.  Sure their revenue doubled last year, but that doesn't mean it's going to double again or for that matter continue.   \n\n4 years ago, Nvidia chips were good for mining crypto, which was a hot ticket for a while like AI, set to have some trillions in a market in 3 years.  The crypto market went up $2T or sextupled between May of 2020 and May of 2021, and in that time NVDA went up 50%.  That huge market that Nvidia chips were powering, didn't give Nvidia an equivalent gain.   Even if AI does get an $8T market, it doesn't mean Nvidia is along for the ride.\n\nBetween crypto and AI, where are we going to get the electricity?   What good does all that power do for us vs. the long term costs of the emissions?\n\nOn the other hand, I feel the same way about TSLA, they are not worth 10x GM, but so far, the stock market still says they are.   Might be NVDA is the next TSLA vs. GM/F like NVDA vs. AMD/INTC    Or AAPL vs. MSFT/GOOG.    The stock market makes its picks, not necessarily based on what value to society the company actually provides.  For that, nope, there's no sober analysis.    Stock buyers are running on hype and emotion.",
