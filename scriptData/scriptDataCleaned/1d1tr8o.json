You kind of disprove yourself in the first place by saying “an android company” because part of Apple’s valuation is they are the only iOS company. \n\nThe stock market isn’t real bro it doesn’t value tickers based on your personal affinity for their products. If you downvote a one sentence joke response you’re butthurt dude. Even saying “apple fanboy” implies butthurtedness and that others give a shit about the Apple android paradigm that defines you. There are very few Apple fanboys just people that default to using their products and joke about green texts.",
