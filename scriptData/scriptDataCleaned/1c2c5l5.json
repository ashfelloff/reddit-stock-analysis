Then a watchlist for my option plays and my investments and past investments / plays. It‚Äôs brutal to see sometimes but can‚Äôt win them all. You can definitely lose it all quickly though so I‚Äôm much more conservative.\n\nI like the YOLO strategy but mine follows more strict criteria:\n\n- options expire at least one week out \n\n- strike must be close to ITM or ITM (not inc. Premiums)\n\n- must have liquidity/volume  - so many stocks are not liquid in options arena.\n\n- don‚Äôt shoot for 200%, try to exit in 3 days or less paying attention to theta.\n\n- avoid contracts with IV 100% or greater (earnings plays man they are fun but damn they hurt)\n\nI‚Äôve made 50% on this strategy in minutes but also break this strategy and those are my biggest losses. the last one a testament to my regardedness‚Ä¶.\n\nHad APPL $165c and $167.5c both expiry 4/19, sold right after open yesterday. Had a few RIVN $10c 4/12 (bought Tuesday so I broke the ‚Äúexpire at least a week out‚Äù bit) and decided to pour all my profits into the same RIVN calls. Stupidity! But at least I got out before they were completely worthless and rolled them into SPY $517p for today, making back all of my money - also breaking strategy there lol.",

I‚Äôve been doing options that expire the next day, but will probably transition to 0DTE for the volatility they have compared to later dates. Like today I got in the market late but still noticed that Apple was very high and added puts & made a 40% gain in 30 minutes.",
