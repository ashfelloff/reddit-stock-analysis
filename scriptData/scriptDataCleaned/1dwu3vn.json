Enovix rallied to 24 last July over a US Army order, and this time around they have way more deals with \"undisclosed\" customers that have been revealed and more on the way. There are gonna be more updates after their earnings this late July, and their grand opening of their factory in Malaysia is on August 8th. I bought the one expiring in September instead of August just to be on the safe side incase it takes longer to go up.",
