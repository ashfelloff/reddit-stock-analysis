Exactly the same complaint with Amazon in early days. Investors kept complaining about no profits while Amazon reinvests massively in things that don’t really grow Amazon profits at all. They were building out an ecosystem and planning in the long term. Good businesses should definitely worry more about long term strategies than to satisfy short term gains for investors. There needs to be a balance of course. That’s why TSLA gets more people hyped up. Not because of what they have now. People are expecting the investments to eventually slingshot the company to new heights. It could fail, but it could also not. That’s the risk.",
