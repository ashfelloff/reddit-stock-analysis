  "selftext": "\nLW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. \n\n“The transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,” said Tom Werner, President and CEO. “The ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition’s effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.”\n\nThe CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.\n\n*Financials Overview:*\n\t•\t2024 sales projection: $6.88B, increasing to $7.27B in 2025.\n\t•\tNet income expected to rise from $856M in 2024 to $953M in 2025.\n\t•\tP/E ratios indicate fair valuation at 17.1 (2024) and 15.3 (2025).\n\nhttps://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LAMB-WESTON-HOLDINGS-INC-31862637/\n\n*Market Presence:*\n\t•\tStrong client base including giants like McDonald’s, Burger King, Wendy’s and Walmart.\n\t•\tDominant player in the global frozen potato market.\n\n\n*ERP System Challenges:*\n\t•\tERP implementation impacted Q3 results, affecting net income and Adjusted EBITDA.\n\t•\tShort-term operational disruptions and financial impact are notable.\n\n*Risks:*\n\t•\tImmediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.\n\t•\tClient dependency could pose strategic risks.\n\n*Outlook:*\n\t•\tDespite short-term challenges, particularly with the ERP system, long-term prospects remain strong.\n\t•\tSolid customer relationships and financial health suggest LW is a viable long-term investment.\n\n\nAdditional analysis:\n“Updated Fiscal 2024 Outlook\n\t•\tNet sales of $6.54 billion to $6.60 billion\n\t•\tGAAP net income of $770 million to $790 million, and Diluted EPS of $5.30 to $5.45\n\t•\tAdjusted EBITDA(2) of $1,480 million to $1,510 million, which includes a temporary, higher-than-expected impact from the transition to a new ERP system in North America and a $96 million pre-tax charge(1) for the write-off of excess raw potatoes\n\t•\tAdjusted Net Income(2) of $800 million to $820 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) of $5.50 to $5.65”\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook\n\nWhile the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company’s fiscal health in 2024.\n\nGiven the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.\n\n\nI dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we’re on wsb bay bay. Also I’m a regard and bought too early in the dip. I probably should have waited until things calm down a bit. But I’m gonna hold regardless. GLHF\n\n\n\n\n",
