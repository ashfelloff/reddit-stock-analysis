  "selftext": "Dah Sing Energy ADR is now up 7.3%, JinkoSolar ADR is up more than 4.8%, Atlas Solar is up about 2.9%, First Solar is up more than 2.7%, PV inverter provider Enphase Energy is up 1.5%, and the Solar ETF is up more than 1.3%. The Biden administration finalized a 25% tax credit for semiconductor manufacturing projects, expanding eligibility for what could be the largest incentive program in the Chip and Science Act of 2022.\n\nThe new rules, introduced more than a year after the original proposed version of the rules, mean that a broader range of companies can receive tax benefits. These include companies that produce wafers that are ultimately made into semiconductors, as well as producers of chips and chip-making equipment. The credit will also apply to solar wafers - an unexpected adjustment that could help spur domestic module production. So far, the U.S. has struggled to boost manufacturing of these components, despite a surge in investment in U.S. panel manufacturing plants.",
