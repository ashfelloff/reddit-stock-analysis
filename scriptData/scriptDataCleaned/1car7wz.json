BioTech stocks tend to be a waiting game as the real jump doesn't normally come until they start posting profits.  Had a good chunk of stock in Exact Sciences back when they were in FDA trials still at like $7 a share.  After FDA approval it jumped up a bit and then dropped back down but once they started posting profits that shit jumped up big time.  Was up to $130 a share or so within 2-3 years.  Just a matter of if you are playing the short game or the long game with some of these stocks at least from what little experience I have.  The other one to be on the lookout for like this one is Immugene.  They are working on the same type of cancer treatments and showing promising results.  Unless you are in Australia you can only buy shares on the OTC market but they are at $.082 a share so you can buy an ass load of shares for super cheap and just sit on it waiting for their drugs to get FDA approval.",
