This move follows complaints from advocacy group NOYB and highlights the ongoing tension between technological advancement and data privacy regulations.",

          "body": "Considering just how much crap Meta has gotten up to over the years, I'd be concerned about data privacy too. They let ChatGPT, Claude, and pretty much every other Ai into the EU. The fact that Meta is actively extracting data from its users in the creation of the model could be really bad. Imagine if they had image generation that ended up using photos of someone from Instagram, and that person sued? Or if Meta's data biasing ends up favoring one of the many false truth-hoods spread on Facebook? And who's to say whether they won't just straight up pull user chats from WhatsApp to train the way the models speak? \n\nYou may be thinking \"Oh, Meta wouldn't do all that! There's just no way a company would\". Well, this is Meta, that has been fined 7 times over data privacy, and notoriously got dragged into congress. I wouldn't trust Zuckerberg not to use confidential user data. If it was basically any other company, I'd agree with you; but this is Meta.",
