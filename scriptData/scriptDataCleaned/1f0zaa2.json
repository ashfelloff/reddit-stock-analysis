Also, the other posters are correct, if you are getting stopped out that much, you have your exit price too close. Go look at a chart like SPX and you can see where breakouts fail, they headfake up and then after they wipe out stops, they move it back down (or the reverse.) \n\nMove your stops (or preferably exit price if you can watch it) further out and size down your position so the larger amount you can lose is offset by less options so your overall loss stays the same. If you are buying 2 contracts, buy 1. If you are only buying 1, then it's a tougher problem to solve.",
