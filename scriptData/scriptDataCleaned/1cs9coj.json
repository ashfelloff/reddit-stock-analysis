If that one is break even you can take another trader. If that one is a Win and you reached 5% Target on the Account, call it a day. If it's a loss call it day. Etc. Day is over when you've reached your Profit Goal, or when you've reached 2 losses, whichever comes first.",

Watch the 4 hr to see the overall direction of the market. Indicators - Add your Macd/rsi and emas (9/50/200). Paper trade with that for a week or two and watch the way it uses emas as support resistance. Watch some videos on support and resistance levels also. \n\nFor every big move there is usually a reversal, use the 5 minute to see when itâ€™s looking topped/bottomed out and buy your call/put for the reversal. Also helps to buy a week out and I rarely hold longer than a few hours. Once it moves against you sell or consider reversing your position.",
