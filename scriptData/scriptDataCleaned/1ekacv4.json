These things really need to be investigated, but since they generate trillions of dollars for these big players, all politicians ignore this topic. Limit how many short sales an agency of a person can do within a day. Let's just say 500 options and 10,000 shares or a maximum of 1 million $$.  You would never see these types of insane ups and downs or simply remove the short selling to be fair to all. *",
