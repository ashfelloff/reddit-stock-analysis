And most people should probably stick to just index.\n\nI essentially had 2x 5 bagger events in the last 5 years. $CCXI had an FDA approval hiccup that dumped the stock from $70 to $10. Read the peer reviewed papers and thought FDA overreacted and decided to buy at $10. The company was acquired 2 years right after the FDA reapproved at $52. This play timeline coincided with the stock market downturn in 2022. So I narrowly avoided that by picking quite probably the best performing stock in 2022. Then I used all that cash to buy NVDA at the beginning of 2023. \n\nNow I‚Äôm just diversifying to indexes to keep it safe. \n\nTime in the market is better than timing the market for most. But if you can time the market just once or twice in your lifetime, you can get on track. I know you just came back from a gambling bet gone wrong, but it could go right.",

Keeping that in mind, close your trading accounts, remove yourself from any whatsapp trading groups, discords, social media, whatever, and use up your $40k carryover tax loss for the next 13 years since you can only deduct 3k of that loss from your income per year. \n\nDon't try to make the money back by continuing to trade.
