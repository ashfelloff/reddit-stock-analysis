Resellers then list it for 3x or 4x the price and nobody buys it.\n\nNike then releases standard colourways of the same shoe again in limited numbers.

Losing a moat in running would be devastating. Nike was born for runners. Still clearing old inventory and poor innovation in recent years. Consumers are and have been struggling. They will continue to struggle while buying on debt. Consumers have gotten credit drunk and that can end up decimating revenues for companies like Nike when it’s no longer an option. Nike will right the ship but for now thanks for the 🧀.",
