The prototype was created in 2006 and brought to production in 2008, the same year Musk was made CEO. IIRC, people on here said Wall Street was gushing when they test drove it in NYC.\n\nMusk was/is a financial backer (put $70M into Tesla) and marketer that wants to be seen as more. The founders of Tesla just happened to watch him give a speech and decided to talk to him about the company and funding. There's a good chance there were other angel investors that could have varying levels of success with the company (some better some worse).\n\nMusk was/is great at capturing free government money which outpaced an income deficit. He's a leech who legally made his billions from taxpayer's money.",

So musk created a net 1 billion company in 2016, and likely worth much more then that now.  You call that a failure?! \n- Boring was valued at $5.6 billion in 2022.  And has multiple working tunnels in LV, their latest opening July 2023.  You consider a 5.6 billion valued company a failure?!\n- neuralink had an overwhelmingly successful first computer brain chip implant just 6 mths ago.   The possibilities of this is massive.  This company will be absolutely massive.  If they went public they’d be worth billions.   You call that a failure?!\n- Zip2 was formed in 1995  by Musk with $3 M venture capital, and sold in 1999 for $305 million.  That’s a failure?\n- Twitter hard to say, but seems to be at least paying its bills and covering its loan interest with no capital infusions.  And it’s only been 1 yr.  I’d hardly call that a fail.  Maybe not an overwhelming success, but it’s only been 1 yr.  \n\nTesla, spacex, PayPal, openAI, starlink, boring, solar city, neuralink, they’ve all turned into billion dollar companies virtually from scratch.\n\nThe dudes never had a L.
