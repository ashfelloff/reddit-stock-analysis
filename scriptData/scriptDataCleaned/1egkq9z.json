You also have to consider margins and any non bill work that comes up. 250/hour is like 130-160k at the very high end - especially if the company is trying to look profitable for an acquisition.

We watch all morning as the first flight gets delayed but not canceled. Then the next flight gets delayed a bit. We’re supposed to be to the airport 3 hours early based on delays and have a little over a 2 hour drive so when it gets close to noon and we see the second flight leaves, we start heading to the airport. We keep watching the flights. Even though the first flight was super delayed, it takes off while we’re the road. The third flight and ours never delay and continue to show on time the entire time. \n\nMy wife drops me and my two kids at the departures so I can start the process of getting them through security and she goes to drop the rental car. I shit you not, the minute she returns the car, the 3rd and 4th (our flight) cancel via text message. No delay notice, just straight cancelled. So now were at the fucking airport with two kids, no car, when we could have stayed at my families house from the get go. We speak to Delta rep, next flight out is TUESDAY.  No hotel assistance. No meal assistance.  No transportation assistance. \n\nBooked a hotel then spent 1k on new tickets with Frontier for the next day (Mon). Between hotel, transport, meals, and flights were out a total of $1,500. \n\nDelta now says they won’t reimburse fees for tickets on other carriers. Mind you two more nights for the 4 of us would have cost damn near the same money in hotel fees (which they are supposedly reimbursing, we’ll see). We were just supposed to sit at the fucking airport for two days apparently. Them reimbursing hotels was because Buttigeg told them to step the fuck up and help people. What if we didn’t have the credit/money to float this?  \n\nDelta makes (edited) tens of Billions a year and straight up told their customers to go fuck themselves. You can blame Cloudstrike and yes, they should. Being in IT myself it’s clear they deployed cheap tech they couldn’t remote control (imagine being an airline and not being able to remote control your PCs from bios level) and they clearly don’t have the IT people, I’m guessing they run a skeleton crew. Delta is at least half to blame here with terrible planning/practices/IT spending and they decided they would just fuck over all of their customers even though they have insurance for this, can sue, and will probably be made whole.",

We go over to the airport and talk to the agent who tells us that the earliest flight back was a Monday night flight to SLC, followed by a red eye to JFK, and then an 8am flight to SC. Without any other options, we booked that and found a hotel room for a few days.\n\nMonday night rolls around and we got on our flight to SLC without issue. 11:30pm and it was time to start boarding the flight to JFK and nothing happens. Apparently the flight crew was there and ready to go, but Delta had a completely different crew on the manifest so they wouldn't let us board. This little issue delayed us by an hour, but no worries, we had a 1hr40 min layover in JFK so plenty of time. \n\nWe finally boarded, then just sat at the gate for another hour. According to the pilot, our plane was 6lbs overweight (probably due to Delta moving around lost luggage from other cancelations) and couldn't take off. By the time we made it to JFK, our last flight had just switched over to departed (even though it was at the gate with the stairs down) and they wouldn't let us on. So we had to book another hotel room and a flight on Jet Blue the next day. All in all the little adventure cost us about $3500",
