It's going to be a long time until they develop human level perception, which is what's actually required to drive a vehicle with other humans on the road. Anyone that tells you this is close to being figured out is full of shit.\n\nWe're easily 25 years away combining these with the perception, The cars are going to require lidar radar, computer vision, satellite navigation, near field communication and then probably some car to car mesh Network that doesn't exist yet, oh that's going to be requiring serious hardware on board cuz you can't send that stuff out. It has to be computed in real time. All the cars are going to essentially have $10,000 gpus in them as well. If we follow commoditization of services and say the hardware trickles down finally to the car manufacturers that's easily 10 to 15 years out. The only reason why Tesla is so far ahead of everyone is because they started from zero and built it with this in mind. People fuckin in Teslas in motion does more to sell it then anything else. But the problem with Tesla is there are no gauges and switches. It's just a screen so people don't like that and we don't want to pay more than $30,000 for a car no matter what it is, people can see that the next big thing for these car companies is #cars as a service \n\njust like games as a service and no one really wants that, that's why they haven't dominated.",

It is, because the question, whom to hold accountable can be answered by laws and which system gives less reason for accountability is the very essence of the question. \n\n2. Driving on instinct is a gutt feeling argument. The question is not, how easily you can train an AI to drive better than a human, but if you can do it. When I was young, the accepted fact was, that computers would not be able to beat human masters in chess. That turned out to be fundamentally wrong, decades earlier, than even the most optimistic scientists believed.\n\nAnd third: AI driven cars can be required to be network enabled and share their data with one another. A car does not feel compelled to drive faster than advisable in fog, because it has to get to an appointment. If cars have mandatory devices sharing their \"flight data\" they don´t need to see the car in front of them to know, it´s there. You can even put that as an app on cell phones and self driving cars will know, if some foolish human rushed on the street to get out of the rain faster.\n\nDon´t get me wrong: That Tesla event in my opinion is a staged stunt. But given the progress in the field I have little doubt, that \"cars don´t have the instinct\" won´t cut it anymore in a couple of years.",

So on a $20 trip, Uber makes $5. \n\n\nA robotaxi company could beat Uber on pricing by dropping that to $20 ride to $15 and it keeps all the money. Yes, now they have to pay for the upkeep of the cars, but imagine if Uber could suddenly triple their revenue and completely remove humans from the equation. That's the reason for the hype.\n\n\nTo me, it's really all about safety. Self-driving cars still have a lot of issues. If we get to the point that self-driving cars are as safe as the average human driver, I think you'll see a lot of people abandon owning cars entirely. Especially when the inevitable \"$99 per month for up to 200 miles of drive distance\" subscription model appears.\n\n\nIn short, robotaxis have the ability to be far more profitable than Uber has ever been.

Uber could have been profitable much earlier, but they went for the Landgrab.\n\nWith that in mind, imagine Uber, but most of what the driver earns (so what he gets minus fuel and repairs) goes directly to Uber as pure profits. This would be roughly 90% or so operating margins once the infrastructure is in place and the car has paid itself off. \n\nSo, even assuming this would somehow not increase Uber (or robotaxi) usage, this would mean about 90% operative margin on 100bn+ revenue. (Uber has revenue of >30bn based on their <30% take rate, so 100bn+ is spent on Uber rides).  So, with about 90bn in operative profits, this business model makes more money than Microsoft.\n\nNow, the question is whether or not self driving becomes a thing, but if it does, and Tesla has a monopoly on it, the profits would be beyond wild.
