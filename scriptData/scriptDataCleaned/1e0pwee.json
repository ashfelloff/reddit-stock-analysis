All the downsides of stupidly high strike leaps (little liquidity, no leverage) and no upside\n\nHypothetically if TSLA pulled a massive move to 500 by expiration time, you're 2x with shares. And with those contracts, you'll have like $100 (i.e 10k per contract) in intrinsic for the 400 area calls, which is a 2.5-3x. Hardly beats the returns on shares.\n\nEven if tomorrow, TSLA magically went to 500, those contracts would only be $100 in intrinsic + maybe $30 (\\*) in extrinsic = $130. That's only a 3.5x. Not even double what you get with shares, even in this silly scenario.\n\nThis is a really stupid bet. Not because of the dump today, but because you might as well be holding shares at this point.\n\n(\\*) Where did $30 come from? Just as the $400c would be 100 bucks ITM when TSLA is at $500, we can look at the $140 Dec 2025 calls which would be 100 bucks ITM Today. These contracts are like $130, so $100 of that is intrinsic, the remaining ($30) is extrinsic. You can approximate that to the $400c if TSLA were to be $500 tomorrow",
