Originally an alphabet investment now headed by an ex alphabet CEO. The founder turned around multiple hospitals in New Jersey then turned his focus to Medicare. The insurance side of clover is simply to prove the model. They hold a decent amount of the New Jersey market. They can increase cash flow with their SaaS model which is now proven and can generate revenue while being not at risk. They had to be a provider to feed their machine learning. One of the main reasons Alphabet gave up on the sector ie \"Google Health\" is that they weren't allowed to use non anonimized data. As a provider you can use all the data you gather to train your models. When the valuation flips to SaaS I expect at least a 5x valuation not the .8 it current trades at.",
