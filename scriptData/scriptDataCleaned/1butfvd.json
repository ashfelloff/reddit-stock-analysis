The free trial they just opened up to all eligible car owners is going to horde so much god damn data that it will probably be close to perfect by the end  of the year.

      "body": "Tesla is just another company in the battle, it is the first that retaken the EV idea, first having the largest charger network around the world. That's what made  it special, but it is a cyclical business just like other automotives. Musk laughed about BYD years ago, and now they sell more than Tesla. No one knows what will happen, but at this point I think Tesla is overvalued and looks boring to me. They need new and cheap models. The cheap marketing strategies of using influencers just don't work anymore, we all know that Tesla cars are fast, have FSD capabilities and a huge screen. And the \"Smart CEO\" reputation just got burned by taking his public political opinions.",
