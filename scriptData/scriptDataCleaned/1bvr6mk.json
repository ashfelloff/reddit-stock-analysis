Literal idiots with GME shares in the 400s that they bought for $20-300 holding down to $12 just to \"get the hedgies\". Plotkin/Melvin were doomed the moment the squeeze happened but folks didn't even sell the 2nd bounce to $60-70. \n\nSheri Redstone is LITERALLY that type of regard. Only difference is she was a trust fund baby who mismanaged the empire her father built. **PARA** was cranked up to meme stupidity by Bill Hwang and Archegos using 20x leverage. PARA was $100+ cause of that dipshit and she didn't sell then either. Then folks were buying for the dip around $40-60 and she didn't sell then. Instead opting to keep spending on streaming and fucking up finances. They broke from the $30-40 range when they cut the dividend and lost the investors. Turns out they didn't need to since they are still cash positive, likely management got spooked in 2022-2023 like the soft bitch paper hand bears. Heck even Warren gave up on her dumb ass cause she can't make a deal. EACH and EVERY time she has and out but chooses NO the company and her net worth gets BTFO more. Bitch too stupid to learn.\n\nAnd yes I'm down a bit on PARA, but I'm not mad. No way I'm losing as much money as that regard. Bitch is a SUPREME REGARD who blew away BILLIONS in her family fortune when she could have just lived it up or sold the company.",
