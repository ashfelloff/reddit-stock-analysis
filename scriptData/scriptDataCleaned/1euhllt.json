  "selftext": "First it was amazing. Making 2, 4, 6k a day. Saw my money double in a couple weeks. Then when my port gained 8k in a day and reached 30k the March 8 correction hit. I panic sold and got fooled by volatility buying more calls.\n\nThat was in the brokerage though. May comes around and I full port the IRA into more calls. Whole account across brokerage and IRA went to 130k (started with 10k in brokerage and 17k in IRA btw). Then another correction.\n\nI learned my lesson from last time not to panic so I Diamond handed all summer. Ouch. All the way down to break even all time. We‚Äôre back though and I have an exit strategy this time.\n\nThis is all my life savings minus a year‚Äôs worth of bills I kept in my bank account when I started trading at the beginning of this year. Wish me luck. My unemployment ran out spring 2023.",
