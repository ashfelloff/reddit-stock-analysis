  "selftext": "No end to CRWD's issues.\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cy08ljxndr4o\n\nCrowdStrike is being sued by its shareholders after a faulty software update by the cybersecurity firm crashed more than eight million computers and caused chaos around the world.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the company of making \"false and misleading\" statements about its software testing.\n\nIt also says the company's share price dropped 32% in the 12 days after the incident, causing a loss in market value of $25bn (£14.5bn).\n\nCrowdStrike denies the allegations and says it will defend itself against the proposed class action lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, the firm has said computers affected by the massive global IT outage are effectively now back to normal.\n\nThe US-based company stated that as of 5pm local time on Monday, 29 July (00:00, Tuesday GMT), the outage had been fixed - ten days after the incident began.\n\nThe suit filed in the Austin, Texas federal court, alleges that CrowdStrike executives defrauded investors by making them believe the company's software updates were adequately tested.\n\nThe lawsuit is seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for investors who owned CrowdStrike shares between 29 November and 29 July.\n\nIt cites chief executive George Kurtz, who said in a conference call on 5 March that the firm's software was \"validated, tested and certified.\"\n\nCrowdStrike told BBC News that its disputes the claims.\n\n“We believe this case lacks merit and we will vigorously defend the company,” a spokesperson said.",

Yes, good engineers make mistakes, but that’s why *good* companies, with *good* engineering culture, have process to catch those mistakes. Crowdstrike had no such process (if they had, this could not have happened on this scale). They’ve now promised they will take a good hard look at everything and implement more safeguards, but the fact is, they didn’t have any despite being in a position where as an organization they should have known better. This doesn’t mean it will happen again (though same as with boeing planes, now that people are *looking*, more small scale issues might pop up with regularity), but it is a sales argument. “Do you want to go with our solution, which does all you need, and by the way we never caused a global billions of dollars outage, or do you want to roll the dice with them for nothing but a slightly fancier dashboard?”",

Forrester and Gartner don't exactly put EVERYONE running in 4th place in a women's 1500m swim race to Katie Ledecky swimming in 1st-3rd. \n\nThe biggest reason no one is going to change is because of how f'ing expensive that type of change is actually going to be. The product is not cheap at its basic options. And many of these large scale companies have already baked in so much that it would be high 7-8 figures for them to replace the entire security stack. That doesn't even take into account the manhours wasted listening to pitches and then developing how you are going to move from one to the other. It isn't just as simple as \"We are moving CrowdStrike to Sentinel One\" type thing either. Anything with federal regulations on them (FAA, FTC, DOE, etc.) are going to have to run through another audit after that transition takes place to ensure it meets standards as well. \n\nAgain, they are an outstanding product when you look at all the various \"agnostic ratings\" but they are certainly not the only ones that are hitting those marks.",

Many mature SOCs are probably ingesting real-time feeds from CrowdStrike via API into their own logging aggregator for detection and response methods. Or they are using a MDR/MSSP that is doing so, so they don't need direct access to the tenant itself. \n\nAlso, if you follow maturation guidelines for SOC/Cybersecurity in general, there is probably a couple folks who are dedicate PoCs internally for everything relating to your EDR or security stack in general. You remove the core tenant in that for something else...what do you do with that SME and continuity of operations within the company itself? \n\nThat is why it is such a monumental tasking to move these types of things around to something else. Once you get that program implemented....you're basically committed to it for probably a good 5-10 years unless something just catastrophic happens. Places like Mandiant, CrowdStrike, and Microsoft have fed off those regulatory requirements to keep the products in place....along with many of their core add-ons because they know the costs of replacing make it difficult to move on from them.",
