So I'd try to sell all 91 contracts at like 440$ if the price stays around 164$ at open, if it doesn't fill, work your limit orders down until it fills.\n\n  \nAlso keep this link open to compare if the price falls more and divide the profit+you initial cost by the number of contracts. Here in this case 35 217$ + 5096$ / 91 = 443$.  I'd set the limit price at 430$ to start off and work it down",
