The big challenge with these new technologies is coming up with compelling use cases for customers. I think a good analogy is their use of near field communication (NFC) technology. Apple introduced it to iPhones about 2-3 years after competitors did, because they didn’t see the point until they could wrap it with an interesting feature (Apple Pay.)",

Idk if an upgraded Siri necessarily means more sales, I'd still be doing most things manually on my phone so idc about new voice assistant features..\n\nif its literally just ChatGPT-4o in an Apple package I dont see how that moves the needle, since we already have those AI capabilities without the need for new hardware.
