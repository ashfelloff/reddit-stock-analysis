  "selftext": "After being down over 12k, I’m done for the year up 8.3k. (That’s a +20k run for you regards). I have had some incredible luck as of late, even though I was up about 12k at one point and took a few steps back last week… I hit my point yesterday where trading weeklies and 0DTE is just too exhausting. And my self control is lacking for just playing more conservatively. So this morning I pulled all my gains out. I PAID OFF MY FUCKING TRUCK. That’s a true chad move. I have about 500$ left after paying off my truck. I plan on buying a nice bottle of whiskey and taking my wife out to a nice dinner with the rest of that money.\nPositions were mostly calls on Nvidia, Apple, and SPY. But some puts as well. Mostly lost on my puts. \nFor those of you regards who are in the hole. Let this be motivation! ",
