              "body": "He means Do Not *Exercise* 🤦‍♂️\n\nThe OCC automatically exercises any option that’s $0.01 or more ITM at expiration as policy, so if your broker doesn’t give the OCC instructions to DNE, they’d be exercised regardless. \n\nHowever, as you unfortunately found out first hand, if you haven’t closed the position yourself—99% of brokerage’s risk teams will market sell your contracts for you, usually about an hour or 2 before market close. This prevents any risk of the automatic exercise from happening, and allows ample time to deliver notices, process DNEs, etc.. \n\nYou can’t really assume that you will be able to offload a contract close to expiration, especially in illiquid markets (most options lol) - liquidity dries up with IV - and it can be tough to close a position reliably at the last minute or even hours ahead of close  (hence most options expire unexercised). Makes sense because wtf would want to buy an ITM 0DTE contract 1 just before the market closes anyway. \n\nBrokers don’t like filing DNE instructions unless you specifically request it, because that carries the risk that the contract expires ITM + DNE and you lose out entirely if you couldn’t find a buyer in time.\n\nThere are too many variables on expiry day, and trusting you the client to be online with a stable internet connection and good understanding of market dynamics to close while there’s still liquidity or submit a DNE with ample time to process it, or otherwise make a deposit if you don’t is a lot of blind faith to put in the hands of someone who’s balance isn’t great enough to take on the shares. (No offense meant btw, I’ve never had enough play money to own 100 shares of anything besides SNDL). \n\nThis is definitely unfair to you as the client imo, but even terminally online people who work for a brokerage (like myself) have gone and run an errand only to come back to my positions being sold out, or had an OTM contract that I was profiting on and simply held too long and liquidity dried up, etc.. etc..\n\nThe bad guys here though imo are the policy writers with rules left largely unchanged since the original ODD was written. \n\nThey could literally just rewrite the rules such that many of the risks for both parties are minimized but they don’t give a fuck.\n\nAs a reminder the OCC is a FOR Profit Corporation and they get paid $1 per exercise, per contract (among their other fees/services)  by your brokerage. The more exercises that happen, the more they make. \n\nFidelity just doesn’t want to be left holding your bags and the only way they think they can guarantee that is to close your shit at whatever value while liquidity is still very good + a little extra conservative wiggle room.",
