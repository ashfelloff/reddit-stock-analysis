      "body": "Your question is asked in a way that you probably haven’t ever shorted so I will answer it by only covering the most important things:\n\nSo it depends on a multitude of factors. What you need to look at is your house surplus and how much margin maintenance is required for each position. Typically most stock positions require a 30% margin maintenance. If you have a hyper concentrated portfolio like me, some positions can go at a higher margin maintenance. Foreign/bank sponsored ADR’s can require 100% margin maintenance. And selling puts can also dig into your house surplus. Your main goal is to keep your house surplus up as much as possible. \n\nAnd of course the main thing you asked for: the actual short’s margin maintenance is determined by the actual stock price. If you are shorting a stock in the 20’s the margin maintenance will be much lower. Above the 5’s is another huge psychological point for shorting and margin maintenance. And the main point of interest is if you are shorting a stock at 2.5 or below. Once the share price goes below 2.5, the margin maintenance is capped at 2.5 which is why shorting penny stocks can really tie up a lot of collateral. \n\nSo what happens if you get squeezed? Well, once your house surplus hits 0, you get called. And then you are forced to liquidate some stuff to increase your house surplus. Take a look at all the things I listed above that affect house surplus and take your pick for what to do to manage this margin call. \n\nPreventing margin calls is very nuanced and isn’t something commonly taught in conventional investing since most people say shorting is too risky, but the returns you get from shorting are so ridiculously quick it makes conventional indexing look funny.",
