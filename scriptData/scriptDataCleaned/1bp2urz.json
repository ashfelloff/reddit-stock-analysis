It was an \"in-demand\" IPO, which had far more short-term upside than short-term downside.  I got no idea where the stock will be next year after a few quarterly earning reports come out, but it seemed pretty safe to assume it wasn't going to plummet on IPO day, so why not make a few bucks.  I didn't expect to be able to get out at $50 and take home $8K, so that was pretty great.  But I don't think it was that risky a move to participate in the IPO with plans to evacuate ASAP.",

No wonder. They dont create any value.\n\nThey are too late for the global forum \"template\" market (like a place where every city, club, sportsteam, political party etc. will offer it as notice board and alike).,\n\nThe search function is and always will be aweful, its not like github, Stack Exchange or alike. You better search via google and add +reddit to it, but this most likely will not help because,\n\nthe engagement and comments is not question-answer (something of value) but more like \"funny answers \\*suprise pikachu face\\* ;))))))) cringe\" getting railed sideways if even at all discussing about the OP question or topic.\n\nAll reddit offers are some bigger reposting subs, not better than 9gag and some aweful political/country subs micry high traffic because same small number of core users, strictcly divided by echochambers, populate all of them.\n\nIts like the sketch from Kevin alone at home where he gives the illusion that the house is full of people by reflecting the shadow of human siluetts against the curtains.\n\nNot even talking about the big influence of god complex basement dweller Mods trying to find power they do not hold in RL. And the higher Admin/Management level is not far better.\n\nIts all nice with you, but its just a place to live out skankhunter42 edgy stuff now and then and no plattform for any information, not by default design and even less by the community inhabiting it. Its entertainment at best and often just hate/rage political belittlement, strongly favouring positions that are made up on the spot. If trump/rightwings say X, then Reddit makes thousands threads and upvote-cricle-jerk that the opposite is true or \\[Deleted\\]. Everything gets political.\n\n  \nAlso the lack of user/profil focus (just some OF with linktrees) where you cant change anything or offer yourself as kind of information source (like a mini-blog, maybe similiar to twitter accounts).... hard.\n\n  \nI bet Reddit will hopefully die with this and Elon or some other mad person buys it and just put the garbage out and then still shut it off after all those god-complex echochambers cried and cried (always funny) from all sides alike.",
