  "selftext": "How do people feel about the future outlook of the Pharmaceutical industry now that Trump has been elected and RFK has sworn to take down Big Pharma? \n\nI’ve been increasing my stake in PPH (up 8% YTD) since I believe the American population will slowly become completely dependent on the Pharma industry. Obesity at an all-time high and people resorting to medicine instead of diet/exercise, cheap processed foods and fast food sales increasing due to inflation making them more cost effective for average person, little to no FDA regulation and oversight, addictions to drugs/medicine, pushes for vaccination, etc. \n\nWill RFK completely reform or even kill the industry?  Or just a good idea to buy and hold for the next 4 years?",
