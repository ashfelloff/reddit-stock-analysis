As was mentioned before, human error is *inevitable*, and nobody is perfect. If you are in a culture where your head gets chopped off the moment you make a single mistake, guess what kind of incentive structure that creates? One where you only gain from covering shit up and hiding your mistakes, since you’ll be punished if you are honest, and not punished when nobody knew that you made a mistake in the first place.\n\nIf safety is key, the way you achieve it is by having *process* that makes it so that people who make mistakes feel *confident* in reporting them. And then said mistakes get dealt with. Transparency is key, but in order to have people willing to be transparent, you need to set up an incentive structure that *rewards* transparency. Blaming individual boots on the ground is….not that. Nobody is going to willingly volunteer for their head to roll when they need to put food on the table for their family. No moral grandstanding is going to change that. \n\nThis is one of those classic cases of “You tell me the incentives, I’ll tell you the outcome”. Boeing sends assassins after anyone who speaks about mistakes being made. Ironically, who the fuck is going to uphold safety and speak up in conditions like that???",

The only major component that is the same from the NG version is the fuselage primary structure.\n\nThe 777x (which hasn’t been delivered yet and is a separate story) also has entirely new composite wing with folding wingtips. This has never been done before on commercial aircraft. It has also a wider cabin\n\nThe 747-8 also has new composite wings and an extended fuselage. Not to mention other numerous changes to the freighter version.\n\nI am not entirely disagreeing with you, but sometimes creating a clean sheet aircraft design is not always the best approach to meet evolving customer’s needs.",
