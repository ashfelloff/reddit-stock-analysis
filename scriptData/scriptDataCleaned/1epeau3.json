              "body": "If your ignoring vast data, a good measure using few data points are: mkt cap, gross revenue, PE. A sustainable mkt cap is 8-10x revenue in most cases for technology. That number fluctuates depending on industry, so read up to learn more about it. PE is price of the stock divided by the earnings per share. If Pe is over 30 you should be concerned your stock is overvalued. PE under 15 is undervalued.  These are general guidelines. Basically if a stock can pass these 2 ‘BS’ tests then it’s a decent investment. \n\nOther times just yolo into what ever you think will grow and completely ignore market common sense lol. Just don’t buy too high and then eat shit in a correction",

That is mostly from the amortization of differed expenses from the Xilinx acquisition 2.5 years ago.\n\nIf you run the P/E calculation on non-gaap income (currently 34.4), and add a projection of market CAGR, it is well within normal range. By my last calculations, AMD has about 2.5x the net inflows as Nvidia per share dollar.\n\nAMD's accounting situation is masking the fact they are making a KILLING currently.",

It's the type of processor that runs your phone and the center stack in your car and your washing machine (if your not a poorfuck).\n\nRadeon is AMD's marketing brand for their GPU left over from the ATI days (ATI was a company that AMD bought for their GPU tech).\n\nAPU is what a GPU is called when it's integrated on die.  \nYou see NPU tossed around for AI marketing but it's the same thing.\n\nMost SoC's right now use an ARM IP core (which nVidia now owns) but an open-source hardware core was released some time ago called RISC-V. Samsung has been shipping product on RISC-V for about a decade now (e.g. washing machines) but not phones yet.\n\nARM was a company with genius leadership that sold at the maximum peak of their product to greedy Chinese fucks. They unloaded it to nVidia.\n\nIP Core means the design of the CPU. You licensed the IP from ARM then could make your own chips using it putting whatever you needed around the chip for the task you were making it for. e.g. Automotive SoC's have CAN network controllers added because that's the network inside the car.\n\nRISC-V was adopted by the Linux community and supported before hardware existed in the real world to verify it on. (Ran it in emulators.)\n\nGoogle has finally officially added support for RISC-V to Android in their latest release.\n\nIf AMD releases a RISC-V SoC with a sufficiently powerful Radeon APU to run a vision model nVidia will fail out of edge computing AI.",
