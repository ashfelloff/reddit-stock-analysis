Last CPI was report was the trigger for me. I tracked stocks that have been coiled or beat down for quite a while. I caught the rotation, but how long will it last? I could see this continuing for a while given the bloat in mega cap and AI. Any small rotation out of those is measured in Billions or Trillions. Billions or Trillions does a lot for small caps. \n\nHappy to answer any questions or explain my reasoning for these positions.\n",
