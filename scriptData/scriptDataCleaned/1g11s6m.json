Some points were: they accelerate/decelerate quickly and would be able to talk to each other so they can eliminate all space between cars! Also, they're more precise than human drivers so you'd only need two strips of road for the wheels, saving on road maintenance costs. And since a driver isn't required, people wouldn't have to buy one - just pay for rides when needed. For efficiency and cost-saving purposes, maybe have designated places that people could walk to for pick ups.\nSeveral of the attendees looked at each other wondering if the guy was messing with us. The main difference between what the guy proposed and public transit was that his idea was private-sector led and was an on-demand service rather than having a train schedule. It finally clicked that a lot of 'innovators' are just trying to make money by identifying problems that either don't exist or exist but have an unsexy underfunded solution.",
