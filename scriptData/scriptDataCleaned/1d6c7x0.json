                                  "body": "No I don’t. \n\nSSO is simply single sign on where you login once and from there you can log in to all integrated apps. Hence to simplify it : it’s a directory based username or password. Most commonly the username and password are your credentials depending on your provider so no it’s not going to be username and password, even easier it’s your work email and password.\nThat itself can be containing 2FA or not.\n\nOnce you’re logged in you can log in to any integrated app for example snowflake. Again SSO is just another way of entering your username and password I.e. credentials so you do it once.\n\nThe problem in question is basically the 2FA not being activated. They’re claiming that demo accounts don’t support this. Which I doubt it. Yes most likely it won’t support SSO because the product is not integrated with their directory yet ( azure, Okta, whatever) but that means nothing here. \nunless SSO is mandatory on all new clients  ( which it can’t because not all clients use SSO) , they’re assuming an SSO would have caused the users email to be removed once they left. But again, it can’t because the app would support your email or gmail and not explicitly SSO because as I mentioned not all companies use it.\n\nHey shit happens but no need to  dupe people with bullshit statements. A demo account is an account, probably with limits on what you can do with it. \nSo here this is a policy issue:\n- do we enforce a mandatory 2FA\n- are we running periodic audits ? \n\n\nClients will use demo to test the product limits, sometimes sales will enable the full experience so the client uses it, specially on high ARR deals so expect them to put at least a chunk of their real  data, which from my experience is almost always in their testing environment, ofc mixed with fake data.\n\nI don’t work for databricks, I’m a developer by background, worked in SaaS leading implementations with US clients, including some talks with prospects to answer technical questions from data all the way to security and compliance",
