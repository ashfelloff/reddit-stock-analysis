The outage resulted from an issue with the latest update, the company said. CrowdStrike\n is now in the process of rolling back that update globally. The confirmation came after widespread reports of technical issues across the world, with many linked to Microsoft products. The U.S. tech giant confirmed earlier on Friday that its cloud services had been mostly restored after it suffered an outage.\n\n>‚ÄúCrowdStrike is aware of reports of crashes on Windows hosts related to the Falcon Sensor,‚Äù CrowdStrike said in a recorded message. Australian telecom firm Telstra said global issues affecting CrowdStrike and Microsoft were disrupting some of its systems. ‚ÄúThe issue is causing some holdups for some of our customers and we thank them for their patience,‚Äù a company spokesman said. CNBC parent company NBC Universal is one of the businesses affected by the CrowdStrike outage.",

My career has been as an engineer with security software startups (I am the person they send out first to fix these exact types of outages üòÖ). everything above is correct!\n\nwhat matters is \"stickiness\", aka how hard it is to remove these systems. remember, removing crowdstrike would cause just as large of a disruption as this did and \\*more\\* (though with the advantage of being planned)\n\nespecially because this wasn't technically their fault...and if their security scanners actually identified this Microsoft flaw and alerted the customers, they could point to the importance of keeping CRWD and fully utilizing it. ofc, there will be a lot of falling on swords as well, and maybe some losses, but yeah\n\ncritically, they can also implement a Fail Open option, where business critical systems can be allowed to bypass crowdstrike when it fails. yes it's less secure, but when it comes down to it, security doesn't always come above everything, like physical safety, or even revenues so high that they dictate the survival or death of entire companies. almost every product I've worked with has this option and is utilized in mission-critical insulated and air gapped environments where it's pretty safe anyway",

I'm not going to speculate until I see, at a minimum, the specific KB of the microsoft bug, but the CEO of crowdstrike himself obviously doesn't see it like you, as he was even less apologetic than I expected\n\nI don't see what we gain by picking apart my choice of words in \"technically\", especially since I said *directly after* that they will have to take responsibility and maybe even lose clients, but will expand as best I can\n\nI've been in this situation before, where a bad piece of kernel code caused software to fail. Often, clients would either be aware of that bad code beforehand and not have fixed it fast enough, or the security software itself would notify of it (or not, which is often where customers get upset)\n\nIn this case, either CRWD pushed the bad MS code themselves as part of a managed update system for endpoints, or they pushed a code update to Falcon that leveraged the existing bug. If the latter, and a KB already exists for that bug, it is \"technically\" not their fault because microsoft told them about the bug and they didn't patch it fast enough. Even in the former, they can argue that they rely on microsoft to work correctly, though they'd get nailed on their lack of QA beforehand\n\nIn reality, customers don't care about technicalities, but it changes the tone of the conversation from \"how can you fix your mess\" to \"how can we work together as partners to both do better next time\". Being in the room for a few discussions like this, this is often how it goes\n\nupdate: I did look at the actual file. early news stories claimed the crowdstrike issue was caused by a \"microsoft flaw\", aka windows not playing nice with crowdstrike. the fact that deleting a crowdstrike .sys configuration file fixes the issue seems to suggest that is not the case, and it would make it entirely their fault, if there is no MS flaw.",
