This means if the stock price doesn‚Äôt move significantly higher, your gains could become losses quickly. You‚Äôre already in the money so your gains are already solid. \n\n Gains: You‚Äôre already up 50%, which is a solid return. it might be wise to lock in those gains. Never be afraid to take profits. \n\nMake sure to set a stop loss as soon as the market opens (to avoid losses) and try to monitor the stock.",
