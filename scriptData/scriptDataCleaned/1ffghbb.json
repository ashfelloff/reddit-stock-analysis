And then, I able to make more small trades at once (less than .5% on most.) And bought shares with profits. Keeping position size small compared to the portfolio took the thrill out of trades, and some of the fear. Which made it easier to think clearly, and slowly build. Also to really study and understand mistakes, bc they always hurt, but being calmer when analyzing them helped to make more things click. \n\nI still live options and watch, manage and/or trade everyday. But in less time, and without getting…desperate? And therefore more time to learn and think. (Also, focusing on longer-dated and LEAPS, because some of the appeal of shorter dated was gone.)\n\nYou’ll be ok OP! I’m sorry this happened. But if you aim to recapture as much capital as possible in the volatility at open, you can sleep on it and make a plan for how to invest it. Also to study and set aside a small amount for contracts, with the focus on risk vs potential reward.",

Look at the option flow. Look at long term supply levels. Monday/Tuesday we had significant put flows lower on SPX. Halfway through Wednesday it all disappeared which meant nothing was holding the market down anymore. So algos pulled in and bought calls. Now the supply is above current SPY price. Means unless that supply level is removed, we’re heading that way so MMs can profit. Nothing is pointing down right now. Buying puts is foolish and idiotic, only hoping for an unexpected catalytic that isn’t likely to happen. If you want to buy puts wait for gamma levels to flip, but they don’t usually do that on Fridays. Take your loss tomorrow, don’t go to zero. \n\nI do this for a living, I don’t gamble.",
