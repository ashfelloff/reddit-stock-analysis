Even the shittiest obviously fraudulent meme stonk doesn't go down in a straight line. Market technicals (short covering, delta hedging etc) mean they have to take a breather occasionally.

The Street is really hating what Tesla is doing right now. They want signs of growth and steadiness with rate cuts off the table and Tesla is not that. Watch some funds pull their money until the ship is steadied. Even Tesla knows how bad this is. They literally waited until AFTER market close to slash model prices. \n\nIt’ll get walked down another 3-5% before ER, drop another 8-10% after, and possibly another 3-5% in the days after that.

So in some way you are right that \"everyone who wanted one got one\".\n\nI think people are butting up against the realities that america does not invest in it's infrastructure in any way, shape, or form (unless it's adding one more lane bro, just one more lane i promise) and trying to make an EV work for a significant portion of the population is no-go.\n\nRight now it's pretty much exclusively for home-owners out in the suburbs with a 3-car garage and only commuting a relatively short distance to their boring office job and back.   It's just not feasible for people who rent or live in row-housing with street-parking only, or those with long commutes. Most offices don't have chargers so it's basically hoping its small enough that you can charge at home, which again, not everyone has.\n\nPublic chargers are also getting vandalized writ large right now, there's been tons of people trying to strip out the wire or just fucking them up for funsies.  Ones installed at like WF or whatever are constantly broken or there's only like 2. The sad reality is gas is just too convenient for the average American.\n\nTeslas have their own major issues too because insuring them is higher because any damage is basically a total and having QA issues. Resale value is plummeting.\n\nMuch like VR, the novelty has died once reality set in and the cart came before the horse.

Economy cars and Prius suddenly got super popular around the 2008 oil spike, if we had mass market EVs those would have been popular too.\n\n\nPeople spending at the high end dgaf about gas prices and will buy whatever they think is cool - maybe EVs aren't cool and futuristic and climate virtue signaling with your 8000 lb electric SUV is out of style. That's a headwind because Tesla had a very desirable image for a long time.\n\n\nWe're going to slam up against the limits of the ancient electric grid pretty soon.

New 2025 Camry is hybrid only and seems to be a nice car.\n\n\nIf Trump gets elected he'll probably stall the CAFE changes, yet again.

I think we're definitely heading toward $10/gallon gas soon, perhaps by 2030.\n\nWe're at all time high production right now but only because we're rapidly depleting the permian basin --  which is a one-time shot of adrenaline to keep production up. It doesn't have nearly that big of volume of sweet and only being drilled for lack of other options.  And at the same time Biden has been depleting the strategic petroleum reserve (which is still falling!) to keep gas prices low.  What happens when we can't dump the SPR anymore and the permian production falls?\n\nBut yeah at the same time we don't have chargers (worse, all the grants are to install *NEW* chargers but no money to maintain them, so once they break/get vandalized, that's it).  We don't have enough substations and high kv capacity, and our actual production facilities were basically all built in like 1940-1960.  Even if we started now (which we still aren't), it's going to be a decade+ before that capacity gets online. \n\nNo amount of rising gas prices is going to make people buy an EV if they literally cannot charge them.
