                      "body": "First and foremost my advice would be to mind your career and set yourself up for old age. Investing is not income. It doesn't come with any benefits nor does it pay into social security benefits. You can't write off expenses and it doesn't have any of the other benefits that come with having a solid career. If you're not happy with your career, you'll need to figure out how to progress past that. After the housing crash, I went back to school and took on ~$250k in debt, which I managed to pay off within 5 years because of the investment I made into my education and career. \n\nOnce you start making enough money where you're not living paycheck to paycheck, you'll be in a better mindset where you can do long value plays and not worry about returns. ...or YOLOs and not worry about losses. \n\nAs far as strategies... You can pull out all money and wait for a big market dip and buy up value plays. That's the easiest lower risk recommendation I can give. ...but we just had a big dip recently so it may take a while for the next to pop up. You're down to your last bit of cash, so it sounds like you didn't have any risk management strategies in place. I'd brush up on those or thinking of some ways to mitigate losses in the future when you're caught on the wrong side of a trade. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't waste time trying to day trade or gambling on earnings if you're down to your last bit of cash. I'd think longer term, which means doing research and finding beat down companies or small to mid caps that are undervalued. Also, I'd stick to equities as they're more forgiving than options where you have to target expiration dates and fighting Theta decay. \n\nBest of luck.",
