  "selftext": "I met with my FA yesterday, and nowadays I hope I am asking much wiser and more pertinent questions. His assertion is that stocks have changed drastically in the last decade or so and that sentiment is lot more important now.\n\nI'm not certain I agree. With more information, it's true markets can react faster, but the buy and hold strategy still holds water in most circumstances (even he agrees) which is a fundamentals-driven one.\n\nI thought I'd ask here for more opinions and information relating to that view.

In the grand scheme of things I think it's just better and easier to focus on bogleheads mainly as there is less noise and while earnings may not be as high as hype stocks, your loss will also be minimised while making investing more of a simple process without overthinking.",
