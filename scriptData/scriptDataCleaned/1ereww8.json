Maybe too easy.\n\nWe might get lucky though, but I also think any bad data, anything that might indicate problems with jobs, economy, inflation or whatever, could bring this down to SPY at 510-520 again in a matter of days.\n\nI sure hope this was the dip, and I would really like to buy it, but I'm not entirely convinced yet.  \n  \nToday felt like a low volume pump, but there's CPI, jobless claims and Walmart earnings this week, I think I'll wait and see how that goes?   \n  \nI sure hope it's all good, I'd much prefer a bull market than several more weeks of crap.",
