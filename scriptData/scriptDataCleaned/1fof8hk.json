                          "body": "i would recommend to put the charts for XRT, gamecock and chewy all together in one full chart view via tradingview. If you compare the charts for the two stocks, you can see that there is a pattern repeating itself for over 3 years now, with both of them moving in tandem most of the time but also a re-occuring pattern where both mirror the spikes of each other but in opposite direction (one goes down, one goes up). XRT also mirrors that but it's switching who is moving along with the XRT chart and who of them is moving in the opposite direction until they come back and start to move together again - until this repeats. gamecock should move up a little bit more, than have another (but smaller) drop, then come back again, have a big drop and then a kind of parabolic move up in the near future. i really recommend to have a look for yourself. i put them three up in one chart and set the it to \"regular\" within chart settings. you should be able to see it quite clearly, especially the occurence of said pattern between november 2022 and  march 2023 is very good to recognize.",
