  "selftext": "> Starbucks (SBUX) missed the mark on revenue and same-store sales growth yet again.\n\n> Q3 revenue fell 1% to $9.1 billion, lower than expectations of $9.20 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\n> Global same-store sales declined for the second quarter in a row, down 3%, while overall foot traffic fell 5%.\n\n> Adjusted earnings per share did come in slightly higher at $0.93, compared to estimates of $0.92.\n\n> Same stores sales declined 2% in the US.\n\n> The size of the average check was up a tad higher, up 2%, due to menu price increases.\n\n> Its second-largest market, China saw the biggest drop of all Starbucks segments. Same-store sales fell 14%, compared to last quarter when they were down 11%. Foot traffic there fell 7% and so did the average check size.\n\n\n\n\n",

              "body": "I have friends in China I don’t know anyone who gives a shit about the patriotism thing. Like maybe some people care about it but definitely not enough to move the needle.\n\nSome Americans want to believe that the Chinese people dislike America and American businesses but that’s really not a good reflection of reality. \n\nThe reality is that Luckin Coffee figured out that they can’t compete with the “whole big fancy coffee shop” business model and basically changed all of their stores to small footprint to-go places, thus lowering operating cost and able to offer much cheaper drinks.\n\nAnd their menu is better localized, offering everything from green tea to rosemary latte to boba drinks. \n\nWhen I go to China I never go to Starbucks anymore because Luckin’s offering is just better and cheaper. \n\nHell, I would bet most of this sub would too if they can try them side by side.\n\nEdit: This NBC article is a good read on the coffee scene in China. The market has evolved quickly and Starbucks simply failed to keep up: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna144402\n\nSo basically on the high end China has many great local boutique coffee shops now, and on the low end there are places like Luckin, so Starbucks is in a weird place that just isn’t seen as special like before.",

Inflation measures the rate of increase, and a smaller increase on a higher baseline is still noticeable.\n\nAlso, inflation is an aggregate measure. If the price of a product you shop for regularly is up 4%, but another product you don't shop for hasn't risen at all, your experience of inflation may be worse than average.\n\n>Microsoft took a dump, McDonald's took a dump.\n\nMcDonalds is down around 10% in the past 6 months. They were slammed by inflation early on, so today's bad news was kind of priced in. Microsoft's drop is part of the whole \"maybe AI is overhyped\" moment.\n\nOverall, 78 per cent of S&P 500 companies that have reported so far have reported a positive EPS surprise, and 60 per cent of the same companies have posted positive revenue surprises.\n\n>The cards will fall and when they do it won't be pretty.\n\nStocks are still overvalued historically, and we are probably due for a recession, but I don't anticipate a bloodbath, just an overdue correction.
