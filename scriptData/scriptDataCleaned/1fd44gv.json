  "selftext": "Oracle shares rose 9% in extended trading on Monday after the database software vendor reported fiscal first-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates.\n\nHere is how the company did compared to LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.32 expected\n\nRevenue: $13.31 billion vs. $13.23 billion expected\n\nOracle’s revenue increased 8% from $12.45 billion a year ago, according to a statement. Net income rose to $2.93 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $2.42 billion, or 86 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nAt its after-hours price of about $153, Oracle is on pace to reach a record on Tuesday. The stock’s highest close to date was $145.03 in July. Prior to the report, Oracle was up about 34% so far this year, compared to the S&P 500′s 15% gain.\n\nFor the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 8 to 10%, CEO Safra Catz said on the earnings call. Analysts were expecting growth of close to 9%, according to LSEG. The company sees adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of 1.45 to $1.49. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.47 per share.\n\nThe company said its cloud services and license support business generated $10.52 billion in revenue. That was up 10% from a year earlier and higher than the StreetAccount consensus of $10.47 billion.\n\nOracle’s cloud and on-premises license segment had $870 million in revenue, up 7%, and more than StreetAccount’s $757.6 billion consensus.\n\nRevenue from cloud infrastructure came to $2.2 billion, up 45%. That is an acceleration from the prior quarter, during which revenue went up 42%.\n\n“Demand continued to outstrip supply” of consumption-based cloud infrastructure, Catz said on the call.\n\nDuring the quarter, Oracle announced the opening of a second cloud region in Saudi Arabia and said its database software will be available through Google’s public cloud.\n\nIn a separate statement on Monday, Oracle said it would partner with cloud infrastructure market leader Amazon Web Services to enable its database services on dedicated hardware.\n\nExecutives will issue guidance and discuss the results with analysts on a conference call starting at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/09/oracle-orcl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html",
