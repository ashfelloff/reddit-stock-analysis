  "score": 3223,
  "selftext": "So I was digging around and found out that Prabhakar Raghavan, the head of Google Search, used to be the head of search at Yahoo from 2005 to 2012. And let me tell you, it's not a pretty story.\nDuring his time at Yahoo, the company's search market share PLUMMETED from 30.4% to 13.4%. Yeah, you read that right - it was a FREE FALL. And it's not like he was just a bystander, he was in charge of research and development for Yahoo's search and ads products. But wait, it gets better. Under his leadership, Yahoo's search market share DECLINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS.\nAnd to top it all off, Yahoo had its LARGEST LAYOFFS IN CORPORATE HISTORY at the time, cutting nearly 2,000 jobs.\nIs this a risk to GOOG long-term healthy growth? Have they started prioritizing short-term ad revenue over user experience, flooding search results with spam and ads to inflate earnings? Are we seeing a repeat of Yahoo's mistakes?\n",

By the time it got listed on the stock exchanges the largest shareholder was Masayoshi Son. \n\nIf you want to shit on Yang then shit on him and Son spending more of their time trying to corner the JP market and investing in Alibaba than fighting Google for supremacy in the US (they weren't going to win anyways). One reason why Yahoo was even able to exist for so long was because they had diversified and invested into China early. They had a large stake of Alibaba shares. Problem was that they sold their BABA stocks too early rather than to double down and put a leash on Jack Ma's dumb ass from getting too cocky.",

Homogeneous, boring results, often barely matching the real search intent, but obviously trying to please with mediocre, but \"safe\" results. Nothing wrong with getting rid of the affiliate shitter sites that hauted the search results in some industries, but it's the smaller, expert sites that suffered, too.\n\nIt's almost like \"Hey, let's display shitty mainstream results only, so more people click on ads.\" Which may be a clever strategy to increase ad clicks, but if people don't find what they are looking for longer term, they will switch search engines at some point.\n\nEven worse: With only popular and superficial content getting high visibility, it endangers a proper opinion formation.
