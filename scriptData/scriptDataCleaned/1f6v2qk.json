I worked for a retailer that actually got a little bit of praise every now and then for taking care of their workers (at least compared to how shit most retailers treat workers). And this was back in the logbook days so there was no online scheduling, everyones schedule was in a log book and you reviewed the book to see what shifts you were scheduled to work. The old timers always worked the same hours, everyone else was typically moved around. But even the old timers who had preferential treatment, I remember seeing their scheduled shifts and they always recorded the total hours at the end and it was always 39.5 hours a week, just below what they would be required to give benefits.\n\nI even remember for us part timers, they did not care if we clocked in early or left late or whatever. I remember some days I would be there an hour after closing if not more. But the old timers who were scheduled 39.5 hours, when their shift end time hit they were basically shoo'd out the door so they do not accidentally pass 40 hours in a week.",

It was usually light cleaning because they did it everyday. \n\nNow it’s about lower overhead so it’s 1 maid cleaning XXX number of rooms that haven’t been touched in 4-7 days. Their paycheck isn’t consistent because the majority can’t clock in ~Mon - Wed when nobody requests cleaning and the 1 or 2 who get to work are extremely overworked. Or worse, they are forced to come in just incase and get sent home after an hour. They have to perform quickly because any other hungry maid on staff will if they don’t. That person will get paid instead. Every room they clean always needs a 100% reset on linens/towels/trash, vacuum etc. \n\nPeople are gross in hotels. It’s often a lot of work and they don’t know until check out who had a coke fueled rager and wrecked the room, doesn’t matter. Airbnb charges when guests don’t clean, while hotels don’t differentiate. Therefore a much higher concentration of dirty dirtballs use hotels these days. All rooms need to be cleaned at break neck speed. It’s been rough for maids.",
