Besides that marketing/ad revenue can be a real show stopper to continue growing if done right (cough meta and google)\n\nI do see that the valuation is a bit rich with a p/s of 10x compared to something like meta and it's been around for 19 years so ita questionable if they can actually grow the way they should post ipo to be profitable.\n\nImo the reach for new users will continue to grow faster and faster thanks to their agreement with Google and OpenAi. \n\nIn addtion, there's a level of a distruptive/moat advantage considering this is the message board of the internet for all things. There's nothing quiet like this platform.\n\nI suspect most will think of rddt as a speculative overvalued stock but I wanted to get a take from the folks on this subreddit.\n\nWhat do you think?  Is Reddit a worthy long term hold?",

      "body": "Reddit right now is overvalued. But then again everything is. If we do a little crude extrapolation from user numbers based on twitter user numbers and market cap, Reddit market cap would be hovering around 8 billion with its current user number. I bought around then and I still find good reasons to buy into it now even when overvalued cuz I will be holding for the long term (+5 years).\n\nFor a social media website it dominates the forum sphere and I doubt we will see anyone compete against it. Many have tried and failed miserably (looking at last year api Reddit revolution). + Management has set up measures to never have these kind of risks occur again (limiting mod powers...).\n\nFrom a complete non bias user perspective (mobile user since 2016) Reddit has definitely improved despite what most Redditors are saying. Video loading is good among other things, much less lag overall. The user experience has improved tremendously. And you can see it clearly once Reddit decided to target mobile users. The reaction from Reddit users is the same as YouTube when it went through its ad friendly phase. Old users hated it, but in the grand scheme of things, their opinions was meaningless (they still use the website)\n\nRedditors hate the CEO. But objectively speaking he has done more to \"improve\" the platform in the few years vs the entirety of Reddit without him. \n\nFurthermore, Reddit finds itself in a perfect timing situation, twitter is stagnating and Reddit and Twitter users share a large userbase with Reddit being in the ramp up phase. 99% of Reddit and Twitter users are lurkers, and content on twitter is not great when it's dependant on famous figures for content. While I don't think Reddit will ever replace twitter, it definitely has advantages over it / completes it. \n\nThe demographic for twitter is largely conservative and Reddit is largely liberal. That's an entire demographic that is not targetted by twitter. That's by the nature of Reddit being more community oriented with upvote downvote vs twitter focusing on the individual. But Reddit can find ways to have more individualism. I can imagine Reddit having verified users who can post on a different tab that people would love to follow (especially since it's current follow system is garbage. Why do they make following a two step process when it could be done in one? Why prioritise blocking or chatting over following when clicking on a user's avatar??).\n\nReddit also has the advantage that the content it generates is unique when compared to other platforms. It has its fair share of unique posts, but also has the unique attribute that it can parasite content from other platforms. Think of subreddit like r/twitter for example.\n\nReddit also has a richer relationship with content in general. For e.g,  Reddit has a strong opportunity to fortify it's sports/gaming forums. If you look at any sports related content you will find user engagement like no other.\n\nI also believe that monetization will be easier on Reddit compared to the likes of twitter which pretty much never saw profits. Monetization is easier by the nature of subreddits. Despite its current lackluster ad targeting, they are trying to find ways to improve. They acquired AI ad targetting tech recently. + Its much easier to learn from the mistakes of other companies. \n\nSpeaking of AI, Reddit is a gold mine for data. Since Reddit is not part of any other larger conglomerate, the likes of Google/Microsoft will be able to buy the data the user generates. Reddit is an unrestricted supplier of training data. It's already happening with open AI buying data to train chatgpt.\n\nThe mathematical analysis for reddit user growth is based on a logistic curve. If we compare any user growth of social medias. The growth, assuming no population ceiling, is around 25-30% (based on twitter and Facebook trend). Aka you can expect the current user growth of any social medias in its early stage to move at that rate yearly. I assumed Reddit will have a max logged-in users population cap around 500-600 million (based on twitter user growth trend assuming no user drop from poor management aka twitter).\n\nIt's hard to price Reddit based on earnings since we have very low data and typically companies like these consistently lose money until they don't. But people never cared about twitter earnings and it still went up in price.\n\nAt worst the current price of Reddit won't move much for the 1-2 years. But I definitely have the minimal expectation that Reddit will 3x if you give it more than 7 years.  And that's a better return than the average of the S&P. So it's good enough for me.\n\nWill Reddit ever have a larger userbase than tiktok/shorts/instagram? Never. People who use Reddit need to be literate and have a better attention span. But Reddit is still pretty addictive with the infinite scroll brainrot.\n\nConclusion: Reddit may be overvalued now but it doesn't matter if you hold it long term. You may not see much return in the next year at its current price but you sure as hell would have wished you bought some shares 7 year from now. Good user growth and it has a lot of room user experience/monetization to improve on.",

It makes me nervous though with the NSFW reliance and potential for competition. Though, more people I talk to, the more they seem to be using Reddit. I think the option gives me good upside expire to the positives but doesn’t commit me to a long term stock position if the trade doesn’t work out.

Twitter, Snap, etc are cautionary tales.\n\nSome folks will make the AI argument however let me dispel it. First, licensing your data will never be as lucrative as monetizing it yourself, which Reddit has so far been unable to do after 19 years. Second, Google can and will pull the rug from under Reddit at any time. Right now the licensing agreement is a double win for Reddit: Google pays for their data and gets them more traffic which Reddit can sell to advertisers. What happens when Google no longer wants the data or is unwilling to pay Reddit’s price? Third, others like Google, Anthropic, Open AI, etc are better positioned on AI and will eventually attract traffic away from Reddit. \n\nAlso keep in mind Reddit’s stock performance is a bit misleading.
