  "selftext": "I think this is going to happen between August September and pot stocks are going to rocket. Election is coming and dems need a win. It’s a bipartisan issue because most republican voters support legalization as well as all Dems. If Biden can push rescheduling across the finish line before the election it will boost him in the polls, same with Kamala if Biden is replaced. Rate cuts are a boost for pot stocks as well. All of this looks like it’s going to be happening in the fall so I’m loading now. ",
