Google, Amazon, apple, Samsung, Qualcomm, Amd, Intel, Microsoft, Meta, Netflix, Moderna, etc, just who exactly do you think is powering all these companies Amd their data centers and all their other endeavors? It’s Nvidia. We have not even came close to scratching the surface of what a.I is capable of and how it will impact the entire world. \n\nYou might say “Amd is catching up” I can assure you they are not, not even close. \nWhile AMD was focusing on the core wars for gaming with Intel, Nvidia was laying down the ground work for the future for the last 30 years, it’s going to take so long to catch up to Nvidia that when companies finally do catch up, Nvidia will be the gold standard, it will be so intertwined with companies servers, data centers and just their whole ecosystem that no one will want to use anything else.\n\nPeople think a.I is a bubble but not even close, as more time goes on, more announcements will come on the future of a.I and it’s implications that more people will want to longer term invest.\n\nThis is also why I’m long on TSM, as all these other companies battle for dominance in the space TSM are the ones selling the shovels to the gold diggers.
