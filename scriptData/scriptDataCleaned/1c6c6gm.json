  "selftext": "First spike is from videogame store gain. I realized Iâ€™m better off investing long term buy and hold, so I withdrawn all my money so thatâ€™s the flat line for awhile. Graduated college in May 2023. I decided to put back $5k from scholarship surplus into the market. I won and lost some but starting 2024, around this time my risk management was very well. Stoploss and 10% gain and Iâ€™m out. that $5k quickly turn into $27k. My ego got a lil hyped I guess. So one day I dropped $10k on 0DTE and it didnt turn out so well. Ever since, Iâ€™ve just been so stupid and too emotional. I think this is it for me. Itâ€™s been great knowing everyone and the emotional roller coaster I have experienced. ",
