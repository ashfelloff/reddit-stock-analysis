  "selftext": "\nThe fear and greed index is meant to interpret investor sentiment. In recent memory the index has only dropped this low once. In October 2023 the fear index flashed a 21. Which is classified as extreme fear. The Dow dropped about 5% and had a minor pullback. Similar to what we are seeing now. In the following 10 months the Dow rallied 20%. The market has to pullback a healthy amount of times to prevent extreme greed levels. \n\nProjecting the Dow to hit $43,000+ within the coming year. This is a minor pullback not a recession. Buy at a discount now",

He sold Apple to reduce the portfolio weighting of Apple so that if it goes up, yay, and if it doesn't, it doesn't have a big impact on BRK's book value.\n\nThe other thing is Buffet wants to build more cash towards future sweet deals, should they show themselves. He (or his team) might end up being wrong (and they have been plenty of times even in the last decade) but only time will tell.\n\nAnother thing is Japan hiking interest rates means paying off their yen-denominated bonds becomes more expensive. So they may opt to reduce their exposure to debt denominated in JPY while it is still cheap to do so.\n\nHell, if the interest rate hike means the market value of the bonds fall, they could just buy them back cheaper than the face value.",
