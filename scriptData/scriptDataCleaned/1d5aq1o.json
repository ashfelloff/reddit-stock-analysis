So is traceable, but one day it will step change from this longe term range and you’ll miss out.\n\nIt is still a young company with so so so much runway. \n\nRisk is non collateralized personal loans, but that’s offset with a high earning clientele. \n\nI have roughly 650 shares and a ~$7.00 DCA. I have a 30 year window and expect SOFI to be a 10 bagger in that time.",

      "body": "Can't really compare sofi to large banks.  \n\nSince most large bank collect money from consumers and still pay less than 1% on savings accounts, there's a 400+ basis point arbitrage they can take advantage of.   Basically they deposit money with the fed, get 5.25 and pay out under 1.   That's pure profit for them.  \n\nSofi on the other hand pays out a higher interest rate to depositors, so their arbitrage is closer to 100-150basis points.  \n\nWhat customer deposits do you get you is the ability to loan out that amount and get paid an interest on the loan.  But again, sofi is primarily making personal loans averaging about 30k that are not likely collateralized and are more prone to default should the economy see a recession.   This again is different that big banks who are making loans based on a brick and mortar asset (I.e. hoise) that can be liquidity should the bank need its money or a business that has revenue.  \n\nSofi does have some new tech that it plans to expand, Galileo or as some here refer to it as \"aws of fintech\" but on the balance sheet that's still a much smaller business than personal loans.  Once they does take off, I would start to increase my position.  \n\nI'm a bag holder with an average around $8 but I'm not buying back in until I see some of these Galileo  plays pan out.  \n\nSofi is a bank on paper, but it operates much differently than the \"big boys\".",

          "body": "The thing I'd add to this is that the bigger banks are all holding long term bonds and mortgages from when interest rates were near 0. So their actual 'arbitrage' (NIM) is actually much lower than SOFI's at the moment. It's also part of the reason why big banks won't offer higher interest on deposits.\n\nSOFI's NIM is around 6%, while most of the big banks are around 3%. Part of the reason is, as you've said, SOFI's loans are inherently riskier. But they're also more profitable from a margin perspective as long as we don't see a major spike in defaults.",
