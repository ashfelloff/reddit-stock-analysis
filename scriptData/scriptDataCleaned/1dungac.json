  "selftext": "Before the bulls start thrashing me, I just want to say I don't do any shorting of Tesla. \n\nLong term Tesla is a great stock to own if we're patient, as it stands given the current momentum it feels like it'll be short-lived and we'll be back to the low 170s. \n\nWith the robotaxi reveal just less than a month away the stock will continue to pump, but as the quote from intelligent investor says, \"An intelligent investor is someone who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists\" this pump up to robotaxi reveal feels that way. Which is artificial. \n\nI'm not anti Elon. I'm not anti Tesla. I admire what elon has achieved and love Tesla as a company. But to any small retail investors that are holding the stock out there, do give this a thought. \n\nWhat does the community overall think about Tesla stock price?. Is it going only up now? Or below 180s, 170s level is gone forever?. \n\n",

I think you got the W. Put that into VOO/VTI/TLT and you're worry free. I just wonder how you deal with the thought if TSLA becoming the next AAPL over the next 5-10 years where the market goes up but TSLA just outperforms again and again and again. \n\nI sometimes hear about folks selling their AMZN/MSFT/NVDA however long ago for a 15%/150%/5x gain only to see those stocks keep rallying without them being able to get back in. I suspect the reason why few get back in is because there is a psychological logic block against you. If you sold at $200 then you already thought it was overpriced and have to have the awareness to reassess while accepting the new thesis regarding the company's fundamentals and story. Doubly hard for those to buy back in if they sold at $200, it goes to $400 but drops to like $300. At that point, the individual will not only have to reassess the company only to jump back in at a higher price but also get over their own ego in admitting the messed up their prior sale call.\n\nI usually don't sell so I don't have that problem. My ego/personal problems stem from holding TOO long. I should have sold more of that TWTR when it was at $80 instead of hodling down to the low $30s to get bailed out by Elon. My biggest wins in LVMUY/GOOG/AXP were massive wins because I held, but some of my biggest Ls like INTC/T/BABA are also because I held too long.",

If you’re long-term holder, the reason you buy a company is because you believe in their vision and in a direction and it’s hard to walk away from companies that you feel strongly about even if they start going down just like fantasy football if you start drafting players that you really like, and they don’t perform, but you refuse to trade them or release them. It’s because you get attached to those players/stocks. I’ve never sold a stock. I lost huge gains recently with CELH with that massive almost 50% pullback in a month.

You’re basically trying to predict the short term turbulence of the market.\n\nRobotaxi reveal could skyrocket the stock depending how advanced the program is.\n\nI look at all the stocks I own the same way.\n\n1. I understand the technology, the management teams strategy, the mission, and ultimate markets.\n\n2. I believe they are all long term massive growth stocks. I believe in the underlying tech, the logic used for future strategies, and the management teams.\n\n3. Given #1 and #2, I always remind myself that it’s not about the stock price today, it’s about the future stock price. This makes it about QTY of shares vs stock price.\n\n4. Given #3, I don’t try to time dips and profit taking. I buy more than I may have originally otherwise planned on dips at that particular time, but mostly I am simply trying to add to my position since I can never foresee when it might significantly rise or fall.\n\nThe logic of #4 goes like this. If I sell high to try to buy back low, I am always risking my future QTY of shares being lower than it is today if I cannot buy back in lower. The future price is static while the current price is fluid. All my decisions are staked on future price.\n\n5. Due to #4, I don’t think of gains/losses based on todays stock price, but again on future stock price. If stock price is estimated 2500 at some point in the future, a 30% rise or fall in a stock price today of 200 is only 2% variation of future price.\n\nNo. 5 makes it easy to justify buying and/or not selling when it has just risen even if I fully expect a dip.\n\nThese are my investment principles. I’ll let you know in 15 years how it works out. (this played out for me personally on a smaller scale when I put $1000 into Tesla when I was 15 in 2010, sold in college due to other priorities).",

From 2014-2019, I wasn't making anything on TSLA. Then 2020-2021 happened and I made 15x my ROI. Investing can and tend to work like that for many companies. This is why you just hold and stay patient. Unless you desperately need the money, I'd implore you to hold. If you see better opportunities elsewhere, by all means, take your profit and do so.\n\nI think people are missing the blockbuster report by Tesla.\n\nTesla has shown resiliency. They have been able to cut prices and stay competitive despite the EV difficulties in the global economy. This shows that when these difficulties dissipate, who do you think benefits the most? Tesla, because they're the only ones capable of being profitable selling pure EV's.\n\nBut the BIGGEST thing people missed is energy. It is 2.3x higher than it was in Q1. Energy storage will have higher margins than Tesla's auto business for the next few years, IMO.. I'm expecting $3-4 billion profit on their energy for this year. They are expected to have a megapack factory in China to be operational next year. There is over a billion $ in Tesla's energy storage profit that isn't yet recognized because of accounting reasons that Tesla could book as 100% profit this year as the contingencies are met. I am very bullish on Tesla Energy. It is playing a very significant role for Tesla and is largely being discounted by people who are just focused on vehicle sales.\n\nWhat intrigues me is people are going to blame the stock price on Elon's politics. When it's going up, no one talks about the politics but Elon is tweeting more than ever. When it's going down, it's Elon's fault. People have to understand that investors DO NOT care what Elon is tweeting about. They care about Tesla's performance. And Tesla has performed well this year despite the turmoil. I think if you are going to sell, I would try timing it before Q3 when projections are expected to increase and after the 8/8 wave. For me, I'm holding for decades. One simple question I always ask when I invest into a company, do I trust that other companies will be more innovative than the company I plan to invest in? And I can't find many, if any, that will compete against Tesla. You can hate the guy all you want but results matter. How quickly you innovate matters. What you are innovating matters. And many companies are not being ran for innovation the way Tesla is.",

This requires an extremely high level of AI and sensor reliability under pretty much any condition.\n\nI think that level of reliability is still a decade out at a minimum and will require many more hardware revisions, including likely bringing back radar to cut through rain, snow, and fog. Even with that, it's extremely difficult to imagine AI getting good enough to replicate the human intuition that us human drivers use every day to judge what other people are going to do and drive defensively. \n\nI think Musk is being bullheaded and blind to what is actually required to make this work.",

I also tend to shy away from hype stocks in general, though, because I'd rather not spend my energy trying to guess people's whims, which I feel is an important component of buying/selling those kinds of companies.\n\nAll that said, I do acknowledge that the potential for further growth is certainly there. Robotaxis, if they work (and that's a big if), could be a lucrative new category. Similarly, if self-driving technology ever gets to a point where it's deemed safe to operate even without a licensed driver behind the wheel (which would seem to be necessary for any kind of robotaxi), then that would be a huge benefit for me personally. I don't have a driver's license, in large part because I'm not comfortable with the prospect due to an eye condition, so if in the future there exists a car I'd be allowed to operate without one, then that'd be a potential game-changer for me.\n\nHowever, Musk tends to overpromise, so it's one of those things where I'll believe it when I see it.",

Wait until FY2024 earnings come out I bet it’s not pretty..\n\nRobotaxi??  Yea maybe coming soon in California and a couple other places but the vast majority of places aren’t close to allowing such a thing AND even if they were fine with the autonomous driving the politics of it and what it means to the workforce and an the gig workers might hold it back beyond the autonomous vehicle regulations.  Uber and Lyft I’m sure will have a legion of lobbyists trying to keep it on the sideline..",

The market is not just that large. The market would be Hertz, Avis or Uber who could finance a fleet but even then who wants to be driven anywhere? The promise of AI is frantically overrated. Who will trust that getting into a robotaxi will get them to where they want to go safely and in decent time? Why would they not be objects of abuse?\nHow many Americans outside of the major cities have even been in a taxi more than once in the last two years?\nLastly, how will they keep them smelling of piss and vomit?",
