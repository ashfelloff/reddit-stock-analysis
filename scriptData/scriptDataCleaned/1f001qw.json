The richest, largest companies simply have way more in assets that generate more interest which they then leverage to buy up more assets and continue to grow at a far faster and larger rate than anyone else can hope to compete with unless they get very, very lucky. \n\n(I'm basically agreeing with you, it's just that IMO the way to maximize revenue is buy up assets.)",

It would be slower for sure but it would also still grow. \n\nThen that tax would have to be managed properly because it doesn't do anyone any good if the tax money goes to contracts to these same big corporations that have always milked the government and therefore us and became the very vessels which destroy the middle class.",

You probably live in a high tax VHCOL state (probably CA, NY, MA, etc). Just from income taxes, you’re now down to 600k (50k/month — I’m rounding so fuck off if you’re going to play accountant and argue with me about the exact numbers). \n\nNow, let’s say you are young and want the American dream (house, dog, 2-3 kids, and a husband/wife). To buy a mediocre shit box house in an expensive area at 2m-2.5m at 6% interest, you’re probably looking at PITI payments of 13-15k/month. Over 30 years you will have paid off a 2m house, great (now you’re down to 35k/month).\n\nNow 2 kids with childcare in VHCOL is easily 3-5k/month. Let’s throw in another 1-2k per month in other expenses and/or college savings. Now you’re at 27k/month.\n\nLet’s say you want to max out your 401ks and Roth accounts - you’re probably at around 20k/month now. \n\nStudent loan payments? 3-5k/month for a few years perhaps. \n\nNow pay your grocery bills, your vacation bills, your lifestyle creep fancy car bills, and you could easily be at 10k/month left over.\n\nYes, you are living a comfortable life with some excesses.

This is because those who make the money will seek to expand and preserve it and then pass it on to the next generation. You then end up with a situation where who is in charge is not determined by meritocracy but rather who your parents are. Those wealthy aristocrats then are incentivized to prevent social mobility so people with more merit then them cannot compete with them (because they are meritless having on achieved power and wealth due to who their parents are).\n\nThere have been several events over the last 250 years that have prevented thIs from happening and reset the playing board. \n\n1. Revolutionary war (old aristocracy destroyed, new ones established with a new dynamic system).\n\n2. Civil war. Southern aristocracy destroyed and massive social change that disrupted transfer of wealth to next generation.\n\n3. Industrial revolution created new class of wealthy and flipped the playing board on the old money. This created opportunities for workers to rise based on their merit. \n\n4. World wars, great depression and new deal socialism gutted many traditional aristocratic families and once again shuffled the playing board. This led to the largest middle class in history in the 50s-70s. \n\n5. Information revolution again helped to shuffle the playing board and led to a new class of wealthy people entering the system. \n\nThe difference is in this cycle that\n\n1. Traditional wealthy class were not disrupted much by the information revolution and many actually gained from it as well. \n\n2. Worker class gains were concentrated in the top 10-20% of workers that are highly educated and can work in technology. \n\n3. New class of tech billionaires and aristocrats are now seeking to cement their control over information, power, and capitol to prevent the same social mobility helped them rise up. Just look at Elon musk, Jack Dorsey, Peter theil etc. there is a reason they all support Republicans who will give them more power and favor the wealthy aristocracy vs workers. \n\nTL;DR the middle class is now just the tech workers in the top 10-20% of the economy and everyone else is fucked. If you want to fix it then we need to aggressively target the aristocracy to transfer their wealth and make sure it doesn't pass down to their next generation if we want to ensure a return to meritocracy.",
