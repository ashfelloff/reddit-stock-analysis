I remembered that about 2 years ago I made a joke about high school fashion and she informed me that A&F is “cool again” and she even ordered some stuff from them online. A&F is up ~400% since we had this conversation.\n\nSo today I’m telling her about this article and how she was way ahead of that, then I asked if there are any other brands that are resurgent at the moment.\n\nHer answer was yes… Coach.\n\nThus, I will be loading up on TPR options tomorrow morning, possibly even a YOLO. Earnings 8/15.\n",

Turned out it was incredibly high lol. This was like a week after they introduced new chicken tenders to menu. I even had a few managers admit to me on the phone that they’d discovered that this same thing had happened multiple times in a few shifts over the week.  \n\nI was sure it was going to blow up on them. \n\nNever happened.
