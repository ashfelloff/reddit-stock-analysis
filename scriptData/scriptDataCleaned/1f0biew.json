The space business is a new part of a company that is too big and important to fail. So, the space part is not exactly in the argument to be nationalized.\n\nI think overall though that the argument of nationalization is not even the issue here, more of capital market regulation. Intel has been the biggest player and as such it has become far and lazy, while others have done their best at finding their niche and being really good at it. When regulation allows and incentivizes short term gains that’s what you’ll get. Share buybacks, unlimited bonuses, mismanagement such as not focusing on R&D but on cutting costs (cutting corners) outsourcing etc etc. All that is going to doom especially the basically uncontested market leaders. Once competition is there, Boeing, Intel and so on will have forgotten how to be an agile and innovating business.",

I'm always blown away at the lack of actual thought by people who make such dumb arguments. It's like someone you think is smart said something you assumed is smart, so you just fucking repeat it so other dumb people might think you are smart.  \n\nNationalization is horrific and leads to terrible outcomes when tried in countries with more than 10 million people.  Any good example of it will be in small countries that don't produce innovation. Big countries that do it only innovate in inhumane conditions, and rarely give two fucks about human life.\n\nThis will get down voted for sure, but this sub, and reddit in general, have never been accused of having smart people. Please, for the love of God, Try thinking before you say such patently stupid things.\n\nBefore anyone replies to this, you might say NASA is proof of the concept of nationalization. That's false, we went to the moon as a demonstration of military might during the cold war. They never made a shuttle not started during that time. \n\nAlso, if you are thinking you are arguing with me understand that you are arguing with air, I never read replies.",
