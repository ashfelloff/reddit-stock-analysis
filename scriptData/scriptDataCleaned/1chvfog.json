  "selftext": "“Sorry about you poor people. We’re very sorry”—-“but you will get dividends”-JPOW\n\nThe heck does that mean? Is that signaling some sort of government checks coming soon?\n\n\n“All this bullshit you’re talking about is priced in”-JPOW\n\nHuh? Did he really just signal that we’ve reached the top?\n\n\n“We are diverse, and have no clue what you regards are talking about”-JPOW\n\nThat made me giggle. \n\n\nIn conclusion, the body language of JPOW was not like I’ve ever seen before. Dude was nervous, finicky, and in a bad mood. Usually he’s much, much calmer and collective than this.",
