The fees paid by retailers to V and MC can now pass them on to consumers at checkout which could reduce credit card usage and hurt V and MC earnings. Now the litigation risk is real and how will it effect the stock price? It already lost $15.85 Tuesday.",

Problem solved.\n\nDon’t act like the DoJ is doing us “justice” by targeting companies. Their shitty lawsuits result in a one time fine and literally nothing ever changes after that.",
