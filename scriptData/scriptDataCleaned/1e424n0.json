They pioneered the EV look and continue to do so with the cybertruck as every other auto company continues to copy 10 steps behind them. They have charging stations all over the country and world being the only EV maker allowing reliable travel across the country, other EV manufacturers are being forced to make bargaining deals to use the tesla charging network. Tesla also has other ventures compared to legacy auto who only has cars. Tesla is setup to control the entire auto industry chain from manufacturing the car, running the FSD software in every personal vehicle, and delivery vehicle, to the charging network, to home energy with their solar roof  and battery wall technology. Not to mention other projects such as Optimus which we will continue to see more of as tesla evolves, you’re trying to place the value of the entire company on its cars when in reality that is only one sector and will continue to play less and less of a role as the company develops. I can’t say what will happen in the short time but in 10 years tesla will be a multi trillion dollar company.",
