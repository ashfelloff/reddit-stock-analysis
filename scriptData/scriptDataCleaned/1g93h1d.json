And more funds were long fossil fuels than were shorting oil, gas and coal.\n\nGeopolitics is the key reason why the energy transition theme isn't working out. China commands a dominant position in most of these sectors, and tariffs are spoiling the investment case.\n\nWith much of the supply chain for green technology now depending on China, the risk of a full-blown trade war targeting its products has become a direct threat to the financial appeal of clean energy, according to hedge fund managers interviewed by Bloomberg.\"",

Price of solar keeps continually [falling](https://ourworldindata.org/images/published/Price-of-electricity-new-renewables-vs-new-fossil-no-geo_1350.png) (86% decrease for solar and 26% increase for nuclear over last decade), that price is in LCOE, levelized cost of energy, **that measures cost of building the powerplant itself as well as ongoing costs for fuel and operating the powerplant over its lifetime.** All of these included, solar is FOUR times cheaper than nuclear. Oh, price of [storage continously falls too.  ](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/tumble-storage-battery-costs-boost-shift-renewables-says-iea-2024-04-25/)They both trend to dirt cheap.\n\nOn top of that, the durability and lifetime of solar panels has shown to be much longer than we expected. We thought that they would last 20-30 years but it turns out solar [panels last even longer.](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/282173/1-s2.0-S2212827122X00024/1-s2.0-S2212827122001317/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEDoaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDAalZt6ua3KJvDEXFUKsrzJ%2BZropY9%2BxcyNPS9x0ksDQIgTkYsZKfyUbUgotdFyZuHbMmfelsqo%2B%2BjJ7NfWphAYQYqvAUIov%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDJomMJ0nn7otS7LIoCqQBY3BbdKHJ0xDQKVnsEJTFGOuZFvsrAO5PoxfqkNNzmvFt2JxZjfX%2Ff%2FZKBhFtWCDySK2SYvu4Zu%2Bvfs2vKqcXt5g3Ad6igD9ljOnvZ0PnS%2Fi9QIVE6%2F9RWAEKqQfDGehYkignhKhVojC7gD7lU7KEyHp6QVsnTIfLL1jmwt80YIy2DCebEJrS63OUmcuaqJrNwiEIpsCNo2Ow5D0U69H1jOEynP6Fk%2Fv0TXgXWDQpoQysIJ3Udch%2BBnyd%2FVzqSovWg2OcrNkMu28A%2Bu9a7960%2BgNA%2Bvo%2FLdoh9GHXy%2FE14bozy6LWPhpdiZLVSnG%2BqFlj9zDkffAASZNDHsB6txlf9FuELuzqXdsQ9jE8QoBU8m9AXHkVYv%2B99hwqOwiEaScIumOwVFG1bZV%2BoDObOhY9vIuIeLb6rFsy7MXw2grLFGgICTjpmcTB7X8Jor1DUwcgYMCH1E55jPCCcS8feF6daCb6x11p2Jr61%2BqFtTwGDNx01b9dXRsiqIou%2FeU538EIhzAuqxOdPfT0CGpSa7aOPDcSwUz%2FtzVSVU6Y92IHh%2BwM2CUjxxNBjsCcjE%2Ficf0qEJUXA3SDEWmA54988qu1BGAt8BxQeoN939DZCVUB5lwpsajJv3DJyiKJtWXC7KZB5e%2BuPszKC8F7FKi8lKVg5JA6AGU4LU%2FgJRXOtFETO%2F6PL6eUs8VYT8kuA8FzAjUosZw3Gj7zBVqIJu2je5m%2Bcxi46ks9OqNHov9wAmfyd1GvZoqMHxf2Epi157bOIWaEYErcSRopsRWlY5Clviip9TpvlsQdjN5eN48NjmPPQNnH%2B8DdE69Ttij0ABxQ8WWEAPF2Nt26BtUXoLwQjxrjp4X08tXCefGzoMQRk8Fj4V6MNbb3bgGOrEBtvj5u4DMAS9UNJkTnDfZYieaIwg5%2BumZVc2yn0YLJcHa8mzCO2x0HsvL8eRq08i8OYca9DU1N0jwHv5dpT3ikgoSDQMdhIDqp%2BNTO9zbVbZ7qVN8l%2FHG48Y%2FLXsI%2F5HuqtQrz1jTVvWVp4VqECFqdwhUbcQpNXXenWahnAEMchIudr0tV00unFkWkOUt5PLy1JU7bgom6McywnmBdW0WoM%2FlUF32Qa%2BqhaMdGBKm6ikh&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20241022T094100Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYR3YYXLLO%2F20241022%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=231e036f720a7762d92aaed3edf62b6a6c728d80116afbb2cbceede85f269bcc&hash=5f4142045cf1aa6d40c2304e03748c7d39a58e50ee332a79ca12a4e2c591aeef&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S2212827122001317&tid=spdf-70976f21-f281-4a95-a7e4-e47447553d69&sid=daa86cff9036b04f146abc33356287300a04gxrqb&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=051c5b04515a5b555457&rr=8d6887717e6ab34b&cc=cz) All of that with minimum maintenance compared to operating a whole nuclear powerplant.\n\nThe nuclear energy costs has track record of overunning expected [budget and deadlines. ](https://www.gao.gov/blog/over-budget-and-delayed-whats-next-u.s.-nuclear-weapons-research-and-production-projects)Now the life span cost you talk about? France had to shut down [\"a record 26 of its 56 reactors are off-line for maintenance or repairs](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/15/business/nuclear-power-france.html)\". Imagine the complexity of building the nuclear powerplants and now think about maintaining and fixing them over the period of decades.\n\nTo give an example, [Georgia finished their nuclear powerplant **7 years late**, $17B **over** cost.](https://apnews.com/article/georgia-nuclear-power-plant-vogtle-rates-costs-75c7a413cda3935dd551be9115e88a64) This is very symptomatic for all nuclear energy projects. These construction and maintenance billions pilled up on each other.\n\nOne thing is basically building modular easy and cheap legos (solar) and the other is buidling a spaceshift.\n\nThere is absolutely no chance of solar being more expensive and there exists no data to base that statement upon, not even close.",
