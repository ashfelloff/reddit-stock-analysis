  "selftext": "**Bull Thesis on $MARA: A Comprehensive Analysis**\n\nHey everyone, I want to share my bull thesis on Marathon Digital Holdings ($MARA). This analysis is divided into two parts: fundamentals and technicals. Let’s dive in!\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\n1. **Strong Earnings Potential**:\n   * **Estimated EPS**: Based on Q1 earnings of $1.3 per share, the trailing twelve months (TTM) EPS is estimated to be at least $4 per share.\n   * **Current Valuation**: With a current share price around $20, this gives $MARA a Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio of 5.\n   * **Potential Upside**: If investors apply the S&P 500’s minimum PE ratio of 15, this suggests a minimum potential price of $60 by the end of the year (EOY).\n2. **Bitcoin Holdings and Mining Power**:\n   * **Bitcoin Holdings**: $MARA holds 18,000 Bitcoins on its balance sheet, which provides significant asset backing.\n   * **Mining Capacity**: The company currently has around 30 EH/s (exahashes per second) of mining power, with a target of increasing this to 50 EH/s by EOY. This expansion is expected to boost revenue and profitability.\n\n**Technicals**\n\n1. **Weekly Chart Analysis**:\n   * **5-Year Time Frame**: The stock is close to breaking out of a cup and handle formation with a neckline at $27.\n   * **Profit Target**: The projected profit target from this breakout is $50.\n2. **Daily Chart Analysis**:\n   * **Year-to-Date (YTD) Performance**: On the daily chart, the stock appears to be forming a triple bottom with a neckline at $21.\n   * **Profit Target**: The profit target from this pattern aligns with the cup and handle neckline at $27.\n   * **Support and Risk Management**: The current price is around $19.50, which acts as a support level. This is a good point for setting a stop-loss to manage risk.\n\n**Catalysts**\n\n* **Bitcoin Price Movement**: A key catalyst is Bitcoin breaking the $70,000  mark (which is also its long term cup and handle neckline) , which would likely drive $MARA’s stock price higher.\n* **Mining Reports**: Monthly mining reports showcasing increased production and efficiency will bolster investor confidence in the company’s performance targets.\n\n**Historical Accuracy**\n\nAs some of you might remember, I was bullish on $MARA last December when it was trading around $20, predicting it would reach $30—and it did! You can check my post history for verification [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17oeiij/comment/k8lsrfx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17oeiij/comment/k8lsrfx/)\n\n**Timing**\n\nHistorically, $MARA tends to perform well in summer and winter. Therefore, I'm targeting the first week of June as my first profit point at $27 (I want to avoid trading the second week of June for the CPI and FOMC meeting) and then the first week of  July as my last  potential sell time at $35-$40, capitalizing on this cyclical pattern. Then anything below closing $19 as a sell out zone to manage my risk.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFor me, this is an easy trade given the strong fundamentals and promising technical setup. I believe $MARA has significant upside potential, especially with the catalysts on the horizon.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on $MARA? Do you see any additional catalysts or risks that I might have missed? Let’s discuss!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7rg018nu4f1d1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=be82ae181ebe4c9191d4a448e4e083a44b51d3ee",

                  "body": "I’m saying stock dilution is good depending on how the company spends the money in general and this goes for any company whatsoever. Marathon, digital, and all the other bitcoin mining companies have issued more shares in hopes of creating more shareholder value. Specifically $mara plans to use the money to continue to invest in mining hash rate, as you may know, mining companies in general compete to earn a portion of a maximum amount of bitcoin that can be produced a day (right now around 450). However, public mining companies are in a unique position where they can raise capital and reinvest in facilities and mining equipment  to outpace their competitors who are private companies. They may not say this outright, but public companies use their strategy as a way of forcing smaller mining operations into bankruptcy as companies who cannot raise capital cannot compete with the growing hash rate of public companies, allowing them to take smaller companies at a fraction of a cost of mining equipment facilities.  \n\nCurrently marathon digital has not sold any of the new shares issued. I believe they are planning to do this when the stock price starts to go above $30 in which they will use the money to buy smaller miners or mining equipment which will be immediately bullish for the stock. This is why the stock traditionally has such wild swings as investors patiently wait for the bottom.",
