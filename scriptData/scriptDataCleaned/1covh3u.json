                          "body": "No, *you* are mistaken.  There's been plenty of local support for nuclear construction (after all, if the power plant made money it would be a large source of local tax revenue).  It's just that the financial case isn't there, even with considerable federal subsidy.   Most recently, UAMPS & NuScale's CFPP failed for this reason.  They had plenty of support in Idaho Falls where the thing would actually be built, but they couldn't sign up enough utilities because the price became uncompetitive.  Before that, most of the AP1000 builds in the US were abandoned, even with large federal loan guarantees, because they couldn't compete.\n\nMost of the time when you hear about \"local opposition\" it actually means \"local and state governments weren't willing to subsidize us to the point we'd make money\".   It's not fear of accident, it's reluctance to spend huge amounts of extra money.\n\nHere's a quote from 2018 from then-President Crane of Exelon:\n\nhttps://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/71/12/26/904707/US-nuclear-industry-fights-for-survivalA-glut-of\n\n> “The cost of new nuclear is prohibitive for us to be investing in,” says Crane. Exelon considered building two new reactors in Texas in 2005, he says, when gas prices were $8/MMBtu and were projected to rise to $13/MMBtu. At that price, the project would have been viable with a CO2 tax of $25 per ton. “We’re sitting here trading 2019 gas at $2.90 per MMBtu,” he says; for new nuclear power to be competitive at that price, a CO2 tax “would be $300–$400.” Exelon currently is placing its bets instead on advances in energy storage and carbon sequestration technologies.\n\nThe Henry Hub price of natural gas today is even lower than that, even before adjusting for inflation.  And since that article was written, solar has gotten cheaper, and batteries have gotten much cheaper.   This is pounding additional nails into nuclear's coffin.",
