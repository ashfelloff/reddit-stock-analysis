Probably you heard about it after it popped off and fomo‚Äôd in\n\nYour calls are fucking stupid. A 4 dollar stock you‚Äôre buying 10 and 12 dollar strike prices, 200-300% \n\nAlso, and I may be wrong about this because I‚Äôm not a fucking moron who only concerns myself with short interest, but reports of short interest I believe are fairly hard to get accurate. I think they are reported once a month and for the previous month. So you really don‚Äôt know when shorts are closing and shit bc you‚Äôre always looking backwards at what happened the prior month. \n\nSo lot of speculation. Also highly shorted companies are going to be the ones that suck the most. If you have a high short interest on your stock your company probably blows. Not something I‚Äôd be super interested in gambling on, a trash underlying I don‚Äôt actually want to own so I can screw over someone making a reasonable play on the actual direction of the stock - which is down",
