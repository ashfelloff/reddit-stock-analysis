So they just put the price in the middle. The stock price is under $8. Unless that stock is crazy volatile. Those are worth nothing at this point. I had puts in a Russian etf. Bought right when the war started. Then they halted the etf. Everyday it would fluctuate even though it had no bid. Just a high ask. You will learn.",
