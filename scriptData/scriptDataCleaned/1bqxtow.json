  "score": 242,
  "selftext": "ARTICLE TLDR:  Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on a massive data-center project estimated to cost up to $100 billion. The initiative includes the development of an artificial intelligence supercomputer named \"Stargate.\" While the companies have not officially commented on the project, sources suggest that Microsoft will likely finance it. Stargate is anticipated to be operational by 2028, marking the final phase of OpenAI's AI upgrade. This U.S.-based supercomputer is part of a series of installations planned over the next six years. The projected cost of $100 billion has been attributed to conversations with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Microsoft's initial cost estimates. The project is progressing through five phases, with Stargate as the fifth phase, while Microsoft is concurrently working on a smaller, fourth-phase supercomputer for OpenAI. The focus of the current phase is on procuring AI chips necessary for the subsequent phases. \n\nLINK:\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-planning-$100-billion-data-center-project-the-information-reports) ",
