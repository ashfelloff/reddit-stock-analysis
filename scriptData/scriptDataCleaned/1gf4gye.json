You cannot buy an Nvidia card and just throw it into an existing server.  Sadly, they are ordered with specific power supplies and cooling to support these cards.  If anyone wants to buy and run a Nvidia card for anything, it needs a new server with an Intel or AMD processor in it.   \n\nTo make it more profitable for Intel and AMD, you can only stack a handful of the Nvidia cards into a server and the server requires two processors minimum to fully populate the PCI bus with enough bandwidth for the cards.  It's almost a two Nvidia card for each one processor.  If Nvidia sells 100,000 cards,  we better see at least 50,000 server class CPUs sold.",
