  "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm a sailor, busting my ass on a ship and trying to build my financial future by investing in the stock market. It's my little hobby while out at sea. So, right before heading out, I left with some open positions. No big deal, right? Well, I had no internet the whole time we were out. When I finally got back to a place with internet and checked my portfolio, I was in complete shock. My investments tanked. Now I'm stuck, investing is truly my calling. What would you do in my shoes?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ux1plqis7hd1.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2071a3895c05e29c1bdfa3c59f91b624978d6c9\n\n",
