  "selftext": "Hey Reddit,\n\nI'm a sailor, busting my ass on a ship and trying to build my financial future by investing in the stock market. It's my little hobby while out at sea. So, right before heading out, I left with some open positions. No big deal, right? Well, I had no internet the whole time we were out. When I finally got back to a place with internet and checked my portfolio, I was in complete shock. My investments tanked. Now I'm stuck, investing is truly my calling. What would you do in my shoes?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ux1plqis7hd1.png?width=294&format=png&auto=webp&s=f2071a3895c05e29c1bdfa3c59f91b624978d6c9\n\n",

So, what did he do? Did he abandon his sailor dreams? No way! He doubled down. He thought he had figured out how to balance the chaotic life on the sea with the wild ride of the stock market.\n\nAnd once he set his mind to it, he bought options, believing he could navigate those treacherous waters like a seasoned sailor. But the market—oh, the market, what a cruel mistress! With waves crashing and winds howling, it drove him to the brink of madness. Before he could do anything, his investments tanked harder than the Titanic.\n\nAnd so it is the story of a man who tried to master the high seas and the stock market alike, only to find that both are equally unforgiving to those who seek to conquer them.",
