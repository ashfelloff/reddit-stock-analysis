We’ve seen certain disease names provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities, create unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade, and **trigger needless slaughtering of food animals**. This can have serious consequences for peoples’ lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe reason it's called like that is to prevent people from killing monkeys. Something that has happened already in [Brazil](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/08/11/monkeys-killed-brazil-monkeypox-who/10295253002/) for example.",
