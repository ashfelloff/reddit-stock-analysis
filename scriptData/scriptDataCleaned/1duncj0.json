But to be fair, it has decrease precipitously since 2021. Last year dilution was about 5% and this year it will likely be a lot less.

In time, it will die like all the other incumbents over the last 20+ years. The concept of Internet banks is a wonderful concept, but overpaying for stocks based on this is a terrible idea.

My main concern was and is their debt.  $2.8B is a lot even if it is manageable for them.  It will cause more dilution or future cash flows paying down principle instead of being invested into the company.  If they had 0 debt the stock would be likely appreciating as income increases.  In general it wouldn’t surprise me at all if this company either goes flat or steadily downward.  It’s just way overpriced given what it is currently delivering",
