I truly think you will make money on some of those longer dated by doing nothing at all!\n\nI also hope MU does well. Iâ€™ve been buying calls the last two trading days on it and NVDA. If that and/or investorâ€™s meeting donâ€™t go well, thenâ€¦ maybe a break in the music. But holding until 45DTE, while it might mean some boredom, seems wise?\n\nI hope someone more experienced will chime in here.",

                  "body": "Well, the only reason I'm thinking of selling before rolling is because the contract count is so high - for 24 contracts, I'd be looking at an additional $20-ish thousand depending on the expiration and strike price. I could cover the cost by selling off my other stocks, but given how much exposure I already have in NVDA stocks and calls, an additional $20k would bring this to a $100k gamble. The possibility of losing it all just makes my heart sink. \n\n\nI'm confident the long dated options will pan out though - I bought 3 contracts of Dec 2026 calls today when the price was around $122 so there's a lot of upside potential there. \n\n\nHere's hoping that all of our bets pay off!",
