      "body": "The argument here (as I read and understood it) is he grew his money from $xx,000 to $25m. Once hitting that point, he discussed working with some financial advisors, and got things rolling but still was doing it himself when he hit that $4xx million dollar point. He engaged the advisors fully, and they were supposed to take over the bulk of the funds to be focused on wealth preservation. \n\nIt wasn’t, and they even talked him into donating $25m to them/their charity of choice for all the work they were going to be doing\n\nI’m sure the guy isn’t going to win, but I personally believe the firm has some liability. Directing $25m to their/their charity’s pockets but not saying “let’s put $200m of this into funds and you just chill forever and gamble reasonably” is wild to me",
