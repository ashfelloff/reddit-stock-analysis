This bank has liquidity risk, which is the ability to meet short-term cash demand (e.g SVB situation.) This is not a big problem unless people are misinformed and panic. Solvency risk is when your assets are worth less irl than on the book (2008 recession). That’s a problem with no easy solution.",

Banks are solvency risk right at the door with only needing less than 1% cash on hand. They can't possibly collect in the event of a necessary realization. The world would stop if everything ever actually had to balance. All of these companies are factually and dramatically under water, but they continue to pay out more than they make by floating on a sea of fake money. It should be somewhat balanced now and then, but the music will probably never stop so why bother.\n\nAll of this really only applies to poor people, and the uninformed sleep better at night thinking that rules actually apply. As Henry Ford put it,  \"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning\"",

So if interest rates go way up, suddenly the sell value of your bond plummets, because why would somebody buy it when they could get much better rates by just buying fresh bonds?

The Fed even bailed them with BTFP that ended in March 2024, so probably March 2025 would be the time to see if banks are fine without life support.\n\nAnyway, there is probably also the case that they got too much influx of savings in the helicopter money period when covid happened with rates near zero and put that into the treasury, while now personal saving down and the rate is at normal. There is also the case of a lot of commercial properties going down so the loan is probably going bad. Their book is probably worse than reported.\n\nI think credit cards have crazy rates right now is one of the ways to compensate for their loss in other areas, but when most people are unable to roll over their credit card debt when banks are starting to tighten their risk, it would be really wild.\n\nTheir supposedly safe treasury had become a sink hole because of the timing they put it.

Default risk of the bonds and the balance of risk exposure at the bank. If default risk of the borrower spikes hard ('97 in Thailand/Korea, stuff in Chinese property sector now, 2007-8 subprime default risk, etc.) then the bank can hold the bond but the bond value does collapse and the paper losses become real losses quite quickly.\n\n2. Bonds and other \"safe\" securities being used as collateral for other, riskier exposures. If cash needs to be raised to compensate for losses elsewhere on the balance sheet, banks still have to sell early to provide liquidity to trading arms. \n\nThat said, the 5% does matter. Those two issues are a big part of why there was a push to reinstate Glass-Steagall divisions in the banking sector in 2008. It failed, but the risk is there, and significant liquidity problems can quickly turn into solvency issues as a result. \n\nDoes any of this apply right now? Nope. Not at all. (Probably.)",
