Massive amounts of hedging against all the calls that were sold sent them through the roof.\n\nNow I'm not saying there isn't any manipulation going down, because I'm guessing there are countless automated strategies being deployed by MMs, including unhedged naked short option positions.\n\nHowever the regarded small brain attitude around here is that MMs are controlling and manipulating everything in the markets.

The company isn’t going to crash IMO as their backlog and demand is through the roof but that’s all priced in at this point.  I’d say the probability of a pump is low and more likely that it plateaus and barcodes for a while as there are no known upcoming catalysts that I’m aware of to move the stock price.    Any sign of strength that comes between now and your exp. is your sign to dump out of this.

The intrinsic value of the option - that is, the profit that would be realized if the option were to be exercised at the stock's current price. If the strike price of a call option is higher than the current price of the stock, then the option has no intrinsic value. \n\n2. The time value of the option - the longer an option has until expiration, the more valuable it is. Time value is represented by the greek letter theta, which is why you hear options sellers referred to as \"theta gang\" sometimes.\n\n3. The implied volatility of the underlying - the range of possible price movements that the market considers possible for the stock. This can shift dramatically over the life of an option, and when IV is high, option prices are high because the uncertainty means the market can't rule out larger moves to the upside or the downside. Around major events like earnings announcements, IV rises as people try to predict what a company will say during its report. After the report, the company's expectations and results quickly become widely known, and \"IV  crush\" occurs, causing option prices to drop.\n\n4. Last but certainly not least, the current price of the underlying stock.\n\nOP lost money because they lost ground on all four of these variables - when NVDA went down in price, the intrinsic value of the option fell with it, each day that passes eats up more theta, the earnings report caused IV to drop, and of course, the drop in stock price itself made the option less valuable.\n\nOneS8lf, you should really do some deeper reading on option pricing than this Reddit comment before attempting to trade them. I know, sir, this is a casino, and all that, but if you walk into a casino and sit down at a $25/hand blackjack table and you don't know what the numbers and pictures on the playing cards mean, you are going to get rolled.",
