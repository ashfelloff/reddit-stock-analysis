  "selftext": "Alright regards, started as a 60k yolo, but trimmed it to half for ~5k gains. The DJTs expire next week, the TSLAs expire Friday.\n\nI'll hold the DJTs until I see the insides sell off and try to get out with a healthy profit. \n\nFor the TSLAs, I buy 10-20k of puts every morning after the retail regards pump it big and try to make a quick 5k on the subsequent sell off. Today I only sold half and kept the other half to gamble a bit now tomorrow. \n\nWhat do we think? Lambo or Wendy's?",

I occasionally play both sides of it, but one night I drank too much and pissed away 20K because I couldn’t get DCA out of my head. Other than that it’s a great way to spend the first hour of the morning.\n\nCurrently betting against SPX, TSLA, AMZN, and NOW.\n\nBout to sell some calls I bought a while ago on LUNR.
