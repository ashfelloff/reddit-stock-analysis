They think about literally anything and everything else tho! The development details and things they research will feed private development immensely. I’ll share a story of what I mean. \n\nThey were testing something with a battery. Battery accidentally dropped during testing and explodes. The business move is “omg get this asset working and the project back on track for launch.” The people at nasa go, “we didn’t expect that, let’s do it again on purpose and run some tests.”  \n\nThat story there is why NASA is great at new tech but at a far greater cost due to actually testing every thing they can think of vs slapping something together and sending it to space with people in it.",
