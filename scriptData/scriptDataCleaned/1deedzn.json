Use the \"cash\" as the cash cover to sell puts to üåàüêªs on stuff I'd want to buy anyways but were too high or things that were offering good premium: TNA/UWM, UPRO/SSO, BAC, DAL, EWZ, XLU, PYPL, TSLA, TMF, etcetc. Also sold some far OTM calls on some winners, but I say the ratio is like 10 puts to 1-2 calls?\n\nIt's certainly not BAD, but my money would have been better spent just buying leveraged & unleveraged index etfs on dips and DCAing (at least the last 9 months or so). The neutral strat worked better in Early 2022 to around fall 2023. \n\nTL;DR There's no free lunch, even if you're taking lunch money from üåàüêªs. It's a lot of work and neutral or even neutral-bullish offered suboptimal returns the last 9 months to just being a megabull like Tom Lee.",
