  "score": 84,
  "selftext": "Salesforce shares rose about 1.5% in extended trading on Wednesday after the business software maker reported robust fiscal second-quarter results that beat estimates and raised its full-year profit outlook.\n\nThe company also announced president and CFO Amy Weaver will step down. She will remain at the company as the CFO until a successor is appointed and, after that, will stay on as an advisor.\n\nHere’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings per share: $$2.56 adjusted vs. $2.36 expected\n\nRevenue: $9.33 billion vs. $9.23 billion expected\n\nThe company’s revenue grew 8% year over year during the quarter, which ended on July 31, according to a statement. Net income, at $1.43 billion, or $1.47 per share, was up from $1.27 billion, or $1.28 per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nWith respect to guidance, Salesforce called for adjusted fiscal third-quarter earnings of $2.42 to $2.44 per share on $9.21 to $9.36 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected $2.43 in earnings per share on $9.41 billion in revenue.\n\nManagement called for $10.03 to $10.11 per share in adjusted fiscal 2025 earnings, with $6.05 billion to $6.13 billion in revenue. Last quarter’s forecast was $9.86 to $9.94 per share and revenue from $37.7 billion to $38.0 billion. The LSEG consensus was $9.89 in adjusted earnings per share, with $37.84 billion in revenue.\n\nDuring the quarter, Salesforce said in the fall it will start testing an Einstein Copilot for Merchants that can compose product pages and promotions with a few words of human input.\n\nEarlier this month, activist investors Starboard and ValueAct both disclosed increases in their Salesforce positions. Both bought shares before the company announced a widening of its adjusted operating margin sooner than planned last year.\n\nExcluding the after-hours move, Salesforce shares are down 2% so far in 2024, while the S&P 500 index has gained 17% over the same period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/salesforce-q2-earnings-report-2025.html",

          "body": "Salesforce and Amazon are almost the same story and your comment is why many missed it for years. 20 years of high revenue growth with 0 profit to keep the revenue growth up. Now they are both industry leaders and growth is slowing so they are moving to a new phase with modest revenue growth and massive operating leverage. 50x earnings and earnings grew 15% on 8% rev growth with headwinds from the tech spending environment with cash flow increasing by low to mid 20s!\n\nGAAP operating margins are 19% but are likely to get to MSFT/INTU/ADBE levels in the 30s to 40s as they continue to scale. That will plummet the P/E showing the value, but it will be too late by the time you see it",
