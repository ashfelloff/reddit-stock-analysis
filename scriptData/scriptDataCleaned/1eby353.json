But for what they are doing, direct to cell with MNO partners - coverage will be entire globe with 5g broad band.  Everyone will have access. There are so many avenues.   The list of partners around the world is awesome.  Vodaphone, ATT Verizon, Bell Canada - and other majors in their regions.  Imagine it acting as a constellation of big space cell phone towers orbiting the world and all the carriers use it to patch gaps in coverage areas - without having to build terrestrial cell towers ever again to get full coverage for their customers.  ATT, Verizon in USA get first crack as they have made investment deals and prepayment deals to help build out first - but eventually everyone will get coverage and prioritized by similar prepayment structure (as a means of funding the buildout vs dilutive offerings) and/or strategic markets with the best return to maximize cash flow.  They tout 45 agreements with MNO's currently serving 2.8 billion customers - maybe more to come.  - maybe 10% 280 million customers or 20% 560 million get signed up for revenue share - (estimates of $2. per sub per month) 24 x 580 million? sick, right with  250 million in operating expenses?  These are just numbers i have read about, no way to know how it all plays out from current subs, and new ones, ARPU or any of it.  but 5 to 10 billion annually in profit over the next 5 to 10 years after full build out?  again, not certain numbers, but need to create projections from what is out there.  That's why i'm in this.  I could be wrong, but it's how i and a lot of others see it.  And yes, without dilutive capital raises in the past and new deals in place - this was very risky from a financing standpoint.  It seems to not be a major issue anymore and ATT and Verizon have seen enough in testing from the BW3 satellite up there to move forward.  ATT has been in from beginning - and has FirstNet funds to deploy for coverage buildout -  ASTS should be a big part of that plan so is additional revenue.  Could go on and on, but there are more qualified people to follow for dd.  I started buying years ago at $10, up to $14 and then down to $2 - the last three months have been a blessing - because you know to hang on for years in the face of shorts - and bleak news and delays is tough.  But the revenue and profit numbers, have seemed clear to me from the start. (if they could execute and survive the funding issues).  i have  been burned before with goods ideas that couldn't survive the finances to get to where they needed to be before.  FYI, i realize this is a little scattered of a reply - head over to r/ASTSpaceMobile  - hit the bookmarks, search around for dd among all the excited investors comments...  Expecting the best!",

In terms of competition, they currently have zero competition. Starlink is not a competitor despite what some people think. ASTS sats are on a completely different size scale, while Starlink's is just added capability on existing small sats. When you're talking about communicating from space with a bog standard mobile phone on the ground that only needs to connect to a cell tower less than 10 miles away, the size of the antenna is not something that can be handwaved away with software.",
