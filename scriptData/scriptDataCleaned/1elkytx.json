  "selftext": "If you are bullish on AI, then you have to be bullish on PLTR. Here's a summary of what Palantir ACTUALLY does. I wrote a longer article but I feel like most people on here don't have the attention span for anything but bullets. \\*PLTR IS MY BIGGEST POSITION AND I'LL BE BUYING ON ANY DIPS BELOW $25\\*\n\n* Palantir leverages AI to process and analyze vast amounts of data within a company, process, or organization and then helps identify complex patterns and derive actionable insights.\n* If a company‚Äôs in-house data solution is data-Frankenstein, then Palantir is a data-Zeus, the god of all data solutions.\n* **Foundry**\n   * Think of Foundry as a super smart filing system that stores all sorts of information from different places. This tool can pull together bits of data from various sources, like spreadsheets, emails, and databases, so that everything is in one place. Then, it will use a really smart and well-trained robot to help your company make important observations and decisions based on the data.\n   * Puts data together: Foundry can take all sorts of information from different places and put it together so it‚Äôs easier to see everything at once.\n   * Keeps data safe: It makes sure that the data is secure and handled properly, following rules about privacy and safety.\n   * Helps make decisions: It uses AI to help people at a company make decisions by showing them patterns or trends in data that might not be obvious.\n   * Lets people work together: Foundry helps teams within a company work better together by sharing their findings and plans based on the data.\n   * Custom tools: Companies can create their own tools (code, low-code, and no-code tools) with Foundry to address specific needs they have, making their work easier and more efficient.\n   * Foundry uses AI to automatically combine data from different sources ‚Äì this helps avoid the need for a lot of manual work to clean up and organize the data.\n   * Foundry makes it easy for you to use AI to make predictions or find patterns in data.\n   * AI in Foundry helps analyze words in documents or online posts to gather important information or see how people feel about something.\n   * AI helps create charts or point out important bits of data quickly, making it easier for people to understand what the data means.\n   * Foundry‚Äôs AI can help businesses plan better or test out ideas by simulating different scenarios. This is like trying out strategies in a computer game to see what might work best in real life.\n   * Foundry‚Äôs AI also helps keep the data secure by looking out for any unusual activity that might suggest a security problem.\n   * Ontology is a cataloging system for data ‚Äì it organizes data into specific categories and relationships.\n   * Just like a well-organized library allows you to navigate through shelves of books effortlessly, a well-structured ontology allows computers to navigate through large datasets.\n   * What type of company should use Foundry? Any company that manages large volumes of data.\n   * Stellantis, Airbus, PGE&E, Tyson, Cleveland Clinic, British Petroleum, Exxon Mobil, and even Ferrari‚Äôs F-1 racing team have all partnered with Palantir Foundry.\n* **Gotham**\n   * Gotham‚Äôs main clients are military, defense, intelligence, counterterrorism, and law enforcement agencies.\n   * Gotham enhances military operations with an AI-powered kill chain that helps soldiers quickly identify and manage targets.\n   * Gotham can control sensors like drones and satellites either automatically with AI or manually with human input.\n   * Gotham transforms any location into a command center with mixed reality, allowing operators and commanders to work together virtually.\n* **Apollo**\n   * Put simply, Apollo helps a company manage, deploy, and scale Palantir software within their organization.\n   * Continuous software deployment is a lot more complex than it may seem.\n   * If SaaS was the hero to software deployment issues in the 2010‚Äôs, then Apollo is software deployment‚Äôs modern-say savior. This was all a long-winded way to say that Apollo helps companies easily manage continuous software deployment and integration so that they can focus their attention back to innovation and away from meaningless deployment and update issues.\n* **AIP**\n   * AIP is a no-code environment for creating, testing, and deploying AI functions using LLMs. You can build, test, and deploy features using a simple interface without needing to write complex code.\n   * AIP is absolutely game-changing for enterprises hoping to leverage AI into their operations. I think that within the next 3-5 years, most large enterprises will be using AIP someway somehow within their organization.\n* It's not just about managing information; it's about unlocking its full potential in the most fun and captivating way possible.",

Truth is, Palantir is Accenture with MBB-level marketing. \n\nNot even 2 years ago there was a companywide ban on AI. Seriously, if you wanted to develop any sort of ML for a client, it had to be developed by a third party. The AI rebranding is a 180 shift on where the company was 18 months ago. \n\nAs to all the platforms being so great, why did the model (adopted roughly 2 years ago) of self-serving and moving towards SaaS-like solutions that the customers can just use with no need for consultants fail? Why are Palantir \"deployments\" essentially built from scratch? Surely if there is a hospital managing solution that works, it would be very low-lift to use it in nearly any hospital instead of just one, right? Why are there no scalable products released?  Like if Apollo, Gotham and Foundry are so much better than the alternatives, why didn't they just release them straight to the customers? Why not become an actual product company? \n\nI think we all know the answer to that- the product is not scalable, the platforms very laggy and full of bugs. If they released it to the public, any developer would be aware of stuff like how \"Ontology\" is just a set of tables linked with foreign keys and the AI positioning is pure marketing.",

So there is no need to have state-of-the-art software when plenty of companies basically only use email and simple VBA. I think Palantir generates a lot of value for its customers, and rightly so. But if you are using an image of   a cutting-edge AI product company for valuation, I am not sure this is the case. You are buying a hype consulting company with perfect marketing and a charismatic leader who is capable of saying controversial stuff, not an AI champion with a suite of AI products and a history of having top-tier ML talent. Maybe the valuation of this company should be even higher. But it is not a product company, but an implementation center.\n\nJust for comparison, Palantir has been around nearly as long as Meta/Facebook. Meta released Llama, uses AI extensively and has published plenty of AI research. Palantir has big-name customers. So it is still the implementation that gets paid for, rather than the product. What would you say is the more scalable company that actually showed their AI skills?",

Their positioning as a cutting edge AI firm has certainly at least been believed by these big names and of course has led to a valuation multiple much higher than what the market would give them (and indeed perhaps more than they deserve) than if they were perceived instead as a consulting firm. So really, I agree with your take regarding this but also believe that any rational leadership would strive to maintain such an image for the above reasons.\n\n\nI think a big litmus test will be to what extent their clients can demonstrably improve their bottom line from their products long-term, and if its material enough, then the market may not care about how truly an AI champion they really are. Of course, I think all that would be predicated on the scalability of their products which I didn't realize was such an issue before reading your earlier point. I can't imagine that issue not being a major focus for the firm to improve upon.\n\n\nOne other point that's interesting though is that I don't think any company could acquire and integrate them fluidly and it appears by extension that they may have a pretty reliable moat in terms of intellectual capital and product offering. Any long term opinion of them?\n\n\nAddressing your question, Meta of course is much more scalable but I don't know how direct of a comp they are for PLTR just in terms of market cap, product mix, and of course different customer and geographic base.",

They are not trying to sell the implementation of their solution, they are trying to grow out the infrastructure of their platforms (Gotham, Foundry, etc) as well as their more scalable AIP platform. This will generate reoccurring revenues from several of their clients.\n\nThe biggest key factor is their 20 year head start in a field that is just starting to gain use cases commercially in the last 5 years. They have developed a ridiculous MOAT in the data analytics field, using their head start while being funded by the government.  Several of the largest tech companies have partnered with them to offer PLTR's platforms on top of their own services. Now you can see them growing with successful use cases from a variety of fields being presented at AIP conference. They are bottom line profitable and growing revenues/customer base in this challenging capital environment. I believe companies are realizing the benefits of PLTR's offerings are even more valuable during these challenging times where access to capital is more expensive and streamlining their businesses is crucial to navigate.",
