It's an old play and we're all in it right now as we speak.\n\nSun Microsystems versus Microsoft, circa way back in the day.\n\nThe reason Java and c# are so similar is because Sun had all the devs and Microsoft wanted them. So Microsoft went on a quest to get them by effectively rewriting Java and then offering an incredible toolset around it.\n\nAnd the same is true today with Visual Studio.\n\nNvidia making this move is basically the same thing as Microsoft back in the day.
