Today jumped into $QQQ puts and kept averaging down due to no volume and everything happening in the world (hurricane, war, china cut rates, cpi tmrw). kept going and lost it all. idk how i’ll bounce back but i’ll hopefully find a way. setting +20% limit sell and -20% stop less and pushing $QQQ or $SPY options every morning from now on to at least get back to the $10k range. i know it’s risky but i just lost my whole account and months of work. i’ve always read the stories of ppl who lost it all but wow averaging down this is what happens. how do i cope? idk.

Set out some rules for yourself and follow them. I'd advise against trading every day, and trying to make it back as quickly as possible. Money comes and goes, but if you grab for it, it trickles away in your fingers. Use the lessons you learned for next time (don't average down lol).",
