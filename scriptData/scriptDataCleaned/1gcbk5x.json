We are talking about chips far more advanced than anything else on the market, by leaps and bounds.\n\nWhat most may not realize is their chip technology will eventually bleed into other tech markets. In addition, AI will be heavily utilized in many modern rapidly expanding industries. Data intensive industries and industries where research is key to profits may be among the biggest beneficiaries.\n\nThe key concerns for Nvidia's maintained dominance is the government trying to break up any monopoly that may end up occurring or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.",

This to me is the most important factor. It's superior...for today.\n\nApple is not user friendly. They invented their own screws and bolts so you're forced to go to the Apple store. Also not being open source they can set what Apps work and which don't. Nevertheless iProduct users spent more money to get a device that isn't better for the cost. Any Apple product you buy 10% of the cost is the Apple Logo.",

They do lock down the software a bit but.. most users like that.
