COVID has shown that money can be printed overnight at scale and just handed to people for doing nothing. Sure it results in inflation which leads to rising rates etc but the average person can't connect the two because the consequences of actions are so slow moving and take years to materialise.\n\nSo like I said before, if you can print money to inflate asset values indefinitely and you own a bunch of assets, why wouldn't you just keep printing money until your power or life is threatened? That's the situation we're in now. No incentive to change anything so we'll keep doing the same thing until the youth are spending 100% of their income on rent and then after that passing their debt on to their kids and so on. It'll probably continue until there's a revolution or civil war triggered by the consequences of economic policy.",

It doesn't do anything to exacerbate inflation because it just inflates the stock market.  As covid bail out money proved to us, you need to give money to poor people if you want it to cause inflation.  Cuz those are the people who are actually going to spend it and actually make the economy do stuff with it.\n\nSo anyways, I guess it makes the economy look good if you're only looking at stock prices. But if you're looking at employment percentage and CPI and such, it's not really having much effect there. Just like our first $22 trillion in debt didn't have much effect. Inflation only kicked off once we decided to give a bunch of money to a bunch of poor people who are going to spend it all and cause shortages of consumer goods.",

                  "body": "> Keep creating more credit. Just because\n\nNope.  Create no more new credit. Do not issue new bonds. Simply pay off the debt using newly created money.   This will lead to inflation sure, but it's an inevitable can we keep kicking down the road making it worse and worse as we go.  Instead of just eating the inflation we've earned, we are creating new, extra debt to pay interest on our existing \"debt\" when we could make that debt and our obligation to pay interest on it disappear with a wave of our hand.  \n\n\nAt a certain point, compounded interest will account for the majority of the newly added debt.  This leads to trillions of dollars of unnecessary inflation simply because we insist upon maintaining this fiction of \"borrowing\" money. Simply printing money to pay off our debt is what we will ultimately **have to do**. The sooner we do it, the less painful that pill will be to swallow.  We can do it now and prevent trillions of extra dollars from being printed for no reason. \n\n\n> That's your thesis. Doesn't really track\n\nNo, it's not even close.
