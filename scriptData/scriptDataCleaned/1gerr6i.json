Back in the day, even if OP was a regard the top comments could inverse, counter argue, or have the actual facts. Now we just get shitty puns or jokes at the top.\n\nAnyways, your comment would normally be the top but it didn't break the top 3 as I'm typing this. \n\n>https://apnews.com/article/tram-crash-shop-norway-666020291c635d8b1f99330a971c2618\n\n>A tram derails and plows into a shop in the Norwegian capital but only 4 are lightly injured\n\n>***The tram driver*** was among those injured. Police said everyone was treated at the scene but no one had serious injuries.\n\n>The cause of the accident was not immediately determined and police said they were waiting for members of the Norwegian Safety Investigation Authority to arrive. The four-story building was later evacuated to check for structural damage.\n\nIt wasn't autonomous nor did it have anything to do with Apple beyond almost hitting it's store.",
