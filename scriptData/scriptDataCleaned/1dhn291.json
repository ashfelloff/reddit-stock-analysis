(No I won‚Äôt say it here, I don‚Äôt want this to sound like a thinly veiled plug and no it‚Äôs not *that* stock). \n\nIm curious if there‚Äôs any of you like me with a similar conviction for a company. \n",

My idea was there is no way they will go under as there has to be at least two CPU makers. I feel similar about INTC but they also make chips. USA government needs chips to be made in America for national security reasons. In 5-10 years so much can change in chip products as we have seen with AMD passing Intel during this time. \n\nNew Intel chips are also their version of 7nm while AMD using TSMC are using chips that are 5nm. If Intel can improve on making chips they can regain their crown. \n\nWhat do you like about them?",

This is literally the only individual stock I own because I couldn't get myself to sell it and I bought more at the $2B valuation when the SP was in the 3s.

Even at their highest SP, they have never been better off and they trade at 1/3 of that previous high.\n\nSpace systems revenue is growing (it generates more revenue than the launch side of the business). But the launch side of the business is doing well and Electron cadence is picking up. They are pre profit essentially because they are dumping money into R&D for a larger rocket, neutron. Without that they could become profitable but they are obviously trying to grow their business with a larger rocket for larger payloads. They have a backlog of orders over $1B, and they are scoring contracts with governments and businesses across the world. The number of satellites in space is only going to grow exponentially. Someone else in the thread mentioned ASTS, which in a way is kind of a space company because they are going to launch a satellite constellation for cell service. They aren't totally related obviously, the business model is not the same, but they are both in the space... space. And to give you an idea, ASTS is essentially pre revenue with a valuation of $3B and RKLB has a lower valuation with a TTM revenue of $282M (with a billion dollar backlog in orders, and mind you RKLB is often waiting on the people with these orders to get their payloads ready) and their revenue is growing fast and could grow significantly woth neutron development. They are nailing everything. They could even make and launch their own constellation. In my humble opinion they're building a solid company from the ground up and the CEO is awesome and mentally stable (looking at you spaceX). The only thing is that in rocket development, companies will never be on time with developing new rockets and any hiccups woth neutron development will scare people into selling. But obviously building massive new rockets is hard. And delays are expected.\n\nThe pop in SP the last couple weeks is because they scored some federal money ($25M) to build spacecraft chips, and then got a contract for 10 launches for a Japanese company (contract not valued yet, but they generally make about $7M-$8M per electron launch). Also they are expected to hotfire the archimedes engine soon, which will be the engine in the neutron rocket being developed.\n\nI'm in for shares and some OTM LEAPS.",

              "body": "Of the pure quantum plays, I like IONQ best because of the trapped ion thing which IMO should be a lot more economically viable and scalable than the superconducting qubit paradigm that RGTI and IBM use on account of the fact that they can operate at room-temperature and don‚Äôt require a crazy cooling infrastructure to keep things at 0.4 Kelvin.  Not to mention, trapped ion qubits currently have longer coherence times than superconducting qubits.  Results aren‚Äôt as accurate with trapped ion as they are with SC qubits but for most use cases (the few that we‚Äôve actually identified so far) it should be good enough.  The stock is also a helluva cheaper than IBM so I feel like I‚Äôm getting more bang for my buck. \n\nThat said, the others do have merit and I do keep a little bit of money in them hoping one or two will pan out (except QUTS, I‚Äôve never heard of that one).  I don‚Äôt think there will be a single winner in this landscape since none of them are perfect. You can pick and choose depending on the requirements of your application. I think IONQ will end up as the most dominant though.  The common roadblock for all of them right now though is a) scaling the number of logical qubits available in their systems and b) error correction.  All of these companies need to figure those two things out no matter their underlying processing paradigm.  The good news is that they‚Äôre somewhat complementary problems, if you solve A then B gets solved too. \n\nIBM isn‚Äôt a pure quantum play but they probably have the largest amount of community resources available and thus grassroots following which is super important. They‚Äôre actually the ones who have the money to do outreach (Qiskit summer school), RND and develop educational resources for the next gen QC programmers. Not to mention the hardware they‚Äôre using is something they invented decades ago but only recently realized that it could be used in QC applications. They‚Äôll probably be the Cadillac of QC‚Äîmost expensive but most accurate product on the market if they can tackle error correction and coherence times.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure what the hell is happening with RGTI but they‚Äôre like a pure QC-focused IBM (they use superconducting qubits and was actually started by a former IBMer). They seem to be falling behind for some reason though and likely don‚Äôt have the resources to fight longer term which is what this field requires.  They‚Äôll probably be acquired by IBM before actually making it to the big dance. \n\nQBTS is not actually pure QC like the others per se, but more quantum annealing (kind of like an quantum-flavoured optimization paradigm). I don‚Äôt know a ton about it but it sounds even less accurate than trapped ion. IIRC it also only works for limited use cases but there are probably enough of them where it‚Äôll work fine that they could be viable alternative. Think using a bike vs. a Lamborghini to get to the corner store a block away. This could be a lower cost alternative to the pure QC paradigms in these cases.",
