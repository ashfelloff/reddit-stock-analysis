Nvidia is a multi-trillion dollar company largely based on the assumption that the well isn't going to dry up anytime soon. Problem is, LLMs aren't progressing as rapidly as companies expected relative to the investment cost. Nvidia and related companies are set for the next few years, no doubt. They've already been paid the cost. The problem is valuations can't be justified just based on a few years of everyone wanting the best chips. What happens if META/Microsoft/Google etc start saying \"ya know what, we'll stand pat with the billions we've already spent on cards.\" The answer is the bubble pops. From there, it'll probably recover to a more justified valuation. Make no mistake, AI is legit. But the current gold rush might not be.",
