  "selftext": "I don't know why people have the regarded take that stocks can crater from ATH to 0. That usually happens because of market wide catalyst like 08 crisis. Its extremely rare to ever see that.\n\nLook at the UNH hack earlier this year, or the Morgan investigation, or Boeing etc etc. \n\n  \nThis was a fuck up on processes at CRWD, but it does not invalidate their entire product suite, and how entrenched they are in most companies. Most institutions will take months to plan to **possibly replace** them, and then research competitors, hear their pitch and then **ultimately decide** no one is at the same level of CRWD and decide to stay but ask for more stringent roll out process, CAPA and all other useless corporate documentation. \n\n  \nThose who decide to move from them, are not doing it overnight, it will take months to years and is extremely expensive. It will take months of effort to move to a different vendor, a lot of retraining of staff, and a bunch of other expensive activities\n\n  \nSo if you are sitting there thinking this stock is going to 0, you will be fucked. At least wait for quarterly guidance to decide on buying shorts and be realistic. Time and time again, regarded fellows try to catch falling knives and then come back here to cry about MM manipulating data to own them. Yes they absolutely loathe you, yes they can manipulate the market but more often than not, your smooth brain plays is the reason why your retirement account is negative in one of the longest bull runs ever. \n\n",

No matter how optimistic you are about CrowdStrike's future, an idiot could've predicted that causing the worst internet outage in history would cause a substantial decline in their stock price, even if it's just temporary. It's the most predictable, common-sense scenario imaginable. Anyone surprised by the Friday and Monday drops, in my opinion, should seriously consider finding a new hobby/investing vehicle.\n\nI missed the boat on this Friday because I just wasn't ready to capitalize on the opportunity as the news broke, and I was too slow to move Monday morning, so I just missed out on the good positions given the cash I had to spend on this. Moral of the story: Be ready to move FAST when a golden opportunity like this presents itself next time. Have the money in your account, and just be ready to pounce.",
