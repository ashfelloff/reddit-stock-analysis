  "selftext": "from the article - However, the implications of AI extend far beyond corporate growth. As education systems worldwide grapple with funding challenges, AI emerges as a powerful tool to bridge gaps and enhance learning experiences. AI-driven educational tools, such as virtual tutoring and adaptive learning platforms, can help mitigate the effects of under funding by providing personalized assistance and adjusting to individual learning styles.\n\n[https://www.newsreport47.com/home/ai-giants-poised-for-unprecedented-growth-palantir-and-nvidia-set-to-soar-2025](https://www.newsreport47.com/home/ai-giants-poised-for-unprecedented-growth-palantir-and-nvidia-set-to-soar-2025)\n\n  \nMy question is, is there money to be made by robots teaching our kids?",

      "body": "Tax bases are flat or declining, school enrollments are declining, and pension payouts are increasing, so school districts are under a lot of pressure to continually push teacher salaries downward.\n\nWith that being said, having kids teach themselves on computers was a *massive* failure during COVID, and having a chatbot on the side wouldn't address any of the core reasons why. Half of the failure was getting them to that computer in the first place, and the other half was having them pay attention to the shit on there without popping open another tab.\n\nMore to the point, most of the value in schools today is having them serve as a public daycare, so that neoliberals can enlist both parents into the workforce. Anything the kids learn while being babysat is secondary. If American businesses need educated workers, they can import them.\n\nTeachers are already in charge of babysitting 30-40 kids per classroom... do we think that buying chatbots will allow districts to fire teachers and spread that number thinner?",
