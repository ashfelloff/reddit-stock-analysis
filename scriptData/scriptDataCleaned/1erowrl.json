  "title": "Why was Berkshire Hathaway So heavy invested in Apple?",
  "score": 382,
  "selftext": "Last week it was announced that BH cut 50% of their stake in Apple. Before the cut the stock represented 44% of the company's whole portfolio. To me this ratio seems incredibly excessive compared to most big holding companies. I think Apple is a good stock to own. But, why would the company put so many eggs in one basket? It doesn't seem like good risk management to me?",

They own an incredibly deep and rich amount of wholly private businesses that you just don’t even see pop up in that portfolio list.  Railroads, energy infrastructure, insurance, manufacturing, clothes, food, all type of things.  \n\nAt even liberal valuations, Apple was probably only ever 10-15% of BRKs intrinsic value.  They have a market cap of $930bn right now.",

You have equity in the corporation, you have a right to a remainder portion of the assets of the corporation if it is wound up, it’s liabilities paid and whatever’s left over is distributed pro rata.\n\nETFs that receive dividends from companies owned by the fund have to pass a substantial portion of that cash onto you.  Berkshire receives dividends and can do whatever really it wants with the cash.  \n\nThe people running an ETF collect management fees from the investors.
