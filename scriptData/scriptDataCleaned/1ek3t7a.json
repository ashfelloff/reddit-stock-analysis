      "body": "I’ve used Robinhood, Acorns, Webull, and Fidelity. From my experience:\n\nFidelity is OG and one of the best brokers out there right now. They’ve been here for a long time and offer their own mix of ETFs. Only thing for me though, is that the interface is a little wonky but recently it’s not too bad with their new updated interface. \n\nRobinhood is the black sheep of the brokers. They have a bad reputation (according to Reddit lol) but they have a really user friendly interface. That’s probably the only reason why I would use it tbh. \n\nAcorns is my “set it and forget it” account. There’s only a limited amount of stocks and ETFs you can pick but you have to pay a subscription to customize your portfolio. I use Acorns as my main bank for 3% on my checkings and 5% on my savings and with direct deposit, they waive the subscription fee. \n\nI currently use Webull to buy my stocks. They have a pretty good interface. It’s a lot at first but once you get used to it, it gets really simple. The charting feature on this broker is also top notch! \n\nAll of these brokers were able to send in my buy orders on time in seconds or minutes if I bought stock during the open market. But if I put in an order when the markets is closed, it executes the next day when the market opens. If it’s a market order, it executes instantly. If I have a limit or stop order, it takes a little longer.",
