  "selftext": "$PLNT (PLANET FITNESS) is raising prices for the 1st time in 25 years this summer by 50%. Going from $10 a month to $15 dollars a month.\n\nI do not believe this will slow down sign ups, but it will boost revenue by 50%!! This is big news. Higher prices = greater revenue. It's fairly easy to analyze this co. They also just completed a debt refinancing which will free up capital, and allow them to possibly execute some buybacks/dividends this year. The new incoming CEO starts this month.\n\nMacro Thesis: Health & Wellness is a high growth industry right now.. and is not slowing down in the instagram age. It is particularly popular with Gen-Z. A $15 monthly gym membership is affordable, and offers great value in an age of higher inflation.",
