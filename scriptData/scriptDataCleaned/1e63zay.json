Trump wants to stop the rally and crash markets before election in september. market crashes are negative for the actual president biden and would damage his image. Furthermore trump loves new highs under his president time so he can say these are cause of his management. Therefore he wants the FED to not cut rates untile the elections are over. He will break down markets in the next weeks. (i am only joking for sure)",
