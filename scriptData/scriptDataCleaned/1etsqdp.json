      "body": "I work on mostly the terrestrial side, but from reading SpaceX's paper, it seems that their argument is that\n\n1. The regulation is needlessly strict and that relaxing the specification should have minimal impact on throughput\n2. In the worst case scenario SpaceX can come up with, the relaxation of specification they are proposing should not significantly impact downlink performance.\n\nRe#1: There is some merit to arguing for relaxing and updating specifications where needed. A lot of 3GPP specifications were written decades ago with much older technology, using less advanced modeling techniques, for a very different spectrum allocation, and in an overly conservative manner. Regulatory agencies like the FCC and 3GPP have very little incentive to update existing out of date regulations, and usually only do so after being lobbied by corporations who would like to use that spectrum. I can think of a few bands with unnecessarily strict regulations to protect spectrum allocated technologies that were last used decades ago, but nobody wants to stick out their neck and change it when companies have been working around it this entire time.\n\nIn general, people memeing about SpaceX \"begging for government intervention\" really don't understand how this industry works. Pretty much every major player in telecommunications is constantly working with government regulatory bodies around the world to update specifications. As others have noted, ASTS themselves submitted a similar waiver before and I'd expect most commercial products working on cutting edge technology (5G FR2, WiFi7, satellite cellular, etc) to submit some form of waiver because this stuff is really complicated on the implementation and regulatory side.\n\nRe#2: I find SpaceX's arguments in this case to be a bit tenuous. Skimming through their waiver and supplementary application, I think SpaceX does a decent job of outlining a theoretical \"worst case\" scenario for their emissions output and UE noise floor, but their conclusion to set the specification at 3dB below an ideal UE's noise floor instead of 10dB seems way too aggressive, and is unlikely to convince the highly conservative FCC/3GPP. Their ultimate argument is \"in the worst case theoretical scenario we're *barely* at the UE noise floor, so in the real world we'll be way below noise floor!\" does not seem like one that would convince regulators.\n\nTL;DR can't buy puts because private company RIP",

They're proposing that even if they hit the theoretically relaxed limit, in the real world the interference is going to be significantly less than the lab tests.\n\nAT&T/VZW have responded that if the theoretically relaxed performance *does* occur, there will be significant impact in terrestrial networks. \n\nI think both sides have merit. SpaceX's point about their worst case scenario is extremely unlikely to actually happen is true, while AT&T has provided data that shows *if* the worst case scenario does happen, there will be degradation of existing networks. However, regulatory bodies are way more likely to align with incumbents and not changing existing regulations.

Instead, they are proposing that -110.6dBW in *ideal* tested conditions are functionally equivalent to -120dBW *real world* conditions.\n\nI think there's merit to their reasoning, but I don't think it's going to convince the FCC. AT&T already provided some studies and experiments that showed if emissions at -110.6dBW at real world conditions were operating near their networks, there would be capacity hits.

My point was quite the opposite: It's the kind of thing billionares sprinkle into \"eat the rich\" conversations to draw attention away from the fact that [they make the rich look like the rest of us schlubs in comparison.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wealth-jeff-bezos-earning-1-211718230.html) and tend to be [completely unhinged about risk](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65998914)\n\nBefore we get to your sources (and there's plenty to talk about there) let me ask you this:  What kind of job do you propose they do after they leave the FDA? \"Welp, I worked for the government so now I have to hang up my whole career.\"\n\nOK, sources:\n\n> https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/09/28/495694559/a-look-at-how-the-revolving-door-spins-from-fda-to-industry\n\n\"Going to work for industry after leaving the FDA isn't inherently bad, but it does raise some questions.\"\n\nAlso: \"about 27 percent of the total number of reviewers left their federal oversight posts to work for the industry they previously regulated.\"  Put another way, 73% of reviewers did not leave their post to work for an industry they previously regulated.  Are you trying to claim that *anyone* who moves from one to the other is automatically corrupt? \n\nOh, and from the abstract of the paper npr cited? [\"Although this “revolving door” has been criticised, it has not been studied.\"](https://www.bmj.com/content/354/bmj.i5055)\n\nSeems like they share my complaint of lack of evidence, which is why they began this study.  Its conclusions do not on their own support your claim.\n\n> https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-12483423/HALF-CDC-staff-lobby-Big-Pharma.html\n\nWeird, the dailymail claims half, but [their source](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2023.00418) says that 15% had been employed in industry before their tenture and 32% left for industry. That's not \"More than HALF\" leaving to work for big Pharma.  Once again, hyperbole, speculation, and zero proof of actual malfesence.  Just \"people switched jobs, therefore corruption.\" \n\n> https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/04/fccs-revolving-door-former-chairman-leads-charge-against-title-ii/\n\nThe FCC is a *really* interesting one!  Wheeler caught quite a bit of flak (and Obama caught some for his appointment), and he initially pushed back against real net neutrality.  However, due to an effort of the rest of the FCC and some private industry advocates, he backed off of his stance and pushed for enforcement of net neutrality.  \n\nWhile we're on the subject, the entire article is about how industry was *suing because the government was trying to protect consumers with net neutrality.*\n\nIn other words, you handed me a *beautiful* counter example.\n\n\n\nTo quote you, \"That covers the FDA, CDC and FCC. Should I keep going?\"\n\n> And I wasn't aware searching \"FCC revolving door\" and \"FDA revolving door\" on Google constitutes \"a hard time.\" Or is it not \"hard\" enough evidence for you?\n\nIf you'd done one click deeper on the NPR article, you would've seen that your first source is a paper that literally has in the abstract \"Although this “revolving door” has been criticised, it has not been studied.\"  You know, my exact point.\n\nIf you'd done one click deeper on the daily mail article (seriously? DAILY MAIL? LOL) you would've seen that they had straight up given a wrong figure, and it was much much lower than they were claiming in the first place.\n\nIf you'd bothered to read the arstechnica article, you would've noticed that they very complaint you were making was debunked by the fact that the industry was *suing to overrule the FCC on consumer protections*.\n\nNot one of these sources even comes close to proving your point.  Several contradict it.\n\nWanna try again?\n\nedit: to be clear, I am 100% supportive of deeper factual research into government corruption.  What I am against is wild claims that are designed to erode trust baselessly.",

Or maybe they've already maxed out their board power and their at design limits already, and would have to deploy new hardware to take advantage of extra headroom. \n\nI wouldn't jump to any conclusions about performance gains based on the relaxation of a single test condition.",

              "body": "Depends. There's typically a few methods to reduce out of band emissions (interference), and it's unclear what SpaceX has explored and what's viable.\n\n1. The brute force method is to simply reduce output power. Lower output power = lower emissions. However, this obviously has implications for range, usability, stability, and throughput. I don't have enough insight into their link budget to know, but given that SpaceX would rather chance a waiver than simply reduce power output implies there would be an impact\n2. There could be a software related optimization issue that can be fixed. RF circuits are quite complex with many synchronous parts, optimizing some look up tables or PA operational points could feasibly improve out of band emissions while maintaining maximum output power. However, they have likely already investigated this area and have not come up with much if they've resorted to a waiver.\n3. Depending on the cause of the issue, a revised hardware design could result in reduced emissions. A more linear PA from another vendor, improved ET or DPD circuitry, or fixing some underlying issue could reduce emissions. This is significantly more costly and time consuming than option #3, and maybe we'll see a third generation design that can meet specifications.\n\nIn short, the easiest way is indeed to reduce their output power at the cost of performance, but how much this would impact performance is unclear. There may be knobs they can turn in software and hardware which they're probably investigating or have investigated, but if they're submitting a waiver they probably don't have anything ready soon.",
