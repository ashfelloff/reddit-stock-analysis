  "selftext": "Who's following the cocoa commodity price explosion? To the moon?  \nI'm looking at the supply chain companies, not the chocolate brands - key logistics providers and closest to the actual bean growers are ADM, BG, and maybe INGR.\n\nWhat do you know?\n\n  \nIt all boils down to **a dramatic drop in supply**. The world is facing the biggest deficit of cocoa in decades. Most cocoa beans are grown in West Africa, where extreme weather and changing climate patterns have upended crop harvests, which are forecast to fall short for the third year in a row.",

One thing I have observed with every big run-up in the market is that when the mainstream media starts talking about it (Bloomberg, CNBC, etc.) the rally’s days are numbered. The smart money got in when cocoa was cheap and they are going to want to take their profits, and when they do, it will crash HARD. It’s honestly looking like a good place to sell cocoa as these prices aren’t really sustainable. I think some July Cocoa puts would be a good option if a person wants to profit off of this. Then again, the end users can use this as a good opportunity to increase prices and profit off of the consumer. This is not financial advice, just my take.",

That only when things go wild, do the MSM start writing stories about it. Whether it's a particular type of stock, housing, commodities. It's a lot like Kennedy's thing about shoeshine boys giving stock tips. \n\nOf course, by the time you reach that point, there's bubble effects going on, and that's probably going to get corrected. And remember, this isn't the price of cocoa. It's cocoa futures. There's probably a bubble going on of people thinking this can only keep going higher.\n\nI'm buying some Hershey next week, as this cocoa stuff has depressed the price.",

And now that the media is talking about it, people will happily pay for their expensive candy bar because “there’s a cocoa shortage” while Hershey sells cocoa futures and makes more money off of their hedge account than they do the chocolatey goodness itself.

I'd assume chocolate to be easier to substitute with other products (for most people lol) and that people don't buy as much if prices rise because you don't really really need it. In contrast, the demand for a car or lumber is most often less elastic because you often really need the product when you buy it. Futher more I don't think anyone will gladly buy expensive chocolate just because they know why it is expensive. The sticky prices thing is definitely true tho. And I don't know about Hersheys contracts nor hedging but that's a good point. Thanks for the reply!",
