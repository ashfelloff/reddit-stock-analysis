Interesting enough to share here since some, if not most, of the companies mentioned are discussed frequently here.\n\nASML, TSMC,  INTC, NVDA, SSNLF, QCOM, AVGO, AMD, ARM, AAPL,  GOOG, AMZN, and more.\n\n[Semiconductor Titans Visualized](https://preview.redd.it/a5gpi0l3qltc1.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a0a1239a15db7cabea5eccf9fb1cd490c55db9b)",
