  "selftext": "Philip Morris (PM) is set to release its earnings report on October 22nd, and all signs point to strong performance. The stock recently touched $128 in early September before pulling back to $120, but the growth in their smokeless products like Zyn and heated tobacco units (HTUs) is undeniably driving momentum.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2f2bw487ajvd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ab4ab3068eed9a783ca0505a3abd601f8a1a341\n\nZyn, in particular, has been a sensation in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Indonesia. The product's soaring demand even caused a supply shortage over the summer, leading to a scramble by consumers to stock up. These smokeless products have rapidly become a staple, offering a cleaner, more convenient alternative to cigarettes without the lingering smell.  Over the past six months in Germany and Poland, I've personally seen them being used everywhere, and their appeal is clear: the convenience of enjoying nicotine anywhere, without the negatives of smoking traditional cigarettes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fmu50a56ajvd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=85947bf6ba5b09a1e0c30a5d5bb2b359ce5e2a5b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qobeqqg5ajvd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b4ab93b8a4ddcbe25411db69576618282b048d0\n\nThe competition‚Äîproducts like VELO and ON!‚Äîaren't even in the same league. Zyn offers a far superior experience, with a longer-lasting and smoother buzz. The numbers reflect this growing popularity. By the end of Q2, PMI had 30.8 million IQOS users globally, and Zyn saw a 50% jump in U.S. shipments. Total Zyn pouch volumes grew by 20% in Q2, while HTU shipments increased 13% year-over-year to 35.5 billion units.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wrukqel3ajvd1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9125be9d0a2274e208029b09a0bda608bfa8208e\n\nTo meet this skyrocketing demand, PM has committed to investing heavily in its U.S. production facilities, with a $232 million expansion in Kentucky and a new $600 million Zyn plant in Colorado set to boost production to 900 million cans per year by 2026. PM stock already up 27.1% year-to-date and has a strong track record of beating earnings expectations.\n\n  \nThoughts?\n\n\n\nPosition 400 $130 call 10/25",
