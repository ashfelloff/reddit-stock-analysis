          "body": "It's like buying a telecom company in its infancy imo.\n\nThey hold a ton of patents. They've already built their first satellites and are prepping to launch. They've signed deals with Verizon, AT&T, and the US Government. They won't be generating money for a while because they need to spend money on hardware, labor, and launches before they start bringing money in, but when they do they're ahead of the curve. They don't need special receivers. They don't require users to buy specific phones. You just have global coverage. This also means anyone anywhere in earth COULD be a customer.\n\nThe thing is that they're somewhat insulated as well by but being locked into one carrier. If Verizon were to go tits up, they could survive with a AT&T or strike a new deal with Google or whatever. They're a carrier service.",
