Us expecting some bomb ass JAV or nasty ass bitches from pornhub but we open the link and it's fucking HBO. Worse yet! It's not even like GoT where you see some ass and tits. It's fucking Last Week Tonight with the British wanker. And OP gets back to us like \"üòè That's some good porn right?!?!\"\n\nNot only do they fail at gambling, fail at taking gains, and fail at helping their mom. They also fail at posting loss porn correctly.",
