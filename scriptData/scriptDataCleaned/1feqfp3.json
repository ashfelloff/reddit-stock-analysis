  "title": "SOUN (SoundHound AI) is insanely overvalued ",
  "score": 80,
  "selftext": "Company has a $1.74B market cap on only ~$54M of annualized revenue…an insane ~32x revenue multiple.\n\nOn top of that last quarter EBITDA margin is -158%…down 37% from same quarter last year.\n\nNow if SOUN was some sort of revolutionary category defining company…maybe I could get on board. But it’s just mostly a customer service/customer experience tool…not even particularly differentiated at that. Plenty of competition in the AI sound and voice recognition space.\n\nNow granted it’s growing much faster than your typical public SaaS company at ~54% YoY…but that’s easy when revenue is only around $50M. No way that growth rate is sustainable for this business. \n\nThe 8-12x revenue multiple range is where SOUN market cap should be right now…I have a feeling we’ll see it there sometime not too far off in the future.\n\nSource: https://publicsaascompanies.com\nSource: https://publicsaascompanies.com/saas-multiples/",

A lot of people on the same side, and at some point they'll all want to close their position. Probably from a better price point than you'd enter at now, but not always. \n\nFor a short position that means buying and potentially, if enough people want to buy at the same time, the price goes up, hurting your short position. There's also the possibility of the stock spiking and people being forced to close their short position by buying automatically to close the loan. (\"Short squeeze\", which gets mentioned way more than it actually happens)\n\n25% is a fairly high short ratio. It just means there's a lot of skeptics, but companies do grow right through that.\n\nPuts are a little different and simpler to execute from the outside.",

It's an attractive buy out target at current scale and there are some tail ends of probability where it ends up a major tech titan.\n\n  \nAlso WTF is with using a linear fit trend line.  YoY growth would be compound growth.  ie it should map to P/S as an exponential.  And then eyeballing it SOUN looks mostly in line.",
