  "selftext": "If you woke up Monday and thought god fucking dammit I don’t have enough cash right now to buy this dip like I want too then you probably weren’t sitting in treasuries getting dicked on with 4% returns cause you got scared.\n\nSome of the valuations that morning were insane bargains. The first thing I bought was bitcoin and then of course sold before the major moves before buying nvidia below $100 and then cashed that shit out and was done.\n\nMy gains could buy a nice dinner at Wendy’s for a family of 5, which I absolutely fucking did and told them about the trades that got us here.\n\nNow I’m here to tell you we are going to SPY 600. It’s gonna be here by the end of the year. \n\nTrust me. JPOW wants to retire too…\n\nDid I spell everything correctly?\n\nI’m not sure spell check is working on my flight to Venezuela ",

Because there’s been a collective disbelief on Wall Street about the strength of the U.S. economy for well over a year.  The “experts” have thought for many months that a recession is inevitable and will come very soon. But they’ve been consistently wrong.\n\nSo when the weak report hit, it resulted in a collective panic: “The recession is finally here!  Run to the exits!”  But a recession isn’t inevitable and it hasn’t come soon (or at all).  Maybe it will. But the doom-and-gloom crew have been telling us — incorrectly — that IT’S THE END for a damn long time.",
