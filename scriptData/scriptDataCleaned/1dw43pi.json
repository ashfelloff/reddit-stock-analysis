I’m well aware that in addition to many people losing their jobs, a lot of banks failed.  So most people had no money to invest at all, be it from income or savings.\n\n  \nI‘m basically asking out of curiosity.  If you had money saved in one of the few banks that didn’t fail, could you have invested?  ",

During the Great Depression we had unemployment close to 30%, negative double digit gdp shrinkage, and massive farm/food destruction due to the dust bowl. This is not even accounting the safe guards. Back in those times there were no safe guards for anything. Social Security wasn’t a thing, FDIC insurance wasn’t a thing. If a bank collapsed that was it your money was gone. Most people lost their jobs and had nothing. Thats what happened when the Depression started. On top of it the stock market saw a 90% collapse in value. It wasn’t like Covid where it was a one and done and the market fully recovered in like a month. It took close to 3 years for the decline to play out and the recovery was much longer. Thats quite a long bear market. Not even 2008 was that long. Nobody here would have the patience to play it out that long.\n\nLet’s say hypothetically that the people on here commenting weren’t part of the 30% who lost their jobs. Now factor all that in on what I just said and keep in mind in 2022 we had raising the federal interests rates and 8% inflation. Thats it. Nowhere close to the levels that the Great Depression saw. If you would have came on Reddit during that time in 2022 you would have thought the sky was falling and we were heading towards another Depression. \n\nI promise you close to nobody on here would be buying. Like at all. It’s either cause they’re too scared or they’re suffering so much economically that they just can’t buy. Cause thats what the Great Depression was. Suffering with no end in sight.",

      "body": "Short answer: Yes, people who had liquid assets were able to buy up all sorts of assets in the depression.\n\nThe reason that many wealthy people weren't able to benefit is that assets are subject to a herd mentality. Investment money tends to go to the assets that have been growing, and higher valuations can make people stop diversifying and put everything into what ever seems to be making others rich.\n\nThe depression lowered the prices of most assets. When the economy was sluggish enough to create deflation, the value of cash was on of the few assets that was rising. A lot of people invested in the stock market had margin accounts, and their borrowing to buy shares meant that they had to sell other assets at whatever price they could get to avoid getting wiped out in the market. And then they were often wiped out anyway.\n\nSo people who had assets outside of the assets that fell bought up a lot of things that had been devalued. Of course, no one knew what prices would do in the future, so few bought assets at any of the actual bottom prices, and some doubtless felt foolish for buying when prices continued to fall.\n\nStock market price charts do go back that far. It's worth going to have a look to see how the markets actually behaved.\n\nThe lesson is not to be in the same investments that everyone else seems to be holding. But then everyone else holding those investments supports or increases the high valuations. There is no perfect way to be smarter than the crowd.\n\n If lots of people are anticipating a depression-sized fall in the stock market, that's one of the forces that keeps it from happening.",

Business owners thought why should I continue to manufacture some goods when they are becoming cheaper and cheaper each month. So economy was shutting down as the most profitable thing was just to sit in cash.\n\nThose who sit in cash then were actually right. Sure it could be profitable to buy stocks at the end of the Great Depression but who can guess the right moment?",

      "body": "I think OP’s question is whether the average person could have invested… meaning could they have physically done it, not whether they should have.\n\nThe average person back then didn’t invest. It was costly and difficult to buy stocks. Mutual funds existed but weren’t regularly used by average people and also were expensive.\n\nSo could the average person who didn’t lose their savings have bought stocks? It would have been possible but they would have been buying physical certificates of individual companies at high commissions. And like today, single stock picking could fail even in a bull market. So they probably didn’t.\n\nRetail investing at the scale we see it today is a pretty new phenomenon. Free trades are very new, within the last decade. Index funds started in the 70’s. And most people had pensions so they had little need to invest themselves. Index funds, 401ks, and free trades have made every American into their own little hedge fund, for better or worse.",
