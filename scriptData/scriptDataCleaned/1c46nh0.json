  "selftext": "My thoughts on coming week:\n\n* Iran/ Israel Tensions: Iran made a move that seemed to satisfy their domestic audience without causing any real damage. It played out about how I expected, with the markets reacting skittishly and dipping a bit, but also providing some good buying opportunities.\n* Earnings Season: Earnings reports were spectacular, but banks got caught up in Iran's saber rattling\n* Inflation and Rate Cuts: The volatility is likely to persist over the next several weeks as the inflation picture becomes clearer (it appears to be coming down) and the timing of rate cuts by the Fed (potentially June or July) becomes more certain.\n* Overall Outlook: Despite the recent choppiness, this remains a fundamentally strong market backed by a robust economy. My advice would be to take advantage of the volatility and Buy! There seem to be some solid opportunities emerging.\n\nWe are in the third innings of a bull market that's just started.  Buy!\n\n  \nPS - there's always some commentary on market having run up too fast, etc.  Just remember it took a big dump the prior year.  Those looking for a big correction also need to look at the history: we haven't seen strengthening economy and weakening markets.  There's a wall of worry to climb, which this market will climb.",

I think the market loves to inverse the common sense or sentiment and I also think certain stocks have really hard targets.\n\n$4.50/share EPS is really high. They could still miss and report really good guidance even if it’s bullshit and run up. CVNA is doing well despite being a terrible company that moderates used car sales to really shitty loans and can’t make money during the biggest boom of the used car industry in recent memory.\n\nMy litmus test is this - Disney seems fairly priced or even should be closer to $100 and its market cap is less than Netflix. How in the actual F could all that IP and assets and overall breadth of coverage be worth less than a single streaming platform that could literally go away in under 3 years? Not saying they will, but they offer nothing that sets them apart from other streaming services other than they were first to market and to expand to every household.",
