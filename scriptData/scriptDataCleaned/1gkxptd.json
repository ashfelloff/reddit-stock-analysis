  "score": 380,
  "selftext": "Japanese automaker Toyota Motor on Wednesday reported its first quarterly operating profit drop in about two years, as it strives to navigate the market shift toward electric vehicles.\n\nHere are Toyota’s results compared with estimates from analysts, compiled by LSEG.\n\nRevenue: 11.44 trillion yen vs. 11.41 trillion yen\n\nOperating profit: 1.16 trillion yen vs. 1.24 trillion yen\n\nThe world’s largest automaker by sales volume saw a 20% year-on-year drop in operating profit during the quarter.\n\nNet profit attributable to company more than halved to 573.7 billion yen from 1.28 trillion a year ago.\n\nThe automaker’s sales volume for the second-quarter slipped to 2.3 million from 2.42 million units a year ago.\n\nStill, Toyota raised its full-year dividend forecast to 90 yen, up from 75 yen a year earlier.\n\nToyota has been slower in embracing fully battery-powered electric vehicles, with chairman Akio Toyoda reportedly saying that an “electric-vehicle only future” would lead to job losses in the automotive industry.\n\n“There are 5.5 million people involved in the automotive industry in Japan. Among them are those who have been doing engine-related (work) for a long time,” Toyoda told reporters, according to Reuters.\n\n“If electric vehicles simply become the only choice, including for our suppliers, those people’s jobs would be lost.”\n\nThe company maintained a full-year operating profit of 4.3 trillion yen.\n\nToyota also has been in the spotlight this year due to the multiple vehicle recalls, most recently in September.\n\nThe latest recall of 42,000 vehicles was over the loss of power brake assist that can extend the distance required to stop, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It affected certain 2023-2024 Corolla Cross Hybrid vehicles, the administration said.\n\nEarly in June, Toyota lost over $15 billion in market value after Japan’s Transport Ministry found false data was used by Japanese automakers to certify certain models.\n\nThe wide-ranging inspection by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism also found irregularities in certification applications by other automakers Honda, Suzuki and Yamaha.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/toyota-posts-nearly-20percent-drop-in-second-quarter-operating-profit-missing-estimates.html",

A new car costing $25k will cost less than $0.17/mi, and will have lower fuel and maintenance costs.  Given this, it most certainly is smart to buy the new car.\n\nWhile many households buy way too large and expensive a car, buying new vs used isn't the problem.",

Even with a low CPM, *if the total cost is outside your budget, buying new is financially risky*.\n\nThe difference between CPM and total cost is about **cash flow** considerations. Not everyone can afford the upfront price and ongoing costs of a new car, even if it technically costs less per mile over the long term. [“boots” theory of socioeconomic unfairness and all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/discworld/s/HC1hMYarrF)\n\nThere’s also **opportunity cost**—the extra cash spent on a new car could be invested for potential gains elsewhere. That’s a big factor you’re ignoring.\n\n**Depreciation** doesn’t follow a smooth line; it’s piecewise, hitting hardest in the first few years. Your “150k miles” assumption overlooks that if you sell earlier than that forecast, you’ll eat a big loss.\n\nAnd you’re oversimplifying **interest payments**. Many people finance new cars at higher interest rates, adding substantial total costs and per mile costs they underestimate. Whether or not you should buy new or used might even have more to do with credit scores than CPM. \n\nFinally, **insurance premiums and taxes** are higher for new cars, increasing total expenses. These aren’t direct “car costs,” but they impact the true cost of owning new. The differential can be huge.",

If money is tight, the best plan is probably to move down-market and get an newer economy car rather than an older one.\n\n>**Depreciation** doesn’t follow a smooth line;\n\nIf you keep a car for its full useful life, the shape of the depreciation curve really isn't relevant.  Given the transaction costs of buying a car, buying new and holding for the life of the car can minimize these costs\n\n>Many people finance new cars at higher interest rates\n\nAs stated above, new car financing is generally at better terms than used.\n\n> **insurance premiums and taxes**\n\nInsurance depends.  Quite often, collision coverage is quite a small percentage of insurance cost, so the extra value of a new car will not be that significant in insurance costs.\n\nSales taxes are a percentage of the car's price, so they will boost the CPM by a fixed percentage no matter what.  Some states charge a value based personal property tax on car registrations, which will raise the cost of a new car slightly.",
