  "selftext": "Blue zircon is great and all, but the real scarcity is in the soil market.\n\n**Fundamentals**\n\nThe world needs food.  To grow food, we need soil.  However, [soil is disappearing from farms.](https://www.bbc.com/future/bespoke/follow-the-food/why-soil-is-disappearing-from-farms/)\n\nAt this rate, we will be out of soil in the next couple years.\n\nI have rounded up a few investors behind my local Wendy's.  Together, we are forming a cartel to corner the market on soil.  We have each gone to our wife's boyfriend's house and managed to sneak away with a few cubic feet of dirt.  Soon, we will control the world supply.\n\nJoin me if you want to be part of the revolution.\n\n**Current position:**\n\nAbout 50 cubic feet of dirt\n\nAvg. cost per cubic foot: <$1\n\nTarget price per cubic foot: $10,000\n\nTotal cost basis: $250 AUD\n\nTotal unrealized gainz: 500 billion ",
