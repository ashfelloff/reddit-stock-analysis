  "selftext": "Its not like AI hasn't been around for years now. It's also not like Nvidia just released CUDA and graphic cards capable of doing AI work. Its also not like Machine Learning is new.\n\n* Machine Learning has been used in scientific research for a long time now (atleast in Physics/Astronomy).\n* Look at Cyberpunk video game. It released in 2020 and started development in 2016. It used AI to lip-sync character conversations into 10 languages. This was back in 2016-2020.\n* GPT-1,2,3 was released in 2018/19/20. Here's a part from wiki about LLM - \"Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention because OpenAI at first deemed it too powerful to release publicly, out of fear of malicious use.\".\n\nLooking at that Sam Altman/Microsoft etc didn't think they should pour trillions into it or just buy all Nvidia chips? Nvidia earnings actually went down in 2019 lol.\n\nAll these companies knew about it years before. So what changed? Is it just that ChatGPT became public and people realised what it could do? or is there a more technical reason that justifies this?\n\nI looked at dot-com bubble. That was spurred by creation of public Web which became accessible in 1993 - so naturally only after 1993 could people even imagine websites etc and then there were new startups blah blah. Something, that couldn't have been anticipated, actually changed to cause the hype and new funding.\n\nBut this time around it seems to me like nothing fundamentally changed. Did companies/investors just overlook use of AI until 2022? Then looking at ChatGPT suddenly realised they were missing out on a trillion dollar industry that will revolutionize human lives? I am really confused about what happened. So please ELI5.\n\nEdit - I will summarize what people are saying in comments and share this tweet someone commented- [https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603](https://x.com/buccocapital/status/1828407633541296603)\n\nMost important part is about scaling laws and emergent properties. Essentially - AI is showing unexpectedly \"intelligent\" properties at higher compute powers (emergent properties) and these companies now believe that this will scale at even higher compute powers. No one know what will happen. It might happen that the emergent properties was a one time thing and AI may never get more intelligent or it will continue and we get a \"Digital God\" (according to the tweet).\n\nSo something did change in last couple of years, and the reason no one invested before was because no one saw it coming and it was an emergent property.",

Nobody thought that transformers could beat the Turing test, but if you took GPT3 and scaled it by 100x you indeed can. Where can we go from now? It's unclear, but the world might be very different than what it is now.\n\nThere are also no natural laws to neural scaling laws either. There are physical limits in how fast you can make planes or rockets because of fuel density and there are physical limits to how big buildings can get because of gravity and wind effects. There are no such limits for how intelligent transformers can get (or that we've discovered) - you could potentially have a trillion trillion parameter transformer that sucks up as much energy as the USA and still might not hit the limit of how smart these things can get.",

The release of GPT was exciting, but only in academic circles. OpenAI paying tons of labor hours to web scrape and label data for ChatGPT (not to be confused with GPT) was putting their money where their mouth was. ChatGPT 3 and 4 being the first models that really mimic human English speech and are also generally factualy correct are then later what got them accepted as impressive by the less technical investing public. \n\nChatGPT is a product based on the core GPT algorithm. It was originally developed more as a proof of concept and a case study than a true alternative to Google or something. Because Microsoft is the biggest financer of OpenAI, it's all been productized. Because GPT is open source, other products like Google Bard, musk's Gronk on X, and Microsoft/Github Copilot exist on the same core technologies with variations in implementation. They are *not* just giving you ChatGPT in new clothes, they are giving you a brand new ChatGPT. Almost everyone else saying some shit about GPT or AI in their earnings calls are throwing white smoke because it will pump their stock price for a day, when in reality it'll probably just be paying some absurd fee to openAI for horrible customer service bot that can't do what they want it to do. The best use cases for GPT will probably have to be academic until everyone stops throwing it in everything they make just for the sake of it.",

I'm a software engineer and I am quite skeptical of it's capabilities.\n\n\nIn 2022 with ChatGPT you basically had ML development packaged into a consumer accessible form for the first time. This meant that people who weren't exposed to \"AI\" before now saw it really for the first time. On top of that, the LLM form of AI is very good at language, and the human brain is predisposed to interpret something that communicates with us as intelligent. Lastly, for decades we have been trained by science fiction to associate the term AI to mean sentient computers, so marketing these products as AI means we are, again, predisposed to think highly of them. Notice how a whole new term, AGI, started being thrown around to distinguish from what we have today.\n\nNow I'm not saying AI is useless. Far from it, AI in its current form is an invaluable tool. However, it doesn't even come close to living up to the hype. Moreover, progress isn't as rapid as the companies hype it up to be, and true reliable accuracy may not be possible with current technology. In short, AGI is likely 10-20 years away at minimum, not around the corner.\n\nSo yeah, it's a bubble and it's gonna pop.",

Moore's Law basically states that computing power doubles roughly every 24 mos.  Yann LeCun created CNNs decades ago.  CNNs are computationally intensive.  They really didn't make an impact until advances in hardware unlocked their power.  \n\nCompute power has crossed a threshold that will allow software exponential growth in capability.\n\nHowever, the next limiting factor may be electricity.  Some say that GAI won't be achieved until we can solve the electricity problem.\n\nOnce that is unlocked, then AI scientists will be created.  On average, it takes 28 years to create 1 human scientist.  Human scientists can only work 8-12 hours per day.  Once Ai Scientists are achieved, we can create 100 millions of them who will work 24/7/365.  Every unanswered question in the universe will eventually be solved.  Every human biological mystery will be revealed.\n\nEvery major company and country knows that the group who wins the intelligence race, wins it all.\n\nPresently, the US is the most dominant.  We are about 3-10 yrs ahead of China, next closest competitor.\n\nThere aren't any other countries with the brain talent, manufacturing infrastructure, financial resources, and electricity to compete.  Ever wondered why China pushed so hard to move to renewable energy that its now surpassed the US?  Renewable energy, esp solar, is \"limitless\".  Fossil energy is not.\n\nMaybe India and the EU have an equal standing behind China but for different reasons don't have much of a chance in this race.

All that stuff could be done later once the use case was defined.

This can lead to much more capable personal devices.\n- truly generative AI is now a thing. Videos, audio, computer code, art, and somewhat conversation. Before transformers we were mostly just in the world of predictive AI. This can enable rapid content creation.\n- Advances in high power GPU processing like Nvidia Blackwell will dramatically reduce training time (to allow faster iteration) but also enable massively powerful cloud based AI. \n- embedding has greatly improved in the last couple years and helped alleviate some of the problems with NNs overfitting to data (though this is still a challenge).\n\nFrom my experience most companies are still in the tinkering phase with AI. Most of them have about enough expertise to start trying things out but not enough to actually advance the art. Put the tools in the hands of billions and great things will happen eventually.",

The professor asked if anyone had used a chatbot that could effectively answer their questions, and no one raised their hand. At that time, it was widely accepted that chatbots were pretty terrible and unusable. The following semester, after ChatGPT came out, I had another class where we were assigned to create a chatbot. Since the professor had planned the syllabus before ChatGPT’s release, we had to use older technology. We had to get people to try our chatbots. Everyone just wondered why we couldn’t \"just use ChatGPT.\"\n\nChatGPT was a game changer in conversational AI, paving the way for the current wave of Generative AI advancements.",

Then those effects subsided, only for the regional bank crap to occur and ultimately lead to what worked in 2022 getting thrown in the trash completely and for us to have a 2019-esque type year where the S&P decided to laugh at diminishing liquidity and recover most of its 2022 bear market losses.\n\nIt was really May-ish I believe where AI really started becoming a factor, but what happened from the start of 2023 through to July 10th has widespread thanks that can be spread around. Like I don't think the S&P trades like how it traded in 2019 without the Fed/Treasury being spooked over what was going on with regional banks and them stepping in, and you're still seeing complaints about tech layoffs close to 2 years after the cutbacks started.",
