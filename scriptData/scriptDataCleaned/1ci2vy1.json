              "body": "\"aid\" by mostly paying American contractors. The aid is money given to buy or produce the weapons from their military complex and deliver them. Its not like the money is leaving the nation. \nEven with the current huge aid package, it's still less than 10% of total military spending. \n\nSo let's put this into perspective. \n\nSome EU countries have spend above 2% of their GDP just for Ukraine and are perfectly healthy, while the USA spends 4% of GDP for military and of those 4% - 10% or 0.4 of it are spend for aid, which doesn't even leave the country. Yeah I would say aid is not a factor.",
