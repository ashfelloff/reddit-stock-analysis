China controlling all of the silicon and the cost is super cheap thus giving them super cheap solar production.\n\nThe debate or argument that bloomberg is proposing here is that tariffs are the reason for the US manufacturing situation turning negative.",

              "body": "Tariffs are not the only reason. When you look at the total cost of the goods (which is essentially what tariffs add on to), labor is one of the biggest factors. When a Chinese company can hire workers for pennies on the dollar compared to other nations, that drives manufacturing out. Tariffs are also reactionary and defensive, reactionary here  meaning there has to already be something to be able to slap a tariff on. By the time tariffs hit, most of the manufacturing had already left. Defensive here means, the tariff is added in order to support domestic production (when all modern militaries run on chips, you best fucking believe it concerns national security).\n\nTherefore, I postulate that Bloomberg's argument is wrong. It points to the wrong thing. Tariffs are NOT the reason for US manufacturing going negative, but rather the result from it. The reason is largely that for years, China has either used forced labor, has much cheaper labor (an almost non-existent minimum wage), or their companies have subcontracted out to even cheaper labor.",

              "body": "U.S. companies face a range of practical challenges when trying to compete with Chinese manufacturers in the solar industry. These challenges stem from differences in scale, production costs, and market conditions that have developed over time.\n\n1. Economies of Scale\n\nChinese manufacturers benefit from producing at a much larger scale, which helps them lower their production costs significantly. When companies produce in larger quantities, they can spread out their costs, making each unit cheaper. U.S. manufacturers, by comparison, operate on a smaller scale, which makes it harder to reduce costs in the same way.\n\n2. Government Support\n\nChinese manufacturers receive significant financial support, such as incentives and favorable financing, that helps them reduce costs and expand quickly. In the U.S., while there are policies to support clean energy, they may not always provide the same level of direct financial backing to solar manufacturers. This can make it more challenging for U.S. companies to grow at the same rate.\n\n3. Production Costs\n\nLabor and production costs in China tend to be lower, which allows Chinese companies to manufacture products at a lower cost. U.S. companies often face higher production costs due to wages, regulatory requirements, and other factors. This makes it more expensive for them to compete on price in the global market.\n\n4. Access to Raw Materials and Supply Chains\n\nChinese companies often control much of the supply chain for solar materials, which makes their production more efficient. They can source materials domestically or through well-established global partnerships. U.S. companies, on the other hand, may rely more on global supply chains, which can lead to higher transportation costs and exposure to supply chain disruptions.\n\n5. Investment in Innovation\n\nChinese manufacturers have made significant investments in research and development (R&D) for solar technology. This focus on innovation allows them to continually improve production efficiency and reduce costs. While U.S. companies also invest in technology, they may not have the same level of resources or incentives to invest at the scale seen in China.\n\n6. Manufacturing Infrastructure\n\nChina has developed a large industrial ecosystem that supports solar manufacturing. This includes easy access to suppliers, logistics, and infrastructure designed to help manufacturers operate efficiently. In the U.S., some of this large-scale manufacturing infrastructure has diminished over time, making it harder for companies to scale quickly and efficiently.\n\n7. Policy Environment\n\nThe policy environment in China is designed to support large-scale solar production, which includes streamlined processes and clear goals for the renewable energy sector. In the U.S., policies supporting clean energy exist but can vary by state or region, which may add complexity for manufacturers trying to plan long-term investments.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe differences in scale, cost structures, and support systems between U.S. and Chinese companies create significant hurdles for American manufacturers in the solar industry. While U.S. companies remain innovative and competitive in certain areas, overcoming these challenges would likely require a mix of investments in manufacturing, infrastructure, and innovation, along with policies that help support long-term growth in solar production. These factors are more related to business and market dynamics than political decisions.",

The only reason why the argument stands is because of how poorly we've done with EV charging infrastructure. \n\n\"In the US, EVs account for around 7% of new car sales (as of 2023), while globally, EVs make up about 14% of new car sales, with Europe and China leading the adoption. The US lags behind these regions, especially China, where EV sales dominate at over 25% of new car sales.\"",

Second, in many factories less than 5% of the workers are permanent full time.  There are labor pools that are drawn from daily.  Third, the cost of compliance and environmental regs are completely different.  I could go on but you get the point.  Tariffs on their own will not fix the problem, but they are a way to get other countries to the negotiating table.
