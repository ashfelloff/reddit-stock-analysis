I was alerted to it from a squeeze angle, I also noticed that the big guys own most of the float, I think meme season is coming so I figured they'll pump the stocks their friends own first with a sprinkle of biopharma magic. I've been loading up on the 45$ Jan 2025 calls so I'm in it for a bit longer. I hear rumors of a buyout at 80$ a share but that could just be noise. If the market cap hits 30 billion thats like 250ish dollar a share. This new deal changes things so who knows. Could be funny.",

Like I said I saw who owned the stock and thought there is no way this is going out of business with shareholders like these. And when you have that high short interest at an all time low with no chance of bankruptcy in a market like biopharma where you are a headline away from a mega pump I felt pretty good buying leaps.",
