  "selftext": "I've spent the last year learning option structures, this is after years of learning about trading, taking courses, learning about fundamentals, how the fed works, etc... I'm up 23% ytd after today's losses.\n\nFrom my experience, what's made me the most profit are bets where time was on my side. Holding shares or even contracts where you're purchasing so much time the market cannot price it accurately.\n\n1. Buying and holding the fundamental runners, market leaders. Understanding the margins of a company, EPS beats, forward guidance, PEG ratio, P/E ratio, ROCE, etc... Buying shares of the companies can get behind and hold.\n2. Buying LEAPs usually almost 2 years out, then selling monthlies. This is a diagonal spread, it's a poor man's covered call. I won't go into the mechanics but simply this has been extremely profitable for me with options because imo time's on my side.\n3. Buying OTM calendars sometimes LEAPs, then selling weeklies or monthlies. This is a horizontal spread, cheaper than the poor man's covered call usually by half the cost but same concept except now price is building the LEAP that's OTM which then will go ITM.\n\nWhether shares or options after being around the block my most profitable trades seemingly are when time is on my side, long term plays. Shares to hold a life time or LEAPS to open spreads with and sell monthlies to nullify risk, using ITM or OTM LEAPs basically PMCC's or calendars.\n\nWith this said, I'm tired of playing earning's, looking at charts, predicting what'll happen next based off news events, seeing market get rocked by little comments, I want my own time back! Not lose time to the market, which really sucking the life out of us. Imo buying & holding longer timeframes achieves that, it's something I've forgotten and need to get back to for a simpler life. Not financial advice just years of lost time, tons of knowledge, not enough to show for it, and now retiring for longer holds and leaving this short term mess for more peaceful life.",

The big tech companies of today may not be the best performers tomorrow, but if you have $2mil +, only in tech, I wouldn't be worried about retiring without selling immediately into SP500 because the risk of all the big tech crashing and retirement plans failing is no greater than SP500 crashing.

TSLA, Visa, GE Aerospace, KO are also reporting that day (July 22nd) and that's not the entire list. I could go on. Next Tuesday is a BIG DAY and next week is a big week. There's usually pullback for a lot of stocks prior to earnings due to options volatility and hedging.\n\nAlso, this pullback gives high-flying companies a better opportunity to go higher after earnings. Most stocks at their 52-week highs - and with correspondingly high P/E ratios - either go down or remain flat after earnings. Higher stock prices = higher expectations.\n\nMy very amateur prediction is that tech mega caps recover and go higher after next Tuesday.\n\nETA: **Correction** - MSFT reports earnings on July 30th, so almost 2 weeks from now. NASDAQ's earnings calendar has them tentatively on the 22nd, not sure why.\n\nSomeone said that the S&P 500 was trading something like 15% above its highest-ever moving average, if I recall correctly, so that may also have prompted a pullback.
