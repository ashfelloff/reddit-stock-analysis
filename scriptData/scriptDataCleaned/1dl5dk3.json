Options can be quick money but those who buy further out and their options gains every day beforehand are the early birds that make the most. I bought 0dte expiration puts and sold the second it made a profit for the easiest 300$ of my life, since it was pretty obvious it would be red day. I'd start putting options you'd think are reasonable and put them on a watch list or paper trade them for some practice before actual buying.
