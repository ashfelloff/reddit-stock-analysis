  "selftext": "* Tesla stock is in a \"quagmire,\" the longtime investor Ross Gerber has said.\n* He said he'd sold about $60 million in Tesla shares amid growing concerns over the carmaker.\n* Gerber told Yahoo Finance that no one seemed interested in buying Tesla's cars anymore.\n\n  \nOne of Tesla's longtime investors has dumped about half his stake in Elon Musk's carmaker.\n\n\n\nThe shareholder, Ross Gerber, has said that's because no one seems interested in buying Tesla's cars or robots.\n\n\n\nGerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\n\n\n\n\"Over time, I've just been sort of lowering my position, because I just don't have the same confidence that they're going to achieve the goals that were set out for Tesla several years ago and even recently, which is really to sell more cars,\" Gerber said, dismissing bullish talk on Tesla's robotics and full-self-driving tech. \"That's just a distraction from the fact that they need to sell cars, this year, and next year, and the year after, because none of this is coming anytime soon,\" he added.\n\n\n\nOther Tesla investors have also grown skeptical and impatient over the car company's trajectory. Tesla's stock is down 13% this year, largely because of declining sales, rising competition in China, and drama surrounding Musk's legal battles.\n\n\n\nGerber said the used-car market was swarmed with old Teslas, adding that he'd been unable to offload his own Tesla at what he deemed a fair value.\n\n\n\n\"It's really a quagmire where you have the best products in an industry but a CEO who doesn't actually work there, who doesn't try to sell the cars,\" Gerber said, adding: \"We've seen sales go down, and that's what's happening. Sales are going down. If you're expecting a great quarter, you're wrong. They're not selling any Teslas here, other than basically, discount, discount, discount.\"\n\n\n\nAnd while analysts have made the case that the company is being undervalued as an AI firm, Gerber said artificial intelligence was unlikely to save the company. He speculated that demand would be poor for Tesla's humanoid robots, given doubts over Musk amid his chaotic revamp of Twitter into X.\n\n\n\n\"The simplest way to do it is, go around to your neighbors and ask them, 'How many of you would buy a humanoid robot built by Elon Musk?' And the answer is zero, OK. Nobody wants a robot from Elon Musk. Why? Who would trust it?\" Gerber said, adding: \"The last thing I need is some robot built by Elon Musk in my house, so I don't know if they thought about the marketing of this at all yet.\"\n\n\n\nMusk's leadership of Tesla has been under rising scrutiny from investors and lawmakers over the past few years. Most recently, Sen. Elizabeth Warren sent a letter to Tesla's board of directors, calling on the executives to ensure Musk was meeting his financial responsibilities to Tesla shareholders.\n\n  \nSource: [businessinsider.com](http://businessinsider.com)",

Something isn't adding up. \n\n>Gerber, who's been a loud critic of Musk since the Tesla CEO acquired Twitter in 2022, said he had sold about 60 million worth of his Tesla shares. He told Yahoo Finance in a recent interview that his investment fund still had a $50 million stake in the company.\n\nIs the miss-match because Gerber personally owns a small amount of Tesla stock (1k shares would be about 200k of Tesla stock) but his investment fund owns a bunch more? \n\nI guess if this was the case then one could say that 'Gerber sold 60m of Tesla stock mostly on behalf of others'.

This isn't even an argument, it's a verifiable reality you can get to via Google in a couple of minutes.\n\nElon haters don't seem to understand how dominant Tesla's position is, even when they're losing market share everywhere they're still at like 55-60% in the US which is the biggest market there is. Share is a lot smaller in Europe but they're still the biggest player, keep in mind they also have the best margins in the market by far, most other companies are bleeding money on EVs while Tesla is making money. Volkswagen's revenue last year for example was over 3 times what Tesla's was, yet their profits were pretty much the same, and Volkswagen is mostly ICEs, they sell EVs at a loss.\n\nAdd to this that Tesla has been selling the same product for a while now, whenever a new regular model comes out you can expect sales to skyrocket again. When it comes to FSD which people like to shit on... I mean...\n\n> Nvidia CEO predicts 'every single car' will have autonomous ability and reveals which company is 'far ahead' in process. Jensen Huang spoke candidly on the future of cars, saying that most will have self-driving capabilities. “Tesla is far ahead in self-driving cars,” he said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\nAdd to that the fact that people also like to shit on Tesla not being a tech company then you get this: https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/servers/elon-musk-shows-off-cortex-ai-supercluster-first-look-at-teslas-50000-nvidia-h100s\n\nThey're just ahead on a lot of stuff, almost everyone who actually tried FSD (ignore reddit trolls who say they had when they can't even afford these vehicles) pretty much loves it and that's just the beginning.\n\nLong response for no reason but w/e.",

The original Model S run (pre-X) where the cars went UP in value because of production woes. With early adopters urging Musk to stop trying to scale production to \"protect our investments\" because they were pretty much hoping the company would flounder so they would have a \"rare\" car to sell to collectors. I remember people saying shit like \"THIS IS NOT A CAR IT IS AN INVESTMENT.\" and getting angry here on this site if I suggested the model 3 would be successful. (this was 2016)\n\nThen the insane car market in 2021-2023 where model Ys were selling used up to 100,000. People were paying double for EVs. I met a guy who bragged he paid $50k over MSRP and said that's why his is better than mine.\n\nI could have sold my car, paid off the loan, and had $40k in my pocket at one point. Which to me was insane, and I loved my car too much to do that. In hindsight it may have been the better choice lol.\n\nThis isnt happening again with these cars and anyone who thinks it will is delusional.\n\nIf anything the current glut of used Teslas on the market is a good thing for people looking for an affordable EV.\n\nWhere Tesla is messing up is not creating value in their newer cars. a 2018 and a 2023 are different, but not so much the consumer knows this. It looks the exact same.\n\nSo why buy a 2024 that has a headlight change when you can get a 2018 or 2019 that appears mostly the same and is still fast for $15k-$18k used, with a $4000 instant rebate?",

This makes existing customers  less likely to recommend, and less likely to stay a customer for the next car purchase. \n\n\n\n4) Elon public brand and personal world view impacting customer who vote with cash.  The Tesla brand is also damaged by all the above items on lack of service and failed promises.  These are all at the direction and from the mouth of elon.  So even if you remove the fire brand portion of the issues of elon, you are still left with a mountain of lies and failed promises. \n\n\n\n5) The stock cannot trade as a Ai company with no real Ai shipping and not finished. \n\n\n\n6) FSD is way behind waymo and the rest of industry in Ai driving so you can not trade it as a robot taxi company \n\n  \nThese are the key movers for Tesla in the future.  Elon can shut up and get back to work and resolve half of these by reversing course and fixing charging, sales, and service.  Elon can stop promising more than he can deliver, and make it right with the existing customers with transfers or upgrades as needed like he said.  Elon can step away from Tesla and let a strong leader walk in and start to do all of the above and remove his fire brand from the company.  \n\n\n\nThere are a lot of variables on what he can do, but we all know what he will do which is keep shit posting.",
