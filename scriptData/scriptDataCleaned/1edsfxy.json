If they only get one or a few chances to launch enough to overwhelm, then it's gone, why be in a rush to use them? Strategy says you milk the threat for as long as possible. Once it's used they have no deterrent.\n\n>Rockets that are heading into the most populated areas will always be intercepted, rest are free to land. \n\nSo why was the rocket allowed to land on a crowded soccer field? It had a big public bunker right next to the crater. They don't usually install bunkers in empty areas.\n\n>Air superiority always wins in this age.\n\nNot anymore. See Ukraine. Russia has massive air superiority and it  is a total non factor. Man portable surface to air missiles totally nullify air superiority, at least for air support in a ground protracted ground war. \n\nOne off air strikes are different. You can unexpectedly swoop in and out once for a high value target. But the same could be said for Hezbolla drones.",
