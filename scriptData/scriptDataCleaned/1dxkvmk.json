The ATM call/put straddle costs $10 ($5 for each option). \n\nSo, if it trades in the range expected, your gains will not offset your losses.

They donât even care about guidance or whether something else like a stock split/buyback was expected. Or the action/sentiment pre earnings. DELL/MU are good examples here. For DELL after Q1 earnings it was an 110$ stock it traded all the way to 160$ before earnings. Yes they beat expectations but it was not a smoke in any way to justify the 50$ rally pre earnings. On top of the fact their data center revenue was barely a beat. For MU similar set up,  high run up into earnings, expectations beat but nothing special. And a stock buyback was being priced in too. \n\nIâm looking at CMG next earnings. Depends on how it trades into earnings though. If itâs <59 I think the market would be overreacting to this whole portion size BS. Especially because I think itâs bringing attention to them if anything.

I thought they were a sleeper and would kill it with AI frenzy. But I was too chicken to buy the contracts. 4k could have grossed ~120k had I done so (did in my paper account.) So then, like a fool, I tried the next ER. I was up 100% the day before and sold all but one contract. Letting that one run was a mistake and seriously cut my net gain short. Played MU next and just finished realizing the loss there. The lessons I took from it, I shouldnât have had to experience, as Iâd certainly been warned. Now I buy with some time leading up to the event and sell into the volatility just before and realize profits immediately. There is always another play in the current bull market. Also, generally buying some time and using LEAPS for capital management has served me well. (Position sizing and concentration with some diversification are the other two things that have helped me this far.) People here have been incredibly helpful.
