Go look at how much of their GDP comes from TSM and tell me if they wanna fuck with 66% of that.\n\nYes. We are profoundly reliant on TSMC’s chips. But those chips don’t exist in an invasion of Taiwan. They have what we need, *but we allow them to exist to provide what we need* If the building is no longer safe from fires, can anything be cooked anymore if the kitchen goes up in flames?\n\nLet’s say Trump actually goes crazy on Taiwan and sparks massive fear Taiwan about Taiwan’s defense guarantees. Guess where that sends TSMC stock? Down the shitter\n\nToo many downvotes from differing opinions, from people balls deep in semi calls🫣\n\nI think Trump and Taiwan will likely reach some form of agreement or at the very least the “make a deal” sentiment from Trump won’t stick around long. Even the most regarded or elitist politicians around his cabinet or circle won’t let him fuck around with the semis much. Especially because AI is basically an arms race, has security implications, warfare technology implications… No one’s gonna fuck with something that’s become relevant to a trillion dollar a year military industrial complex of all things\n\nTSM historically has been very sensitive to China invasion sentiment, however we are seeing this sentiment in the midst of the great AI Pump so who knows. If you think TSMC has a great earnings report coming up soon, the market may froth again and start to forget about his comments *(which may not help you if you’re balls deep in 0 DTEs right now)*\n\nJust my two cents. Agree or disagree on Trump’s stance, I’m just making a comment on the political leverage of it, not whether it’s a good decision",

And the tarrif chat on Trump side saying 60%-100% on China. Is yikes. Another trade war with China will hurt everything. TSMC is building like 4 manufacturing plants in USA but keeping R&D where they are. \nThe status quo is good for USA led global market. \nThat’s why China makes such claims over Taiwan. I don’t think China can take Taiwan without huge blowback esp internally; China has maintained to Chinese people Taiwan is a part of China. So any war would be hard to sell to them, since they say they belong to them anyway, not sure the Chinese public would take China on China deaths on their screens well. Screens made with TSMC chips! \nI like TSMC, Intel, NVDIA, regardless (but that’s gone up so much respectively is a bit of a worry to keep chasing it). \nTrump chat about spending is very much in keeping with rhetoric of NATO payments so it’s not a huge shock. There is also the law that the USA must provide Taiwan arms to defend itself and I don’t see that law being revoked. So I’m not sure what any of this means apart from what others have said; that a tweet or social truth post has the power now to move the markets. Gambling times ahead!",
