On a sequential basis, revenue increased 8% as demand improved in several end markets.",

Finally knocked out some of my higher priced shares and I'm in a better position with AMD than I was a week ago.  The drop so far is now down back below my average.  I will scoop up some more shares down here.  Mm shares below my average mm gimme.\n\nI just trade expensive shares like this fractionally.  I had worked up to AMD 6 shares (usually in 0.1 increments) as it dropped recently, then sold the upper half ASAP at bare minimum profit on the way back up.  Now I just have 3 \\~$157 shares.  Almost in the green with it still.  Tempted to buy a whole share right now after hours.\n\n**Edit**: Just to clarify since it's not clear to me why I'm being downvoted, my main focus is on building a strong position with shares bought below my average price. When I sell a few shares at minimal profit, it's simply to reduce my cost basis by offloading higher-priced shares. This way, I hold onto shares I consider well-positioned for gains, while ensuring my average cost remains as low as possible.  The goal, really, is for every single stock in my portfolio to be green in terms of total g/l, while at the same time, if things don't go well (which they sometimes do not), trying to reach but not exceed -$3k in realized losses.  These are the incentives that have been put in place AFAIK, so I'm just trying to maximize the possible utility within them.",
