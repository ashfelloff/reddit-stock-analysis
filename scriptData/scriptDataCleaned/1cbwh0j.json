Multiple is a larger set than single. lol. \n\nCars already use multiple sensors in an array of ways of determining road and vehicle conditions. \n\nI see no reason to stick to just vision when it comes to mapping the world around it. Vision is limited to line of sight, whereas lidar can map the world in front of objects blocking its vision. \n\nThere's a reason Waymos self driving is so good, and it's not just \"geolocking\".  And yes, all those externally mounted sensors are ugly but it's in development, those sensors could eventually be build into the car (since Waymo doesn't build cars and doing that now would be unnecessarily burdensome while they're doing R&D on the software.)",
