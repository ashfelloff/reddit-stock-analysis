  "selftext": "Im not promising tendies with this one but there’s definitely a good theory behind all of this. But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.\n\n## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes\n\nLet’s start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn’t matter much towards the end. But it’s true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria’s cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT. \n\n## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry\n\nLosing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you’re the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit’s about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.\n\n## PMTA Registered List\n\nAltria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don’t even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They’re all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.\n\nSo Altria’s bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it… until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.\n\n## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape\n\nSo Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you’re underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA’s tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they’ll get it if they approve.\n\n## Altria’s On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor\n\nIn case you didn’t know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they’re expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).\n\nOne of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.\n\n## Altria’s “Moving Beyond Smoking” Plan\n\nAltria is dead set on its new campaign, “[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)”. They know smoking rates are declining so they’re repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That’s why Morningstar says they’re worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it’s a value stock.\n\n## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev\n\nAltria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they’re out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we’ll be eating tendies and banging their wives.\n\nPositions $MO 47.5c 6/21, 50c 6/21, $PM 100c 4/26",

The vape market is too big to ban. The triton decision gives the vape manufacturers the ammo they need to fight the fda on pmta and they vape lobby is organizing(just beat GA ban, pushed back FL ban, veto campaign that will probably succeed in VA) Louisiana ban was delayed indefinitely, Oklahoma isn’t enforcing, Cali ban had no effect at all, Texas marketing ban didn’t do what they want manufacturers just rebranded for Texas. \n\nThis is a huge uphill David and Goliath fight that the vape industry is winning. \n\nThat being said I’m gunna go ahead and throw some MO shares in. \n\nI work for one of the companies being sued I’ve been in the industries 10years and do know what’s happening on the ground in all of the states referenced",
