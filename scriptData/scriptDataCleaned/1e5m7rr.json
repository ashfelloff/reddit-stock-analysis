  "selftext": "Hey, I posted on here 3 years ago that I was going to break up my $3k investment into $SHOP, $AMZN & $TSLA, I was 21 at the time‚Ä¶ well I wanted to update yall on it. \nI‚Äôm currently 24, just graduated with a bachelors in accounting, going for my MACC degree next. I should be done and ready for the workforce this time next year, hopefully!\n\nI have been investing consistently through university, I have gotten passed my new milestone of $21k+ \n\nMy biggest positions are: \n\n$COST\n$TSLA\n$GOOG\n$AMZN\n$MSFT \n\n\nI have the Roth set up with just VOO & SCHD and have been reinvesting every dividend payout for the past 2 years! \n\nI hope to hit $100k in stocks before I hit 30 and then I‚Äôm going to start buying land and have a savings account (7% interest) in Guatemala. Once done with that, coming back to buy a duplex over here and hopefully house hack so I can lower my expenses and hit my FIRE goals by 45 years old. 2045 is my retirement goal. ",
