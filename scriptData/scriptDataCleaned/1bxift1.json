  "title": "JPOW Says He’s Confused About The Economy ",
  "score": 430,
  "selftext": "JPOW often plays the dummy card when he has to explain the economy particularly around the jobs and CPI reports.\n\nJust like on WSB, there are some topics we just can’t touch even though it’s pretty obvious why the jobs report came in smashing estimates.\n\nAnd for that reason alone, the market responded positively since everyone took out their calculators and backed out one statistic to arrive at the true jobs report out. \n\nOne other thing to consider over the weekend is the alarm bell the United Way is sounding in regards to poverty lines that haven’t moved much since 2010. This population is called ALICE and increased 18% from 2010 to 36 million people in 2021. They haven’t reported an update since, which is huge red flag. So you know those numbers are now jacked to the tits.\n\nThis is a data set that predicted the subprime mortgage crisis, baby formula shortage and now they are saying there is a big fucking problem. \n\nSo the debate is whether or not that actually matters for the stock market.\n\nEven though it sucks ass, I still think we ride. The biggest returns are missed when you sit on the sidelines with somebody else’s shlong in your hand trying to time bottoms. \n\nPlus if you aren’t bullish on the solar eclipse you can fuck off right back to your shitty planet Nibiru. If you need gold hit up Peter Schiff. \n\nWe don’t care about that anymore. In 10 years we will be eating your galaxy for lunch with Nvidia chips and a chocolate frosty. ",

Yeah if I was these folks I’d think the economy was doing ok, and occasionally you read online that the poors are complaining again. It’s not like they ever drive through those parts of town to see the reality, or even see those people face to face at their jobs. So what do they do? Keep pumping stocks, and to them why would they not? Since they own such a high percent of the wealth of the country, if they are buying stocks then stock market will go up. Only thing that scares these folks is if banks get in trouble, because that is an assault on their class and then they actually see the reality of what is happening all around.
