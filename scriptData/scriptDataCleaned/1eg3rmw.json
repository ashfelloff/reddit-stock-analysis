  "title": "AMD Delivers Upbeat Sales Forecast as It Shifts Into AI Chips",
  "score": 282,
  "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. gave an upbeat revenue forecast for the current quarter, signaling that its new artificial intelligence processors are helping bolster growth.\n\nRevenue will be roughly $6.7 billion in the third quarter, the chipmaker said in a statement Tuesday. Analysts estimated $6.62 billion on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe outlook suggests that AMD is making headway in its pursuit of Nvidia Corp., which dominates the market for so-called AI accelerators â€” chips used to develop artificial intelligence models. Nvidia has capitalized on booming demand to send its shares and stock price soaring over the past year, becoming the worldâ€™s most valuable chipmaker in the process. Now AMD is looking to make inroads with its own lineup, called MI300.\n\nAMD is Nvidiaâ€™s nearest rival in the market, but still trailing by a wide margin. The hope is to gain more of the money that data-center operators such as Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. are pouring into the creation of AI tools.\n\nAMD shares rose about 2% in extended trading following the announcement. They had earlier closed at $138.44 in New York, leaving them down 6.1% for the year.\n\nAMDâ€™s quarterly report kicks off a week of earnings updates from large semiconductor makers. Qualcomm Inc., Arm Holdings Plc and Intel Corp. all report numbers this week, and it comes at a delicate time for the chip industry. Investors have been selling shares of the companies after a dramatic run-up earlier this year.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/amd-delivers-upbeat-sales-forecast-as-it-shifts-into-ai-chips",

Fairly sure google already makes more AI Servers/chips then AMD.\n\nNvidia will slow down as far as selling to the top 6 companies of the world sooner or later. AMD will be much sooner. None of these companies like the idea of transfering their stock holders wealth to anothers.\n\nEdit: People got mad at me but this is how it is at this moment.\n\nWhen people saw AMD do well - they immediately invested in Nvidia, not AMD.",

      "body": "AMD is competitive with Nvidia hardware tech wise. The problem is that developers have been educationally invested into Nvidia software to work on AI products. Nvidia software was the best tbf. And because Nvidia doesn't allow other hardware to use the software commercially, companies have to buy Nvidia cards. \n\nAMD did try successfully to support the inofficial use of Nvidia software for their hardware by supporting unaffiliated devs who made it possible but since large companies can't use them officially, they can't create products with it.\n\nWill be interesting how AMD can fix that bc devs will unlikely be willing to move over to AMD software when they are already experts in Nvidia software. Similar problem existed when Android and Apple dominated the mobile apps market. Noone could pull the devs to new platforms \n \nOne possibility could be companies/job market pressuring devs to adopt AMD because they can't buy nvidia hardware with the shortage on supply. But without machine learning libraries adopted or recreated for other tools, it is not practical for devs to switch over.\n\n(Supplement words with Cuda API and machine learning Libraries, which are the crucial software advantage other companies have trouble competing with)",
