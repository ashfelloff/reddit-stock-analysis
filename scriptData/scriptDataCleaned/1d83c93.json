  "selftext": "I think all the other Cybersecurity Companies like S, PANW, NET shit the bed because CRWD has been eating their cake. It’s not because “Cyber Spending is down” or threats are lesser, it’s because CRWD is going to crush their earnings. They are the staple of Enterprise Cybersecurity. They are going to be theeeeee go-to security product as AI comes in hot. CrowdStrike, just this month announced a strategic partnership with Google Cloud to transform and shape AI Cybersecurity. These are the fuckers that will keep SkyNet in check. Also, election year. I got sick of hearing cyber threat this cyber that last elections - CRWD is going to cash in.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs such, based on my DD above, this is my first real YOLO that meets the terms and conditions of WSB. See you on the other side. This is over 25% of my Port. Going to go home big or broke.\n\nOh, and I do have a batting record of over 500 according to !banbet if you want to join.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h1zbhslbdl4d1.png?width=1144&format=png&auto=webp&s=3965f91836eb0224c30f45a8b298c64dd6318646",
