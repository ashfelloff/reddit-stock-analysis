I made it all back buy selling CSPs and CC. (From shares assigned by CSPs. Tickets I play are only ones I want to hold long term and only entries are good. They are ASTS, LUNR PLTR (selling CCs on this one) RKLB, S, MPW and OXY. I sell ITM CSP and because I'm more not assigned than not, I have yet to pay margin fees.  I also hold SGOV for that sweet 5% dividends. Slow pace wins the race (well not that slow. Just slow for WSB. My lowest was August 2 at 18k.)\n\n\nI know it's not wow inducing like Odtes but obviously works for me. So I'll keep doing that. ",
