  "title": "Google files an antitrust complaint against Microsoft in the EU for stifling cloud competition",
  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "Google filed an antitrust complaint against Microsoft, alleging that they use unfair licensing contracts to hinder competition in the cloud computing sector. Central to their argument is that Microsoft's licensing terms for its dominant products (Windows Server, Microsoft Office, etc.) \"lock in\" clients to using their Azure cloud service, making it difficult for them to switch to other providers.\n\nGoogle states that these practices force European businesses to pay up to €1 billion annually in licensing penalties to move their workloads to other cloud services. This claim is supported by a 2023 study from CISPE, a cloud computing industry group. Google criticizes these practices as harmful to cybersecurity and innovation.\n\nMicrosoft reached a settlement in July with CISPE members to alter its practices. They responded to Google's complaint by pointing to their previous settlement as a resolution of similar issues.\n\nGoogle, not a member of CISPE and having opted out of the July settlement, continues to press for changes that would allow more freedom for customers to choose their preferred cloud provider without facing restrictive costs or penalties. \n\n[https://www.barrons.com/news/google-files-eu-complaint-over-microsoft-cloud-services-7a636234](https://www.barrons.com/news/google-files-eu-complaint-over-microsoft-cloud-services-7a636234)",
