You cannot use the information in isolation but in combination with other data, this stuff can be very useful for making short-term trade decisions.  I am currently up almost 575K since going YOLO in my options account on short-term QQQ and big 7 PUTS since last Thursday, June 20th - you were warned.  Despite still thinking that QQQ gap at 469 will close, I am now down to just 30% of my PUTS position now since it's no use being too greedy.  I still want that cool mill on the trade, so I am not closing just yet, but I have my trailing stops now in place to protect, hedges and all house money now and more.  Good luck to all.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6ykdd8bcmk8d1.jpg?width=632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eb7cf6f8e63b503ea4b523799d2f2ab2bd4214ac",
