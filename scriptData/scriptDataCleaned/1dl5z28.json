  "title": "Finding Mispriced Call Options",
  "score": 60,
  "selftext": "Yesterday I posted about Tegna (TGNA ), with its high short-interest, and the ungodly amount of share buybacks that the company is doing. Finding that whole situation was mostly unintentional, although now I'm looking for similar management vs. short seller face-offs. My original goal was just to find cheaply priced call options. I didn't expect to find a fight in progress. I figured I would share with the community how I did that. If anyone else has a better strategy for finding them I would also love to hear it.\n\nI was getting annoyed at how often the market seems to price call options in such a manner that profiting off of them seems unlikely. I mean it does make sense that the market makers know what they are doing, at least most of the time. So my first thought was stocks with a high short interest, where the market is expecting a drop, could be a place to find cheap calls.\n\nI used this formula to screen for stocks with a high short interest:\n\nShort interest \\* Price >= Market Cap \\* 0.05\n\nShort interest being the total number of shares sold short multiplied by the share price to get the total dollar amount. Then comparing the dollar amount to the overall market cap.  Screening out stocks with less than 5% short interest when compared to market cap.\n\nI wanted to add another piece though, since while I was looking for cheap call options, I wanted mispricings. Not calls that are cheap because the company is dog shit and dying.\n\nSo there's this other formula I like to use:\n\nCash and Short Term Investments (Quarterly) + Total Receivables (Quarterly) >= Payables and Accrued Expenses (Quarterly) \\* 1.2\n\nWhen the government shut down all the shopping centers in the country because of COVID I got kicked in the balls hard because I owned a debt-heavy Shopping Center REIT that was trying to make a comeback. It went bankrupt. I learned a lesson there. I like that formula since the idea is that the company has enough money to pay its bills for the next year. That would seem common sense but a surprising number of corporations don't.\n\nThis yielded good results, but I noticed that if the stock had high short interests and a high PE, it seemed to indicate disagreement in the market about the stock's value, and the call options would be expensive.\n\nSo I added PE <= 10 to try and narrow it down to just the stocks that the market is willing to sell call options cheaply on.\n\nMuch like Tegna (TGNA) I did find numerous other corporations, including GM, with high short interest that were launching \"accelerated share buybacks\"  I guess it's not that uncommon for corporate CEOs to give the middle finger to short sellers. But in a lot of these cases, the options market again, isn't selling calls cheaply.\n\nI'm keeping my eyes peeled for another opportunity where management is fighting short sellers with massive buybacks and the company is of sound financial strength and calls are cheap. I don't only use the one standard for financial strength. After a stock pops up on the screening and I confirm the calls are selling cheaply, I start to dive into their financial statements. Looking at a lot of other things aside from the corporation's ability to pay their bills for the next year.\n\nThe professionals seem to know what they are doing most of the time. But boy is it sure delicious when they get it wrong. Especially with retail investors, watching, waiting, and ready to strike.\n\nI am curious if anyone else knows of a good way to find cheaply priced calls. My method is a bit labor intensive and slow for me to do.\n\n\\*edit\\*\n\nThere was a good point the comments, I wanted to add that I also look for stock where the market is selling calls that don't expire for a year or more. Long-term call options.\n\nAs I think more about his comment it might also be a good idea to wait for the share buybacks to have gone on for a long time. In the case of TGNA they bought back 25% of their shares last year. Doing this at the beginning of last year wouldn't have worked. So I think that should be a consideration with this strategy too. How long has the fight been dragging on for.",

Fair warning this isn't really a WSB answer.\n\nYou are essentially going down the path of value investing with your strategy.  I don't believe this is an idea strategy for buying call options.  I say this because as we all know... The market can stay irrational longer that you can stay solvent.\n\nIf you continue down this path you are going on and decide to buy long term stocks I think you will find much greater success.  Call options have a short window to become profitable.  If you find a company and you know it's a good buy it still may not increase in price for two years and as a result you may not make money even on a good company.\n\nIf you want to buy calls it might be more efficient to chase speculation and find catalysts.",
