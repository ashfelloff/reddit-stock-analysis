Never Fomo in again and get angry when making investment decisions, because you will get your bootywhole pummeled without lube and it will be brutal\n\nI think what makes this post 10x more brutal is that I'm 28 so this is basically my life savings lol\n\nI was planning on taking a chick out to vacay and buying a property but I guess I'll do that in the next 3 years or so lol\n\nTHE STORY\n\nThe reason why I didn't buy calls again after the stellar earnings report is because after having traded Nvidia for several months, I knew what kind of monster I was dealing with. High sensitivity to federal reserve rate announcements, the war in Gaza, tech shows etc. even when I put a stop loss I'd wake up and see it sell and blow past the stop loss I put it at so if I sell early I lose if I don't sell I lose it was all fucked lol\n\nSo I was like ok let's avoid the stress of waking up and seeing me getting fucked because of a bad position or for it to drop back down to the low thousands I'll just stay out for a bit\n\nLittle did I know, this fucking company would go up 40% over the span of 2 months with only a 20% increase in guidance. How does that even remotely make sense\n\nBut it's clear that stock markets have long abandoned rational movement patterns. It should have stopped around 1150 or 1200 and corrected down to 1100 or something but nah that Bch kept going up\n\nAnd it just pissed me off so much, I could've full ported again and had half a million in the bank and never had to deal with this shit again, but I opted out and opted back in at the worst possible time and in the worst way possible lmao\n\nKnowing my luck this shits gonna trade sideways for the rest of July and then start the ascent on August so I'll buy august calls when they're a little cheaper and do another full port on this earnings. After that I'll probably ride the gains for a week and never touch this shit again lol\n\nEither that or lose every penny ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£\n\nDon't get angry when making trades apes. Lest you become an omega regard like me",

Getting better at ready QQQ 0DTE and timing in right.\n\nIdk how much money you have leftâ€¦there are 125 trading days or so left in the year starting tmrw. You wonâ€™t be able to win with yolos easily. Example from my win trading, I turned 4k into 14k in 3 days. Then another week I made 10k in two days. But the following week, lost 9k one day, 6k, 3k another day . If I had just bet smaller bets of my total account, or used better stop losses, I would have been around to trade another day. Now I have to be super careful with a disciplined plan to make it all back.\n\nIf you make 500 dollars a day on average, starting tomorrow you would have over 60,000 dollars by the end for this year, for example.\n\nIâ€™m in the hole too but trying to get comfortable with small wins, locking in profit, using stop losses and timing.",

I feel like those kind of wins are mostly luck and gambling because unless there is concrete data or anticipated economic data that may bring the index up or down I donâ€™t see a point to it. The only way is earnings plays or riding a rally. I tried riding a rally that never came to be lol",
