Day 2 it went up to £9, with no red prime day sticker but a 10% discount tag. \n\nSome beats headphones were £149 before prime day. With prime day deal they were £139, however they were showing a 66% discount in the prime day discount as the RRP was over £300. The ‘non deal’ price for non-prime members was £149. They are back at £149 now. So the reality is it’s not even a 10% discount on the normal non-prime day price for those headphones, its a 6.67% discount from the normal price on Amazon.
