          "body": "The Federal government gave a lot of money to TSMC to build in Arizona. If the Feds discover that TSMC is incapable of sealing up the leaks in their company with China they will remove funding and those grants they gave TSMC to build the factory will likely be taken back, or they’ll find someone else to fill the factory (not sure if that’s easily done). Pretty sure the Feds are already prepared for this, hence their encouraging of Intel and Motorola to fill the same role as TSMC. Our Feds are essentially trying to find any US company they can to design and produce semiconductors domestically and reduce trade secret exposure as much as possible. If you’re Intel and the government is begging you to take hundreds of billions of dollars, it’s probably only a matter of time before one of our chip manufacturers merges or buys up the market, the government will give it a seal of approval, etc.\n\nSome of the info above may be outdated already, but last I heard the TSMC deal was on shaky grounds. The fact that TSMC has failed to seal up their leaks is sort’ve damning for Taiwan. It means that they’ll struggle to keep the CCP out of their most important business, politically and economically. If they can’t do that then…wtf is Taiwan.",

So they make they make SU-57's in house and try not to be behind. \n\nWhy does France waste time and money on a Rafale in a world where the F-35 exists? Because they can't buy one.

While they enjoy the luxury of being able to source from TSMC now, that might not always be the case. Both the US and EU chip acts address that growing concern with supply chain and national security. Skim through the requirements of those grants and you'll find all sorts of national security stipulations that would make it difficult for international companies to meet. \n\nAs it stands, if the US needed a Northrup / Lockheed like semi fab tomorrow...

Something like 90% of our semiconductors cone through TSMC. The Feds will absolutely move on from them to reduce exposure, but with an official probe (there have been whispers about this at least the last 10 months) they may have to move on as fast as possible. Hence the Feds actually encouraging monopolies in order to have US owned/operated foundries. If TSMC could actually demonstrate more ability to reduce their own exposure to China none of this would be happening.",
