  "selftext": "Ladies and gentlemen it’s time to make generational wealth this weekend.\nBoeing will be launching their infamous Starliner into space tomorrow, aboard are two astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. This launch will be a major milestone for Boeing and their journey of space exploration and travel. The stock is severely underpriced at a mere $173. Boeing isn’t going anywhere even amidst its recent bad news. I believe a successful launch will “Starline” this stock 10% or more.\nTLDR; All in BA $185C exp 6/7\n",
