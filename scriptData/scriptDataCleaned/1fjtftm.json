I held off, and it exploded by 800% and more, as I thought it would. Sigh. \n\nThis was premarket, so do you think RH just didn't show perhaps a bunch of premarket orders waiting to be triggered at open?

Or You can use the estimate feature to see the estimated cost that the overnight increase in value created.\n\n\nFor example let‚Äôs say stock a is at 10, and option b is at .10, so 10$ each.   Then the stock overnight goes to 15.  On robinhood it will say the price is .1 but that‚Äôs only because option don‚Äôt move overnight.  As soon as it opens it will reflect the ‚Äúactual‚Äù value of the option, let‚Äôs say 1, or 100$ each.   It doesn‚Äôt mean you can place a .1 order at 8am est and think it‚Äôs gonna fill cause that option no longer worth .1, it‚Äôs worth 1 it‚Äôs just that you aren‚Äôt allowed to trade it till open.\n\n\n\nBasically, no free lunch.  If it was as easy as looking at which stocks went up overnight and placing arbitrage options plays at open everyone would be doing it.  If you decided to just buy the option at whatever price after the 50% overnight on the stock and the stock didn‚Äôt go up further  \nyou‚Äôd just end up actually losing money to theta.\n\n\n\nIn order to make money on options on lunar from yesterdays jump you‚Äôd need to have bought it yesterday before close, or earlier.
