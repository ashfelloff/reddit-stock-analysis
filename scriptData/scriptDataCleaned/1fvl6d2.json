              "body": "62% pay raise over 6 years. Yes but how unions work is usually like this.\nIn Nj they are making 39$.\nSo 62% over 6 years will bring them to approx 63$ an hour in 2030.\n\nSo usually unions split that raise up per year so 4$ per year. Which year one is a 10% raise. Great. Thats awesome.\nWhat they don't tell you is that healthcare cost goes up in that time and so does the cost of getting a pension credit.\nSo every year pension cost goes up 1$ (some years it doesn't) and healthcare costs go up 80 cents. That's money that you don't see \"in the pocket\".\nSo now your first year raise which was 4$ is now 2.20. Other things pop up dues go up different things cost money. Now every year this dorsnt hapoen but I would say 85% of years it does. i would say these guys will probably end up seeing half of that 24$ raise on their paychecks over 6 years. So maybe 50ish an hour in the year 2030. \n\nThese are guesses but thats just how unions work. Everyone saying a 62% raise is crazy yeah it sounds like a lot but in reality the workers wont see 62% on their checks and in 6 years will be fighting for more money. ",
