Will update if folks have interest.\n\nHello All,\n\nI am long PureCycle Technologies ($PCT). I know that our group is predominately value focused so please forgive the speculative nature but I believe it represents a high risk/extremely high reward play. The company is polypropene recycling company with licensed IP that was developed at Proctor and Gamble. Coming into September through January, we are reaching the make or break in terms of plant commissioning of plant 1 in Ironton, Ohio. Should the launch be successful (which I believe it will be), we are looking at a stock that will be grower for at least a decade as it becomes a dominant plastics producer. An important factor is that PCT expects to be able to create virgin grade (and likely better on the odor front) Polypropylene plastics for the same cost as fossil fuel based producer, so I look at it as a plastics producer with a premium product vs just a recycling company.\nCurrently stock trades apprx. 1.2b market cap ‚Äì however, really all that matters for the price is Ironton plant launching successfully.\n\nDoes it work? Can it scale?\n\nTo date, PCT has had a successful test plant (FEU) in which the process has worked. Currently Ironton (plant 1) has reached mechanical completion, produced product from post industrial waste and is currently running at 40% capacity. The more important question is can it scale? We will find that answer out through the end of the year as the plant must perform at 50% in September. I have visited the facility in Ironton and observed the FEU operating at capacity ‚Äì I believe it will work.\n\nUnit Economics/Plant Costs\n\nThe economics are fairly simple conceptually. You have input which is used feedstock (plastic) that you run through the plant and sell at standard PP prices. An important note that starting last year, PCT has negotiated a feedstock plus pricing model so they have a fixed margin on top of their input costs that guarantees margin effectively. This will hurt them when oil prices are elevated, and thus PP prices rise but in the long term having ‚Äòguaranteed‚Äô margins will give them bonus points in terms of forecasting. Ironton was supposed to cost 400m but various delays and issues have increased final cost to 500m (main issues were COVID, war in Ukraine and Mississippi River water levels being to low). Once concept is proven, I expect to see various subsidies or virgin plastic taxes (especially in the EU) as a viable alternative is created. However, these are NOT required to make the model work.\n\nMarket + Growth\n\nGlobally there is approximately, 70million tons produced per year. Ironton plant 1 is scheduled to do 135m pounds per year. So really unlimited room to grow here. Post Ironton, there are four plants currently under construction or design.\n1)     Augusta GA. First two lines under construction, 6 more planned. 135m LBs per line\n2)     Antwerp Belgium (design)\n3)     Ulsan, South Korea (SK Global of South Korea building in JV ‚Äì 50/50 financing)\n4)     Japan (JV announced with Mitsui, waiting to close JV and site selection)",

For example, in the SPAC agreement they anticipated that the first facility be fully operational by 2023...or for example the agreement had a milestone that if they traded above $18 a pop for 20 days during March 2024 they were to receive 4 million additional shares...as we can see they were trading less than half of that.",

              "body": "All fair concerns\n\nLicense - the license is exclusive until 2040. And you are correct, P&G may revoke if plant is not delivered upon. However, this is not in P&Gs best interest for a multitude of reasons. First, taking the license back and starting over will cost P&G min 4 years to get back to this point. Second, PCT has developed proprietary info around how to run the plant (feedstock combos, temperatures, pressures et ) think of it as a recipe book. P&G does not own that and it takes at least a year to learn these things. PCT is extremely well back financially and has a strong management team, so it is in P&Gs best interest to stick with PCT as they will deliver product the fastest.\n\nLitigation\n\nEssentially ambulance chaser lawsuit due to PCT coming public via SPAC. Easier and quicker to pay it and make it go away than litigate in court. The reality is things haven‚Äôt gone ‚Äúperfectly‚Äù so lawsuits abound for frivolous things. Unfortunate reality of being a public company.\n\nUnderperformance/Optimism\n\nIt is 100% true the plant has had challenges coming to scale. It is a first of its kind refinery that was being built during COVID - not easy. The delays have been primarily caused by 1)supply chain issues with COVID 2) a power grid outage that caused key parts to fail 3) a bad weld which dumped beads throughout the pelletizer (needed custom part to fix) 4) a clog when draining some of the waste from the purified plastic (this was caused by the temps/pressure dropping faster than anticipated on extraction causing the waste to solidly, thereby draining the pipe (this was also fixed via custom build). The important part is that ALL of this is behind us now, and AT NO POINT did the core technology ever fail. Lots of mechanical and teething issues have been worked through and now the plant is primed to go. If you look at progress YTD in terms of production you will see a plant that is scaling FAST at this point.\n\nHope this answers your questions, happy clarify anything.",
