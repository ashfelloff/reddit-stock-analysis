U3 is the current equation, U6 is referred to as the ‘broad category’ taking into account a bit more (sits at around 7.7% currently) and pre-1994, which is the 26% I’m talking about. In 1994, BLS defined “discouraged workers” out of existence.\n\nEdit: realize that working age (18 to 65) will include college kids, black market work, etc. so 26% isn’t like riot in the streets, but does show that a massive amount of the population arent working a traditional job that files with the IRS. Of course no one really knows what the actual unemployment is like actual people that should be working but aren’t, but the 4% is a fucking joke to anyone that follows the actual excel files.
