  "title": "$INTC as serious AI inference play",
  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "I keep reading posts about Intel and consumer CPU's or GPU's. It is relatively insignificant if they sell some shitty GPU's for a new xbox. The real money is in datacenters and AI, specifically AI accelerators and inference chips for training / running models quickly. Nvidia has been the king with their monopoly-like features (optimisation, their ecosystem, CUDA, etc..), but Intel is making some serious moves. \n\nIn the latest MLPerf benchmark from just a few days ago, which tests AI chips on tasks like object detection and large language models, Intel's Gaudi 2 is showing impressive results. Not to get too technical, but even David Salvator, Nvidia director of accelerated computing products, acknowledged that Intel's chip is actually competitive \\[1\\]. While Nvidia remains on top, price / performance wise Gaudi 2 beat them in Stable Diffusion and was close in the large language model. (Yes this is only inference - so does not reflect training, but this still shows potential). Intel said Gaudi 2 delivered a massive 1.42x jump in performance compared to their previous gen in just one year.\n\nThe generative AI market is estimated to hit $1.3 trillion by 2032, and we're in a unique position to guess who will be selling the shovels. As a bonus: Intel will be hugely susceptible to being hyped up during an AI bubble.\n\nBesides all this, we know that the Biden admin just announced Intel is getting up to $8.5B in direct funding under the CHIPS Act, along with a 25% tax credit on over $100B in investments and eligibility for $11B in federal loans.\n\nIntel could be a hedge against Nvidia, as they rely on TSMC. If geopolitical shit hits the fan, it could affect TSMC, which would impact Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and many others leaving intel as the only serious option.\n\n**TLDR**: Intel's AI Chip is no Nvidia killer yet, but Intel's making solid progress. $INTC could be an interesting AI play. Pie is big enough.\n\n\\[1\\] [https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/03/28/mlperf-inference-4-0-results-showcase-genai-nvidia-still-dominates/](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024/03/28/mlperf-inference-4-0-results-showcase-genai-nvidia-still-dominates/)",

I don’t care about all the haters dismissing them and saying “they’re a boomer stock.” \n\nPeople are shitting on intel for the $7B loss they just announced. I don’t think people know how investing works. If you want to build multibillion fabs and R&D it’s literally going to cost money. Takes money to make money. Gotta come from somewhere. The government is helping which is nice. But that’s clearly not enough to cover it all. \n\nThe fact people cream themselves over NVIDIA and AMD and makes me even more bullish on intel. I’ll take the contrarian play. We’ll see what happens. As long as intel’s strategy pays off we’ll probably see one hell of a rally. But it’ll take time. Hold, buy on major dips, and just DRIP and forget. I still have high conviction’s this company will join the trillion dollar club at some point in the next decade or so.",

Considering I’m bullish on intel for the next decade or two, if not longer, I have no problem holding and DRIPING. Maybe add a bit more if prices seem particularly attractive. It’s not like I’m all in on intel to begin with. Even if intel doesn’t live up to their goals I’m not going to be crushed. \n\nI’m not in the business of speculating what the hot stock will be for a year or two. Companies fall in and out of grace all of the time. Sometimes on a dime. Intel is making significant investments in it’s business. Not many other companies out there are doing so as aggressively. And being backed by numerous governments. If it works out (mostly) to plan. It’s going to be a pretty big deal. And if it does, holding out for 4 years or so would most definitely be worth it. Everything has risk of course. Their plans could fall short. I’ve already accepted this. But I say the long term pros outweigh the shorter term cons.",

People forget that it was Intel that made all the shit in the fab work (SiGe? Finfet? that list is endless) long before TSMC had a clue. Their process prowess and innovation is second to none. As for anything else, well, remember Intel's attempt at getting into mobile, and how well THAT went?\n\nIntel's cash cow is the datacenter. 💯. They are losing ground there, quickly. \n\nThis foundry business better take off, or Intel is gonna be in trouble in a few years, if not sooner. \n\nIt'll be more about execution around turning to that type of business model. Even then, the workforce in the US will be a problem- Taiwan is absolutely a better place to have big fabs for that (and several other) reasons. It's a young person's game for sure, tough work, 24/7/365. \n\nI'll always be a fanboy but find it hard to keep any money there.",
