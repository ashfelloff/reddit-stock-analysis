On the contrary, American companies are quite productive, their earnings insanely high, and US economy is doing relatively good. The biggest threat to the companies was Biden imposing taxes - even that is out. We are also up for a rate fall cycle, which just makes the money cheaper. \n\nTLDR: this is a panic sale. Could have been caused by fear and Japanese yen investors, but this has no wings. Buy, buy, buy!",

Just saying this is an opportunity to buy without 0 evidence that the market won’t keep dropping is foolish in my opinion.

So panic sell or not, people are trading at what they feel they comfortable of losing. If I see 20k loss in a company and I see a down trend of course I’m selling to minimize my loss",
