  "selftext": "  I have $500 left to day trade, if I lose that (which is most likely given my graph) I will stop trading for at-least 4 months. \n\n Probably not worth 33k, but I did learn a couple things losing that money. Hopefully I can  reflect back on this in 4 months with a complete fresh mind and start over.\n\n1) I need to live a more disciplined life if I want to succeed in waking up at 6 am and trading everyday. Something Iâ€™ve lacked my whole life.\n\n2) I should only trade for 40 minutes a day. Most of the big moves happen here and my strategy of following momentum with tight stop loss only works in the first 40m. Also this helps reduce tilt, revenge and over trading. I donâ€™t see myself having any chance of succeeding without this rule. Iâ€™ve had countless days winning in first hr turned into losers.\n\n3) Iâ€™m a much bigger degenerate gambler than I ever imagined. Never thought I could lose this much money this fast doing the dumb things I did while being fully aware of it. I need to be extra careful even after finding consistency in the future, especially when sizing up.\n\n4) itâ€™s going to take me at-least another 2-3 years to be consistently profitable and I need to focus on preserving capital.\n\n      \n\n \n\n",
