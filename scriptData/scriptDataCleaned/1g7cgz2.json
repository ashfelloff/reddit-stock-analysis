Let’s look at the math to understand why.\n\nProbability of Winning:\n\nIn American roulette, there are 38 numbers (1-36, 0, and 00). If you bet on 22 numbers, your chance of winning on a single spin is:\n\n P(\\text{win}) = \\frac{22}{38} \\approx 57.89\\% \n\nTotal Bet per Spin:\n\nYou place $23 on each of the 22 numbers:\n\n \\text{Total Bet} = 22 \\times \\$23 = \\$506 \n\nPayout on a Win:\n\nIf one of your numbers hits, you receive a payout of 35:1 on that number, plus your original $23 bet back:\n\n \\text{Winning Amount} = (\\$23 \\times 35) + \\$23 = \\$828 \n\nNet Profit on a Win:\n\n \\text{Net Profit} = \\text{Winning Amount} - \\text{Total Bet} = \\$828 - \\$506 = \\$322 \n\nCalculating Expected Value (EV):\n\nThe expected value represents the average amount you can expect to win or lose per spin over the long term.\n\n\t1.\tExpected Gain from Winning:\n\n \\text{EV}_{\\text{win}} = P(\\text{win}) \\times \\text{Net Profit} = \\frac{22}{38} \\times \\$322 \\approx \\$186.32 \n\n\t2.\tExpected Loss from Losing:\n\nWhen you lose (which happens  \\frac{16}{38}  of the time), you lose your total bet:\n\n \\text{EV}_{\\text{loss}} = P(\\text{lose}) \\times (-\\text{Total Bet}) = \\frac{16}{38} \\times (-\\$506) \\approx -\\$213.05 \n\n\t3.\tTotal Expected Value:\n\n \\text{EV}{\\text{total}} = \\text{EV}{\\text{win}} + \\text{EV}_{\\text{loss}} = \\$186.32 - \\$213.05 \\approx -\\$26.73 \n\nConclusion:\n\nThe negative expected value of approximately $26.73 per spin means that, on average, you lose money each time you play. This loss is due to the house edge inherent in roulette, which cannot be overcome by any betting strategy. Therefore, the proposed method does not provide an advantage, and there is no “infinite money glitch” in roulette.",

My advice is to take that 500 and swing trade some ETFs and shoot for 5-10% gains on each trade. Better yet take it and buy some ETF or mutual fund and forget about it while you save and reinvest. Once you have accumulated a decent amount, then look at re allocation. Consistency is key. It will add up. People like you end up giving up on trading because you only trade short-term market trends. It's how the big man takes equity from retail investors. I also recommend doing so thorough due diligence before making trades. It will help distinguish the thin line between gambling and investing. Rome was not built in a day or week, you need to change your mindset to succeed in these markets. They will take a pound of flesh and more. Good luck, and godspeed.",
