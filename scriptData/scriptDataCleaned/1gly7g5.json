So if they’re rising despite current rates being cut, it’s either because people see the future as being increasingly uncertain or rates are more likely to increase in the future",

Even with rate cuts many people think that if Trump does do what he says in regards to tax cuts and tariffs it will spark inflation and in turn higher rates. \n\nYou can watch the 10yr move as it became clear Trump would win.  Even if you are a 1% earner if you don’t have a lot of assets it could get bad as inflation soars. For the very rich and cash and asset heavy this should be very good as interest rates go up cash becomes king. \n\nHopefully Trump doesn’t do what he has campaigned on, but if he does I think non dividend stocks will soar with the tax cuts but inflation will also go back up to Covid levels or higher.  \n\nAlready hearing from customers that they are trying to buy material now before tariffs hit. I think q4 and q1 of 2025 will be very good because of this and could start crashing after that. \n\nRegardless of what party is in power we need to start cutting the deficit to maintain our status as global currency. In my mind this needs to be done both by increasing taxes and reducing spending.

If the fed can only control the short term bonds then the long end has to make up for the shortfall in debt financed on the short end. Meaning yields on the long end have to rise to what the market deems an acceptable rate to buy. So far everyone is saying “no” to the debt as the expectation is that the government will keep spending like drunk fucking idiots and the inflation will get worse. Something is going to have to give. Most likely the fed will have to step in and print the shit out of it even more than last time or we default on the debt with failed treasury auctions.
