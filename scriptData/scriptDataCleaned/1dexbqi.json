You have the current owner of the house sign a contract that says they will sell you the house for $100,000 within 1 year no matter what - even if the house goes up to $200,000 or even $1 million ! . You pay the current owner of the house $5,000 to sign this contract. \n\nThis is the theory behind ‚Äúcall‚Äù options contracts. \n\nAt the end of the 1 year (or anywhere within it) you can exercise this contract and buy the house for the $100,000. \n\nAlso, if you don‚Äôt want the house anymore, you still have the piece of paper! your name is still signed on the contract ! You paid $5,000 for it! You can sell this piece of paper for a lot more than $5000 if the house is skyrocketing! Imagine you have a piece of paper that says you can buy the house for $100,000 and the house is worth $1 million! That‚Äôs $900,000 profit! Other people will definitely want to buy that contract!\n\nSo you can either buy the house for $100,000 or sell the contract to someone else who will want to buy the house! \n\n\nOn the flipside the price of the house goes down. You just wasted $5000. \n\n:)",
