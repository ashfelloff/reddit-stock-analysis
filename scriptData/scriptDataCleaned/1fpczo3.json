(I‚Äôm worried about your bills now‚Ä¶) I only do really short expiry in a small way and occasionally if in the mood bc I think it‚Äôll be fun but then it‚Äôs stressful so I sell at first sign of green, haha. But, I have had good luck buying SPY or XSP contracts further out. May only be able to get one, but I‚Äôve been lucky and always sell at a double. Buying time may be worthwhile. And you can watch and choose more carefully and plan, even as simple as buying a drop during strong trend and waiting a few days. Every time I do 0DTEs I feel like I learn all over again that it‚Äôs literally like throwing dice. For me, anyway. I couldn‚Äôt make a cogent plan for them (I know some ppl do, but not me.) Anyway, best of luck!!  Maybe try in the crazy volatility at open, or hope the market reacts to FedSpeak etc by charging back up!",
