Doesn't Rome look beautiful lit up at night?\n\nI don't see a future without a world at war wherein we don't return to the mean. But perhaps you're right and we simply print our way out of every single economic disaster until such time as inflation sinks us. Or war comes and devastates us, changing the world forever once again.\n\nBottom line though, what's happening right now _is not sustainable by any measure of finance or economics._ We've always had the money printer and we've always had people parroting over and over and over ad nauseam \"Everything is fine! Housing is doing great! Rally rally rally!\" and they chant it nonstop, all day, every day, using whatever megaphone they can find.\n\nAnd then the bottom falls out and the inevitable correction arrives. I don't believe this time is going to be any different. I'll believe we have more borrowed time when the Fed starts printing and starts QE again. Until then, my philosophy is bearish as fuck, because we're already so far into borrowed time right now that the _actual correction and subsequent crash_ is going to hurt worse than anyone anticipates.\n\nWe'll see though.

It's starting to dawn on people that the economic pie can't grow 7% bigger year after year, and in fact, it'll actually need to shrink from where it's at.\n\nThe \"big\" picture is that every developed-world government has made promises and taken out debt in the past based on the assumption that their tax base would keep growing at around 7%. Now 20 years of 3% and 4% growth has left them in a hole. And Malthus says that they've got no chance of catching up and growing their way out of the hole, so the entire world is basically insolvent.\n\nFrom there, the world's governments have got two choices. They can either default on their debt and formally declare that they're insolvent, or they can hyperinflate their currency and pretend that everything's OK for a little while longer.\n\n40% American deficit spending during at peacetime with full employment is what \"extend and pretend\" looks like. They have no option to stop at this point and let a normal business cycle take over. What the heck would they do if a recession hit their tax base?",
