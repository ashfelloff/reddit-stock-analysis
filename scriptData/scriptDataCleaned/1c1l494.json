I made good money trading shares during 2021 but then discovered options and lost all my winnings. \n\nStarted revenge trading with options and losing my initial, kept depositing more trying to hit it big and make it all back. Eventually was down about 20k. I couldn’t let them win. I recently redeposited 25k to get it back and boom just did today. \n\nKey things I learned that helped were:\n\n-having 25k or being a cash account so I was never stuck swinging trades I didn’t want to\n\n-learning about key option pricing numbers especially theta and iv\n\n-not playing earnings \n\n-not playing meme stocks or stocks with low liquidity \n\n-take profits early, i usually exit at 10% unless i swung overnight and it opens way higher obvi\n\n-not fomo, if you miss your target entry just wait there is always another play \n\nMy positions I played:\n\nRecently: various calls/puts on sbux, aaple, tsla, amzn, spy, qqq, czr, gld, gild, google, nvda, bac, Lulu , dkng, ko, ba\n\n\nProlly just gonna let it chill for a few weeks, buttttt part of me wants to keep growing it to 100k+ and buy a house \n",
