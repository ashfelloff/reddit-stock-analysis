  "title": "$NVDA Earnings Projection",
  "score": 67,
  "selftext": "Considering that Tech-Companies published a significant increase in AI-Spending for Q2 '24 and the likelihood that these are mostly made up by buying chips for their models and analytics and for salaries for tech-engineers and u know the people u need for all the development, a large portion will go to NVDA. Also, earnings consenus is at 0.64 EPS (an increase of only 5% to previous quarter reported EPS) which doesn't feel much when taking the huge increases in spending into account. I know Mr. Cool leather jacket aims low in EPS guidance, so market will expect a beat. Still, AI spending just hiked in Q1, Q2 2024 to enormous amounts (switch to own chips to dodge nvda's unreal margins is another topic), so I'd think they will beat estimates the way the market anticipates, resulting in $NVDA at 140$ after earnings if it doesn't already reach that pre-arnings.\n\nHow 2025 and 2026 will play out for nvda is another discussion, but I don't think they will cut on guidance.\n\n\nMy fellow regards, what do you think?\n\n",

I expect it to be more like $120 or lower depending on how much it gives back before then (it is extremely overbought).\n\nPre earnings short dated: I would be looking to enter a $125 8/30 exp of NVDA ever goes below $120, with anticipation it will finish $125 or higher before earnings. I would sell those before earnings.\n\nPre earnings longer dated: I would be looking to sell $150 calls out in Sept/Oct (naked or cc) with the full intention to close these out AFTER earnings and prior to any substantial run up to profit from IV crush.\n\nPost earnings: I would enter a bullish position no sooner than 9/6 exp probably more like 9/13 roughly $10 higher than what it opened on Thursday morning and see how that performs.\n\nI don’t believe there will be any significant movement up or down and what you will find is IV crush on both sides just like Google experienced at their earnings. They will undoubtedly beat earnings and give a solid forecast but the market already knows that and can see you playing that. It isn’t unusual for all of this to yield a 15% dump but not here IMO. I am absolutely not holding any options through earnings that I bought, only sold if approached that way. Instead, I think the price action will be a nothing burger and will start a rally within 2 weeks of earnings, so the 9/13 calls $10 OTM whatever that is sounds least risky to me",
