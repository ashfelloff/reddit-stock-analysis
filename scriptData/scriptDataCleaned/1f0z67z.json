(Russia, Iran, North Korea, China) they can indirectly support Iran through Russia who is blatantly giving them military and economic support. \n\nIsrael is on a war path and has its own agenda but uses the leverage as the U.S backing as the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù as a deterrent. The U.S is put in a position where they don‚Äôt want war before the elections but can‚Äôt control what Israel does , but also can‚Äôt NOT support them given Israel is the biggest ‚Äústick‚Äù in the Middle East and the risk of them losing influence in power in the region would be a huge blow to the west. \n\nPeople are downplaying what‚Äôs unfolding as them being a ‚Äúpaper tiger‚Äù but it‚Äôs hubris and ignorant. This is much bigger than the Middle East. Iran is simply a knight on a chess board, while Hezbollah, Houthis, Hamas, and other factions are pawns. China is the queen, Russia is a rook, North Korea is the bishop and together used in tandem is a real threat and competition against the west and its interest. \n\nThis is a World War",

                          "body": "Can you explain why 'US' can't risk losing a stick in the region? Is this really accurate? I mean, Saudi is very friendly with US. UAE is friendly with US. I guarantee you the ruling class in most Arab countries loves US, perhaps bar Iran. American consumers love AliBaba, lol. So this concept that 'they can't lose influence in the region', seems like a dismissive, oversimplification of what is really at's stake. Which is?",
