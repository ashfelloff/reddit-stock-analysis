  "selftext": "To all those people asking me to quit while I’m ahead,\n\nI’ve been buying $BABA since December 2021 and have been dcaing ever since. My concentration had also been increase ng as the price kept on falling down to the point that I took margin this year to add into it. I’ve been through all the negativity on chinese stocks from covid19, real estate crash, Russia Ukraine war, weak economy, ADRs delisting, competition from $PDD, US smear campaign on China, chip bans, etc. \n\nI’ve been doing my DD day and night. Work multiple jobs and side hustle and throw it into $BABA and recently $BIDU. I followed insiders buying. Dataroma of big Value investors such as Michael Burry and David Tepper.\n\nThe geopolitical relationship history of US and China. I even know they shipped pandas over to. San Diego zoo this year as a sign of better relationship. I read the negative chinese press like Peter Zeihan, Gordon Chang, Epoch times (concluded they all full of bs). \n\nAll of this and yet I continue holding and plan so while China restarts their economy. I didn’t know when which is why I have no options but I know recessions don’t last forever. It was lonely when everyone was fearful and negative about China but now look where are we now. Sure we can see the chinese stocks go back the other way and this may be a fake rally but I’m not f**** leaving until everyone is a sucker for China like in 2020.",
