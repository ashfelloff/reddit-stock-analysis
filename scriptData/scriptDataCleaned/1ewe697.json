  "selftext": "Started trading in Nov 2021 after almost 2 years into my job. What a way to start. Down hill only. \n\nIn 2023 after i got screwed scalping nvda bought like 135 shares of amazon but that sucker gave me 50% gains and that wasnt enough to get me out of my shit. I mean options fucked me up and they still do but i play less now a days. I have AssTits 6.5$ per share and 750 shares strong enabled this. \n\nI will set a stop loss for 34$ and will exit if things go to shit. I know it has value but rn its kinda behaving like a meme stock, idk I‚Äôm a regard. \n\nGood to be back for now, i know I‚Äôm still down 20K if i just invested in SPY and DCAing. \n\nTldr: all time green color feels good. GreenDay is best. Imma basket case thinking about Holiday but got lost in Boulevard of broken dreams singing Good Riddance cuz I‚Äôve lived like an American Idiot. ",
