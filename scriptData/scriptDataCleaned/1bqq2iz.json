  "title": "You missed META, NFLX, GOOGL? Try AAPL",
  "score": 417,
  "selftext": "I think AAPL is an obvious play. It hasn't participated in this 2024 rally at all and is due for a catch-up play. Two main reasons why AAPL has been lagging: slowing growth (mainly China) and lack of AI hype. The slowing growth is priced into the stock. Earnings expectations are already low for AAPL.  \n\nAAPL reminds me of GOOGL this year when it was in similar situation of dumpster fire but then broke out after it finally worked out Gemini. AAPL already told you that it's going to make a push to AI, which should mean multiple expansion for AAPL stock. My guess is that in June we'll see Siri being totally revamped and actually be useful. Don't get me wrong this June WWDC event needs to be successful or this stock will stay dumpster fire. We need to see some sort of hype and the market needs to be convinced that that the next iphone will be a must-have due its new AI features. If there's anyone who can market the shit out of anything, it's AAPL.\n\nThe whole kitchen sink was thrown at AAPL recently. You have dissapointing product launch of its Vision Pro. You have the news about negative China sales. You have this big DOJ case come out of no where. You had an analyst downgrade yesterday. And even with all of that, it didn't make a new low from March 6th. Unless there's an unexpected market-wide correction, I can't see AAPL going lower this year.\n\nThis whole market recently has been a rotation trade. That is why the market has gone up even without AAPL and now without NVDA. The market has been broadening. It will continue to find laggards and re-allocate money from hot areas. AAPL is that obvious laggard right now and it needs to eventually participate for the market to continue signficiantly higher.\n\nTLDR: June $175 calls",

So what do they do?

We are not in 2010 anymore. Old and young, everybody has it now, and most important: already had dozen before and already decided which brand they like more or less.\n\nIf they do not come up with crazy new features like 30 day long batterie power or 5min 100% charge or whatever, its no pressure anymore to renew to next gen anymore.\n\nAlso the market competition is settled, apple now maxed out their customer share, the minor back and forth between apple and samsung (or now the dozen nearly equally well smaller brands available) do not give big gains.\n\nWe are way beyond early adopters or even late adopters, the only ones comming in are Laggards at the other end of the bell curve with just a few percent to trap in the apple-universe-cycle.\n\nApple Vision is just a toy and other production lines and markets like office PCs or just tablet/laptops are also saturated - newer generations do not add greater features. And those who would buy it are usually just apple-users before and they do not catch random offices/companies/privat households to try out the apple brand instead of windows/samsung they were used too.\n\nOther stuff like Music and tv/movie plattforms might also just lead to a rather big loss and no gain, because they arent the king in the jungle there and even the more stable alternatives (netflix, spotify, amazon prime, amazon music, disney+) struggle to go net positive without increasing fees while still lowering their content quality and variety.",

That’s $460 to potentially have the leverage of $17,000 worth of Apple stock.\n\nBut I wouldn’t go for 30DTE. For an extra $1200 a contract you could get 280 DTE and have a much better chance of making some big money.\n\nThe thing about Apple is that when it moves, it *moves*. If it can manage to catch a bottom here at 165-170, it can end up over 230 by EOY.",

But it is really a question of wether u think appl is underbought or the rest of the market is overbought. There’s only so much people on this planet to purchase there products and if they have already reached the vast majority of people that can afford it they have almost reached there full potential which is why innovation is such an essential part of these mega caps and why appl got hit so hard when it was discovered they r falling behind on it. When company’s reach there peak or near it it is common for them to start paying out dividends to encourage shareholder to hold although they are not seeing much growth. Appl has had the luxury of avoiding this but i feel one will b announced in a quarterly report this year.",
