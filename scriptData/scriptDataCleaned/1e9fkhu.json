You probably can't just inverse everything they do but they are great to listen to in order to understand how wealth managers think about things. I've actually learned quite a lot from following these people as well as finance Youtubers. They always have a great story and lots of creative arguments but always seem to underperform the markets over a long enough period of time. Youtubers are even better, since they underperform much more consistently. They just hide it better.",
