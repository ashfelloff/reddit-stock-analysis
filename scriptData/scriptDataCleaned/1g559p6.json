  "score": 110,
  "selftext": "> ASML [CEO] said he expects the chip market’s long-awaited recovery will extend “well into 2025,” following disappointing third-quarter earnings that sparked a broad selloff across the semiconductor industry. \n\n> Slow recovery in demand has led to “customer cautiousness and some push-outs in their investments.” \n\n> That’s led ASML to slash its earnings guidance, even as [the CEO] said the artificial intelligence boom, energy transition and electrification continue to provide strong upside.\n\n> [ASML], which makes the world’s most advanced chipmaking machines, has shed over €60 billion ($65 billion) in value since it reported bookings that were less than half of what analysts expected on Tuesday.

It’s just more computing to better allow them to figure out how to do the lithography which is the process of them laying trillions of transistors. There are going to be more transistors laid in the future requiring both more lithography machines and more advanced lithography machines at smaller sizes.",
