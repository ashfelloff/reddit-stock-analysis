  "selftext": "Interesting bet, there is a possible buyout of Paramount by Apex capital, they offered $23 per Class B share, currently its trading at $11. There are speculations that that offer is fake, but I think its not, so YOLO. Out of the money calls, strike 15, are trading quite cheap, couple of cents. So decided to load up. If this is real theres LOOTS of money ot be made. ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ $PARA\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aapgoqkkupgd1.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8f7688e58ee8e0bc5951388d751bbcd863af3d4",
