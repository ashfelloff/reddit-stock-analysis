      "body": "Back when I was REAL broke, living paycheck to paycheck (with three jobs, I might add), I did something similar.  \n\nI had a PayPal debit card, a BoFA debit card and a random ass credit union account.    My BoFA card was linked to my PayPal account.   I could use the PayPal card at the ATM, but it wouldn't dispense cash unless I actually had money in the account, obviously.  Same rules as a debit card.  \n\n\nHowever, there was one loop hole.   Since it took about 24hrs for a transaction on the PayPal debit card to hit my BoFA account, I could use it to make purchases even if it had $0.  I could even get cash-back with it.  I'd do that from time to time, usually a day or two before I would get paid.   \n\nOne day I found myself in some particularly hard times and had no money to speak of.   It was the first time in my life where I legitimately had no way to even buy food.   I spent the better part of the day hitting every single store with a high dollar cash back limit.   The transaction limit on the card was $3000, iirc, and I got every last dollar I could.   I didn't care about the consequences, I was already at rock bottom as far as I was concerned.   \n\nAnyway, that was years ago and I'm in a much better place now.   The $3,000 bounced between PayPal and BOFA for quite a while.  I assume neither wanted to take responsibility for it.   I never found out what happened to it either.   Both of those accounts were shut down, obviously, but nothing from that debt hit my credit score.",
