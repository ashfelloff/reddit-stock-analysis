You seem to be aware of what the broader insurers are facing now because of CMS. You would be well suited to understand why Clover is positioned extremely well for new regulations, as in already compliant, and why the Counterpart offering has come at precisely the right time.\n\nLook into it.

Old people are simply seeing doctors too often and CMS didn’t up payments to compensate. I don’t believe any matter of AI is going to reduce how often people are seeking care or overall healthcare spend in the next year or so. And Clover Health’s open network approach is only going to reduce their revenue. \n\nAlso, the biggest use of AI in healthcare is two-fold. One, get people healthier before hospitalization is required (upfront spend, save in the end), and two, increase risk adjustment to obtain more dollars from the government. Neither of these is going to offset healthcare costs in the near term. Also, regulators are beginning to introduce AI regulation aimed directly at hearth insurers. AI for increasing risk adjustment dollars is going to be heavily scrutinized in the coming years.",
