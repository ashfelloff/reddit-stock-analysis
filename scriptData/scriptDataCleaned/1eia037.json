  "score": 83,
  "selftext": "I'm not a newbie, I opened a trading account many years ago, not in the USA market but human psychology is all the same everywhere. I didn't trade everyday, it's on and off, but more on than off in the last 5 years, and I have only lost money. I have lost enough to buy a Ferrari. I have never cashed in and bought some nice things with my profit, I went sometimes to quadruple my money in a month, thinking it will go to the moon, but no, that didn't happen, no matter how much you won on paper, it always somehow goes back to zero and then some, and so my one advice for you and the one rule which I have never followed is this: \nWhen you unexpectedly won so much amount of money in so short time to a point where you feel so happy, so proud, almost arrogant to a point where, AND THIS IS THE KEY, you cannot help but tell everyone and your mum how you are winning , making so much profit, THAT RIGHT THERE, is the red flag to sell.\nIf not all, at least half. \nIf you don't, it will all be gone while you are looking at the numbers and it keeps going down while you keep hoping it will go back up tomorrow. \nIt is very very difficult to sell when you are still winning, but, that is my one impossible advice. \nSo, what's your number 1 rule of trading ?
