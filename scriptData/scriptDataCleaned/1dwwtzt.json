Many of my older colleagues never recovered. They were simply unable to find jobs that paid as well as their old ones in the immediate aftermath, and then ran out of time. I saw relatives withdraw from their retirement funds to survive or save their homes. Families sold their homes, taking huge financial hits, and moved far away from cities to afford basic shelter.\n\nBeing in tech, the 2000-03 recession felt much worse for me personally. Jobs disappeared overnight, and a confluence of events turned the tech world upside down. Right after the dot-com bust came 9/11, the war on terror, a string of high-profile corporate scandals, and finally, the beginning of large-scale tech offshoring. I saw several of my much older colleagues go from having a great early retirement in sight to losing their children's college funds overnight.\n\nThe 2008-2011 recession was more widespread, but it didn't feel as intense in tech because the tech landscape was changing with the introduction of smart devices, social media companies, etc. That said, I'll never forget walking one morning in a very affluent neighborhood and seeing at least 100+ people lined up outside Barnes & Noble, many middle-aged men and women dressed to the nines, for just four open sales associate positions. That image hit me hard and made me grateful for my decent job.\n\nHistory aside, I don't think we'll see such a crisis again. The Federal Reserve had both theoretical and political limitations on liquidity back then, but those limitations no longer exist. If they feel the whole economy is under threat, as they did in 2020, they'll turbocharge the money printer, take interest rates to zero, and flood the system with liquidity. No one in 2009 thought the fed funds rate would remain near 0% until 2015 or that there would be four or five rounds of quantitative easing. I remember the uproar when the Fed's balance sheet touched $1 trillion, and here we are today, comfortable with an $8.5 trillion balance sheet. The times have indeed changed.",

Over the 6 years that it existed, it lost \\~80% of its $2B in assets. \n* Both his 1999 & 2006 books predicted both that the DOW would hit 40,000 and that the NASDAQ would hit 20,000 before 2010.\n* In September 2009 he launched the [DENT](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/DENT:US) Tactical ETF. The fund lasted less than 3 years--it was liquidated in August 2012. During its very short run, it lost 12.9% while VTI gained over 40%. \n* He won an [Ultimate Charlatan](https://www.maxfunds.com/?q=node/319) for his 2009 book, The Great Depression Ahead\n\nYou're better off taking stock picks from a gaggle of pet rats than listening to anything this \"top world economist\" says about the market.",
