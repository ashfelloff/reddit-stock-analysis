Plus it would reduce gas costs as well with a reduced need for commutes...\n\nBut it would cost those that invested in commercial real estate a lot and much likely trigger a domino effect on the banking sector. Plus let's be honest those in power don't care if workers can't afford a home, they like it in fact as it weakens us overall... so yeah full remote working while it would be a good solution is unlikely to be implemented on a large enough scale. \n\nThere is also the matter that by now a lot of people have established their lives and connection in those dense urban areas and have few (non economic) incentives to leave... so I guess there is that as well.",
