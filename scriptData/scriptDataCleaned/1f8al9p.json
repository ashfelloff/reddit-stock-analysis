  "selftext": "[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-03/nvidia-gets-doj-subpoena-in-escalating-antitrust-investigation)\n\nThe US Justice Department sent subpoenas to¬†Nvidia Corp.¬†and other companies as it seeks evidence that the chipmaker violated antitrust laws, an escalation of its investigation into the dominant AI computing provider.\n\nThe DOJ, which had previously delivered questionnaires to companies, is now sending legally binding requests that oblige recipients to provide it with information, according to people familiar with the investigation. That takes the government probe a step closer to launching a formal complaint.\n\nAntitrust officials are concerned that Nvidia is making it harder to switch to other suppliers and penalizes buyers that don‚Äôt exclusively use its artificial intelligence chips, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.\n\nNvidia shares, which suffered a record-setting rout on Monday, fell further in late trading after Bloomberg reported on the subpoenas. Still, the stock has more than doubled this year ‚Äî fueled by explosive sales growth at the Santa Clara, California-based chipmaker.\n\nAs part of the probe, which¬†Bloomberg previously reported¬†on in June, investigators have been contacting other technology companies to gather information. The DOJ‚Äôs San Francisco office is taking the lead running the inquiry, the people said.\n\nRepresentatives for DOJ and Nvidia declined to comment.",

                          "body": "Ah i keep forgetting these specific examples in the response,\n\nBut things I noticed that are anti-consumer is how the chip industry will always make a product for large companies like Amazon, Microsoft, etc and give the masses the scraps or leftovers. They won't design a product with the mass consumer in mind, only the consumers with the most money. That's how the business model works unfortunately, and you might be saying \"so what?\". Well, that is anti-innovation and anti-consumer. You are not enabling more innovation by putting better products in MOST hands.. you're only putting innovation in the hands of the few, resulting in less innovation from them in the next cycle.\n\nCase in point, When Nvidia designed the \"RTX\" brand and dropped GTX focus. No mass consumer wanted, needed, or had a strong use case to use RT cores. Yet 1/3 of the die or more is now commited to these tensor cores. They used to make cards and chips that had full CUDA cores which CAN be used by the current consumer, and consumer expectations are that Nvidia will continue to offer products that serve this need. But no, when you're the market leader, you steer and customers shut up and follow. Criticism seems to just be quieted when you are in the lead.. They will hail these decisions as innovations when really they don't serve the consumer. Nvidia dropped GTX and dropped making full CUDA cards and will only offer RTX now.\n\nDo you remember the first Ray Tracing demos? Do you remember the tech press' reviews of \"real lighting and reflections\" and how much performance was lost when enabling it in battlefield? Do you remember the hype, the marketing? Do you remember how much this was touted as \"innovation\"? The truth is, RTX as a brand is an attempt to sell Tensor cores to the masses and artificially brand it as \"innovation\". The only use case where this comes close in the whole RTX brand line up is DLSS, the only one that is even usable or passable. And this still took 4 years to become more mainstream and a decent use case.\n\nLet's move to the competition for argument's sake. What did AMD do in response to this? They took their architecture which is SM units and not CUDA core cells, whatever the overarching container is called I forget because they changed it every new product they made... They took their SM units and made them reprogrammable so the same SM unit can do Ray tracing, DLSS, vectors, rendering, or whatever workload you want it to. This is a true innovation and pro-consumer. Why? Because it serves the needs of all, not just a select few, of AMD's customers. You can use the full die space and every core for whatever it is your use case, be it gaming, mining, vector math, whatever. Including RTX suite like use cases. AMD also made RTX suite competitive products in a FREE and opensource way, without dedicated hardwhere which requires an AMD chip to enable it (see g sync monitors at a premium requiring Nvidia chips to work vs freesync). And this is \"Innovation\" because Freesync is now the standard and even Nvidia had to adopt this. You should see that GPP bullshit they tried too. Are all of these examples from Nvidia \"innovations\"? Could Nvidia been in the lab cooking up true innovations instead of milking it's customers? Yes, they could have. But they made their choices and if it wasn't for AMD's brilliant responses, we as consumers would be MORE fucked.\n\nNvidia's been stealing other people's innovation for decades. See PhysX, TressFX which nvidia rebranded as HairWorks, etc etc etc.\n\nWhat is true innovation in response of this claim? The companies doing the work that Nvidia stole from...PhysX died an early death after \"aquisition\" or hostile takeover of Ageia. TressFX was open source from AMD. Nvidia couldn't find a way to continue to Milk the consumer by rebranding these stolen things as innovations, that's why they are on the shelf now. **Is this innovation?** No, it's the opposite of innovation. And if nvidia didn't kill PhysX for example, what product would have came later if the original creators we're allowed to keep evolving it? It could have been something real cool. But now we will never know. Also, PhyX and Hairworks killed your FPS and we're seem as gimmicks. Why did Nvidia not evolve these products themselves? They could have went further with the innovation and done all that work, surely a market leader can spares the funds to do this right? Right... But they choose not to.\n\nWhat are examples of innovations competitors made that Nvidia DIDN'T Steal or couldn't? (Often because they are opensource and the opensource implementation is better....) a unified low level platform/engine for gaming that was open source, baremetal, and offering great performance for consoles, mobile (phones), and PC hardware. Mantle -> Vulkan. Who made it? AMD.\n\nI'm telling you, isn't it funny how the little guy competitor is actually more innovative and has had a more profound impact on the masses than the market leader? Yes, it is interesting and funny... But we don't reward those company's with cash. We only reward the sleezy salesman who found a way to steal and market these innovations as their own proprietary product... That's how the tech world seems to work.\n\nSo you tell me, why is it the biggest most profound innovations that benefit most consumers are never from Nvidia, but from competitors? Because Nvidia will only do things that solidify it's market dominance position and increase it's market cap. See CUDA moat.\n\nAlso, further examples of bad behavior, you will see what Nvidia has done with CUDA is what Intel used to do with bribing OEMs to only advertise and offer Intel products. Punishing your distributers if they dare sell any competitor products. That isn't innovation my friend, its crooked. Jensen is the world's best salesman today and that is why Nvidia has risen to where it is today. But make no mistake about it, once the party is over and shareholders are no longer rich... Oh will they be quick to crucify him.",

                          "body": "You could argue the same in retrospect for any Tech company. Use intel as an example. Did they bring alot of innovation on their rise? Well, their fab was ahead of everyone else. They we're always on the new node first, they pioneered finfet even. You could argue these are innovations and are net positive.\n\nConsider this, that's just the result of being first though. And what happened once that one trick pony ran out? What happened once it got hard and exponentially more innovation and money was required to keep the monopoly? TSMC caught up and surpassed and even Samsung reached near parity.\n\nSo back to net positive argument, Intel holding the industry back and selling only 4 core CPUs to the masses for a decade, is this a net positive? People argued for YEARS and the pro-Intel response was always \"Well software doesn't take advantage of more than 4 cores so you don't need them\"... Yea chicken and the egg, and we learned real fast the illusion wasn't true at all, if you give the masses more than 4 cores they use them. So the argument here is now is the same 4 cores and only 5-10% more performance per new product \"innovation\"? It really isn't. And if you look closer you can probably find this sort of argument with Nvidia.\n\nIs it a net positive that GPUs have taken a similar approach? Nvidia used to be more proconsumer and offer GPUs at affordable prices, all the way from budget cheap sub $100 up to halo products for the enthusiast near $1000. What is Nvidia today with it's monopoly now that it is securely in the lead?\n\nWe see no low end products. We see only high end super enthusiast products that consumers can't afford and don't want. You see a market with a \"shortage\" that is artificially created. You see a company not making GPUs for consumers like me and you, but for crypto miners and AI data centers. \"They are innovating\".... Yea for who? They are the shovel seller in a gold rush and they are following the next shovel the ones with all the cash think they need. Nvidia has turned it's back on the consumer.\n\nPeople have been waiting 4-6 years now with their 1080s and 1080tis, holding their breath seemingly forever as they wait for miners to sell the \"new\" cards that are now 4 years old on ebay for something $300 or less.\n\nWe also see this trend in Apple's iphones and Samsung Galaxys. It's an anti consumer trend, it slows innovation down, and all it serves is to milk the consumer. They eventually think \"why release the product I have in the pipeline now, when I could wait and release it next year because the competition is no where close?\". We see the same pattern, the product that was 1.0 where they learned they had a good product that consumers wanted is released at the price consumers want it at. Usually around $300. Then you slowly see that same product with less and less innovations/performance added but the price creeps to $600. Then suddenly now it's $1000. This is not real innovation. The innovation was the creation of the product at the very beginning. \n\nAnd why is the competition not close? See lawsuits, buyouts, takeovers.\n\nSo again, \"Innovation\" from what we are debating here in the comments in terms of nvidia or any company at the peak or tail end of their rise, in the long term scheme in retrospect is the **symptom**, not the **source**, of what has transpired for that company and it's actions. Real innovation without the limits of greed, with a goal that is near unobtainable, would be seen in things like the space race or pure sciences. That is easier to see than say trying to define that tiny moment in a company's history where they took and had true innovation. With Samsung, maybe it was one of their early Galaxy phones. For Apple, maybe their first iphone. For Nvidia it's harder to tell, but maybe the 900 series? It's subjective where you want to draw that line of true innovation. What we see with these tech companies in the private market is nothing short of just salesmanship, trying to get the consumers to believe they are still that innovative company when in reality they are at the end of that arc and are now just milking it.",

How are you supposed to \"easily switch suppliers?\" And why does it need to be easy? And why is that Nvidia's responsibility? Companies can evaluate the potential for switching suppliers and decide whether or not to use Nvidia or not. Literally every company on Earth, especially tech and software, is difficult to switch suppliers. They're not working together to create interchangeable products, nor should they be.\n\nAs far as how they're \"penalizing\" those who don't use AI chips, I'm pretty confused as to what that even means too. Can Nvidia not set their own price incentives and can companies not choose which products to buy?\n\nMaybe there's something to this, but this just comes off as a very premature attack on a company who is doing great work and being rewarded for it. I don't know the motive, but it's hard to understand why Nvidia gets targeted for anti-trust almost immediately while many other companies have skated by for years.",
