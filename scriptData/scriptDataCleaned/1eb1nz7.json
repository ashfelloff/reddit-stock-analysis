Most of them just ignore me, but some start laughing and telling me to get a life. I know I'm right because I do all of my research on reddit - reading many of the extremely thoughtful posts from my mom's basement for hours on end, so I know for a fact Tesla owners are morally, ethically, and intellectually inferior to us redditors. They're 2nd class citizens tbh. They really shouldn't even be citizens imo. Every should by a kia instead. Sure the ICCU might blowout, and they might use a little bit of migrant child labor (good workers imo), but at least it's not a Tesla, hahaha! I can't afford anything because I'm a fry cook at Wendy's, but I know what I'm talking about, ok!",
