  "selftext": "* This time is different; the sentiments for SoFi shifted to an all-time high with the stock price holding well (the curse is broken) after the best quarter performance in SoFi's history. Analysts' price Target Upgrades and an overall increase in Buy ratings over this past month despite a 40.46% increase in stock price in one month.\n* CME FedWatch puts a 98.9% chance of a 25bp interest rate cut on Nov. 7th after the important PCE report and Job report this past week.  SoFi's core lending business is poised to gain from rising demand for personal, student, and home loans with the lowering of Fed interest rates.\n* There are 113K Options in the money as of Nov. 1st, yesterday equated to 11.3M shares. Which would significantly help lift the stock price for this coming week.\n* The election this coming Tuesday would be significant for SoFi stockholders as the CEO stated which administration would be better for SoFi's business. Currently, there is an event contract for both candidates with different prices based on the odds (I am not going to be political and not going to post that amount but you can search it for your very own curiosity)",
