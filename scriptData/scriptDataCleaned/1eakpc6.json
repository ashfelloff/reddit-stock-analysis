This advantage can allow them to purchase any interesting and potential competition before they have a chance to steal market share from the whales.  Google is basically known for this.  As is Autodesk, who wasn't mentioned in that article.  Hell, there's a large portion of startups who's end goal isn't to become the next Google, it's to be bought by Google.",

They're likely to replace their electric with an electric, but the switchover from gas to electric will reach a point where it'll meet more and more resistance.  I gave it 20 years because some people were/are waiting for the prices to come down a bit, or perhaps even to purchase a used Tesla, which I assume would occur when the vehicle is 3-8 years of age.\n\nIt's already slowing, and profit margins are dropping.

          "body": "I think Tesla is doing a decent job at capturing people beyond the early adopters by lowering prices and continuing to monopolize charging infrastructure against their explicit promises to the government. I can see them increasing their market share as EVs continue to replace gas cars. This might fail with project 2025, which is my guess on why Elmo is currently Trumping so hard.\n\nThe thing is that they'd need several times the entire world's car sales to justify their valuation. It's just so ludicrously high. Their valuation is just not reachable without at least some of the ill-defined buzzword bingo Elmo likes to sell to investors turning into a billion dollar idea, and I just don't see it. Tesla is bad at FSD and Robotics and while their battery division is awesome, it's a fungible good with zero moat. First mover advantage is great, but I just don't see the margins.",
