Full disclosure I do see potential issues with TikTok but as of now there are essentially 2 schools of thought on why it's bad. First is data privacy. But there is no indication they are doing anything that other social media companies aren't doing right now. If they wanted that kind of information on the American public they can purchase it legally right now so TikTok wouldn't be some priveleged information.\n\nThe second school of thought is I think more legitimate and that is that the Chinese government is functionally in control of TikTok and there is nothing stopping them from manipulating the algorithm to cause strife or issues in the US. There's not any good way to prove this especially because social media in general does this sort of thing anyway but they could potentially take it a step further in a more targeted and malicious way.\n\nSpyware leads me to believe you are talking about the first school of thought which is not really an issue. I mean it is but all social media are already doing this so we should take steps to stop it from happening in general.",

Tornado cash is a tumbler/mixer that makes it more difficult to track specific crypto transactions - but if you turn up one day and tell the IRS that you have a shitload of money you can’t explain and they’re like “where did you get it?” and you respond “uhhh… tornado cash?” your ass is still going to get nailed.\n\nLaundering money is not about hiding money, it’s about convincing government entities that the money you’re declaring on your taxes as income was legally earned. Tornado Cash won’t help with that at all.",
