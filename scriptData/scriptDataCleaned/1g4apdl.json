Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent company with a commanding lead in extreme UV litho (their \"moat\") but investors need to realize that the semiconductor market is more than just data centers (a relatively new and fast growing semi market), the automotive, computational and smartphone demand has still not fully recovered from the bear market. Not all chips need to be the most advanced produced with cutting edge tools, so even if the EUV litho segment is growing it's \"only\" accounting for circa 50% of sales. \n\nI would like the share price to drop to around 500€ (dcf with 10% growth and generous average TTM cash flows of 8B$) to really feel like I'm getting a great company with a slightly premium price, but it's still looking too expensive and this dip is likely just getting gobbled up in the coming weeks",
