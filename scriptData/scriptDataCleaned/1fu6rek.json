It's like that guy at the casino that eventually hits it big, but the losses are so massive, he will never get out of the hole he dug. And overtime he will find himself in a even deeper hole, and no big win is going to ever get him out.\n\nOn top of that I was living on my wages not working, thinking I'd be trading for a living. I am now getting back on my feet, finding a job and going long-term on SPY. I will build wealth the safe way.\n\nThe insidious thing about those pumps I had is that it made me think I was finally on my way to breaking even, only to plunge lower deeper into the abyss.",

What do you think happens to someone if they go from 200k to 40k overnight. Think about the notion of path dependency and the leverage that someone might take on in response to this drawdown.\n\nThe vast majority of people are losers or soon to be losers. Don’t take it too hard. This economic environment is unprecedented and every single moron who is strapped for cash and desperate is in your shoes betting as if their life depends on it (it does) but no one thinks about what it feels like to be in a hole until they dug one.\n\nCongratulations on being part of the majority.",
