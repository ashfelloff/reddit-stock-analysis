  "selftext": "**Premise**\n\nIt's not news that Europe as a continent has been struggling to keep up with the US. Innovation is lacking, regulation is abundant, cheap ru$$ian gas is gone, Germany is committing suicide, Fr\\*nce is full of fr\\*nch and Southern Europe is just a retirement home at this point. Ah, and the UK has being doing horribly since Brexit and food shortages are still going on even if they don't make the news.\n\n**The numbers**\n\nEconomically speaking, if you take the GDP of the EU, you'll see that it's almost half that of the US, or about two thirds if you believe the PPP figure (you shouldn't, nobody cares how many big macs you can afford in a day, it's useless). The PPP detachment from reality can easily be observed if you take any market you like and compare the sales volume. For example, taking the car market in 2023 you can see that 22 cars were sold in the EU per 1000, while 43 cars were sold per 1000 people in the US. Sure you could say \"muh EU's got trains\", but that's only true for Western Europe which is half the total population.\n\nIn addition to this, most EU countries are facing a pension crisis that's going to obliterate the budget for infrastructures in the near future. Either that, or we are going to let pensioners live in absolute poverty to keep up the welfare state.\n\n**The meat**\n\nWhat's interesting to notice is that the financial literacy of younger Europeans is incredibly higher than the one of their parents and grandparents. On the flip side, young Europeans are incredibly broke, because of the welfare state, the Ponzi-pension schemes, and other shit which is constantly extracting value from the economy and putting it into the already fat accounts of elderly people who are not spending anything, not investing in anything and just parking their money, stopping the economy as a result.\n\nBut, all things come to an end, even their lives. And all that money is gonna flow in the pockets of young people with access to the US stock market. These generations are gonna know that the State will never be able to pay a decent pension, so they'll either invest on their own or put all that wealth into private pension funds that, you guessed it, will just invest in the US stock market, 'cause no one would ever invest in shitty EU clones of successful US businesses.\n\nI can see that this ball is starting to roll with the current generation of Europeans entering the job market. We are looking at at least two decades of European money just pouring into the US stock market from everywhere in the EU.\n\n  \nHere's to the biggest bull market and wealth transfer in the history of the World.",

Now their tax base is about 30% smaller than they budgeted for (and spent for), and they're scrambling.\n\nSpending can't be cut back 30%, because so much of their payments for pensions, healthcare, etc are essentially defined-benefit.

The only means that governments have to square this circle is to debase their currency and create 30% inflation. \n\nWhen long bonds start pricing that higher inflation in with higher rates, it's going to create a deficit doom loop. Western governments that don't print their own currency will default. Governments that do will soft-default via hyperinflation. \n\nThis shit isn't even doomer-ism, it's just mathematical reality.
