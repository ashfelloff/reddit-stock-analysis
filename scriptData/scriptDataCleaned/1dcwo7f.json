The more you give context the better the answer will be. That’s the hard truth. \n\nApple’s refreshed AI solves that problem. It takes all the context from messages, email, photos and everywhere else and complies a better context for you. That’s why they showed the demo of ‘when is my mom’s flight landing’.",
