But losing it on bad investments doesn't count as withdrawing.\n\nSo TFSA is a great place for reasonable investments,  you aim for %7ish percent a year and eventually you've got 100k in there off of only 60k invested. You get that money tax free, and if you withdraw it (not lose it), your available space for the next year would be 106k.\n\nTFSAs are a fantastic tool, and their space is precious.
