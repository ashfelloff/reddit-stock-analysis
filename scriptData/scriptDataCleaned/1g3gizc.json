  "selftext": "So I just went ahead and did what Mama always said‚Äîinvest smart, even if you don‚Äôt know much, like Nancy Peloci, whoever she is. Mama always told me I might not be the smartest, but I had a knack for keepin' things simple, and that‚Äôs worked out pretty well. I got me some Nvidia, and now it‚Äôs goin‚Äô up faster than I could ever run. And I know runnin‚Äô‚Äîso I figured that was a good sign. Broadcom? Well, I don‚Äôt know much about chips, but it seems to me that if all these tech companies need them, it‚Äôs like buyin' up the whole bus instead of just a ticket.\n\nAnd Bitcoin? Now that‚Äôs a funny thing. It‚Äôs like money, but you can‚Äôt touch it, so it took me a while to understand, but Mama always said sometimes the best things in life ain‚Äôt the things you can hold. So I reckon Bitcoin‚Äôs the future, and even if I don‚Äôt fully get it, I know to hold on tight. You don‚Äôt need to be a genius to see that Microsoft and Apple are like sure bets, so I got me some of those too. Sometimes, keepin‚Äô it simple is the smartest thing of all.",
