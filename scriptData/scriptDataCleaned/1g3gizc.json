  "score": 1491,
  "selftext": "So I just went ahead and did what Mama always said—invest smart, even if you don’t know much, like Nancy Peloci, whoever she is. Mama always told me I might not be the smartest, but I had a knack for keepin' things simple, and that’s worked out pretty well. I got me some Nvidia, and now it’s goin’ up faster than I could ever run. And I know runnin’—so I figured that was a good sign. Broadcom? Well, I don’t know much about chips, but it seems to me that if all these tech companies need them, it’s like buyin' up the whole bus instead of just a ticket.\n\nAnd Bitcoin? Now that’s a funny thing. It’s like money, but you can’t touch it, so it took me a while to understand, but Mama always said sometimes the best things in life ain’t the things you can hold. So I reckon Bitcoin’s the future, and even if I don’t fully get it, I know to hold on tight. You don’t need to be a genius to see that Microsoft and Apple are like sure bets, so I got me some of those too. Sometimes, keepin’ it simple is the smartest thing of all.",
