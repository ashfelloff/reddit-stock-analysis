The calls you buy helps cover the cost in the calls you sell. Which strike you choose is what makes the position either bearish or bullish.\n\nSo example... you buy a spread 150 strike price... then call sell 160 strike price.\n\nYou only need to pay the 10 dollar difference on each call (so 10 USD x100 per call) because if you get fucked and your 160 call that you sold gets exercised... well you have a call you bought that guarantees you to buy the stock at 150 USD. So you exercise your call at 150, and you get to sell the stock at 160 to cover the call you sold.\n\nIn this strat you ideally expect the stock to close bellow 160 but above 150 for maximum profit... so the 160 call you gets wrecked and you can close the position for a profit, hopefully.  (This is just a bad example made up on the fly, not a strat)\n\nGet it? You are not naked. You are protected by the calls you bought. and you can change this spread to whatever strat you want. More bullish, more bearish, more neutral etc...",
