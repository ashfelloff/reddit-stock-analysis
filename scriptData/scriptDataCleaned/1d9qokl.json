  "score": 88,
  "selftext": "From the SEC IAG's draft proposal: \n\n\"From both the SEC‚Äôs and FINRA‚Äôs guidance, it is clear the options approval process is one that historically has required a suitability assessment. However, the rule itself does not make this explicit. Moreover, the Committee believes it is appropriate that the standard utilized in determining whether options trading is appropriate for a customer should now be the standard set forth in Regulation BI, one that assesses whether the account type is in the customer‚Äôs best interest. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that FINRA amend Rule 2360 to explicitly state that when approving an account for options trading, the brokerage firm must determine that the level of options trading approved is in the client‚Äôs best interest\"\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/fials/iac-060624-rec-re-self-directed-investors.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/fials/iac-060624-rec-re-self-directed-investors.pdf)",
