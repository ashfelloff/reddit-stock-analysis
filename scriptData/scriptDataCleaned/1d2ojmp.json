If I‚Äôm spending time in a casino enjoying losing (sometimes making) money on craps, or standing in line to go party at a club, or drinking a beer and playing penny slots - and I overhear someone euphoric about an investment I‚Äôm in, it‚Äôs time to get up and go home and sell EVERYTHING.  \n  \nAnd it happened yesterday.  \n  \nI was enjoying a solid run on the dice, turning $200 into $1000 when I heard two casino staff talking: ‚Äúyeah man‚Ä¶ and you know they‚Äôre about to 10:1 split!‚Äù The other guy was elated. ‚ÄúAnd you just KNOW that thing is gonna shoot right back up to a thousand bucks.‚Äù  \n  \nFuccccccccccccck.  \n  \nIt‚Äôs over bros.  This is one signal that does not fail.  In 2017 I heard door hosts at Vegas clubs swapping shitcoin tips right before the crash, and the same shit in 2021 as well.  The stock market is toast.  \n  \nYou have been warned.",

He got out of the stock market just before the 1929 crash because he was in an elevator and the attendant -- yeah, back then they had manual operation of the elevator -- started giving him investment advice. He said, if ordinary people think they can make a killing, it's time to get out.\n\nUnfortunately, it might very well be an apocryphal story. It's been variously retold as a shoeshine boy. But the point remains pretty clear. It's not possible for everybody to get rich. But it's possible for lots of people to lose money.\n\nUpdate: Old Joe was a scoundrel and a Nazi sympathizer...and as I said, I have no idea whether this story is true. I think it's too clever to be true.",

If it is, Wall Street will be shit... but the positive side is that Main Street won't get hit as hard as it did in 2008.\n\nPeople don't realize how hard Wall Street got hit in 2000.  As you said, it pretty much took 13 years for the S&P to hit ATH after 2000.  Technically, it briefly peeked its head over ATH in 2007, but fell right back down and didn't come back up to the same level until 2013.\n\nI've been trying to talk my boomer dad (75) to take something off the table.  He gave me to the old, \"Oh, I'm not worried if it goes down.  It will eventually come back.
