They pay in relation to the clubs (teams) relevance in the world. Barcelona is one of the top 5 soccer teams in the world so being their main kit sponsor would be pretty damn expensive. \n\nBrands also have the option of buying the naming rights to the stadium. This is also very commonly done in American sports. Kraft. Insurance companies. NRG. Pac Bell Park. Rocket mortgage arena etc. Just a few examples. \n\nAnywho, they also sold the banking rights for honestly chump change compared to other clubs and spotty pays them 70-80mm for all of this.
