  "selftext": "I’ve noticed that many of the older folks in my life are ditching their long-time Direct TV subscriptions. It seems like the recent Disney/ESPN dispute with Direct TV has prompted a lot of them to make the switch.\n\nIt's not much to go on but I’ve noticed a trend over the past month where older people, including coworkers, family, and friends, are switching from Direct TV to Hulu Live TV.\n\nI know AT&T recently sold their remaining Direct TV stake to a company called $TPG. I don’t know much about TPG, except they are a major private equity firm based in Fort Worth, Texas. My initial thought was to buy put leaps on whoever owns Direct TV, but I wanted to ask you degenerates if you have noticed a similar trend among people who overpay for Direct TV.\n\nAre put leaps the play? TPG has a $21b market cap which makes me hesitate. What do you all think? ",

      "body": "TLDR:  No actionable analysis here, just some context.\n\nDTV traditional is a dinosaur, for sure.  DTV/Stream is a bit more like cable/DVR but it has \"unlimited recordings\".  The Box+Remote option is nice for people coming off of the dish.  I personally use DTV/S via app (Smart TV, browser) and it's decent (no box fees).  At the time I subscribed, it had the best channel lineup that was impossible to beat for any other single service. So there is value, I just don't know how that translates to people subscribing to it over other services. As a boomer-adjacent genXer, I probably have more disposable income that the average Joe, so the price is not a factor.",
