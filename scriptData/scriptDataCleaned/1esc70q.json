  "selftext": "After losing 80% of my portfolio in the first few weeks, I wanted nothing else but to make it back. After many hours on the computer and working hard to make good calls, I finally reached breakeven, was drained and my mental health probably took a toll from all the stress. And then the next day I went all in on SPY calls. WORST DECISION EVER. It‚Äôs like I was against God. The crowd strike outage, the people of JAPANS doing some shit in their country etc etc. \n\nPlease vote 1 or 2 for what my next plan of action should be: \n1- Walk away and never look at options again \n2- Fund this account after saving up and make it all back and more.
