You just had to go to help with order and say “wrong or missing items” and it was automated so it would automatically refund you and there wasn’t anyone you had to talk to. They needed to get users just to get on and also had a lot of funding so it was really easy to do\n\nNow they’ve become established and are public while also having to meet shareholders expectation so they aren’t as lenient so you can’t really do that anymore and now even if your order is wrong sometimes like you still might not get a refund for that. I only did for big companies like mcdonald’s or chipotle",

Land and capital raise with inflation and it also affects you more if more of your income goes into 'living costs' rather than into more investments (ie wealth generation), and average wages lag inflation constantly until an significant 'peasent' up-roar, then go straight back to lagging again and then because you're spending far more of your income rather than saving and investing (partly out of necessity)... Graph the lower 60% of incomes vs the top 20% vs inflation for the last 200 years for an example; then do the same for weatlh (better yet remove the top 3% from the system at all and do it).\n\nAlso if you had your money in an index fund you can think of that as the baseline of what you should be beating to be at 0. Forget inflation, just peg your progress vs a passive index fund (includuing all fees/tax).
