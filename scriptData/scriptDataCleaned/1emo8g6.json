It doesn‚Äôt include mutual funds. It doesn‚Äôt include ETFs. It doesn‚Äôt include TSPs. \n\nFor a guy with that much time in the feds, he definitely has at least something in a TSP. \n\nInstead it is simply grouped under the defined pension umbrella even though, obviously, they aren‚Äôt really a defined pension plan. \n\nWith the house money he could take however much, throw it into an ETF, and report zero.\n\nDude could credibly be worth millions but outlets are reading that he has nothing in a 401(k) and no outright ownership and they have assumed a lot of different things about his financial status.",
