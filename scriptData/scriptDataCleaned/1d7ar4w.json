  "selftext": "WM will acquire all outstanding shares of Stericycle for $62 per share in cash, representing the dealâ€™s total value when including Stericycleâ€™s net debt of around $1.4 billion.\n\nI am surprised this has not been posted yet. Thoughts? $SRCL is up almost 15% while $WM is almost down 5% as of this posting. Might be a good time to add $WM if you have been watching the stock unless this acquisition changes your thesis. \n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240602670467/en/WM-to-Acquire-Stericycle-a-Leader-in-Medical-Waste-Services-for-7.2-Billion",
