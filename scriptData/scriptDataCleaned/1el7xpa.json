The more you trade the more money they make, whether your trades win or lose. In a perfect world for your broker, all their customer orders are basically random, balancing out evenly. That‚Äôs what market makers pay big bucks for: non-correlated orders that pay the spread and don‚Äôt pose any net directional risk. Whether any *individual* customer makes or loses money doesn‚Äôt matter, so long as they‚Äôre not all taking the same positions.\n\nIf you want to criticize Robinhood a better basis would be their garbage codebase and complete lack of KYC due diligence: leap day crashes, infinite leverage glitches, spread privileges for minimal trading experience, etc. But those are also what makes for all the fun WSB stories so‚Ä¶",
