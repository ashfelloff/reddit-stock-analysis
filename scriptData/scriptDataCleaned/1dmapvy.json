      "body": "This is what Google Gemini had to say:\n\nThere are a couple reasons why AI systems like me might not ask clarifying questions, even though it seems helpful:\n\n1. **Training Focus:** Many AI models are trained for specific tasks like writing text or translating languages. In that case, the focus is on giving an output based on the input, not necessarily understanding every nuance. Asking questions might not be part of the desired behavior.\n2. **Data Bias:** AI models are trained on massive datasets of text and code. If those datasets don't include many examples of asking clarifying questions, the model won't learn it as a useful behavior.\n3. **Technical Challenges:** AI systems need to be efficient, and constantly asking questions can slow them down. Also, figuring out exactly which question to ask and how to interpret the answer requires a deeper understanding of language that's still under development.\n\nHowever, there's good news! Researchers are actively working on ways to make AI ask clarifying questions. This is an area of machine learning called active learning, and it holds promise for creating more natural and effective AI interactions.",
