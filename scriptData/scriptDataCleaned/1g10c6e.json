          "body": "It‚Äôs really puzzling how in the year 2024 there are still any credibility left whatsoever with Elon when it comes to FSD.\n\nEven *if* it comes out in 2026, his timeline would have gone from 6 months to **9 years**. There are only two explanations for when people miss estimates by 1800%:\n\n1. They are intentionally lying\n2. They are absolutely incompetent at their job and have zero understanding of the work.\n\nNow before someone calls me a Tesla hater, I was actually an early investor of Tesla, owned a Model 3 and liked it a lot, and was even a moderator on the Tesla sub. I still think the company is doing a lot of cool things but everything with regard to FSD has just been a borderline scam to monetize something that is years away from being ready.\n\nWhen FSD was announced in 2016 I have friends in the AV field (autonomous vehicle, not adult videos), that pretty much suggested that Elon either has zero technical understanding of the challenges in the field or he‚Äôs just being a con artist.\n\nNow seeing his current day behavior and looking back, I‚Äôm a firm believer that he was both of those.\n\n**Edit**: It‚Äôs really hard to explain why there are *still* people firmly believe Tesla is a leader in the AV space. There are multiple companies *already* operating robo-taxi fleets in some of the biggest cities, from Waymo to [Chinese startups](https://youtu.be/izLfWY4c0Ko?si=QqP15Uh311UTdKnR).\n\nYet Tesla has not demonstrated a *single* time that their cars can operate on public road (even today‚Äôs event was done in a movie studio for fuck‚Äôs sake) without a human driver behind the wheel.\n\nElon might as well promise he‚Äôs gonna solve FSD by inventing AGI at this point. Oh wait, he kinda did: https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-musk-predicts-ai-will-be-smarter-than-smartest-human-next-year-2024-04-08/\n\n**Edit 2**: As expected, Tesla fans with zero technical knowledge have jumped out of the woodworks spewing misinformation. These people are claiming Waymo doesn't use \"software and AI\" when Google literally published the paper Tesla based their neural net on: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g10c6e/musk_robotaxi_to_be_30k_and_confirmed_to_be/lrdcscf/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g10c6e/musk_robotaxi_to_be_30k_and_confirmed_to_be/lrdga08/",
