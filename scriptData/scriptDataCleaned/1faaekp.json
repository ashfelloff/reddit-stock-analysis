  "selftext": "This happens every damn time. The stock drops more than 10-20%, everyone loses their mind, people panic and call for absurdly low price targets like 70-80, and then it shoots back up. \n\nAnd **every** single time these predictions and targets pop up, they are said with the utmost confidence only for them to be wrong. \n\nIt’s remarkable how people can’t follow the simple adage of buying during fear and selling during greed. This entire sub is panicking and frothing over how much the stock dropped and you’re now…selling? **after** the drop? A drop which was precipitated by a baseless article regarding a DOJ subpoena? No wonder you’re losing your grandma’s money. \n",
