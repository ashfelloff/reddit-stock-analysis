I think this stock has tons of room to run — if they win any of these contracts to be awarded soon, it’ll be huge. And if they have a fully successful landing (after getting SO close last time), well, we could really see some fireworks. I think the stock is still cheap. I see price targets between $8 and $12, and if some of this stuff goes well, I feel like it could go much higher than that.\n\nNone of it is a guarantee, right?
