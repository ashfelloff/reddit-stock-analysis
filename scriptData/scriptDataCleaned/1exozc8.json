  "selftext": "So for a bit of context, I put a fixed portion of my salary each month into S&P, Total World and a bunch of blue chip stocks such as Microsoft, JPM, BRK, Amazon each month. I built this “portfolio” 4 years ago and am up 30% or so, the reason for the “perceived” underperformance is that I’ve increased my monthly contributions since last year which has led to a large rise in average cost basis. I’m hoping to cross the 100k mark in the next 12 months if the current trajectory continues. \n\nWhile I recognize that investing is a long-term game, the process feels slow at times. I'm curious to hear from others who have pursued a similar passive investing strategy.\n\nHow long did it take for your portfolio to reach a point where the annual passive income matched or exceeded your annual salary? When did you feel comfortable enough with your portfolio's performance and size to consider retiring or achieving financial independence. Specifically, how long did it take before you felt your portfolio could sustain your lifestyle without the need for additional income from employment?",

It is a much better investment to hone a very good career or learn skills that are marketable and open a business or get a really good job....  My portfolio could sustain a simpler lifestyle now (roughly 100k a year in dividends) but lifestyle creep is real and I do enjoy some of the finer things.  So i will work and continue to let it compound for another 10 - 15 years.

I was happy to shed them - especially prior to covid where the people in there would have undoubtedly stopped paying their rent with no fear of being evicted.   I still have 2 industrial buildings, one we run our business out that I essentially rent from myself, and one that is a full rental.  Also some smaller flex space units under construction that should start filling up the 2nd prong of my plan which was a goal of around 450k passive income, half dividends half RE... I like industrial real estate, someone moves out - you pressure wash it and re-rent it.  most of the time people stay for a long time. I like the liquidity and the returns on equities.  They have been higher most recently. \n\nI like equities.  The only downside is wild market swings. With real estate you aren't sitting evaluating its value on a per minute basis.  I wouldn't own residential homes again.  I am considering an investment in a deal to develop some lower cost family oriented housing near by but there would be management in place and we would just collect a check - hopefully in the 8-9% range a year.",

Carrying a balance on any revolving credit should be enemy number one in your battle to becoming financially independent. Carrying credit card balances, for example, will suck you dry faster than you can imagine. If you can’t pay for it, you can’t afford it. Thats mainly all there is to it from my perspective.\n\nEDIT: I have worked with a wealth management firm for the past 5 years and has been a boon for my investing.

Held heavy bags of RIG when it fell to 40s in 2012 and held it to single digits. I for once timed LULU perfectly buying it at 30s only to fold after it ran up 20% and then watching it go up 12x. Held INTL for 15+ yrs thinking i am DCA, when i could have bought real quality stocks between 2008-2012, i put my money on those chinese solar companies to lose it all. Oh! I also once held few bitcoins when it was in the $2k range and very quickly sold them thinking they'll eventually go to $0 because its a \"silly, internet money\"!

We sold our first completely independent film to Warner Bros Max last month. It's pretty awesome. \n\nI started out with $500 from saving up all my money from last semester of working in college and in 15 years turned maybe a net savings of $65,000 (around $100,000 deposits minus $35,000 withdrawals) into $350,000. Took 10 years to get to the first $100,000. The first 5 years I didn't think about the money, I just thought about making good decisions. The next 5 years sometimes I thought about the money and realize I'll be old by the time I make $1M or $2M at my current income/pace. By year 10 you realize investing is just part of your habits and you don't think of the time it will take to get rich and retire because you've already created a fulfilling life as you are. Now I manage friends portfolios for them (About $200,000 currently) for free and it's very rewarding to see how amazed they are by how much money you can make by just being smart about where you put it. The great thing about investing is to manage $5,000 is not much different than managing $50,000 and it wont be much different managing $500,000 or $5 Million.",

All in I took about $130k in 2019 and really focussed for about a month on researching and planning our portfolio for a 10 year period to see if I could make significant difference in our wealth.  I also did this because I will have 2 kids in college at that time.  \nWhile it hasn’t always been a pretty chart, I have managed to 4x that initial sum with no additional contributions.  So much so that we have also transferred all the accounts into my management.  \n\nMy simple approach of seeking 10% minimum growth annually and rolling all dividends into speculation equities or higher growth potential holdings.  If you are up 30% including the last 4 years which means likely your initial investment had a big drop in Feb 20’ unless you timed that perfectly.  I would say you are on the right track, and as you should be able to start seeing that sum increase exponentially.  At an average of 10% growth you would double in just over 7 years.  And as you approach 20-30% growth you are doubling every 2 and a 1/2 years.  \n\nAs far as being rich, that’s an impossible number to quantify.

Im insanely frugal to the point that it even annoys me because I know I can afford to spend more. So I could have retired on my 1st mil back in 2012.

      "body": "\"Anyone\" ? Yes. But you have to understand the risk involved with getting rich in a short time span. 30% is decent growth but your mistake is that you're kinda aimless in your approach and I'm assuming very risk averse. You say you made this portfolio 4 years ago. Depending on when exactly in 2020 you did that, considering the nose dive and massive rebound the economy experienced, you could have been up at least 70% if not more if your money was on something like QQQ for example. And before people start howling about how irresponsible something like this is, it's not, if you know what you're doing. Ok maybe 70% is not exactly right since it doesn't account for the contributions spread across the 4 year time frame, but the point is, if you're not touching that money for the next 5-10-20 years, why the S&P500 and not the top 100? It's pretty much the same chart with a wider range. Higher highs and lower lows, better long term growth. If you're putting money in the s&p and all world and a handful of companies that are so big they have no real room to grow anymore, it paints the picture of someone who wants gains without the risk of ever seeing his investment go red even momentarily. That's fine, that's understandable, it's the right approach for many people, but if you want to maximise growth, then you're not doing it right, rather you're going at it blind. Chasing growth means treating your investment like a time capsule, you do not touch that money for a good long while, you define your time frame and plan a strategy accordingly. \n\nAlso the alternative of not investing doesn't really do anyone any good. You work, you make money, you save, there's no benefit of having your savings sit and do nothing. Even with modest growth you're still getting free money for doing nothing. You want to hit it big? You can try, but that comes with more risk, and for 99.9% of people, it's not worth it. Stick to what you're doing now and it will pay off.",
