This threatened the petrodollar at the time and the USA wasn't bogged down in Ukraine, Palestine, or Taiwan at the time.\n\n\nA gold-backed currency is controversial because the country wouldn't need to participate in the US dollar dominated international financial system. If Zimbabwe could pull it off, it's more controversial than Russia invading Ukraine as far as rejecting US hegemony. Essentially they would be acting as an alternative to US debt which is something in the tens of trillions now. If countries don't use US dollars and debt to back their currencies then the USA collapses.\n\n\nBut it probably won't work because Zimbabwe would need to show its proven gold reserves, and then protect those proven gold reserves from a military that could get greedy and take over the building where the reserves are.
