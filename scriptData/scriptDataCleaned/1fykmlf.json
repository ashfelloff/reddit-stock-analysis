Imo, this market is priced to perfection and if there is any significant hiccup on the way, this market could spiral for a correction. Anyone saying they expected to hit ATH while the Fed kept the 2% inflation target is straight up lying. If you don't think we are in bizzaro world, just think of the things that don't make sense. Housing prices are insanity. Houses trending towards half mil in no where towns in the Midwest, property taxes going ballistic this year, hot economy in the US while costs are so high, and the biggest being the cost of capital going up for companies when it was essentially 0 for so long.

The stock market rose on the strength of the economy. It isnt a conspiracy and it isnt a 'bubble'. The 2021 stock bonanza was a mini-bubble. But the past 2 years were not. Median income has significantly risen significantly, most companies are already at ATH profits and revenues, even travel companies. Current PE ratios are slightly elevated but are well within the range the S&P has traded at in the past 3 decades. Prices are also slightly elevated because of the higher than normal growth we have seen in the past 2 years and stock prices are forward looking and account for growth. \n\n&nbsp\nWhilst moneyprinting had accounted for the 2021 mini-bubble. Interest rates had been high since then and US money supply had steadily been decreasing since then. So no, the past 2 years of growth was not because the FED had been continuing on a money printing bonanza. Sometimes you just gotta appreciate a soft landing and be grateful for once in your life.",

This is especially true since 2008. It isn’t an exact line for line trend, but the ebbs and flows average out to that sadly.\n\nWe haven’t had the technological innovation in 3 years to warrant the growth of the S&P. This is what happens with a fiat currency. It’s a bunch of crap, but it’s the game we all play. \n\nTake NVDA for example it’s made plenty of us lots of money on paper. Now tell me how it’s changed your day to day life? Just one example how this market and our whole run on inflation is a big bubble. ",
