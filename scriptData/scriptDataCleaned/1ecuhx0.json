It‚Äôs better to get stung, then immerse yourself into study of economics, markets, and anything you can get your hands on. You can listen to everyone‚Äôs advice, but you will be amazed at how much the pros differ. That should tell you something. Nobody can predict the future, but through the study of economics and markets, you might pick up correlations between the two. That‚Äôs a start. \n\nAnd if you ever save $30,000 again, invest $3,000 until you have a clue, like in a couple of years. Then maybe your life savings might be $40,000 by then. Add another $1,000 to the stock market. Anything you don‚Äôt need of your stash should be in treasuries if the FOMC starts cutting the FFR. Give yourself a few years of small ball trading before you increase the %. If you already have a gambling problem, then stay out of the market forever!",
