  "selftext": "Full disclosure, this is a rehash of what I said before and currently don't have a position, but plan on getting in as TSLA grinds down to $150.\n\nI have maintained that while Tesla (TSLA) is looking cheap, selling isn't done, yet. Chinese competitors are going hard and sentiment will stay negative for at least another few weeks, till fundamentals start caching up. TSLA is going to get much better run at the US market longer term (see Ford announcement to suspend the investment in EVs), more the sentiment turns negative right now. Its lead in battery tech, software and AI, and charging will turn it into a monster money machine not far in future, but next 6 months once interest rates start to dip. Wait for stock to drop to 150 and then load up.\n\nBottomline: long term buy, but lay off for next month to allow yourselves some peace.\n\n&#x200B;",

Factor in operating costs and you're looking at low single digit profit margins. Charging is just a middle man between the electric utility company and the consumer. Consumers want the cheapest energy possible. They'll just go elsewhere or plan around charging at home if charging companies raise prices too much. Sure Tesla can still pull supercharger revenue on road trips but road trips are a tiny fraction of daily driving and EV owners already do 90% of their charging at home according to the DOE.\n\nAlso, oil prices aren't expensive when you look at inflation adjusted history of oil prices.\n\n[https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1369/crude-oil-price-history-chart)",
