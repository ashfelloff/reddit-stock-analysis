But NVIDIA did tank yesterday to 762 USD, so I would have expected the buyer on the other side of this option to exercise, meaning: OP is obliged to purchase 100 NVIDIA shares at the price of 800 USD while share prices are at 762 USD, so making a total loss of 3800 USD (excl. received premium on the options sold).
