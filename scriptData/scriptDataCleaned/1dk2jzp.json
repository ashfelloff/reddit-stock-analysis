  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo let's say you get lucky and buy a certain stock for very cheap many years ago.\n\nToday it's up like 10x and you have huge unrealized gains. You're concerned that its price may go down because it does feel like it's overbought but you also like the company and are happy to keep it for the long term.\n\n**Question: What's the best strategy to protect your gains in case the stock takes a sudden dive of >20%?**\n\nIf you sell a bunch now, you'll pay 20% as LT Cap Gains -- so that sucks you might as well keep it because  even if it drops <20% you're still better off holding the stock. Also guarantees no further growth,\n\nYou can set a trailing stop loss at 20% but it seems like those can get triggered for the wrong reasons.\n\nFidelity also has a bunch of conditional exit plans like \"One Cancels the Other\" -- but it's not clear how to use those.\n\nBuy put options? Is this cost effective? ",

Because you’ll lose almost as much value on the put as you gain from the security it’s on going up.\n\nBut you are very wrong on the downside protection. Selling a CC gives you protection from downside as it protects an amount equivalent to your premium you receive. If it goes down and the contract expires worthless you keep all the premium and hold the underlying still able to ride it back up. If it goes down and you buy it back for cheaper you also keep the premium amount over the price you have to buy back and the underlying security to ride back up.\n\nTry selling a deep ITM CC sometime and report back what the resulting P&L is when the underlying goes down. You be pleasantly surprised you lose little if any overall as the CC loses money for the person you sold it to also leading to little or not P&L loss as it goes down. That’s a pretty solid downside protection 😉. It just doesn’t protect you from unlimited downside, only down to around the strike you sold the CC at. Any loss past that is going to hit you. If it’s a good company though you can assume it’s likely not going to drop bankruptcy level in the foreseeable future.",

      "body": "Lets say its NVDA. I would look at the long dated options I can get which are 12/2026. \n\nLooking at the option chain I would consider selling a $71 call and selling a $168 put. Seems strange at first glance, but look at the breakeven points and potential profit. \n\nStock would have to crater 75% ($34)before you lose money on this deal. It would also have to go up 45%($204) more before you have giving up additional gains you could have gotten by not hedging. In the meantime you collect roughly $133 per share now with the tax issues happening in late 2026. Toss the money into a treasury etf that focuses on lets say 5 year treasuries. Collect the dividends and wait. \n\nNow I dont know your cost basis, but I if I was holding a position and wanted to cash out a bit I would tweak the two options so the lower break even point is relatively close to my cost basis but not necessarily all the way down to it. Essentially I would be cashing out the bulk of my profits. \n\nNow imagine the options are getting close to expiration. You have choices to make but it will basically boil down to where the stock price is at that point. Below $34 you lost money with the put being the issue. Below $71 you didnt make max profit you dont lose your shares and you might actually be picking up some up if put gets exercised. Above $71 you again didnt make max profit as you still have that put you sold possibly kicking in, but you also dont lose your shares. Above $168 you are losing out in opportunity cost and either let shares go or have to pay to keep them. \n\nWhy would I consider this route over the single call? More theta to decay in my favor AND I have a bit of hedge for if Im wrong about a longer term drop. A key thing though is if you go this route do not risk the credit collected. Just put it work for some risk free interest. In a couple of years you will close the options and will realize some tax implications. Barring a total collapse of the share price you should come out ahead over simply selling the stock at this moment. You will be behind where you would be if you didnt hedge and the stock still runs up quite a bit over a couple of years. \n\nNow I dont how many shares you got, but if its was me and it was going to result in a lot of contracts I would probably do a bit of this, and also sell calls for this year and more of the sold call and sold put approach for 2025. I would likely do ITM for 2025 and 2026 with an eye towards the lower break even being in the ballpark of my cost basis. I would probably sell the calls for this year a decent ways OTM and plan to roll them if they get near to ITM. And as always I would park the money collected into some risk free treasuries and just hold that until I work through this. Ideally the shares wont go away, but I will likely have short term gains this year, long term gains from this trade in 2025 and 2026. If in 2026 all has worked out I will have collected a bunch of interest from that risk free treasuries and I will have tax events for the gains I experienced in each of those years. If things went ok for the stock I might have even picked up some more shares. I may have sold some when that happened to rebalance the portfolio, but who knows. \n\nThe only real downsides of this are the sold put requires you to secure with cash or margin, you could lose money if the stock absolutely craters more than 75% and stays that way, or the stocks runs up a ton further and you have to pay a bit to keep your shares. But on the bright side risk free treasuries etfs pay. You could stack up a decent amount of cash during the intervening time. Everyone is in a different place, but for me I would feel comfortable with this for a stock I liked but has volatility.",

      "body": "Insurance costs money which cuts into your profits. Long dated ITM or ATM puts are a great option if you fear a crash but they will cost a fair bit, so you have to consider whether any possible growth of the stock in that timeframe if it doesn't crash will outweigh these costs. You can also get OTM puts so that they're cheaper. If you're ok with losing 20% before cutting your losses for example it's not that unreasonable to buy a put that only starts going ITM with a 20% drop, though of course if it's rising in the meantime you run the risk of creating a widening gap that may not be covered at all by the put by the time a crash happens. This it also the reason why people buy ITM options. \n\nAlternatively you can sell covered calls if you have at least 100 shares. If it's overbought it's likely you'll receive decent premiums for them, though you have to have a plan for the possibility of exercising. If you find yourself rolling to not get exercised constantly you're just losing money, and being exercised may be a less than ideal scenario but it's not that bad if it's for a higher strike price than the current one. It's sort of like ripping a band aid. You're unsure whether you want to sell or hold and getting assinged forces your hand somewhat and you might miss out on even more potential gains but you also lock in profits right now.\n\nLastly you can just cash out and put the money into something less volatile but you will get hit with taxes on that.",
