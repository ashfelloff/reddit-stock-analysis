  "score": 51,
  "selftext": "What's up with $ASTS options market. The front week is good, bids and ask are close, but anything further out has the widest spreads.\n\nIs anybody playing that? Such as getting filled on a buy below the midpoint and flipping that to sell above the midpoint? Doesn't seem like these contracts have enough volume for that, so nobody's doing it\n\nBut seriously, it's atrocious liquidity and spreads for a real position, like $3 spreads on a $5 option. What can we do about that? Why is it like that? Market makers will fill you somewhere in between the bid and ask, no problem, but its still fucking annoying, you don't really know how much you make and different brokers show you different midpoint prices in the mean time.\n\nI hate illiquid options and these shouldn't be.",
