          "body": "Boeing is too big to fail and will never die.\n\nDespite killing hundreds of people, Boeing commercial aircraft sales nevertheless contribute massively to the country's GDP. It moves the needle so much that many official economic indicators exclude \"commercial aircraft\" because the cyclical, burst-y nature of the sales make fluctuations from *all other economic activity* seem like noise by comparison.\n\nEven then, that is not nearly as important as Boeing's defense business. The reality is that Boeing is a national security asset. Quality issues, cost overruns, schedule delays, doesn't matter. The DOD just considers that the cost of doing business. Boeing delivers weapons, fighters, etc. that the DOD \"needs\". Thus, there is an implicit, unlimited government-backed financial backstop to keep the doors at Boeing open indefinitely.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't necessarily mean shares wouldn't go to $0 if Boeing went into government receivership. I have no particular position in Boeing outside of long index funds.",
