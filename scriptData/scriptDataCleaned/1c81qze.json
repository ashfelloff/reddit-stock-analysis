No one on youtube is going to give you actual methods on how to trade because it creates too much competition. It's something you need to learn on your own. But most of the times trading is gambling. Only 1-20% are actually successful, which means 80-99% are not. Doesn't mean you can't find ways to maximize your gains with options. You just gotta be smart and not do what other people are doing.",
