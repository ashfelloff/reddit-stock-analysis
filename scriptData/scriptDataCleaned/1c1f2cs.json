  "selftext": "1. PPI came weaker than projected. An interesting nugget from the release\n2. Markets overeacted to a minor miss in CPI on Wednesday\n3. EU on path to start cutting rates.  Yield hunting will send that money to the US.\n4. China injecting more money into the market.\n5. Smaller markets (India, Japan, UK) growing\n6. Election year - governments stimulating the markets\n\nThe risk of elevated yields is there, but its actually helpful to have high interest rates as that gives central banks ammunition in case market stutters.  Historically, we see a pause once the top rate is reached.  Markets fret during the pause, but continues to grind higher given a lack of direction from Fed.  \n\nThis is a 3 year bulls market.  Yesterday was a good opportunity to put your cash to work.  Small bumps here and there will come, but don't fight the tide.  Go Long!\n\nPS - lot of comments as to how market has trended slightly lower so far.  Its early days and you'll be better off staying in than out in this market.\n\nPPS - an interesting nugget from today's PPI release:\n\n    A major factor in the March increase in prices for final demand services was the \n    index for securities brokerage, dealing, investment advice, and related services, which rose 3.1 percent.
