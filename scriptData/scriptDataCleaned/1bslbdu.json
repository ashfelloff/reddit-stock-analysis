An authorization for a share buyback is a permission granted by the company’s board of directors to repurchase a certain amount of its own shares from the market. This authorization sets a maximum limit on the money or number of shares that can be bought back and usually has a set time frame.\n\nThe actual buying back of stocks is the process where the company goes to the market to purchase its own shares, which is done after the authorization is approved. The company may not necessarily buy back the full amount authorized immediately or at all, depending on market conditions, company needs, and other strategic priorities. Therefore, completing the share buyback authorization means the company has finished purchasing the amount of shares or spent the amount of money that was authorized.",
