Don't ever trade earnings.  \nThat's when you have the least edge as an options trader.  \nThe move is already priced in and you're risking ALL of your money to make maybe a 100% gain. When you can actually find much much lower risk setups in the market to 10x your account overtime.   \nThings like $AMD and $NVDA when they bottomed in October of 2022.  \nThere are similar opportunities right now. In stocks like $PYPL & $SQ.  \nAs the fed begins to cut rates, these stocks tend outperform as do all hypergrowth tech names.\n\nJust stay way from options for now. Trade stocks & ETFs. See if you can get going again with a better system of identifying setups, entries and exits. Once you're rock solid trading stocks, you can come back to options.   \nStay away from any options that expire within 3 months or less.  \nI'd actually focus on leaps. 1+ year out.  \nA lot less risk/chance and theta decay involved and you still get a lot of leverage.  \nJust make sure whatever you're trading is liquid enough to have a tight bid-ask spread on options that expire a year out.\n\nI wish you all the best. But $60K is still a lot of money and you can definitely make it back. It would be an absolute shame if you wasted that on earnings and gone down to 20K or something like that.
