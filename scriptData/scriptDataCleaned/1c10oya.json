  "selftext": "Entered today having sold x45 SPY $515Cs open for ~$4.32 and purchased x25 QQQ $439Ps for ~$1.45.\n\nSold-to-close the QQQ puts right at open... small gain. Then blasted SPY $513Cs... IV was insane, got almost $2 each. As soon as the 9:50 reversal happened, I additionally sold SPY $315Ps... IV was still insane, got almost $1.50 each.\n\nContinued to trade all day... sold $514Ps, then $515Ps as SPY rebounded close to $515. The 10:40 reversal caught me off guard so I had to turn every Put into a straddle as SPY retraced. Scared the fuck out of myself at 1:10 when I sold to open x120 SPY $514Cs for only 50 cent each on the shitty T-notes sale and SPY insta-bounced back up.\n\nHeld all day because Momma didn't raise no bitch. When it was all said and done, SPY ~$513.50 was my best case/max profit. The end-of-day runup to $515 had me sweating.... needed OT for this one. Held through regular hours anticipating a drop in AHs - and was rewarded. Closed everything expiring 4/10.\n\nOpened Vertical Call spreads for tomorrow, SPY 4/11, $513Cs.",
