And I liked to scalp Forex while watching minutes & seconds chartsüòÇ I spent a good amount of time just picking colours for all of them as required by my bachelor of design undergrad. I stopped seeing the candlesticks‚Äîjust pretty layers of technical indicators, with cool, desaturated colours fading in to the background and warm, highly saturated colours in the foreground, or vice versa depending on the chart background. They became like constantly evolving, abstract landscapes, and I wonder how far it can be taken. Can I make ‚Äúliving‚Äù kinetic sculptures that metamorphosize based on market data? Or how about immersive, experiential, environmental art‚Äîmarket data controls the release of fog, and the colour and intensity of lights, sound effects, temperature, the irrigation of plants, opening and closing of doors, windows, shutters, moving walls? Might interaction with the art trigger trades? Most importantly, is it profitable? ü´†",
