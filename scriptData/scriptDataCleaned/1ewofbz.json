                      "body": "Okay so to be honest, I have no juicy LEAPS positions, and the closest I've come to such things is seeing your YOLO update (nicely done btw, beautiful gains!) and vicariously speculate what I would do if I have had the foresight for such things. So really, I have no idea what I'm talking about. \n\nBut here's what I'd do if I had some LEAPS that were nicely up: \n\nSell one of them for some money in the hand - and with that money I'd buy myself some time with an accountant well versed in trading and related tax obligations for your country. Not being facetious here, if I had gains in the 5-6 figures, my first call is going to be to a chartered accountant to get their advice. If you have a lot of calls, then imo 1 of them is worth selling to get that advice. I don't know much about tax laws but I know if I'm up significantly, then I want to have a chat with someone who does! \n\nSecondarily, I'd be thinking about whether I want to lock in those gains and convert them to cash, to use on another position or play, or, if I want to be long on a position, then, in a way that the accountant says is cool, I'd look to sell some of the calls to pay for the exercise of more of the calls into stocks. But it all depends on the ratio of cash to stock you want to see out of it, and your personal strategy. For myself personally, I've always thought if I get some juicy LEAPS I'd: see the accountant, take some profit and put into an SP500-relates fund managed in my country (tax stuff), take some profit and convert to long stock position, save the smallest ratio of calls to hold until close to exp, around 3 months, and then depending on how I feel, sell the rest for profit, or, sell some to pay to exercise the rest. \n\nSorry for the essay! Again, I'm not in this position, purely speculating (I just have long stocks on ASTS, no LEAPS, but I think space is cool.) \n\nMost important thing though, is, if the amount you're up is significant, it's worth seeing a professional accountant about as the first point of call!",

Fidelity has been calling and I can meet with one of their local advisors for free, at first. My plan was to do that, and get a referral for an accountant, but was thinking that wouldn‚Äôt be important until next year. And, I‚Äôve been putting off the Fidelity call, for various reasons. Partly because I‚Äôve got lots going on, partly because I don‚Äôt like phone calls, and honestly, maybe, a little bit of embarrassment over what I‚Äôve done. Even though it worked out, it‚Äôs kind of nuts (and ohmygosh, also, then I‚Äôd have to stop. Eek.)\n\nOk, thanks again. I will leave a message this morning and get some help. (And practice saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to paid services - I tend to just agree to things.)\n\n(I did take my initial and profits along the way, though ASTS is still a large position.)\n\nHave a great day!",

(They don't expire until 2026 right?), so if you've got other stuff going on, you can focus on that while knowing that you've done some awesome stuff on the investing side, and tackle this once you've spent some time figuring out your feelings and your strategy. \n\nSo yeah, don't rush into it, take some time to really feel out where you want to go with your position, and definitely practice saying no to stuff! Get second opinions, and, the one thing I will strongly say, is if anyone tries to instill a \"sense of urgency\" in you before 2026 then be wary of that. But yeah, defs get some professional advice on the best way to manage tax stuff. \n\nAgain, I'm super unqualified, but it's so cool to see your journey and how you're working things out - I'm gonna try build some capital and play some RKLB LEAPS so hopefully I'll get a chance to put my theories into practice üòÅ",
