Intel can't afford such a huge consumer base to have another reason not to buy their stuff. On the other they don't want to be accused of antisemitism at a time when they can illafford any more controversy. Plus they're losing marketshare and have declining sales, so they don't really need a new plant right now.\n\nSo to walk the middle line they've cancelled construction of the factory, but they're only saying it's on pause to try and eat their cake and have it too.",

Invidia, Google, Amazon, AMD etc - which unlike Intel haven't been shrinking even before any boycotts. This means that when Intel lays off an educated Israeli worker he just immediately goes into an equally high paying tech position. No damage done to Israel other than a stressful month for a bunch of people.\n\nUnless you successfully boycott a substantial percentage of the tech companies employing Israelis, the Israeli workforce still gets paid by you just the same.

Intel is in the best position, they got a ton of CHIPS act money, and in 2-4 years they could become the best chip maker in the world, by building state of the art fabs. Where are they putting one of them? In a more volatile country than Taiwan has ever been.🤦🏻",
