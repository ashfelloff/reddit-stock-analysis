Wilson even said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny to watch them try and say it‚Äù when asked about the pronunciation.

Only minor decreases but just a few days ago their asking price is now what my offer was. The listing agent actually called my agent and said they‚Äôre willing to accept my last offer but I said fuck that, I would still like the property but I am pissed at the seller for trying to be greedy and holding this deal up for 3 months and now they finally want to take my offer. At this point I want to see how much longer it sits and what it finally sells for. Probably will sell for under what I offered. \n\nHope the sellers feel good for delaying their own sale for 4-6 months just to get a lower price than an offer they got 3 days after they listed their home.",
