Wilson believed that brand names with multiple “L’s” would sound more Western or North American to Japanese consumers, and that this would make the name seem more authentic. Wilson even said, “It’s funny to watch them try and say it” when asked about the pronunciation. He also thought that the difficulty in pronouncing the name could be an extra marketing tool in Japan.",

It was under the sellers asking price, but even in the current market I felt I was offering too much.\n\nOffer declined and for the past 3 months I’ve been watching them decrease the price over and over on a 2 week basis. Only minor decreases but just a few days ago their asking price is now what my offer was. The listing agent actually called my agent and said they’re willing to accept my last offer but I said fuck that, I would still like the property but I am pissed at the seller for trying to be greedy and holding this deal up for 3 months and now they finally want to take my offer. At this point I want to see how much longer it sits and what it finally sells for. Probably will sell for under what I offered. \n\nHope the sellers feel good for delaying their own sale for 4-6 months just to get a lower price than an offer they got 3 days after they listed their home.",
