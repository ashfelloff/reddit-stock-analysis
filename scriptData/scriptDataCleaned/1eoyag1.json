      "body": "For context, the chairperson of the India's financial regulatory agency (think SEC) owned stake in offshore financial vehicles used by Adani group for a range of unsavory activities.\n\nAdani group is one of the largest conglomerate in India and briefly the founder was richest man in the world. Hindenburg claimed in their previous short seller report that Adani used the same offshore financial vehicles to manipulate his share price, commit money laundering, theft etc. It was reported that these vehicles actually consisted of 30%-47% of the company share's delivery volume.\n\nAdani's stock price crashed 60% last time the report came out but because regulatory agencies took no action, it bounced back up.\n\nNow that this is revealed, there will be more intervention and likely the company will lose credibility and its creditors will come knocking, its share price will go down and so on and so forth.\n\nAlso, Adani and the ruling party are quite close and have been granted special privileges and contracts. In the end, Adani has become too big to fail, too many assets bought with shareholder money and debt that was raised on false premises, but that's India for you.",
