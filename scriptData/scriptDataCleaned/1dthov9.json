I do this based on whether I believe the company and go over news and financials. I have no idea about TA.\n\nBut I've seen a lot of people use TA and also many more people being skeptical about it and calling it \"Astrology for men\" etc..\n\nI think that chart patterns and candlesticks is useless, but I still feel that some aspects of TA is useful.  \nI've seen people mentioning that they do fundamental analysis and use TA to get an entry ?  \nI wanna do stuff like this, but the problem is that I have no idea on where to start.\n\nWhen I search up technical analysis on youtube, all I see is a bunch of clickbaity videos and a bunch of videos which just seem to be fake.\n\nRight now my goals are to invest for a long term, but also swing trade a little bit.  \nSo my questions are:  \nCan I swing trade without using TA, and just with news and fundamentals ?  \nDo I need to learn TA at all?  \nAnd if yes, where should I even start to learn?",

They go by the charts to see which price to get in, where to set stop losses and when to get out.\n\nIf this is your first dabble with picking stocks, learn fundamentals first and how to pick good companies. And just let your portfolio grow naturally.\n\nyou are young and I would strongly advice against day trading until you get a few years in the market and have a stable good paying job.\n\nAnd once you get to trading, just like in baseball just going for a hit to get in base is more than enough rather than always trying to swing for the fences and likely striking-out.",

      "body": "## Daily Met Coal commentary: \n\n(Green steel fans, look away)\n\nSomeone on Twitter [posted Goldman Sach's latest met coal cost curve](https://i.imgur.com/24Yt4T7.png). This graph breaks down at a company level what their total production is vs. their marginal cost. It's a bit tricky, so let's explain further.\n\nSuppose we pick the 90th percentile of production, as in, move along the x-axis until you have reached 90% of the current global production. Now move upward to the height of the bar. This is your 90th percentile marginal cost of $240. For any of the producers to the left, it costs them $240 or less to produce the *next* ton of coal. Equivalently, for all producers to the right (the last 10% of production), it costs them more than $240 for the *next* ton of coal. \n\nUsing the 75th percentile and its height of $215, this implies 25% of producers (the ones to the right) must incur costs of at least $215 per ton on new production.\n\nSo what does this imply if the price of met coal falls to say $215? It means 25% of producers find it unprofitable to increase their production anymore. Over time, labor costs + material inflation are pushing up the cost curve. E.g., if that $215 becomes $230, this means the price of met coal only has to $230 for 25% of producers to see new tons as unprofitable.\n\nSome of these company specific numbers are suspect, in my opinion, e.g., AMR. There is some details on which benchmarks are used by different companies, as well as seasonal or temporary discounts between different benchmarks. (If it costs you $100 to produce your coal but you sell it at a discount of $50 to the premium benchmark due to quality differences, your marginal cost is computed as $150. That way your marginal cost is comparable to the premium producers.) Also, keep in mind this is marginal costs, not total costs.\n\nWhat you want to do is pick companies that are low cost in production (to the left), realize prices as close to the premium benchmark as possible (not shown in this picture), are able to increase production (HCC and BTU, not AMR). Teck, for example, appears to be one of the lowest cost operators of met coal. Though some of these producers to the left aren't necessarily good investments because they aren't pure play met coal producers and also own various other assets. Some aren't even investible, e.g., Russian producers.",

Regarding timeline, they write the company cannot even *enter* the mine safely for months. The mine remains on fire with smoke pouring out of entrances. Even if they can fully extinguish it, production won't start for much longer, if it even does ever again.\n\nMeanwhile an underground fire just happened in a W. Virginia met coal mine. It literally just opened up 2 years ago. There goes another 2-3 MPTA.\n\n(These aren't common occurrences, so the fact 2 happened within a day of each other is total coincidence)",
