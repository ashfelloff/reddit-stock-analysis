It’s supposed to be an autonomous fleet of cars. This is the same way you scale software. Many small servers not one big one. In software we call this horizontal scaling. \n\nYou don’t want fewer 4 seat cars with a lot of open seats. You want more 2 seat cars with a lot of taken seats. Saturation is important. \n\nSometimes I read Reddit and get frustrated about how…unimaginative (a polite euphemism) some of you are.\n\nA lot of you criticize things you simply have no experience or understanding to criticize. Some of the biggest critics amongst us are also some of the least capable people amongst us. \n\nThe fact that this is not a 5 seater or whatever you want is proof someone with an engineer’s mindset was thinking about this. \n\nAlso they did unveil a bus for very large groups to handle that edge case. But what is shown here is the most common case.\n\n\nIf I was an engineer thinking about this problem I would: \n- want there to be as many autonomous cars as possible, which means as small as possible while still being safe and comfortable. This increases coverage area and ability to scale how many ride requests can be serviced concurrently \n- have as few open seats as possible for every ride request. By limiting it to 2 seats per car I can guarantee at least 50% usage per ride request. This means if I have 1000 seats (500 2-seat cars) that I am moving at least 500 people if every car is servicing a ride request. If I had 1000 seats in 200 5-seat cars I might only be moving at 200 people or 20% of my seat capacity in the worst case scenario. \n\nMoving 200 people at worst vs 500 people at worst is over 100% difference depending on how you design this.\n\nIt is no coincidence that this is also how spacex approached starlink. It baffles me how many of you can’t make these connections and just how many of you are out there. And the thing is that y’all agree with each other and give yourselves consensus about being “right”.\n\nThis is also how nature approaches swarms. Notice how we don’t have swarms of elephants?",

The cost of making a 4 or 5 seater instead of a 2 seater are only marginally higher, like 3-5%. A 4-5 seater also only takes a little more electricity to run even when it is full, because most of it is the weight of the car itself. So, with a 4-5 seater the possible profit would be much higher and even if it is only used by 1 people it doesn't matter much, because the manufacturing difference is negligible.",

If anything you are making less money because every time you order a 3/4 seater you’re paying the same whether you bring passengers or not. Why? Because of competitor margins from companies that weren’t so idiotic they built a fully autonomous fleet optimizing for an edge case. That edge case being ordering an Uber for 3-4 people. Again, the most common case is a single passenger in a car - that is one of the biggest complaints about car culture. 2 is a happy medium. \n\nTwice as long to charge?!

They're offering a 250 mile range two door vehicle that can recharge 40 miles just sitting outside in the sun for $25k.   They're also offering a 1,000 mile range battery option, but it tacks on an extra $20k to the vehicle price I think.\n\nTesla could just order a bunch of unpainted Aptera's with no interior and add in their own Tesla tech and it would probably be way cheaper than what they're trying to do with this robo taxi / model 2 thing.
