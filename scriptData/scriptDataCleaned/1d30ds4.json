  "selftext": "Okay, with no help from you regards, I think I’ve finally found out why CAVA was down after hours despite crushing earnings in damn-near every way imaginable. They beat profit estimates, revenue estimates, expansion expectations, and increased their outlook for 2024. \n\nIf I had calls I’d be enraged after seeing CAVA drop after such a home run. But I finally read that they had 1% less foot traffic due to higher prices. That’s right, it doesn’t even matter that this meager decline was more than made up for from the increased profits and revenue due to the higher prices. That 1% less foot traffic triumphs everything else and has put CAVA in the red AH.\n\nAll I have to say is WTF! Like if I had calls I’d be pisssssseeeddd. Hell, I’m pissed right now, and I don’t even own shares!\n\nThe market we’re living in is absolutely insane. That’s how CAVA came to be valued at over $9 billion in the first place. But this really is a whole new level for me. A company crushes their quarter in almost every single way, but a little hiccup of a measly 1% less foot track and the share price goes down.\n\nAGAIN, THE PRICE HIKES ARE PROBABLY A GOOD THING BECAUSE THE EXTRA REVENUE AND PROFITS FROM THE PRICE HIKES MORE THAN MADE UP FOR THIS MEAGER 1% DECLINE!!!!! \n\nIDK, this is just so dumb to me. Thank god I didn’t have calls, but watch me buy puts next week and it go up another 100%.\n\nFML",
