The price of $COIN at the time (Sept 2024) was between $170 to $190 and is currently $220. \n\nThe strike price is $400 and you are far out of the money yet the calls went up massively due to a spike in IV. \n\nThe beauty of this trade is the cheap option price - 3.5 months of duration for a dollah! And well done to OP for making a large bet ($20K). \n\nInteresting that a seemingly dumb way too OTM trade is not at all required to make the strike price - only the option value has to increase!! And a $1.00 option is very cheap, the strike price being completely beside the point! Do I have this right?\n\nCan you please give us your thinking on this prior to making the trade?",
