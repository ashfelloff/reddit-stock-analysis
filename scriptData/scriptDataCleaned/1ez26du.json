Maybe something is off with the process or maybe not, but the process itself will produce these deltas, sacrificing accuracy for initiative with timely preliminary surveys and then reconciling after the fact with empirical records from unemployment offices.\n\nIt’s like failing a quiz. You can totally just ignore the results thinking it is a one-off and that it has no implication on your final grade or decide that historical precedence whether preliminary/immature does have an effect on the future. \n\nMaybe failing the quiz means your preparation was lacking. You can then choose to study harder to pass the class or sit back and relax and fail the class. The opposite can also be true. You get the top score on the first quiz and think you’re hot shit. Now you either under-prepare and end up failing or check your ego and continue to perform. \n\nThe government is “not choosing to use inaccurate data”. It’s a question of practicality. We can totally just have a final number that’s always late and simply be responsive or we can have preliminary but less accurate data and make timely assumptions.

They just need to pass huge spending bills. But the fed will react by raising rates if inflation moves up. \n\nThe only reason someone would want the government to handle both fiscal and monetary policy is if that person wants the government to spend huge sums of money but NOT let interest rates go up, ie, someone wants to print tons of money and still let the government still be able to pay interest on the debt. But this doesn't work, because eventually they will just spend so much that even with low rates they still won't be able to afford the interest on the debt. Also, it would cause the dollar to depreciate against other foreign currencies, because nobody trusts a government that is debasing the currency and not paying a reasonable interest rate on it to keep investors sticking around.",

      "body": "Im not a conspiracy theorist, not a republican,  not a democrat, not an annoying libertarian just a dude too busy working and raising  my kids to get into all that shit-but when Joe Biden is on tv at the DNC convention blathering proudly that he added  16 million jobs not 10 hours ago, same dude whose dementia has progressed so much he  had to drop out of a presidential campaign 6 months out from the fucking election- Im pretty sure all data, all numbers have largely been cooked by his cabinet and have been for some time. And you can bet your sweet ass Powell knew it, too.\nLook, if they were delusional enough to think they can run a man dying from Alzheimer's into the presidency and get away with it then fucking with BLS numbers are a cake walk. Time will tell how depraved and criminal his cabinet's actions were.\n\nIm on the ground. There is mass unemployment around me. The people around me blessed enough to have toys like boats, planes, RV's are complaining about food prices. It is weird and deeply  concerning.\nThe dickheads in power manipulated BLS and in their haste to prep for the next election seriously fucked the economy up. Big fucking surprise",
