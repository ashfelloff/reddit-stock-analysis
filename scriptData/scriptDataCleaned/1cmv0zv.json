  "selftext": "Dear Regards,\n\nLast two quarter earnings release NVDA started taking a big dip a week prior to earnings due to the uncertainty. Last earnings release we saw NVDA drop from mid 700s to 650. Prior to that from 500 to 400. We also have CPI coming in hot next Wednesday. CPI forecasts have been off by .1% the last 4 prints. So the 3.5% estimate might end up being 3.6 or 3.7%. If we get a hot CPI, markets are definitely gonna tank. And with oil prices, housing and insurance sky rocketing CPI might hit 4-5% by summer. \n\n# Fed‚Äôs Kashkari also indicated that we may get a rate hike.\n\nI'd buy NVDA when the dip comes in a week or two. Try to buy dollar cost average options once NVDA drops below 820.\n\nAnother day, another slay",
