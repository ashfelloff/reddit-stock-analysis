They beat expectations by quite a large margin too.\n\nReported earnings of $3.38 per share on revenue of $5.74 billion for the first quarter ended March 2024. The consensus earnings estimate was $2.84 per share on revenue of $5.73 billion.\n\nWhy did they go down then and are considered to have missed expectations? Because they lowered their forward guidance. The company said it expects second quarter revenue of $6.07 billion to $6.60 billion. The current consensus revenue estimate is $6.93 billion for the quarter ending June 30, 2024. Additionally, their year over year revenue fell by 20%.\n\nWith that last bit of information, if we apply the logic you are using, which one of their clients could be to blame for their year over year revenue fall? The most likely culprit is TSM purchasing the machines one year ago",

So if this continues ASML needs to find alternative revenue if TSM is not purchasing more neither is intel or Samsung. Also china accounted for 46% of ASML sales in quarter three and they just announced they’re restricting American Chips in their computers so ASML should be fine  in revenue for now if china decides to do their own thing?",

What I am ultimately saying is that yes, the YoY revenue decline they saw was likely due to them having a really big order last year, likely from TSM, and this year they simply were not able to repeat that same huge sale, probably because TSM only needs a specific number of ASML machines to produce the number of chips they want to produce. Their revenue is completely fine and they are still growing and their future growth is also secured too. You know how investors are, they just want to see infinite growth at infinite speed. If the growth slows down, the stock goes down. It does not mean at all that the company is making less money. They are just not making the insane numbers that investors  wanted it to.\n\nAs you said, ASML will be fine. Hope this clarified it.",
