Maybe the cost of repairs is so high the insurance companies don't wanna pay that, but in Tesla's case it's not so much paying out of pocket to cover the cost of repairs as it would be writing off the cost of the repairs/labor each time..I think? Still not necessarily profitable business practice, but I could see that not being as costly as the situation where a third party insurance company foots the bill for repairs and pays Tesla for those services. Granted if the vehicle is totaled, then it's a pretty terrible situation since they're losing the full value of the vehicle they sold by paying the customer for the value of the vehicle and at that point essentially would be...returning it minus whatever the depreciation/amount already paid off was? I Guess their maximum loss would be the sale they made in the first place on the vehicle. \n\nAfter writing all that, I'm not sure if Tesla makes a lot of money off their own insurance or not.

Not build inventory for repairs. \n\nAssuming that’s the case then the “risk” from a TSLA insurance could be less as TSLA as a company could control the allocation of parts to reduce the cost of repairs for internally insured vehicles.",

It just helps them, it's the premiums they receive every month is what makes them the real cash outside of their investments. You need that study premium coming in so that you're reinvesting it in other risks that give you great rewards.\n\n\nI'm an EX-LLoyd's name from then 80's, I got taken out by asbestos litigation I. Early 90's, I was in a syndicate that was in the North Atlantic, insuring container ship hulls for total loss on seven years or less olds. Our biggest loss was a Hapag Lloyd vessel. But we had the cushion. Most people don't have a clue on how many vessels are lost on the high seas just on the Atlantic trade alone. I couldn't join the syndicate that did the cape, that had a higher loss rate than I was willing to tolerate. Vessels flounder consistently.",

But you really keep glossing over the original point.  I also think scrappers are making a killing but on the older vehicles like 2009 Chrysler 300 or something.  It’s specifically the Tesla truck I’m addressing.  The one just sold on Copart for 39k. So I was off a few thousand off.  \n\nBy your numbers 75k would be what the insurance company pays out, 39k they recovered (this one was bad,  look like it rolled over on the side).  That’s 36k insurance paid out.  Now there is slippage and cost of doing business but it’s ballpark here.  Seems pretty par for the course for any bmw or corvette.  I’m betting they encountered an issue like the frame that when damaged is worse than any other car.  I mean paying 2500 a year I’ve tried to find statistics on how many cars are totaled in first 3-5 years of their life but can’t.  But I can’t believe it’s more than 1/200 or something.  Even then still seems way high.  \n\nBut alas, both of us are just spit balling.  Thanks for the talk and that’s pretty cool about the ships.  Now we know what totaled cyber trucks run!",
