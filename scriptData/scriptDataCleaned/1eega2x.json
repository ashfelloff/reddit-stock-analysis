Then in craziest bull market ever Mar Apr May â€˜20 I stayed short the market because I underestimated the money printer and lost it all.\n\nI then left options and became a corn farmer\n\nI recently came back this January with a $4k deposit and everyday I yoloâ€™d into (you bet) 0DTE out of the money put credit spreads. Worked my way up to $12k then lost it again.\n\nHave another brokerage account (Fidelity) thatâ€™s currently yoloâ€™d into IWM calls expire October. Hopefully Iâ€™ll be able to post that loss porn soon for your enjoyment.",
