That uncertainty will cause you to be more nervous or reactionary. But good news or bad news, your mindset completely changes once you get confirmation. \n\nMarkets hate uncertainty. The fed and geopolitical tensions causes a ton of it this last 2 weeks. Remember the market after Iran shot the plane down? In the course of a few days conversation went from WW3 to nothing. The market reacted and recovered almost as quick as it went down. \n\nIran‚Äôs response is what will ease fears here. If they double down and their pledge for no other response, things will be okay. Israel is the wildcard.",
