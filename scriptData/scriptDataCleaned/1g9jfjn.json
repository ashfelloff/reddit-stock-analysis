Ever since it’s been in the limbo state. According to the moex. I’m up. But over here in the US it bottomed out. Just kinda stuck with the shares until trade halts get lifted. Pretty decent stake in both companies. Am I cooked or is this just an ultimate hold?",

You’re saying these things with the confidence as if you know what you are talking about, but this doesn’t make any sense at all. \n\nNvidia would be in enormous trouble if Taiwan was invaded. As would the rest of the world economy. Intel can’t just suddenly start manufacturing Nvidia’s GPU chips, even at reduced performance. And they can’t suddenly operate at that scale on a new manufacturing line. You’re acknowledging those, but discarding them as “cost of doing business for a year or two”.\n\nNo. That would be on the order of a potentially permanently crippling event for nvidia’s momentum, when you consider the room it gives for competitors to catch up. It would be a disaster to Nvidia’s price on the order of 5 years at least, and they may *never* recover to the momentum they had previously.",
