              "body": "If they were loaning your money out that would make it less fraudulent than what's actually happening.  They're actually using your money as something akin to collateral to get a loan from another private bank (federal reserve) that is able to quite literally print money.  The loans they got over the last couple of decades were so low of interest that sometimes after inflation it was basically negative interest.  Then they loan that money out out an interest rate much higher and profit the difference.  That money they loaned out then gets deposited somewhere and the whole process starts again.    They're profiting off of money they create out of thin air.  \n\nFractional reserve banking is a ponzi scheme that never ends because the people running the scam are able to print more money.",

If you are paying someone to be your advocate, they should be making you aware of the better option.\n\nIn the case of the former, if you aren't paying for it, don't expect someone else to have your best interest in mind.",
