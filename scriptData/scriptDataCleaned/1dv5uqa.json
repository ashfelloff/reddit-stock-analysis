If you bought a 360k home with 20% down and its now a 600k home, you can sell for 450k after taxes and closing cost. So now you have an additional 150k for a down payment but you need a 450k loan to get the same type of house instead of 300 anddddd its going to be 7.5% instead of 3% interest. \n\nI'll use best case here for 7% and 3.5%. A 300k loan with 3.5% interest is $1247/month. A 300k loan at 7% interest is $1997/month but we need a 450k loan. $2994/month. \n\nYeah... the only people able to easily move right now are people who used personal loans at a higher rate, but still significantly lower than now rate, to buy their house so they can transfer. You cant transfer mortgages to a new house.\n\n\nIf youre in a shitter home, you literally can't move as theres nothing to downgrade to.",

Qqq is up 150% but normies are going to be in the sp500). And theyre going from apartment in most cases to a house so its even an upgrade. \n\nSomeone house hunting in nyc, boston, almost all of california, etc can do that right now. People house hunting for homes in these cities, or anywhere, bumfuckville or not, are fucked whether theyre a first time home buyer or are home owners looking to move to a different house maybe closer to work or a comparable city/town. You cant change the target location for the home owner and not also change the target location for the first time buyer in these comparisons lol",
