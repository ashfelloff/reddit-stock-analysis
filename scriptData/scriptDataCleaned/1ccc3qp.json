  "score": 28,
  "selftext": "As I understand, institutions bitchslapped meta for following reasons:\n\n1. **Capital Expenditures** - Meta is ramping up its investment in AI, raising its 2024 spending forecast to $35 billion to $40 billion, up from $30 billion to $37 billion. They're betting big on future tech.\n\n2. **Revenue Forecast** - For Q2, Meta expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint, $37.75 billion, represents an 18% year-over-year increase, though it's slightly below the average analyst estimate of $38.3 billion.\n\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/24/meta-meta-q1-2024-earnings-.html\n\nBut here’s the thing: with the stock price taking a hit, this could be the perfect YOLO opportunity for those who believe in Meta's long-term growth fueled by AI. They are doing what open ai should be doing by making such powerful models and making them open sourced. Sure they had to spend cash to do that but institutions are panicking \n\nPlus they are cash cow and it’s election season so it’s a good buy even if you don’t believe in the potential of llama \n\nNot financial advice yada yada. But I might know someone whose dad can look at Netflix balance sheets before earnings \n\n\n",
