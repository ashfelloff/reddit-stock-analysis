  "selftext": "Sup my favorite casino goers,\n\nThrowaway account because reasons.  \nMy positions are currently as follows:  \n5x SPY Put @ 540 January 17, 2025  \n10x QQQ Put @ 450 January 17, 2025  \n10x SPY Put @ 500 June 20, 2025  \n10x Spy Put @ 450 December 19, 2025\n\nI believe that the US Labor market and US consumer are currently much weaker than what is being indicated by the media/FEDs at this time. Interest rates are going to fall very rapidly over the next year in attempt to prop up the labor market, and influence greater consumer credit spending. I do not believe this will work because of the present state of the average US consumer. Lowering interest rates can't help consumers who already don't have any sheckles.\n\nThe American consumer is completely broke and over levered, and additionally we are trending towards a tightening labor market, as corporations have been laying off more frequently due to over hiring during the pandemic, job openings are trending down, and unemployment is on the rise. I believe in the next 12-24 months we are going to bear witness to a Consumer Led Recession. For those of you that have made it this far, allow me to explain with some graphs.\n\n**Saving Rates**  \n\"Personal saving is equal to personal income less personal outlays and personal taxes; it may generally be viewed as the portion of personal income that is used either to provide funds to capital markets or to invest in real assets such as residences\"\n\nUS savings rates are at the same levels we experienced in the 2008 financial crisis, currently last reported at 2.9%. This means the American consumer has only been able to save 2.9% of their earnings towards their retirement, or to buy houses. In the second graph we can see this is trending downwards even still since COVID, as wages have not kept up with the high levels of inflation.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a14fx3gimuqd1.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=abeccecd40cb3e22225872ce00ddaa27b4eeaf4a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rudy6x5jmuqd1.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=520e70de2eca321717f91c6d6fc6032c009b2f10\n\n**YoY Household Expenditure**\n\nYear-over-year household expenditures have up-ticked dramatically since the COVID bucks were printed. The average increase YoY change in Household Expenditures has historically been 3.074% since 1984 (close the average inflation rate in the US of 3.25% since 1973). The problem here arises in the second picture below. Household expenditures rose by 8.361% in 2021 and 8.276% in 2022, which is back-to-back years outside of 1 standard deviation away from the mean, highlighted as 5.693%. Tomorrow at 10:00 AM the Bureau of Labor Statistics will release their 2023 Household Expenditures data, it would not be shocking that 2023 was another above-average year, as the average inflation rate for that year was 4.1%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bwv8ivyjmuqd1.png?width=1203&format=png&auto=webp&s=f219b6f3e3a0683f2bcc58ea2437d6d77b18687b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6dd6fsmlmuqd1.png?width=650&format=png&auto=webp&s=ddbca207332bece98da87bc0e86894e23d8071de\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wctffclnmuqd1.png?width=1692&format=png&auto=webp&s=95ee317450b60e4d0038b146a56768c511fdd4d1\n\n**Unemployment**\n\nNot much to say here, except the graph has begun moving upwards in the last 12-months.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ji3liokomuqd1.png?width=945&format=png&auto=webp&s=c959158a5c0075d044dcbbf93575eb0fe4707a71\n\n**Job Openings**\n\nNot much to say here, other than again Job Openings are trending downwards, albeit still above the average Job Openings rate (orange).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3veewgepmuqd1.png?width=1404&format=png&auto=webp&s=76a6ae9f6ca0c9a4fb81ecb9ecc26f72d378936a\n\n**Delinquency Rates Consumer Loans**\n\nHere's where we get interesting again, Consumer Loan Delinquency rates are now currently above levels in 2011 and have continued to trend upwards in our heightened interest rate environment. This may infer two things: consumers have not changed their spending habits, or have become over levered. Orange line indicates the average since 1987.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwew7olqmuqd1.png?width=971&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ca9405a025a9c60be436ec070a3815641b70e0e\n\n**Delinquency Rates Credit Cards**\n\nDelinquency rates on Credit cards are saying the exact same thing as consumer loans. Trending upwards, and above levels since 2011 in the era of low interest rates and lessened inflation.  \nWhat I WILL say is that delinquencies on mortgages have not risen much, but that is an indicator than I am aggressively watching QoQ.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fl4asp6rmuqd1.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f921c6badf44b855bc087b875795c97ec5f2e7cd\n\n**US Deposits**\n\nDeposits on checking, time and savings accounts for households are all going down and are currently all **BELOW** levels in 2019. This is indicating that consumers are currently being forced to draw on their savings previously established from the pandemic to survive, or keep up with their perceived levels of consumer spending. This is also inline with what you can hear from retailers, like Amazon, Walmart or fast-food businesses. Customers are becoming more \"value-orientated\", as they look for ways for their dollars to go further. [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/07/business/economy/recession-consumer-spending.html) is a great read from multiple earnings calls that highlight this.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ie9bbg6smuqd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=f17952747abb993748550ff348458ef6755f9044\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8pecy9ssmuqd1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cbc828d8f9e3ec9d6d7444e4179f686508427d0\n\n\n\nAll data I've presented is publicly available from the US FED or BLS. DYOD.\n\ntl;dr US Consumer is broke. GDP may continue to grow but at a snails pace since consumers have no money to spend lavishly. Savings are going down and delinquencies are going up. Large credit risk, liquidity risks, and geopolitical risks are present.\n\nHedge your bets gentlemen.",

One of those two groups was right.  \nNow after the fact, everybody knows what rate cut means, yet JP himself said we are in uncharted waters and this will be a case study material in future.  \nOn the other hand, BoJ increases interest rate ever so slightly, and SP500 goes down almost 10% in the next couple of days. As we could've seen later, the fall was obviously exaggerated, but it happened nonetheless, and I don't like that kind of volatility.\n\nMy take is that it will take several months to see where all this will lead.

They could have certainly means-tested them, but at that point in time there was little political interest in doing anything controversial like not giving the rich more money.  \n3) The stimulus checks did cause even more inflation.\n\nI'm not upset about anything the Fed or Congress did - they did a pretty solid job considering what we were facing - but there's no question mistakes were made. Not trying to means-test the stimulus, raising rates too late, lowering rates too late, making the second round of stimulus too large - all of those were mistakes looking in the rearview mirror.\n\nNot sure we can take any lessons from Congress here - too much has and will change there - but if Powell is kept on by the next administration I'm guessing he stays pretty much like he's been, solidly managing things but reacting a tad late to everything out of an abundance of caution.",

I see everyone going on and on about macro-economics -- employment, whether the consumer is doing well or struggling, whether inflation will heat up or cool down, whether the Fed will cut the fed fund rate by 25 bps or 50 bps in one meeting as if it is the end-all be-all for determining bull market or bear market, and so on.\n\nI seldom see anyone (even bears) point out that the overall market is pretty freakin' expensive right now valuation-wise, and prices in not just a soft-landing, but booming high earnings growth.  And I get tired of seeing the bull hot takes of \"soft landing + no recession = stocks moon to infinity\", as if simply not having a recession is the only bar that needs to be cleared for stocks to go up at a high rate of ever expanding price ratios.\n\nWhen it comes to mentions of specific individual stocks though, then I see valuation get brought up more often.  I just don't see overall valuation get brought up as much when the discussion is about the overall market or market indices.  All I see then is \"the economy this, the economy that\".\n\n>Thanks for the comment. I'm actually interested how you would attempt to price these factors into already overvalued companies. Send me a PM of your thoughts.\n\nWhere I think the SPY \"should\" be priced at is a bit nuanced, but my overall answer is \"roughly 15%-30% lower than it is now.\"  If your case of a deteriorating US labor market and US consumer plays out, then maybe closer to the 30% perhaps.  I think it would likely affect the SPY mega-caps, but perhaps with a delayed effect.  The end consumer struggles first, which then causes the business-to-consumer companies that sell to them to struggle, which then in turn causes them to cut spending or close up shop, which then in turn causes the bigger B2B businesses (like Microsoft, Google, Amazon AWS, and Meta) that sell to those B2C businesses (or to some other middle-man B2B intermediaries down the chain) to take a hit in their earnings (but not a catastrophic one or anything like that).  I think some companies are more over-valued than others and may/should take a bigger hit, but I'm feeling too lazy to go through  each one right now.  But I will say this for what I think of overall SPY valuation:\n\nI use sites like [currentmarketvaluation.com](http://currentmarketvaluation.com) and [multipl.com](http://multipl.com) to see what the S&P 500 is valued at overall vs. historical averages.  Currentmarketvaluation shows the S&P 500 Buffet Indicator, CAPE ratio, and Mean Reversion all being above or near 2 standard deviations above historical averages (i.e. - \"Strongly Overvalued\", i.e. - near the red dotted line).  The last 2 times that happened were in 2021 and 1999/2000.  So, that makes me bearish overall. Seeing the sentiment survey on [aaii.com](http://aaii.com) (often a contrarian indicator) leaning so heavily bullish in a historically very over-valued market makes me feel even more bearish.  I feel like best case, the market is fairly valued right now if earnings growth is superb.  If earnings growth is tepid, market is over-valued.  If no earnings growth, even more over-valued.  If earnings decline or recession, extremely over-valued.  But in the meantime, clown market gonna clown market and algos will bubble it higher if they're so determined to do so.",

If consumers spend less on everything, companies will cut cost and marketing & ads budget will be impacted: META, GOOGL will take hit. \n\nAPPL/AMZN will probably hit somewhat earlier as people spend less money on fancy iPhone & stuff, new EVs sell slowdown can impact TSLA.\n\nIf all of the above focus on core biz and invest less in AI infra, NVDA will be hit hard (I'm long putting NVDA btw)\n\nAgree, this is a very well thought out DD, good job OP u/No_Alps5102 !",

But, it's far from clear that it will be an actual recession, though I suppose that depends to an extent on definitions. If you're the one that lost his job, it's a recession for you even if your neighbors are all doing fine.\n\nThere's no catalyst though, is the thing. So it doesn't seem like a real crash is on the way. There's some possibility that the data center spending by Microsoft, Amazon, Google, etc. is a bubble and I would say it's very possible, maybe even likely, that they are overbuilding to an extent. But those dollars are in the hundreds of billions, which is significant, but a slowdown in that spend won't crash the economy.",

Far too often people on here will post some valid macro analysis only to end it with a position expiring in a week or two. If you’re new to trading, take notes because this is how it’s done. When you are doing anything macro you must pick DTEs wisely. Being right is only one part of the equation. It’s a completely different (and in my opinion much more difficult) game. I personally never trade anything macro, in fact I have a calendar with a bunch of days blocked off with a message that says “too much news to trade”. JOLTs, fed meetings ofc, inflation data, stuff like that. I always feel more clever when I try and predict macro shit, but I make way more money just sticking to the chart, trading 7-14 DTE debit verticals and avoiding big news days.\n\nOne random idea for another play based off your thesis: IWM calls. If interest rates do plummet at the rate you suggest (or even if the market starts suspecting it), small caps will rally like crazy. IWM is slept on a lot but it’s really a great way to play rate bets. Very liquid and moves like a motherfucker the instant rate cut expectations change.",

For example a Ford bronco selling for 20-30k above msrp and people buying it. Crazy. \n\nBut... \n\nEarnings were very strong. Inflation stayed mostly inline with expectations.

There is trillions of dollars on the sidelines. Many investors were doing the TBill and Chill. With rates dropping some of that money will go back into stocks. We have been seeing this happen for two weeks now. So expect this to continue slowly until the election. After that more money could pour into the markets, an everything rally if you will.
