  "selftext": "It’s almost certain that NVDA is weeks or even days from passing AAPL in market capitalization. Yet their exposure to China and Taiwan is just about as bad as casinos that opened up shop in Macau. Yet traders don’t attach the same risk in the slightest due to the mania of future expectations. China will try to “reclaim” Taiwan by 2028 through a forced peace treaty according to experts. With an aging population, China is not going to sit around and wait making threats forever. The glass bottle is going to tip over. The only saving grace being Intel. But the market hates Intel so much that it could take 20-30% of TSM’s fab business and still be worth less than AMD. ",

In the meantime, US special forces have been permanently established in Taiwan in rotating shifts.  They're training the locals in all the modern weapons and tech we're currently selling them.   They're also being trained in anti espionage and other techniques.  Plus the US has said they'll defend Taiwan against a chinese invasion.  So likely it'll be the US navy that mostly keeps them at bay while the newly trained local military deals with any ground or air invasion forces.",
