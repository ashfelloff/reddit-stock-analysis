  "selftext": "Fellow tards,\n\nLet's get to the point. Tomorrow is Quad witching day AKA the day Hedge Funds wake up and realize they're leveraged to the tits on NVDA and MAG 7 calls. Today and tomorrow these guys are going to unload their bags to show their bosses their MBA from Wharton is worth a damn\n\nDon't be caught with your pants down! SQQQ $8.50 calls are pennies right now and SQQQ is already at $8.25\n\nearlier  \nI'm looking for an easy retracement on these calls to the 50EMA - 13 cents. I've loaded up at 2 cents earlier today and am looking for a 5-6x. Who tf is with me? or y'all ain't got some pennies to spare ü§°",

There's a pretty decent mix between up and down weeks leading up to and including Quad Witching Week. There's also no pattern of higher timeframe (1W, 1D) volatility...sometimes the range of the week is near the ATR, sometimes it's not.\n\nOn an intraday basis, the 1H ES chart seems to show that the volatility for Quad Witching Day and the week prior usually extend a fair amount beyond the high or low for the week leading into that two week stretch.\n\nThe only other constant that I can identify is higher volume (obviously) as many portfolio managers do their quarterly index rebalancing.",
