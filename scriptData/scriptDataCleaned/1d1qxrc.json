The ECB might very well cut rates because they have a very different economic scenerio to deal with. Despite all the inflationary pressures they also are seeing a downturn in many sectors. If those play out, it can be disastrous for governments that have to cover social transfer programs.  This would speak for a rate cut to help the economy. \nThat being said, a unilateral rate cut would cause a rise in the dollar (to euro), which is full of inflationary problems- especially in the energy sector. Really a tough call... I hope they can pull this all off without it causing too much harm to the average Joe.",

As long as the average American homeowner can pay their high interest mortgage, banks will continue to sap money from the working class. And as long as house prices stay elevated, the mortgages are secure for the lender.\n\nThe government benefits from high interest as it is all taxable income to the banks. And high home prices increase property tax.",

Higher rates would typically drag the equities market down and rates naturally rise during a bull run toward a balance.

Even with inflation closer or at 2%, dropping rates really doesn't make sense, until we have a true falling out recession on our hands.
