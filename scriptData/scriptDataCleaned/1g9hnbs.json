  "selftext": "It's the 4th quarter right now, where champions are made, where destinies are determined. After an 8 month break, I got 2 stocks that I'll be gambling on today: **Enphase Energy** and **Vertiv Holdings Co.** ENPH reports today after the bell, VRT tomorrow morning. Btw yes I'm still in the hood, that's why I'm back in the casino. Ok let's get right into it:\n\n* **ENPH** \\- Solar Technology. This is your cringe boomer uncle coming to the cookout with Jordan 4's. When they reported their Q1 and Q2 earnings this year, they went down -26% and -24%. Solar demand is slowing down, their margins are getting squeezed, they ain't expanding internationally as much as they want to. I mean look at their chart, absolutely disgusting, I'm shorting this shit:\n\n[\\(sry my cursor was on sept 9 when I took the screenshot, it doesn't mean anything, and i'm too lazy to make a new one.\\)](https://preview.redd.it/90yj0d04jawd1.png?width=697&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd366c62c6395cfcd7deb0bec94a8e6cae0b327)\n\n* **VRT** \\- According to Google: Vertiv Holdings is an American multinational provider of critical infrastructure and services for data centers, communication networks, and commercial and industrial environments. Theyâ€™ve got all the golden AI unicorns in their client list. When AI workloads require more infrastructure, they call these guys. When they reported their last 5 earnings, they went up: +13%, +8%, +7%, +5%, and +10%. I'm not gonna go into fundamentals, y'all know I'm not like that. I'd rather look at the CEO:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jo8uxyl4jawd1.png?width=677&format=png&auto=webp&s=27565177a12cb5e17c21472b46a1238f0cd12e27\n\nIsn't this the most Italian name you've ever seen? I fucking love Italy. I love their culture, their people, their art, their food, their history. My money is on Mr. Albertazzi.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1zr3n0k81bwd1.png?width=736&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dfc9a173d933a0b5c643b3134fd547572617f1d\n\n**tldr: ENPH go down, VRT go up.**\n\nMy positions:\n\n[$15k+ total exposure, using 5x leveraged CFD's \\(eurotrash\\)](https://preview.redd.it/2h9wo3319bwd1.png?width=1211&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92b1c4828ee4d325e33458da4367bfa99b79fb9)\n\n*I am regarded, you will lose money by following me, this is not financial advice, please don't sue me, do your own research*\n\nGod bless America\n\nEDIT: added positions\n\nEDIT 2: ill be adding results on all my predictions from now on too (i have added them now)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xwm2sooseiwd1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&s=6588ff2ad50b8402c354351a81f1eb4a44081efc",

So ill skip this one, even tho you probably are right that enph is on its way to 30-50 usd.",

It all depends on the guidance, and what analysts/market is actually thinking will happen. \n\nLast time i was right, but lost money because options require you to be right at the right time (now i would be wildly profitable).\n\nWho knows what the market thinks. Thats why this is gambling, unless someone has a conviction a stock will wildly out/underperform analyst expectations",

(VRT)\n\non the flip side, Vertiv's performance has been more stable, but they too face market pressures. the company focuses on critical digital infrastructure and continuity solutions, which have seen steady demand due to the ongoing digital transformation across industries. analysts expect a modest earnings beat, but thereâ€™s also skepticism regarding future growth amid rising competition and market saturation in certain sectors .\n\n# Strategy\n\nit sounds like you're leaning towards a short position on ENPH due to its struggles. itâ€™s definitely a high-risk play, especially with earnings around the corner. make sure to keep an eye on the market reactions post-earnings, as volatility can swing both ways!\n\n# Conclusion\n\nremember, earnings season can be unpredictable, so stay sharp. best of luck with your trades! if you want to dive deeper into the numbers, check out resources like Yahoo Finance or Seeking Alpha for detailed analyses. , also if you're looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation",
