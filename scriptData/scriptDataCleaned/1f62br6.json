  "score": 33,
  "selftext": "I'm just sharing some shit I calculated about the S&P 500, which I'll just call the SP 500.\n\nWhen you look at the yearly returns on the index since 1928 everything seems pretty normal. You can find 20+ percent returns on the SP 500, even really early (e.g. 1933, 1943, 1958, 1980 etc.) When calculating the moving average of these returns I got 7.97%. When looking at averages from a date to today we find these values:\n\n|1928|7.97%|\n|:-|:-|\n|1950|9.41%|\n|1980|10.48%|\n|2000|7.13%|\n|2009|12.99%|\n|2020|13.27%|\n\nIt seems as if the average yearly return is growing. The outlier of 2000-2024 is caused by the massive dot com losses without the bubble's growth.\n\nBut I wanted to get the growth in real terms. Side note here if we look at this in a physics perspective, we can look at the SP 500 as a position of something, say a point. Every year it moves, this can be up or down and measured as points or percentage. This growth can be seen as velocity (change in position per time period). The table above is the average velocity of the SP 500.\n\nBut the yearly change of the SP 500 is not constant. There will be stretches of good years and bad gay bear years. The change of growth could be called acceleration as in physics that is the name for change of velocity. That is what the above table somewhat shows. There has been change in the the growth SP500. In the linked excel document (will be in bottom in TLDR) I calculated the change of a moving average from one year to the next. And I found the moving average of that; which is constantly decreasing since the more data added to the moving average the less each data point affects it. But we can see general ideas.\n\nThe average return of the SP500 grows by 8 basis points (0.08%) every year. At this point I'm kinda confused by WTF I'm doing or even calculating. I calculated some more shit but I'm not sure what it means or even is.\n\nBut from what I can see, the index has been growing fast every year. So while some people who say that the SP is growing too fast just because they looked at the normal chart that is just because of how exponential growth works. But there is data to suggest the growth rate is increasing in the SP 500.\n\nGoogle Drive Link to xlsx file: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aY28Z5syAMYXnq1K\\_qP3CRZVify2zKQs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853431990622128066&rtpof=true&sd=true](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aY28Z5syAMYXnq1K_qP3CRZVify2zKQs/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113853431990622128066&rtpof=true&sd=true)\n\nTLDR: The S&P 500 is growing faster and faster every year.

If you don't go back that far you will see higher averages. Basically, depressions are rare events and there isn't a recent one in the dataset. You are taking averages on data which has severe and rare events in it. Therefore where you choose to sample will determine how representative it is. If you started your data from when the s&p was recovering in the '30's you'd see a very different trend.",
