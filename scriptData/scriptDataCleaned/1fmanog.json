An older investor approaching retirement cannot - he needs a portfolio that will support his cash needs that are not too far off.",

Future dividend payments are more stable and more knowable than future stock prices.  You would need to sell a varying number of shares each quarter, more when stock prices are down, less when they are up.

In a bear market like that, you would maintain 80% of your income with dividend payers.  With non dividend payers, to maintain 80% of your pre-tax income, you would need to sell twice as much stock every quarter until the market starts to recover.  This will deplete your holdings and permanently impair your portfolio, possibly forcing you to reduce your standard of living in retirement.\n\nRelying on rising equity prices to fund your retirement is a horrible strategy, and has a significant possibility of having disastrous results.  \n\n\n>Given that dividends are paid out of free cash flow, if the company can increase free cash flow, then they can also increase dividends.\n\nWhich is a reason to buy dividend paying stocks.

You don't see the basic logic of this? If a company gives you cash, then the worth of the company is reduced. That is why the stock exchange must reduce the share price to reflect this.

I’ll avoid the politics, but one of the parties continues to look for ways to extract as much money from you as possible, and there’s been talk of eliminating the step-up basis, reducing the estate tax exemption, and eliminating the preferential treatment for long term gains and qualified dividends.  I’ve also heard about taxing Roth IRAs and even unrealized capital gains.  What I find most frustrating in all this is your inability to PLAN, as one strategy can be completely derailed by an over-zealous administration believing that wealth redistribution is the main role of government.",
