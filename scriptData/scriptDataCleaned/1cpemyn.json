  "selftext": "Well, it was another great month \"picking up pennies\".\n\nThe link to my last update [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2q2s4/call_credit_spreads_3_month_update_58k_204k/)\n\nThe link to my original post [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bgg3f3/my_almost_invincible_call_credit_spread_strategy/)\n\nOverall, the strategy netted me $47,284.64 this month. Here's a screenshot of the gains (-$4,014.69 that hasn't fallen off from last month yet)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ewbf0ua0szc1.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=362ea949e252a9cea4b8a431af448f588bb63f91\n\nI learned some key lessons this month and was able to get feedback from many people who messaged me with ideas and ways to improve. The spreadsheet from my original post is almost completely updated now and it's better than ever.\n\nReddit isnt letting me upload more screenshots and the format in here made it super weird, so i'm leaving this link if you want to view my full data to include data analysis, weekly profit, and ticker breakdown.\n\nMonth 4 Updates: [https://imgur.com/a/5V5aqOx](https://imgur.com/a/5V5aqOx)  \n\nI analyze all spreads before I choose to sell them. You can see a basic/outdated version of my analysis in my original post. No need to explain here, but I give each spread a \"score\" and sell the spreads with the highest scores. As you can see from the preliminary data above, scores above 80 did extremely well this month, while scores below 80 tended to have more losses. The deltas I analyzed were mostly around .08, which should imply a roughly 8% loss rate across the board. Overall, we saw just over a 4% loss rate. The losses all occurred in spreads with a final score less than 80, which aligns with data I have analyzed in the past and continues the trend of no losses at a score above 80.    \n\nI didn't include exact prices on my spreads because there were too many different strikes, but the average was around my target of .08 - .10 delta on each spread, and all spreads sold had a final score above 85.\n\nThis week, I will likely take some time to comb through my data and refine my models based on the results. I may take the week off from trading in order to finish the work without the stress of watching the markets. Hopefully I will be back with more updates soon.\n\nCheers and happy trading!",

Sure they're high cost being you're putting much more on the line than the premium but that ratio also reflects the probability of success for you as a seller. To the retail bros obsessing over ten baggers, putting up $850 for a potential $150 on a ten point spread sounds like that's risking a lot for very little, but it's actually paying for a potentially very high success rate (85% probability to be specific). \n\nOtm long options are always going to hold the lower probability in a trade. So we end up with a dynamic where the less risky option seller is using their collateral playing the odds and hoping for predictable price action while the buyer is using a small fraction of that collateral just hoping to hit the lotto, price action-wise. \n\nWhen I think of it this way the efficient way to play options is to hold probably somewhere around 80% net short and 20% net long positions, and those longs have to present exceptional set ups. Regardless you're statistically certain to see less than zero success in your options trading if you ignore selling to open.",
