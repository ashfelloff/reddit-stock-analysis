The fact that they are in debt just means there will be a steady supply of willing labor. \n\nReality it's the rich, the upper, and the middle class that hold up the economy via work, taxes paid, assets owned, pumping into the stock market via 401K, investments, and larger spending. You look at THEIR finances by checking [mortgage delinquency rates.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRSFRMACBS) Which is at near 4 decade lows.\n\nAnd that shows it's going to be a fucking nothing burger.

                      "body": "The FRED data is for only commercial banks. It does not include non-banks, which are the primary source of mortgages since the GFC.\n\nAccording to Black Knight data, which tracks some of these non-banks, the total delinquency rate in June 2024 (30 day, 60 day, 90 day, 120 day) was around 3.9%, which is similar to 2007 levels. Some types of loans, like FHA loans, have much higher delinquency rates, like closer to 13%. Interestingly, there was a huge jump (\\~17%) in 30 day late delinquencies from May to June, and homeowners with higher credit scores actually had the highest month-over-month jump in missed payments.\n\nThis doesn't mean there will be a lot of foreclosures in the near future. It takes 120 days of delinquency to start the foreclosure process and there are a lot of protections for homeowners since the GFC/Covid. Additionally, many homeowners have equity in their homes. \n\nAlthough foreclosures will likely be low in the near term, some real estate investors may decide to walk away. Real estate investing activity in the SFH market has nearly doubled since 2019. This is actually kind of the same thing that happened in 2007.  RE investor activity doubled from 2003-2007. These investors typically had average to above average credit scores, and they accounted for 40-50% of the defaults during that period.",
