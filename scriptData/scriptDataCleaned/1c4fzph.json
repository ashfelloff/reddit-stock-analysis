So I'd argue it's not a cause and even the correlation might be on the weaker side.\n\nSo theoretically if ETF's do push bitcoin, we would need to see a performance in this cycle that is exceeding expectency by alot.\n\nOf course those who promote this cycle and hype up ETF's argue that this cycle will be huge.

It can act as a hedge or can diversify your portfolio; if you want large profits, there are better ways to achieve it in my opinion",
