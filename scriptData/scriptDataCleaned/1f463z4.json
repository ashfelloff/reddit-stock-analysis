Do this while you learn and to test things out (strategies, etc) so that you don't blow your stash. Can also see charts of option prices through time, not just an option chain of current price. I suggest getting a free Schwab account to use ThinkOrSwim platform. It's free and you don't need any deposit for an account to use it. Or it was when it was TDAmeritade, which Schwab bought. Or find some other way. Tradingview papertrading is also free, but it doesn't do options. It's literally called paper trading because you could just follow the prices and write down your buy and sell on a piece if paper to see how you did instead of handing over your actual money. Education wise? I don't know, perhaps look up TastyTrades.",
