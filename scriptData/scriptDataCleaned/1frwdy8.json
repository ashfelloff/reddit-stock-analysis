The moment cockiness creeps in, performance goes down. \n\nIt's a self destructive and objectively pointless action to stroke your ego. The best thing that happens is you feel a little nice, temporarily. \n\nThe worst is you now think you're getting a hang of it and your next trade carries that baggage with less risk management.\n\nEveryone putting you down is actually doing you a service.
