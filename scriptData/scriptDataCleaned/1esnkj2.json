  "selftext": "Why NVDA will again hit $140+ right after earnings is because it has been ordering chips heavily that has supplier companies such as TSMC increase revenue by 44% YOY even when nvidia is trying to diversify its supply chain. NVDA is actually also lagging a bit to fulfill demand so it is not like it is stockpiling. This is basic math that cannot be negated when looking at NVDA. Economy can go down the drain but NVDA is gonna hit this out the park this earnings. \n\nPS: Holding NVDA $117 calls expiring Aug 30. ",
