Seeing as markets are already down 5-8%, and QQQ is down over 10%, another 20% would be the biggest crash in history. Not saying it can’t happen, but stocks/companies have a logical value and there’s a point where buying just makes sense. And algos will always be buying and arbitraging opportunity. Annddd we still have huge cash reserves sitting in the sidelines due to high rates on bonds. Sooooo I’d start buying when you think the value makes sense, rather than gut feelings. Right now, we are seeing major tech companies trading under a 25 p/e, strong earnings, no debt, cash div, huge reserves, buyback plans… opportunities are starting to emerge. Enjoy it.",
