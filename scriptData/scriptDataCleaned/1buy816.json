  "selftext": "Been tracking this stonk $TPR ever since another dude made a DD a few months ago. Yesterday, it went down with the rest of the stonks. Today, even though other stonks are recovering, this one is still going down.\n\nI have not been able to find any news on what could be triggering this sell off. Tipranks and marketwatch both gave strong buy/buy ratings and haven't changed their ratings since. Hell, I'm pretty sure I saw TPR on a \"top S&P500 companies\" list this week on /wsb (can't find the post anymore)\n\nCalls are super cheap for earnings in may. 5/17 50$ calls going for 0.85$ when they were trading for up to 2$ just this month and 2.5$ last month.\n\nI don't see why this thing wouldn't recover to at least 48$ in the next week or two, given no apparent selloff trigger.\n\nTLDR: TPR sold off for no apparent reason, expecting a rebound. Loaded up a small bag of 5/17 50$ calls for earnings",
