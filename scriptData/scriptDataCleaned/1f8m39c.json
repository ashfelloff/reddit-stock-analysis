  "selftext": "Starting in mid-August only playing 2-3 DTE SPY using the bull strategy of buying calls after the first half hour of market (10-1030 ET) or at lunch time (12 ET) and selling at market open the following day.\n\nAvoided playing on the weekends, especially holidays.\n\nInitially played with margins, putting in an average of about $88k per play. Bringing in anywhere from $2k to $60k.\n\nWhen above $20k:\n$4k went into 3 month CDs to hold for taxes.\n$4k went into my Wendy's Biggie Meal fund.\n\nLast week of August, I started a bear strategy.\nAugust 29th, broke pattern and yolo'd $88k into SPY puts.\n\nSold my puts at lunch, and bought 200 OTM SPY puts at the end of the day leaving about $60k in cash to avoid being flagged as daytrader from now on.\n\nLet's see how the rest of the month goes\n\n\n",
