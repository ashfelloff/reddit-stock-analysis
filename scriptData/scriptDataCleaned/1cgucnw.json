  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "I know people see the current MC of 633m and their eyes pop out seeing a ton of room to grow. The problem is that the MC is based on 30 million shares. Once the merger is complete, it will then be based on 165 million shares.\n\nThis means you now have $6 a share for every billion in market cap. I know DJT is seen as the new marker here for big name SPAC hype but Sam Altman still does not have the common man name rec of the Agent Orange. To equal DJT at a huge 6.5 bill cap, it would hit just roughly $40 a share. Let's say it still does great and reaches a colossally overvalued $3.5 billion market cap, generously more than half of DJT, that is just around $20 a share. \n\nWith the current share price at $15, the risk/reward of a $15 -> $20 best case seems dubious.\n\nI bring this up not to rain on any parades, but because I to was tempted, but before I could click Buy, I had to really give it some thought on a fair hyped up valuation.\n\nBest of luck if you are still charging hard into it. Maybe I'll regret not buying.",

You buy in for the run up pre-merger catalysts and then you play chicken with the inflated pre-merger highs.\n\nOklo is a fine company and I can see myself buying this again in November when it's $8 again, but right now you buy on the chance of an irrational run up a-la DWAC. \n\nIf MC and future shares meant literally anything in the current timeframe, this would be trading at $10, but it's not.",
