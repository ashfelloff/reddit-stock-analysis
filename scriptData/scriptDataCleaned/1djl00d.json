E.g. \"What app should I use?\", \"What should I invest in?\". \n\n* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, \"inverse cramer\" joke again. \n\n* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. \n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

On the last run, I was buying 90 days out and was hitting max profit within a week or 2.   40-50% gains in 2 weeks = not bad.  In hindsight, I would’ve sold my other holdings and just bought single calls ITM but I wasn’t actively monitoring my account… I also sold a bunch of cash cover puts so that ate up a lot of buying power but my NVDA balance grew 8x in value in just a few months.",
