I was heavy smoker and haven't smoked in six weeks .Also it not alot of juice it's like a candy but it releases slowly.\n\n\nCan You Swallow Spit from ZYN Pouches?\nYes, you can absolutely swallow your saliva while using ZYN nicotine pouches, but it is likely this will eventually irritate the tissues of your throat. Whether you swallow your saliva or not while using ZYN pouches is really more about your personal preference. Some people don‚Äôt like swallowing their saliva, the \"ZYN juice\", while using pouches because they don‚Äôt like the taste‚Äîor how they feel afterwards. Others, however, enjoy swallowing their saliva from ZYN nicotine pouches, mostly because swallowing your saliva while using the nicotine pouch increases your absorbed nicotine level.\n\nhttps://nicokick.com/us/pouch-perfect/science/can-you-swallow-zyn-nicotine-pouches-spit?gclsrc=aw.ds&gad_source=1",
