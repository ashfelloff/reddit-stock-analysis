How can you sell fake policies & collect fake premiums? The “fraud” wouldn’t make any sense for GL to engage in. Was an immediate 60% discount on the stock. While I don’t know about the future value of $130, especially with all the turbulence in insurance markets, $40 was an absolute steal. Bought shares, sold calls against them, shares got assigned. Bought calls and more shares afterwards.",
