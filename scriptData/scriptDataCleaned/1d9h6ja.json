The Western world economy is looking mortally wounded at this point and there are no good ways out. So our governments can either go into austerity and let their massive debt payments kill them today, or they can money-print to keep the plates spinning and let inflation kill them later. Maybe if they buy some time, a future miracle will save them. \n\nI really don't see any economic miracles that are even possible in the 21st century, unless we just absolutely blow out China in a non-nuclear war and transfer all their wealth back our way. \n\nPopulation is in a global decline, Western world economic growth rates are in a 30 year decline, resource exploitation is maxed out and commodity pricing are rising, pollution is becoming a limiting factor, all of our farmable land is already being used and intensified... what can you guys even name that could grow economic output? NVidia-trained chatbots?",
