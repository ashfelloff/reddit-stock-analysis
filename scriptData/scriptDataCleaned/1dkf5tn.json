Bertelsmann is another comparative giant (100.000 employees) that is privately owned and only has some subsidiaries (RTL SE) publicly traded. \n\n\nVAGina recently put Porsche out because they felt their entire company was undervalued. \n\n\nThere's tons of basic companies that produce very important and valuable stuff in some random small village in Germany that just aren't publicly traded nor well known.
