  "selftext": "The world of investing regards keep talking about what the FED will do with rates and how much they are going to cut but that's not nearly as important as what the balance sheet news could be. \n\nRight now, they are still tapering. They cut tapering drastically in May (and surprise surprise noone in the media noticed) and back then Powell said (not a quote, just what i remember): \n\n\"we slowed the pace of tapering SO THAT we don't scare the fin markets and we could run the tapering for much much longer\".\n\nMy bet is that they won't cut tapering or Powell is a mad ass liar in the first place.\n\nNow, should they keep the pace of tapering as it is, then i'm anticipating a decline in SP500 in the second half of this month (which is already here). \n\nTL;DR: REGARDLESS of how much they're going to cut, if tapering is untouched, the markets will fall. \n\nWe'll see.",

Also, markets were about to tank in May (the \"sell in may and go away\" phenomena) but Powell went full dovish out of nowhere (note: meeting was in 1st of May) and scaled back tapering from 60BLN a month to 25BLN a month. That's over 50% tapering cut and many didn't even recoqnize this because headlines are all about rates. And that made a full on SP500 jump to the upside again.\n\nAlso, markets were up because money printing works with a lag so companies were still reporting strong revenues and net incomes. But those are all exhausted now (IMO anyway, i've made an extensive analysis about the relationship between money printing and companies performance) and without a fresh QE i don't see continued net income growth. Where's the money going to come from?",
