  "score": 258,
  "selftext": "Blackberry surprised the skeptics and on April 3 removed the curtains and delivered better than expected revenues beating the street estimates for Q4 FY24. The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside. Taiwan based Foxconn is the make of Apple iPhone. At the Wold Imbedded Software Show in Germany Blackberry and AMD announced a strategic partnership on Robotics technology sending a shockwave in Germany and around the world. Blackberry is back in the spotlight , on  the world stage pioneering innovation in intelligent car software, robotics and so much more. Blackberry is an innovation icon, the Next Nvidia.",
