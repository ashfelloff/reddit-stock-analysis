Stuxnet would look for Siemens software which was used to control and program the PLCs and modify it. As for side channel attacks, although these are theoretically possible it’s much more likely for plants to be hacked through human operators bringing in infected hardware. And since side channel attacks are so incredibly rare and difficult to perform this underlines my point in that you can’t really compare the security of a centrifuge to internet providers like Verizon.",
