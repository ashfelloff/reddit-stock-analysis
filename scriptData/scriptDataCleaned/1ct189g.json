  "selftext": "Think about it, the market always crashes at a fed pivot so we just should never pivot. we could make no actual products and have no one be able to afford anything, but that’s irrelevant. you just pump, hype, take on new debt, dilute shares to get cash flow, up guidance on cash flow from dilution and if you ever miss estimates just announce buy backs with the diluted cash. \n\n   Just infinite pump. Plus why can’t we just secretly give the bank printed cash. The public doesn’t even have to know we can just sell our children’s futures for short term gain AGI is coming, sure we have only seen 2% of all ai promises and sure powerful bots can’t really challenge the system because that would require controversy in any direction but full self driving is only two years away, and next year it will be two years away.",
