  "score": 36,
  "selftext": "Alright, we got the magic numbers from our boy Jensen today\n\nFor Q1, we got $6.12EPS vs $5.59 expected (9.5% surprise). For revenue, we got $26.04B vs $24.65B expected (5.6% surprise). \n\nCompare the expectations surprises against last quarter (11.4% and 7.6% respectively) NVDAâ€™s forward guidance last quarter was $24B in revenue vs $21.9B expected (9.6% surprise) and now we have expectations of $28B vs $26.61B expected (5.2% surprise). \n\nWhat does this mean? NVDA is continuing to surpass Wall Streetâ€™s already lofty expectations, but the surprises are losing momentum by almost 50% in some metrics. \n\nNVDAâ€™s previous earnings were on Feb 21 and about a month after, reached its new peak at around $950, a 40% increase and never truly surpassing that price until now. \n\nGiven the slowing momentum, I see a case of maybe 15-20% growth in the stock price in the next month but itâ€™s hard to anticipate market reactions to the earnings and to the impact of the stock split on June 7. \n\nI think with the high demand for both Hopper and Blackwell extending into 2025, NVDA remains a good long-term play, but as everybody else is saying, its crazy growth is gone. That is, unless we see generative AI step into the scene. Then, NVDAâ€™s growth will continue to be capped by its supply for a few more years. \n\n\nTLDR: NVDA will probably hit a pre-split value of $1100-$1150 by the end of June",
