It was my first ever option try and I figured I'd just put a few hundred in and if it went to zero then it was just a learning opportunity.  I watched that option go 5X and I didn't sell,  I figured,  it would only keep going up.  Then it didn't.  And I figured if I sell now I'm just locking in my losses so I'll wait.  Oh and I should buy more since the price is down,  but I'll be less regarded and buy for May instead because by then I had learned about IV crush.   \n\nAnd it went down,  and down.  And then I figured,  well it can't get any WORSE,  might as well wait for the monthly numbers to come out.  Then they did, and they were good,  but the whole market was in the red.  So I still didn't sell.  Figured I'd wait to see what happened with earnings.  And fuck,  it goes down even MORE?  So now the 4/19 are fucked,  and the 5/17 ones are down 90% too.   I'm really kicking myself for \"buying the dip\" on these.  I've learned that options probably aren't for me and I should just stick to buying stocks.  At least when those go down you can just wait it out.",
