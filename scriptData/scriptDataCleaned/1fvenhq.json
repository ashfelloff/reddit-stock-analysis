  "selftext": "The new AI economy has forced the big players to power their new data centers through nuclear energy as they can no longer rely on the grid. The biggest deal so far was announced 10 days ago by Microsoft with the Three Mile Island Nuclear plant.\n\nMore info:\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-20/microsoft-s-ai-power-needs-prompt-revival-of-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-20/microsoft-s-ai-power-needs-prompt-revival-of-three-mile-island-nuclear-plant)\n\nWhile Microsoft is able to strike a deal for an entire nuclear plant, most of the other big players are seeking to power their future data centers through smaller scale nuclear sources, called **Small Modular Reactors.** This is the case of Oracle, announcing on their quarterly earnings call that they would be powering their new data centers through **SMRs** (without disclosing the company they were going to select). \n\nMore info:\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/10/oracle-is-designing-a-data-center-that-would-be-powered-by-three-small-nuclear-reactors.html) \n\n**HOWEVER, Nuscale Power  is currently the only SMR technology certified by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and ready for commercial implementation.**\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/nrc-certifies-first-us-small-modular-reactor-design)\n\nIn 2020, before the AI boom began, NuScale Power was selected by the Department of Energy to build a six-reactor 462 megawatt project in Utah, but the project was eventually cancelled as COVID related inflation drove the costs too high and the project was finally scrapped. The deal included a $1.35B in financing from the US government.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nuscale-power-uamps-agree-terminate-nuclear-project-2023-11-08/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nuscale-power-uamps-agree-terminate-nuclear-project-2023-11-08/)\n\n**NuScale Power has  been used by the US government as a tool of geopolitical influence to ink energy infrastructure projects abroad.** \n\n[https://www.state.gov/u-s-and-ghana-nuclear-firms-sign-landmark-commercial-agreement-for-small-modular-reactor-project-in-ghana/](https://www.state.gov/u-s-and-ghana-nuclear-firms-sign-landmark-commercial-agreement-for-small-modular-reactor-project-in-ghana/)\n\n[https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/biden-administration-announces-financial-commitment-to-advance-nuscale-voygr-deployment-in-romania](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2023/biden-administration-announces-financial-commitment-to-advance-nuscale-voygr-deployment-in-romania)\n\nUkraine is also seeking to build SMRs through NuScale Power (link from  the official Ukraine gov).\n\n[https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zustrich-hermana-halushchenka-ta-kerivnytstva-kompanii-nuscale-power-realizatsiiu-pershoho-proektu-mmr-v-ukraini-bude-pryskoreno](https://www.kmu.gov.ua/en/news/zustrich-hermana-halushchenka-ta-kerivnytstva-kompanii-nuscale-power-realizatsiiu-pershoho-proektu-mmr-v-ukraini-bude-pryskoreno)\n\n  \nDespite all of this, a bunch of illuminated retardados have decided to short the stock and the current interest sits at 25% of the float (about 25M shares). \n\nBeing backed by the government, being the only US based company approved to build SMRs and having the interest of big US companies (like Oracle) to power their new data centers through SMRs I believe NuScale Power is prime to be one of the biggest winners AI energy race. \n\nPositions: 20 contracts of 15/11 15 strike calls for 0.80c",
