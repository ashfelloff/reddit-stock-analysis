If you are bullish in any given year (which should be most years), your only goal is to beat the S&P, the baseline of which is literally dumping your money into the top market cap companies and just letting it sit there. Naturally, the easiest way to profit in a bullish market is to buy slightly OTM calls a few weeks out, take out your initial after some profit and let the rest ride and sell when you're satisfied. The top market cap companies historically rise an average of 1.5% weekly for at least the past 30 years. Yes, you will get caught by black swans, which is why you buy a couple weeks out, not LEAPs, those companies won't be there forever. \n\nThe market is very simple, most people think they can outsmart the S&P when you should just be surfing it up and walk away with good returns in a bullish market.",
