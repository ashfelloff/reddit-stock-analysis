It probably is overvalued, but by how much? It might be good to cash in for those who want to enjoy their fruit juice. If later on, the mob thinks it's worthless, grab some then.\n\n\n\nAs far as changing minds, I think the awareness that there are different styles, with different tactics.

      "body": "People need to also realize that stock price and company performance can get out of whack. The vast majority of corrections are just fixing that and are usually resolved quickly, but epic corrections can take a long long time to recover from. \n\ngo look at MSFT in 2000, 2008, 2012, 2014, and then on from there. You will see there was something like an 14 year stretch from the peak in 2000 until it recovered in 2014. That would suck for shareholders. However I think the company itself was just fine all those years. In fact if you had held from 2000 until now a $1000 investment would be worth around $25,000. So its not all bad, but  if you needed you $1,000 back from 2000 all the way to 2014 you would have come up short.\n\nIm not saying that will definitely happen to NVDA, but its something everyone should realize can happen. Dont risk money you need in the next few years.",
