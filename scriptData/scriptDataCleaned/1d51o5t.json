Obviously, stock picking is riskier than buying an index so I would say that her fund would be worth its fee if it can generate returns above the index and her fee as well as another 2 percent return for the risk premium. The Nasdaq returned about 55 percent in the last 2 years if you use the same time horizon this graph does while ark invest is roughly flat over that same period. That‚Äôs a terrible return but looking at a 2 year time horizon is also a joke. The fairest comparison is ark invest vs the nasdaq since she took over. In that comparison ark returned about little over 100 percent and the nasdaq returned 150 percent but there were periods in 2021 where she massively outperformed her benchmark and that is how she got her fame. \n\nIn short she didn‚Äôt do well over the long term vs. her benchmark but that‚Äôs pretty normal for any actively managed fund not just for Cathy Wood.",
