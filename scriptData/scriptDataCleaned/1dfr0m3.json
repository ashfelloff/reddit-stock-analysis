  "selftext": "Hi regards,\n\nYou may know me from posts like \"Short CRM\", \"Buy HPE\" and \"how to lose your ass on CPI Day NDX puts\".\n\nAnother post you may have seen is my play on VRT - which was mostly focused around the fact that they are the main player in the data center liquid cooling (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bk8ruo/the\\_next\\_semiconductor\\_data\\_center\\_play\\_vertiv\\_vrt/) - which I recommended a few months ago when they were trading in the 70's. This play actually saved my ass when TSM ate shit after previous ER during the market dip in March.\n\nSo this brings me to today and next week. Recently it came to my attention that HPE also launched data center liquid cooling solutions. And, if you read my VRT post, basically everyone is going to need some liquid cooling data center infrastructure soon because NVIDIA's top of the line Blackwell chips will demand it.\n\nOn top of that, HPE's Discover event is starting next week. I have a feeling that Liquid cooling is going to make a splash (so to speak). Now just go and take another look at VRT's 1-year chart. Mmmmmkay.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if HPE hits $30 by Sept if the stars align right. Load up on shares and calls.\n\nI added 2000 shares to my long term account yesterday... still holding 550 (\\~$100k position now) call contracts expiring at different dates in my degenerate account, with the longest leg expiring in Sept which should be after next ER. Definitely diamond-handing this one.",
