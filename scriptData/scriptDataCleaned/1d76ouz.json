It prevents trading from occurring outside of specific price bands that are continuously updated throughout the trading day.\n\nThe price bands for each security are set at a percentage level above and below the average reference price of the security over the immediately preceding five-minute period.\n\nThe exchange operator said additional information would be provided as soon as possible.\n\n\"It's erroneous trade reports and will get taken from the tape,\" Joe Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, said. \"It's somebody having a glitch whether its the exchange or a market maker.\"\n\nTechnical issues on exchanges can hit markets, impact traders' confidence and attract scrutiny from the U.S. securities regulator.\n\nStocks listed on the NYSE, such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A.NaE), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG.NaE) and Barrick Gold (GOLD.NaE), among others, were halted for volatility.\n\nSome stocks showed unusual outsized movements. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A.NaE) and Barrick Gold (GOLD.NaE) shares were shown to be down 99.97% and 98.54%, respectively, due to the technical issue.\n\nThe NYSE did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Arasu Kannagi Basil in Bengaluru and SinÃ©ad Carew in New York; Editing by Krishna Chandra Eluri)",
