      "body": "I work in semiconductors. There is no way you could run a successful fab in a warzone. \n\nThe supply chains are so complex that any conflict would be problematic. For example, 1/3 of the world’s krypton comes from one factory in Mariupol. This gas is used for a small but critical step in semiconductor manufacturing. When the war in Ukraine started, this was a disruption for all the big semiconductor companies. Imagine that level of disruption for every single thing a fab needs. \n\nPretend that supply chains aren’t an issue. A TEL (Tokyo Electron is a major tool manufacturer) Etch chamber contains 6 RF braids that need to have the tips bent in a correct direction. If this this is done wrong, you will arc the chamber and it’s a $100,000 fuckup. This is just one of thousands of examples of how delicate these machines are. When I was learning, I was told to think of myself as working on a Rolex or other similar delicate machine. The production tolerances are measured in angstroms. Picture trying to run these machines with missiles and artillery fire.",

Both of them are two prominent e-commerce platforms like Alibaba that have gained significant attention in the online shopping landscape. Wish, founded in the US in 2010, serves as a platform connecting global buyers with mainly Chinese sellers and operates under American ownership. In contrast, Temu, owned by PDD Holdings, a Chinese company, entered the US market in 2022 with a focus on providing a localized shopping experience by connecting buyers with local sellers. Despite similarities in offering a wide range of products at competitive prices, their distinct business models, user interfaces, and market presence differentiate them as separate entities in the online marketplace landscape.\"_",
