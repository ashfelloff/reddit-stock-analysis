The glitch made it necessary for the pilots to set the takeoff thrust level manually. They had ample time to do this, but set it too low and didn’t catch the mistake during standard operating procedure.",

      "body": "Corporate America is always vulnerable to making harmful mistakes. Faulty wiring faulty computers & software bad design components not tested in all circumstances such as temperature. The airlines the FAA the NTSB the aircraft manufacturers. Corporations aren’t in the safety business they’re in the profit business.  The FAA decides what’s safe & what’s not. Statistically flying is safe in relative terms but perceptually mishaps are high profile & involve a concentrated number of casualties. Flying is a demonstration of cognitive dissonance. You don’t really completely trust the airline the maintenance mechanics the plane builder the air traffic controllers but at the same time you are willing to trust all of it & take the bet. It took Boeing two 737 crashes & one near miss to finally figure out a hydraulic power control unit had a design flaw. The 747 had a cargo door latch design flaw. I’d probably trust Boeing over any particular carrier. Those planes only make money if they’re in the air.",
