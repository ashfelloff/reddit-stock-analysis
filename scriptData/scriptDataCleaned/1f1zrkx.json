  "selftext": "I am 22, studying at university and fortunate enough to be living with my parents where I have no major expenses except my student loan which I will have to pay after I graduate.\n\nI am able to put most of my earnings into the vanguard developed (VHVG) & emerging world (VFEG) etf 90/10 split and I plan on doing this as long as I can. \n\nI also have small amount in crypto which I was also planning on DCA (around 10% of my portfolio)\n\nAlso is it best to invest in stocks monthly or weekly? Or does it not matter in the long run?\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nEdit: I should mention I live in the UK",

If you want to be more conservative (which I wouldn’t be doing at your age) you can put it all in on s&p500 but the performance will be slightly worse. If you want to stay away from risk then stay away from small caps or if you find a good small cap stock you like just stick to a single stock and don’t let it be above 5% of your total stock portfolio. I don’t think it’s necessary to be diverse in small caps if you only have the total value be less than 5% of your portfolio. \n\nSchg is up 135% in the past 5 years compared to s&p 500 up 88% in 5 years.",

What put me off initially is that Emerging Markets haven't been doing particularly well for a while and I don't really see that stopping in the foreseeable future.\n\nFor comparison:  \nVTI: returned 85.87% over the past 5 years  \nVanguard FTSE Developed Europe (Acc): returned 59.82% over the past 5 years  \nSPDW (Developed World ex US): 30.02% returned over the past 5 years  \nMSCI EM (Acc): returned 28.50% over the past 5 years  \n\n\nVT: returned 58.82% over the past 5 years\n\nWe can infer that recently, Emerging Markets as well as ex-US and ex-Europe developed Markets haven't done to well. That might change, of course, since past performance isn't indicative of future performance. But it's something I personally have a look at.\n\nAnd personally, I think the issues in regards to China, which is the biggest player in EM, are gonna persist for a while. I see no reason to assume they won't.  \nAs for other players in EM such as India or Indonesia, I simply lack the knowledge there, therefore I can't come up with any reasonable estimates.\n\nFunnily enough, the Nikkei 225 has done incredibly well over the past 5 years, even though Japan is the biggest ex-US & ex-Europe player in the Developed Markets and the Developed World ex-US underperformed the Developed Europe so much.",
