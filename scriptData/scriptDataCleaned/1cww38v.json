  "title": "NVDA: Why this earnings call may be different?",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "NVDA's earnings call 22nd May, '24 is the most consequential event till end of June for the US equities.\n\nI believe by the time of this post, bets have been cast: Calls & Puts, hedge funds have fed buy or sell parameters in their algorithms and analysts are looking for last minute cues to adjust their post earnings price target.\n\nBut this earnings call may turn out to be little different:\n\nMarket  appears to be working on following assumptions:\n\n1) NVDA will beat revenue & EPS expectations\n2) Bullish to positive future guidance\n\n\nThis is why there is a lack of any meaningful pullback pre earnings as was in Feb, '24.\n\nCall option sellers are actively delta hedging. Even if some fund managers and investors are trimming positions: it is not even making a dent. \n\nAs of 20th May, stock is at 97.5% of its ATH. Unlike in Feb, '24 when there was a 7% healthy pull back which made it attractive for investors to step in.\n\nNVDA shall rise but in a more muted fashion than previously.\n\nMy prediction:\n\n1) ATM Call Shorts shall cut out a sorry figure in the post earning\n2) Significantly OTM Call Longs shall lose their premiums \n3) Long Puts shall lose their shirts too\n\nHow to make a quick buck:\n1) Buy ATM Calls with 3 weeks expiry\n2) Sell significantly OTM Calls [>1050$] & OTM Put [<875$] weeklies [Edit: please consider credit spread if you are uncomfortable with naked shorts in Options. Manage your risk judiciously].",
