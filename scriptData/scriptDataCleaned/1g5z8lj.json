      "body": "OP plz edit. Stock has gone up cuz recently down action and not because shares were purchased but acquired thru merger. explanation below, [sec form as source](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1780312/000106299324017533/xslF345X05/form4.xml)\n\nThe specific parts of the Form 4 that outline the acquisition of shares through the merger include:\n\n1. **Explanation of Responses**: This section details the nature of the transactions, stating that Rakuten Mobile USA Service Inc. completed a series of mergers with subsidiaries of AST SpaceMobile that resulted in the acquisition of **28,520,155 shares of the Issuer's Class A Common Stock**. It explicitly mentions \"the Mergers\" as the mechanism through which these shares were acquired.\n2. **Details of the Mergers**:\n   * The first merger is described as **‚ÄúAST SpaceMobile Holdings III, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer, merged with and into Rakuten USA, with Rakuten USA surviving such merger (the 'First Merger').‚Äù**\n   * The second merger immediately follows: **‚Äú...Rakuten USA merged with and into AST SpaceMobile Holdings IV, LLC, a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of the Issuer ('AST Holdings'), with AST Holdings surviving such merger (the 'Second Merger').‚Äù**\n3. **Acquisition Statement**: The explanation clarifies that **\"As part of the Mergers, the 28,520,155 shares of Class B Common Stock previously held by Rakuten USA were transferred to the Issuer and cancelled.\"** This indicates that the shares acquired by Rakuten Mobile were part of the merger transactions rather than a direct purchase.\n\nOverall, these points clearly establish that the shares were obtained through corporate mergers involving Rakuten, rather than being purchased directly by Mikitani.",

When this data starts hitting the books as revenue, the stock will suddenly be very undervalued and quickly find its level.\n\nKinda like a ghost value play, RDDT has been rising in my opinion for similar reasons as cash starts to hit the books.\n\nEDIT: I'd also like to add I believe when I bought earlier and even now that it is a 'risk value' play as well since the payout potential if realized should heavily outweigh a loss of capital to the relative upside potential. Theoretically, in a model where the risk/reward is attractive enough, if the odds of payout are truly whatever the delta is in gambles like these companies, it should play out in your favor as you go enough through trials.",
