And for those who are curious the kids in their 30s and 40s didn’t start fat and pathetic, they got that way after 20 years fighting in mediocre “middle class” jobs like most Americans who didn’t or couldn’t become doctors or lawyers.  I’m not saying spoil your kids, but making them survive till their 60s until you die to go from $75k a year to $10mm net worth is some fucked up shit.

Im not gonna put up with it and now that i have everything set up, im not coming back.\n\nI drive between multiple jobs a day so i have a large selection of where i get breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Subway and starbucks use to be a favorite but i got hit with a $20 charge for a foot long sub and pretzel. Im not going back and starbucks is now only gonna be a once in a while treat. I use to get a chai tea every single day from them. Now i might go back once every 4-6 months but im gonna make an effort for a local coffe shop.\n\nThese are just a couple examples of where im focusing my money as a consumer. At the end of the day, im not a number on a spread sheet. I feel my relationship with corporations is a living, breathing thing. If i dont feel any compassion, if ads are shoved down my throat 24/7, or you put a service that was once normal behind a subscription.

People spend less for items and suppliers reduce prices in order to stay competitive. Consumer spending still increased last month. People were just looking more closely, where to spend it.\n\nNow don´t get me wrong. There is very likely a large group of consumers, struggling to make ends meet and if I am not completely wrong, there will be some crunch on lenders, who were to greedy. But apparently many banks have been moderately strict with their customers, which means, we don´t have a large bubble underneath. Instead what has happened is, that consumers started putting money back in deposits, after those began to pay interest.\n\nI may be off. but when I read about suppliers competing by offering lower prices, I don´t see a crisis.
