Each put contract was the right to sell 100 shares of  QQQ at $439. It opened at $425 this morning and is the reason the premium was so high.",

They had 6 put contracts at $135 each, and the “current market value” when they sold was $1588 each. \n\nThe bet was very risky because the put options expired at the end of today, but the strike they chose  was at $440 and QQQ opened this morning at like $425.
