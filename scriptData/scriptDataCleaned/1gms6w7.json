Most people arent selling naked calls or buying super swingy stocks.\n\nEdit: like you can buy nvidia right now, sell a 166 call for dec 20th for 2.5% profit. If it goes to 170 in 6 weeks then you make an additional 12% for 14.5% profit instead of 14.8%. Boo hoo. And if it doesnt go to 166, you make 2.5% in 6 weeks and can sell another one on a stock many people buy and hold. If it goes to 149-165.99 then you make all that profit plus the 2.5%. \n\nNvda going to 200 from 148 in 6 weeks is how you \"lose\" by making 14.5% instead of 35.1%. But thats the consequence for becoming thetagang and not degen wsb gambler. It will happen but the plan is to have more 2-10% gainers that make up for the one stock mooning",
