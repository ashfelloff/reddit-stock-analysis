Systems which were offline won't, and when powered on, will pull the latest (now likely fixed) version instead.\n\nThings such as a persons laptop probably won't be affected by this, however, PC towers connected to the wall and are running connected to the internet, will be affected. Workers currently working in places such as Japan/Australia, will be affected, since it was mid-day there when the update was released.

          "body": "Crowdstrike was (previously, before today), seen as a mostly competent \"next-generation\" cloud anti-virus. It came about because traditional anti-virus software, such as McAfee, and Windows Defender, relied on anti-virus definitions. Think of it like body making anti-bodies towards specific viruses. All biological viruses have a certain shape (a hash in this case for a computer virus), your body can recognize this shape, and make anti-bodies which when finding this shape, attack and kill it on sight (anti-virus definition updates).\n\nThe problem with this is that not all viruses have a hash, there are viruses which are fileless (exist in RAM only), and in order for them to be cleaned from a system, that system needs to see a hash for the file, and if there is no hash, the virus stays and wrecks havoc. There's also the issue that the computers need to know what to look for, if the computer doesn't have the definition update, it doesn't know your photo.png.exe file is encrypting your system in a ransomware attack.\n\nIn comes a newcomer Crowdstrike, touting \"next-generation\" capabilities. Instead just relying on anti-virus definition updates, the software now also analyzes the system for suspicious processing events which malware routinely uses. It detects patterns, such as a process going through and encrypting all your files on your desktop, and stops it from occurring. It may read specific parts of a powershell script you're about to execute, and see if there's any suspicious lines of code, such as a line of code telling the program to delete a bunch of files in system32, and so on.\n\nIn theory, it worked better and was smarter at detecting then-untraditional malware (such as ransomware). McAfee (now Trellix) and Windows Defender have included similar functionality nowadays, but Crowdstrike was a better marketed product which people bought up. Now they're paying for it. Because it was well-marketed, a lot of people used it. And they deployed it to hundreds of thousands of workstations, which had policies set up to automatically download and install anti-virus updates. Those updates are what's causing the outages.",
