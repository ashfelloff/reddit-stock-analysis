  "score": 148,
  "selftext": "I predict that Spirit Airlines will probably drop as much as 50% its current price following earnings due to 'going concerns'. I also predict that they will receive an investor who will eliminate its 1.1 billion loyalty bond debt due September 2025 during afterhours trading on the day after earnings are released.\n\nIf my prediction is correct, the best way to capitalize on this is to close any put options placed before Spirit Airlines earnings release during market open and then limit order 7.5 strike leap options expiring January 2026 at 15-20 dollars per contract right before the stock plunges and receives a volatility halt.",
