  "score": 110,
  "selftext": "I am a shareholder and I am urging my fellow shareholders to vote against the acquisition of Frontier given the leverage issues. Verizon already has a high debt level. The proposed price for Frontier is $38.50 per share. Frontier is also heavily indebted and Verizon will have to assume their debt and issue even more debt to overpay for the company. A month ago Frontier was trading at $28 per share. What will happen once management discovers they overpaid for Frontier and the cost synergies donâ€™t materialize? They will cut the dividend. Time to stand up and vote for new leaders at Verizon and against this awful deal.\n",

Baa1 from Moodys, BBB+ from S&P, A- from Fitch. Default rate is anywhere between 0.3% to 0.85%. Debt 150B\n\nFrontier: debt outlook stable. Ratings from all three agencies are junk territory. Debt 11B\n\nSo, this move can make sense for VZ if VZ can service their debt (VZ plus Frontier) at an investment grade borrowing cost rather than junk. I believe the high yield spread is 3%. So right there is your cost savings 3% of the 11B debt. Absorbing Frontier would add less than 10% of the total debt to VZ; probably not enough to change their credit rating.\n\nJust to provide some numerical context to your comment.",
