That’s like saying your cousin on section 8 housing getting 800 bucks a month is a great investment because he has gov money coming.  Neither can survive without gov assistance that’s not a big selling point.  \n\nI told you guys 6 months ago when this was 1200 .

Then at the same time the 1500 80p were traded, 1500 150c were also traded. The 80p were closer to the bid and 150c closer to the ask, averaging out to the midpoint. Since its all at the mid, all you can do is look at the price action after the trade is placed, which was up.",
