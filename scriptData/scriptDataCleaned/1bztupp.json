  "selftext": "Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this\n\n2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nI was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE\n\nI had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.\n\nBless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.\n\nEDIT: I just think it’s way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  \n\nMuch like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it’s very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the “street” or “market” pivots quickly.  \n\n5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nWhen you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it’s almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won’t have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it’ll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order.",

Plus again the market isn't always rational. \n\nTake Apple for example. Berkshire invested in it in Q1 2016 for the first time. That seems late, the whole iPhone, iPad craze already happened and Apple didn't really change their business since then. Yet the stock was around 25-30$ and is now at 170$. If AI is as big as people say in the next decade or so, there'll still be growth for all the AI stocks.",

If they grow quarterly earnings by just 5% all the way to 2030, then they'll be at 82b.\n\nThe last year they've grown quarterly revenue at 21% quarter to quarter on average. If that gets cut to say 7%, that is 2030 quarterly revenue at 136b.\n\nConsidering how technological the world is becoming, I can see this being a real number. I mean, apple has rev. of 120b. How much could NVDA capture if they had chips in almost literally anything? Phones, cars, heavy machinery, defense contractor equipment, world government equipment, police equipment even.\n\nIs the stock going to double by 2030 with those numbers? Probably not honestly, but it could easily grow another 50% from here imho.\n\nNevermind that they could also release a dividend at a certain point which could be a money driver as well.",
