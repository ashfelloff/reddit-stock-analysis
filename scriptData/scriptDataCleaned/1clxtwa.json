  "selftext": "Hello there fellow regards.  Let me break down why TKO Group Holdings, the parent company of WWE and UFC, is an earnings play worth getting some equity in before their earnings call after market close on Wednesday\n\n#WWE IS THE HOTTEST IT HAS BEEN SINCE THE 90'S\n\nThere was a time that WWE (WWF at the time) was at the forefront of pop culture thanks to Stone Cold, The Rock, and the NWO.  The industry ended up becoming seen as lowbrow entertainment less than a decade later, but thanks to the work of Paul Levesque (formerly HHH) pro wrestling has been restored to it's former glory.\n\nDon't believe me?  Here are some numbers from Q1 this year:\n\n- In the run up to WrestleMania in Q1 of this year, WWE sold out weekly televised arena shows for eight straight weeks https://www.pwmania.com/wwes-incredible-run-of-television-events-is-over\n\n- Shattered attendance records for untelevised shows in multiple markets, including the highest attendance for an untelevised show since 2001 https://www.ringsidenews.com/2024/02/20/wwe-live-show-sees-record-attendance-not-seen-in-over-two-decades/\n\n- Wrestlemania in April set both viewership and attendance records, with 145,298 live fans across the two night event and 660 million views across media platforms https://www.si.com/wrestling/2024/04/09/wrestlemania-40-ratings-record-rock-roman-reigns-wwe\n\n- WrestleMania broke the WWE Youtube channel's record for views in a 24 hour window with 67 million views\n\n- Broke their record for merchandise sales at Wrestlemania in a collaboration with Fanatics, seeing a 20% increase over merch sales at last years Mania\n\n- Signed a $500 million /yr deal with Netflix on January 23rd\n\n#UFC CONTINUES TO BE HOT\n\nIn addition to WWE's record setting quarter, the UFC has seen a great Q1 of their own\n\n- UFC just had an incredibly successful UFC 300 with a $16.5 million gate\n\n- UFC 300 was the UFC's 11th consecutive arena sellout\n\n- UFC 300 prelims on ESPN peaked at 2.49 million viewers\n\n- UFC 300 set the record for most merchandise sales ever at an arena show\n\n- UFC 300 set the record for highest grossing sponsorship for a UFC event\n\nNgl I lost patience finding sources for each, but I created the DD over the weekend using sources and everything can be verified.\n\nAll in all, I am expecting a MASSIVE earnings call after market close on Wednesday.  Join me fellow regards 🚀",
