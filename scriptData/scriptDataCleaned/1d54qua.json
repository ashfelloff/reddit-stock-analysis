          "body": "the right decision is to sell out before the weekend on a short dated contract. the theta hit is pretty hard. can cut you down by 33-50% even with a flat open. Better to just re-size and get back in on Monday if you think it continues. Maybe you miss out on a little, but you balance the RR better getting out. Good choice imo too.\n\nif it opens lower too, you get the crazy good opportunity to simply repeat the play. staying in definitely doesn't beat that\n\nshort dated contracts are really meant to be in and out. you can lose a ton to theta if you try to ride an uptrend on only short contracts. you just end up paying too much in theta over time. cause the end of a contract is pretty expensive in terms of the amount of time you get and the speed at which the premium drops",
