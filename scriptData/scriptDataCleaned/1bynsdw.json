  "score": 73,
  "selftext": "Earnings season is in full swing, and there are some easy pickings if you're on the long side. Here are some key projections:\n\n**CPI:**\n\n* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.\n* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.\n* This could put rate cuts back on the table.\n* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.\n* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.\n\n**Banks:**\n\n* JPM may kick off a bank rally.\n* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.\n\n**Tech Names:**\n\n* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.\n* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).\n* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.\n* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).\n* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.\n* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.\n\n**Energy/Utilities:**\n\n* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.\n* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.\n\n**Gold:**\n\n* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.\n\nThere may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!\n\nPS - Some have reached out for recommendations.  I noted some names that will be interesting to invest in here: [Today's game](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwh7qk/todays_game_strong_buy_signals_from_the_market/).  I am partial to cybersecurity as a sector, given it is likely to benefit from the overall trends I have noted.\n\n&#x200B;",

It won't make sense to keep a restrictive stance in face of these declines.  Market has overreacted to a couple of reports.  The cuts are coming.",

On the flip side, housing and lower electricity will benefit. Vehicle sales have moderated.  Food, apparel, etc. are also behaving.  There are no bugaboos there in the short to medium term.  Long term, the amount of debt relative to GDP may be concerning, but productivity gains over the next few years will likely offset that, too (yet to be seen).",
