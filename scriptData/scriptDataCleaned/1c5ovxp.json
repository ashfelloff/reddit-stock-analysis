It's a complex issue and has more to do with apples hostility to basically anything outside it's ecosystem, making apple users completely dependent on Apple for all their tech needs.\n\nWhile I think that is the least of people's concerns that use apple.  Apple prides itself as a Champion of privacy.  It went to bat against the FBI, Facebook for it's customers to protect their privacy.\n\nAltruistic right? Not so fast.  There was no profit motive to play ball with those entities and did wonders for their public image.  Enter China.  Tim Cook achieved the goal of moving all their manufacturing to China reducing their costs.  Ever since Apple has just done whatever the CCP tells them to keep their sweet sweet Manufacturing deal.\n\n>After Apple caved to Beijing, the demands kept coming. Next, Apple willingly backdoored all its Chinese cloud services, so that the Chinese state could plunder its customers’ data at will:\n\nThis is essentially exactly what Apple fought the FBI over, but the FBI wasn't providing them with cheap labor.",

Android supports a whole lot of different hardware configurations and approaches. Apple’s tight integration really shows up in those APIs that interface closely with hardware - graphics and compute, gesture / touch handling (part of why Apple devices feel “smoother” generally). Another great example is the lead iOS has over android in spatial computing (ARKit has been more advanced and capable than ARCore ever since they were both released, in a big way because of specialized sensors that aren’t on any android devices).\n\nThat software + hardware combo (and probably better hardware overall most of the time) is why Apple devices tend to “run better” than even Google’s own devices (pixel lag) and iPhone customer satisfaction, loyalty ratings are higher than android (in US at least).",

The walled garden aspect of Apple really has nothing to do with the Apple Store, it's more to do with deliberate choices like the Lightning connector instead of USBC, or Facetime being Apple exclusive for no legitimate reason, or the way it handles text messages from Android users vs Apple users.  There are a lot of deliberate decisions made to \"other\" non-Apple users.  Making their own cable when an open source version that has all the same capabilities exists, but Apple can't pull money from licensing if they use USBC, that kind of thing.\n\n  \nThere's nothing open source about Apple Store or Google Play, but those are kind of irrelevant.

It’s fundamentally incompatible with being a walled garden.”\n\nGoogle was found guilty of monopoly practices on Android and the App Store specific complaints are essentially the same. \n\nAs far as interoperability, you’re right about Apple but it’s something that’s evolved into a strong argument over time. The initial use of proprietary standards tracks the development of pretty much every big platform throughout history. It’s become a much bigger problem because no other technology has ever become as ubiquitous as mobile devices, integrating with so many other devices and parts of our lives.\n\nBut hard to say what it all looks like in a few years or even how it actually affects Apple’s long term value to investors given the relative size of some of these businesses (cables?). Who builds the FaceTime app on Android? Can Apple be coerced to adopt an open protocol for its native video chat? At what point is it not kosher for Vision Pro to use a proprietary battery connection? What will be the enforcement mechanisms for all of this?",

An app store % of revenue isn't a walled garden, you see that in similar concepts even in non-mobile spaces like Steam for PC gaming.  Another good example of a \"walled garden\" are cordless tool brands.  You're heavily incentivized to stick with the same brand across all your cordless tools because the batteries are proprietary and every additional tool you add adds to the amount of battery swaps you can do before needing to recharge, and switching brands has the downside of \"starting from scratch\" on batteries.",
