You don't have 100k in your account but you happen to have margin turned on? Great, the broker might front you $100500 so that the option buyer who thought he was risking $550 is now risking $100500 instead of $550 for as long as it takes the option buyer to realize what has happened. Let's say during that time the share price goes from 1005 to 995. Well, now you only own $99500 worth of collateral to sell off to pay off a  $100500 loan, thus, how you lose $1000 on a $550 bet.",
