  "score": 2155,
  "selftext": "This got me thinking about the potential strategy of just buying 0DTE SPY calls every morning. If just today's movement of about 0.5% got a 400% return, aren't you statistically likely to make money, since whether SPY goes up or down is basically 50/50? Why wouldn't this work? Obviously you'd only bet like 10% of your account each day so you can make it back if you're wrong. ",
