The Tesla Credits can be used toward Supercharging, a new Tesla vehicle, service appointments or select Tesla Shop or upgrade purchases. Just for your info, Tesla Tequila is excluded though. The incentive is available after verifying eligibility with Uber through their system, find the button on Tesla’s fresh [tesla.com/uber](http://tesla.com/uber) website.\n\n>The 100 trips need to be completed before February 15, 2025 and the deal is not available for used vehicles. Interestingly the offer is stackable with Tesla Military Purchase Program, but is not stackable with other Tesla promotions, including its Refer and Earn Program.",
