There used to be this rule to not spend more than 3x your annual income on a home. So someone earning $50k could look for homes up to $150k and be confident that they weren't taking on too much debt to handle. Nowadays that rule is practically impossible for most. Other differences include the higher cost of education and childcare that make it harder to either buy a home OR have children, let alone do both. In my opinion, this is why we see so few people that are able to accomplish those things in their twenties. I believe the plummeting birth rate is further evidence of this.",

It you wanted to compare apples to apples and get their same sized home, you are probably looking at over a million.\n\nBack then, mortgage rules were also a lot less strict.\n\nThe disparity between buying a home say back in the 80s, and buying a home now is so massive, its comical",
