Weâ€™re gambling on options, not holding it as an investment. And LUNRâ€™s initial NSN award is only $150 million based on their RFP, $4B is the potential contract value. Again, no one knows how this is going to pan out, and yâ€™all can buy whatever you want. All Iâ€™m saying is make sure what youâ€™re dumping on this stock is money youâ€™re willing to lose since itâ€™s looking like weâ€™re near the ceiling already.
