It's just the US has had insanely low interest rates for so long that it feels high. This nice bubble we've found ourselves in will absolutely cause us a lot of pain eventually. Lowering interest rates will just keep inflating the bubble.",

We've literally never in the history of this country had that much of the housing supply unavailable for market.  Foreclosures alone won't fix the problem, especially because it will just drive rents up when all those former homeowners go looking for a place to live.  Demand destruction won't fix it.  You need supply.  Either lower rates and/or fix the issues with zoning and permitting so that more land is available.\n\nIt's also highly unlikely you'd cause a ton of foreclosures with layoffs because again, the mortgage terms are \\_very\\_ favorable for those holding the homes atm.  Which were also likely locked in when home *prices* were lower too",
