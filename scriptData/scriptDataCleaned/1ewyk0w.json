  "selftext": "Figured I'd make a post out of an upvoted comment I made to save yall the 4 minutes of googling-\n\nBunch of big nasa heads formed the company seeing how space is going to be privatized. Massive potential with IM2 lander, lunar rover (1 of 3 companies in final design stage for contract), and lunar satellites. Their stock tanked after their first lander tipped over due to them forgetting to remove a landing laser safety. That is an error, but you can bet it will never happen again. They were also first to land on the moon in decades. China pressure will increase lunar budget within gov. \n\nI don't want to dox myself too much but I'm an engineer and all of their calls and interviews sound like they really fuckin know what they're doing. \n\nHere is the ceo:\nMr. Altemus is co-founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Intuitive Machines. Before founding Intuitive Machines in December 2012, Mr. Altemus was appointed to serve as the Deputy Director of NASA’s Johnson Space Center, a position he held until June 2013. Formerly Director of Engineering from July 2006 to December 2012, Mr. Altemus served as the leader and steward of Johnson Space Center’s engineering capabilities in support of NASA’s human spaceflight programs, projects, and technology activities. Mr. Altemus is also a director of Intuitive Aviation, a subsidiary of Intuitive Machines. Mr. Altemus received a B.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University, where he now serves as a member of the Engineering Advisory Board, and an M.S. in Engineering Management from the University of Central Florida. He joined NASA’s Kennedy Space Center and the Space Shuttle Program in 1989, where he held progressively more responsible positions working in Space Shuttle operations, launch, and landing activities. He served as the Columbia Reconstruction Director after the loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia on February 1, 2003. In January 2005, he joined Johnson Space Center, serving as the Deputy Director of Engineering, and was subsequently selected as Director in July 2006. Mr. Altemus is an award-winning engineer and leader. He has been presented with the Federal Engineer of the Year award from the National Society of Professional Engineers, Distinguished Alumni Award from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and Johnson Space Center’s Engineering Legacy Award.\n\n\nQ: (from u/LittleWhite0nRice)\nYou seem really knowledgeable on this industry. I've done a lot of DD on them and they seem great. But my question is: what's their future outlook for expansion? It seems like most space exploration companies are private and won't use LUNR so their consumer is NASA which can be defunded easily. Why keep spending money going to the moon? \n\nA:\nLander missions and rover are the short term. Lunar satellites are the long term. Providing *the* communications network for lunar truckstop to Mars is a pretty sci fi concept but thats how they'd go from 1-off missions and a market cap of $500M to something in the double digit $B. This plan is already in action- \"The [IM3] mission is also scheduled to carry a data relay satellite, Khon2, which it will deploy to travel to the L2 Earth-Moon libration point. The mission can also carry approximately 1000 kg of secondary payloads to lunar transfer orbit.\" This is currently scheduled for Oct 25. \n\nSource: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraft/display.action?id=IM-3-NOVA#:~:text=The%20main%20component%20of%20IM,of%20payload%20to%20the%20surface.\n\nPositions- Shares, 2, 5, and 10 dollar calls spread between Jan '24 into 2025.\n\nTLDR: LUNR is legit. WSB effect could create a squeeze, but I am in long term. I don't think there is a need to FOMO and get it right now, if there is a spike from WSB, you can wait for goldfish brains here to lose focus and for it to come down a bit and get in October or November.",

News about the newest one possibly being awarded to them are huge if true. Anyone who knows anything about space missions from an engineering standpoint knows that space is hard and a mission like their IM-1 is a resounding success. Tons of things could have gone wrong and didn't.\n\nSome highlights are them being the first private company to land on the Moon, have a working 3d printed engine of their own design that worked in space, first liquid methane/oxygen engine to work above LEO and basically their shit works and is very well designed. Their selling point is that they're cheaper than NASA. I've said the same shit 100 times on here but regards were like \"B-but the lander tipped over\". Ok regard. Company is solid, stock was trading for a steal all these months. 5 and below is a good cost average to hold this. It will pump when next launch and if contract is confirmed.

I graduated with a focus in propulsion engineering from the Prescott Arizona campus (the one that actually made money while Daytona gets all the nice things).\n\nFor context my jet propulsion professor literally wrote the book on modern airbreathing jet propulsion. My space propulsion professor was heavily involved with the Air Force during the fun cold war years. My controls professor worked for skunkworks and is why the f35 can do the freaky hovermode shit that it does. I'm stuck in IT now and getting by but I've been told by the old engineer guards that if I could get into a defense firm I'd be one of the best engineers around. Life had other opinions sadly. Knowing what I know about LUNR now I'm tempted to throw a resume at them for some sort of work and see what happens lol\n\nMy grad project was hypersonics and I found a way to make airbreathing long range hypersonics viable (but impractical). The company we worked with fucked up the test model but the backup model we rigged and used nondimensionalized figures showed the math worked and you can make an airbreathing missile travel at near ICBM range limits (as in across the entire United States in 40 minutes) in stml using fuel from the cold war all while hitting mach 5 or higher. Current ICBMs cannot do this as they go into space to have their ranges. The tech I made could potentially extend that too. It's just stupidly expensive to do but you can do it and prior to that people thought it was impossible from a heat control standpoint. I figured out how to cool the missile and get more mpg out of the fuel at the same time. You see similar cooling nowadays in the bell nozzles of rockets but I got it to work for aircraft and missile skins.\n\nI'm sure if anyone knows my project on here I just doxxed myself hard lmao. Not like the shit is secret. Raytheon wanted to get me to do intern work with them on their recently announced supersonic glide vehicles since I made a design that was man carryable, and only needed an air balloon to get enough speed to blow up a building on kinetic impact.

      "body": "\"goldfish brains\" - I'm sold.\n\nEdit: My only question about all these space plays - isn't it dangerous to compete against Musk? Highly unhinged regards that hate him - please feel free to go fap somewhere to the sound of your own voice. This isn't a discussion about Musk.\n\nSpaceX is already far head in the game. They have incredible talent and everyone wants to work there. They are already way past the initial startup stages. Their Starlink is literally funding all their experiments and testing. And even if it weren't, Big $ falls over themselves to give Musk money for his projects (even if some of them are catastrophies for the banks - like Twitter)\n\nThey are winning government contracts and NASA might have to beg them to rescue their astronauts because Boeing is a dumpster fire - that will be a huge piece of marketability for spacex.\n\nThat is my only concern - if we're talking long term\n\nWill the space accommodate more than 1 player - maybe? Probably? See: Boeing.\n\nJust some random thoughts from an imbecile online",

It was in 2003 that Altemus’s name first became widely known, back when he was working for NASA in the human spaceflight division. On Feb. 1 of that year, the space agency was shaken to its roots, after the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated on reentry, claiming the lives of its seven-person crew. Altemus was put in charge of the forensic examination following the tragedy, assembling the 85,000 pieces of Columbia debris to help determine the cause of the accident. He did his job well—so well that the surviving three shuttles were able to fly without incident for eight and a half more years before their retirement in the summer of 2011.\"\n\nThere is no team in the world better suited for this task.",
