TSMC is currently trading at the same price it was in February 2021. Meaning, nothing has been priced in for the last 3 years and definitely nothing has been priced in for the massive growth in the years to come.\n\nThe stock has just finally recovered to $140 (the price 3 years ago) and is ready for the next leg higher as they lead the AI revolution for customers like $NVDA $AAPL $AMD $TSM $MRVL etc.\n\nChina is not a threat.

Somewhat since TSM is up 35% since the q4 earnings. However, I still think there’s still room to run. Revenue growth will accelerate in coming quarters as they have guided for low to mid 20% full year growth. Operating margins have been improving in recent quarters. With their customers ARM, NVDA, AMD, AVGO, Qualcomm etc giving strong guidance, would expect TSM to reap the benefits. Still bullish.",
