In 2021, I learned this lesson the hard way with companies like Moderna and Amazon. I lost thousands on both, and several others, instead of 5x'ing and 2x'ing gains.\n\nCan it go lower? Yep. When will the market go green again? Who the fuck knows but the smart play right now is to position some cash so that you're ready to deepen the plays you like at discount prices. \n\nTldr - if you can't read 2 paragraphs you don't deserve a summary",
