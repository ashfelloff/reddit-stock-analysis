Nobody pays attention to the abuses of third-party doctrine and amount of data Google happily hands over to the DoJ. Microsoft paid fines over IE in the early 00s because they had nothing to offer the DoJ. Google has done much worse with Chrome and Android with zero repercussions for obvious DoJ conflicts of interest.¬†",

They think doing anything to silence critics through lawfare and the court of public opinion \\[largely in the news media\\] is noble, when they're doing exactly what a Communist Regime, like the CCP, does on a daily basis.
