Nobody pays attention to the abuses of third-party doctrine and amount of data Google happily hands over to the DoJ. Microsoft paid fines over IE in the early 00s because they had nothing to offer the DoJ. Google has done much worse with Chrome and Android with zero repercussions for obvious DoJ conflicts of interest. ",

You add reddit to a search, and it shows you reddit responses. That seems like the search product is working as intended.

Are the 30 companies ahead of Google on this list better investments because they have a higher revenue per employee?
