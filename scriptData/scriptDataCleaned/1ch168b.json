              "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nr/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.\n\nPolitics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.\n\nStill, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

                  "body": "That’s if you don’t have gains to offset. The maximum deduction for “net” capital losses is $3k. Net being key word. So if OP makes $20k next year, he can deduct the $17k (technically) assuming he deducts $3k this year. Also, you don’t have to use you losses the following year if you don’t want to and can instead wait to dump all your losses in a high income year to get your income under the threshold for higher cap gains rate.\n\n> Capital loss carryovers provide you the freedom to choose when to use your losses. Depending on your unique tax planning requirements, you can decide when to use the carryover to offset future capital gains or ordinary income. In a year when you expect to have more capital gains or when your tax bracket is higher, for instance, you can strategically opt to employ the carryover. Since capital loss carryovers may be carried forward indefinitely, you can also potentially improve your overall tax situation and manage your tax liabilities over time.\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital-loss-carryover.asp\n\nI was going to link the irs site but this explains it better",
