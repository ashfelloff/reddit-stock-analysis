  "selftext": "Take a look at Cassava Sciences $SAVA. After a brutal 3 years of the short and distort campaign that was initiated by a Citizens Petition (denied by FDA), SAVA is approaching its finish line of phase 3 trials with insiders extremely bullish and purchasing stocks without selling over years even at ATH.  Keep in mind SAVA does see overall blinded data from its phase 3 study, but it doesn’t take much common sense to realize if the drug works, since Alz placebo historically decline by a large margin over time.  So ask yourself what motivates the insiders to buy?  Remember the drug demonstrated efficacy in its phase2 and MOA has been confirmed by independent researchers by a sophisticated process of TR-Fret assay.\n\nSAVA had a successful cash raise via warrants and sits on a massive amount of cash (200ish Million) with no debt. There are only 7-8 months to go until the first readout of its phase 3 trial and the share price still sits at a rock bottom price in the $20s because of the vicious shorting. \n\nAlzheimer’s market is massive hence called the holy grail of medical breakthroughs.  100 billion market for a successful Alz drug is well within the realms of possibility. Happy to break down the numbers in the comments.  You have to dig deep for this one and  past all the FUD.  But remember the ones who bash SAVA are the same usual suspects or whom I like to call snakes of wallstreet (not wolves bc that would be a compliment to these vile untalented individuals).\n\nPositions: 6,000 shares in Fidelity and more in other accounts. Screenshot below in comments. Not financial advise do your own DD.  For me I’m bullish af",

Look at the Clarity-AD study which was actually a positive trial. SAVA patients are more likely simply tolerating the drug enough to roll over hence the high attrition rate. If anything extremely clean safety would make me think that trades with efficacy and ph3 will fail on the primary endpoint\n\nI’d look at ABOS or CGTX targeting the a-beta oligomers with oral drugs, those at least are far more externally validated than SAVA’s drug MOA, and trading far cheaper granted they are still in ph2. SAVA at a >$1B mkt cap is not an attractive risk/reward imo",

No moving goalposts, no stratification, no worrying about mild/moderate. \n\nOn average there was virtually no cognitive decline in the study population over 12 months. That's it. That's the headline. That's the topline data result. If those results are replicated in phase 3 it will be ground-breaking.\n\nIt's not definitive because there was no placebo. Okay, that's fine. No one is trying to claim efficacy proof or FDA approval on that data. BUT, compared to expected declines from other studies' placebo arms, or as compared to a very loosely defined external control arm from ADNI data, it's an incredibly suggestive result.\n\nAnd there's no scientific issue with making that comparison. An external control arm from a statistical population of historic disease progression is completely approriate for this kind of disease. Not for FDA approval of course; but as a matter of interest, absolutely.\n\nThere was *also* virtually no cognitive decline for another 12-months in the total population from the extension/continuation study, participants of which came from a subset of the original 12-month study population. That's also noteworthy. Again, no moving goalposts, no massaging data.\n\nMaybe some concerns about how that population subset was selected, and that's fine, if that's your concern, discount the 24-month total result. That still does NOTHING to take away from the original 12-month result in that case.\n\nLastly a 6-month placebo withdrawal portion that, as I mentioned, wasn't conclusive about anything. There was no statistically meaningful difference between the placebo and treatment arm for that portion. Okay, but what that *means* is subjective, for any number of obvious reasons. You and I have both offered alternative subjective interpretations of what that could mean. Neither has sufficient data to support it.\n\n> This drug has never been tested vs a placebo\n\nDuh. That's why there are two huge phase 3 trials ongoing right now.\n\nThe entire point of this argument is, based on the phase 2 results, is the market's current <5% estimate that those placebo controlled phase 3 results will confirm the phase 2 results a fair prediction? Or is this stock undervalued? Plenty of people think that is an extremely pessimistic prediction considering the phase 2 results on display.",

Alas like all of the IV antibodies, the side effects are a major headwind, like brain swelling. Some past IV treatments like Aduhelm were approved, then pulled, because of not enough benefit to warrant the side effects. If oral tablet disease modifiers pan out, I reckon the cost-prohibitive IV antibodies may fall to second line at best.\n\n[Alzheon](https://alzheon.com/pipeline/alzheon-alz-801/)'s [Phase 3](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04770220) readout likely by year end. Oral tablet, tolerated. An interesting approach to focus on the minority of patients who are homozygous for APOE4. This year, was confirmed that two APOE4 genes isn't just a risk, it is the cause for those patients, with Alzheimer's functionally guaranteed by certain ages. So could just take genetic test, if two APOE4 copies, take their medicine in advance. Private company though, so can't invest.\n\nWhich brings to Cassava ($SAVA), my horse in this race:\n\n* For all Alzheimer's patients, not just the few who are APOE4 homozygotes\n* Oral tablet, so cheap enough to produce, allowing wide Medicare coverage without breaking the bank\n* Side-effects minimal\n* First [Phase 3](https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04994483) readout end of 2024/start of 2025\n* Families in the open label choosing to extend treatment\n* Insider buys, no sells, notably Francisco Partners' Sanford Robertson holding the line\n* Possible mechanism demonstration with TR-FRET experiment\n* The hubbub was with preclinical stuff, my impression is that phase 3 readout is so close, that CUNY will just wait until the Phase 3 readout\n* Cash in the bank through to phase 3 readout\n* FDA gave Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) so that if Phase 3 is good, no more hurdles\n* Political slamdunk for the ages of people who vote, to have an oral Antibody treatment for the politician in office who approved it\n* My impression is that results for simufilam will be best for maintenance of cognition in mild Alzheimer's cases, which is OK for a tablet with minimal side-effects. I don't think going to bring back a brain that is already profoundly damaged\n\nIn my opinion, there are alas no other medicines ($AVXL, etc) that could be on a pharmacy shelf in the near term. Reality is that need large scale, US-based, clinical trials.\n\nDisclosure: Long $SAVA, $XBI. Not an advisor and not your advisor. Good luck in your trades.",

The placebo arm of the withdrawal study was not \"an actual placebo\". That's the basic problem with that design study. It was always going to be murky because of that simple fact.\n\nThe CMS didn't prove that the drug works, because there was no stat sig difference. But it also didn't show that the drug *doesn't* work, because the placebo group is in no way representative of an actual untreated control population given the prior 12-months of treatment.\n\nIF there had been a stat sig difference, that would have been interesting. As it is, it's merely inconclusive to EITHER side of the argument.",

But the evidence is supporting very little chance and that the drug doesn’t work. It’s possible it does. But there’s no evidence it does. With the author being retracted and those limited cases showing no effect, and the normal ad drug success rate under 1%, it is very very unlikely it works. The bet on this is drug is actually WORSE than a totally new ad drug because a drug that works would show better p2 results in at least one of those two scenarios in most cases, so you’ve seen ‘the river’ and it’s worse than what a working drug would usually show.",

There's tons of clinical evidence already and despite what the bulls will tell you, it's bad. That's not including all of the other negative indicators. Some details of relevance:\n\n* When patients on the drug for a long time WENT OFF the drug, there was no statistical difference in those on and off. That's the only time they've compared people from the same pool as being on or off the drug and been able to show efficacy. They didn't show efficacy. It probably does not work. The company of course in sketchy biotech fashion declared success since their investors don't really understand things like statistics or biology or FDA approvals. The other \"efficacy\" the bulls cite is in the absence of a placebo and thus is scientifically garbage. One single best test was an absolute failure for them.\n* The company has been around nearly 20 years. The last time, they had an opiate and went to war with the FDA about it while hyping the stock, eventually getting shut out and costing investors tons of money. Then they began the hype cycle again with this company. In those 2 decades, they've paid execs an unbelievable amount of money (including 9 figures in unpaid but earned stock-price based bonuses) despite never delivering a working drug. Every time they start running out of money, they hype to retail investors and sell some shares to keep it going.\n* Company was at some point under CRIMINAL investigation as well as some number of civil and regulatory 3 letter agency investigations for their alleged shenanigans. There's been no update on that, so as far as anyone knows, the criminal investigation by the feds is still going. There were also SEC investigations. Since all that, they've stripped all sorts of info off their website, like magical biomarkers that defied human reason and got the hype going in the first place.\n* Lab of the main investigator was searched by at least one federal agency per FOIA releases \n* Main investigator has seen numerous academic papers many of which were adjacent or involving this retracted by journals.\n* Main investigator was subject to a research misconduct investigation. It was quite bad. The conclusion was leaked, though never finalized: [https://www.science.org/content/article/damning-fda-inspection-report-undermines-positive-trial-results-possible-alzheimer-s](https://www.science.org/content/article/damning-fda-inspection-report-undermines-positive-trial-results-possible-alzheimer-s)\n* They sued a bunch of critics and the shorts. Always a flag for a really sketchy company. The suit is in the process of being dismissed.. it didn’t help that they had the misfortunate of drawing a magistrate judge who is also a scientist with a biology background (lol), who found the short comments were not defamatory but rather were reasonable scientific debate. Their various critics include such horrid people as nobel laureates in biology, but according to sava longs, they are all greedy short sellers who will go to any length to torpedo this wonder drug even though if it was a wonder drug said short sellers would make a lot more going long. There have been a variety of very compelling short reports on them which you can search and read. The longs will tell you that these can't be trusted at all, but anything longs say is 100% trustworthy. The longs are among the most elite of people who can believe anything, anything at all, if it fits what they want to hear. Exceptional people, really.\n* Very few if any researchers outside the investor group and the company believe their theory of Alzheimer's. There are no other companies pursuing drug development towards this target either, including the alleged evil big pharma that have refrained from investing in them.\n* They constantly p value hack their press releases - lots of dropped patients, they pick cutoffs for things like mild and moderate to show efficacy, etc. It's sketchy by biotech standards. I'm only slightly exaggerating that they'd report a stat like 'people who have 2 vowels in their first name and prefer carnitas tacos to beef burritos had a 30% slowing of mental decline!' if they could find it. If you mess with the cutoffs you can make anything look decently good...\n\nThe stock is suitable for nothing other than day trading up and down and seems semi-glued to $20. It's possibly a good thing to sell vol on - I personally think they crash and burn on p3 this year, but the price wont go a lot under 10 because management is great at shoveling dung to morons.\n\nVery long term it goes to zero because this management team cant execute and the drug appears to not work. I'm sure they'll make tons of money personally on the way though. And options dealers will make the most of all.\n\nI don't have any positions in it and haven't in quite some time. If I was to trade it now, I'd probably just use a short-vol strategy. If I thought P3 end was imminent, I'd probably consider selling call spreads or buying put spreads down to $10 (because I think the CEO is very skilled at hype and would be able to take a total failure and convince his investors its a win).\n\nAnd this is all of course opinion because they sue people who don't say that. All opinions. Go do your own research. This stock sucks.",

Or could suggest the prior 12 month dose of the drug has disease-modifying effects that linger for at least 6 more months following the final dose.\n\nThe placebo withdraw group had an ADAS-Cog decline of 1 point. The expected decline for a completely untreated placebo group (as per other studies, etc.) for 6 months would be (very very roughly) 4 points.\n\nFundamentally this aspect of the study was too short and too small to statistically support ANY conclusion, for or against, the drug.\n\n> they had an opiate and went to war with the FDA\n\nI mean, they had an opiate drug that *worked*. They fought the FDA to get it approved and released. Ultimately, they lost. No one is surprised that the FDA didn't want another opiod pain killer coming to market in the midst of the very public opiod crisis, but it's weird to suggest SAVA did anything except work in the best interest of their shareholders to get Remoxy, a working drug, approved for use. Your argument is that they fought TOO hard?\n\n> Every time they start running out of money, they hype to retail investors and sell some shares to keep it going\n\nNo insider has sold shares since the company became Cassava Sciences in 2018. Not once. In fact I don't think an insider has sold since the inception of the company in 2013.\n\nAs for dilution, they've had share offerings to raise capital as needed. Literally the most common thing in the world for a fledging corp in every single market sector, ever.\n\nIn no cases could you reasonably argue they had \"hype cycles\" prior; the offerings were generally attached to decent stock performance as a result of material findings in the form of trial data releases.\n\nYou are trying to make the most boring and normal form of corporate fundraising in existence appear nefarious somehow.\n\n> Company was at some point under CRIMINAL investigation as well as some number of civil and regulatory 3 letter agency investigations for their alleged shenanigans. There's been no update on that\n\nReally? Please point to the official statement from any of these three letter agencies or organizations where the company has been under investigation for anything, criminal or otherwise?\n\nThe SEC, DOJ, and FDA have never, not once, not ever, made any formal investigation known to the public, made any formal charge or allegation against Cassava Sciences of any form of wrong-doing, or even said anything in private to Cassava Science management to suggest this.\n\nIt's also been almost 3 years since Cassava initially indicated they were cooperating with any and all agency requests, and we STILL have heard nothing from any of these agencies about Cassava or its potential wrong-doing.\n\nAnd do keep in mind, a few months after Cassava announced their cooperation with DOJ and SEC investigators, the DOJ and SEC DID happen to announce their wide spread, ongoing, many months old investigation into illegal short selling practices.\n\nWe literally have no official confirmation of why the SEC and DOJ were talking to Cassava Sciences.\n\n> Lab of the main investigator was raided by the feds\n\nFDA inspections are not \"raids\". They are not even particularly uncommon. And the result of correcting the errors identified by the FDA inspection findings resulted in no material change to the data in the report in question.\n\nIt's also irrelvant because this is talking about a single 13 year old study that has nothing to do with the promising phase 2 trial data or the ongoing phase 3 trial data collection.\n\n> Main investigator has seen numerous academic papers many of which were adjacent or involving this retracted\n\nThe 13 year old paper everyone seems to care about was never retracted. Dr. Wang has had some other papers retracted, sure (and some of those retractions were since reversed). None of those papers have anything to do with this drug.\n\n> Main investigator was subject to a research misconduct investigation\n\nKey takeaways from the leaked, never finalized investigation are that there is not a single mention of fraud or data fabrication, nor a single instance where Dr. Wang violated data retention or handling procedures in place at CUNY.\n\nYou also forgot to mention that the investigation wasn't just \"not finalized\", it was formally *halted* by CUNY and followed by a new investigation *into the original investigation process* because there was sufficient concern over the entire process around the original investigation.\n\n> Very few if any researchers outside the investor group and the company believe their theory of Alzheimer's\n\nFor the longest time they didn't even HAVE a theory. Took a while to suggest how FLNA might affect this process at all.\n\nBut your argument is \"because they don't know how it works, evidence showing it works cannot be trusted\".\n\nThere are hundreds of drugs that have clear statisical efficacy even though we have no idea exactly how or why they work.\n\n> There are no other companies pursuing drug development towards this target either\n\nHow could you possibly know this? We have no idea what internal candidate drugs are being scoured for early trials at pharma corps. Certainly the monoclonal treatments are dead-ending, with the latest FDA rejection.\n\nCassava holds multiple patents on FLNA, the biopharms can't just manifest a new FLNA-affecting drug out of thin air. They could be chewing through potential patent-free candidates right now and we'd never know until they find something noteworthy and start announcing trials.\n\n> They constantly p value hack their press releases - lots of dropped patients, they pick cutoffs for things like mild and moderate to show efficacy\n\nThe phase 2 trial data stands alone with no stratification. As a whole, the performance of the complete trial population (mild and moderate) in aggregate is already hugely promising and would blow any existing treatments out of the water if replicated in phase 3.\n\nThe only reason anyone cares to dig further is because the improvement in mild cases specifically is even just so much better than that.\n\nRegardless, the phase 3 trials are stratified mild and moderate. There will be no statistical hangups in their ability to pull out data for the different groups.\n\nYou'll have to provide specific examples about dropped patients. Never seen that for phase 2 stuff. There were some attempts to tease meaningful data out of the placebo/withdraw CMS, but it's pretty clear there simply wasn't enough time or numbers in that study to conclusively say anything.\n\nOr are you literally still harping about the way Dr. Wang excluded outliers in his original 13 year old study? Which, upon correction, made no material change to the data?",

They cited lack of NIH funding as a consequence of short activity in one lawsuit. They alluded to investigations in shareholder disclosures. The sequencing of criminal and civil was discussed in one of the filings I think. They’ve as far as I know never directly denied the criminal investigation. \n\n- It's true insiders haven't sold, but they have gotten very above market compensation as well as a stock price based bonus program that paid out like 5 or 6 m, but has earned in a bit more than 200m (To be paid at a later date when the company liquidity is more). We also don't know if they turned on borrow of their shares to shorts, in which case, they are getting astounding amounts of fees through the controversy. \n\n- Of a lot of my points, you have a lot of legal technical or irrelevant rebuttals. Common sense would suggest there are enormous problems here. For example, the idea the research misconduct report isn't fair game because it's an unapproved leak? That's hilarious. It's still the report!!! and it's damning!\n\n- You can't patent a target. You can patent a set of compounds for a target. The peptide segment they are going after in FLNA is quite short and would have lots of possible matches. Of course, Simufilam doesn't even seem to bind it according to third party research, but that's a small matter isn't it?\n\n- the p2 has not shown evidence of efficacy. To the extent it might, it’s shown the opposite with the initial biomarkers by Lund and the withdrawal study. Both of those queue up a p3 fail. \n\nThe dropped patients are littered throughout the myriad press releases many of which you can't find without web archive any more. They do this as a matter of course.\n\n  \nHere's my prediction, and feel free to mark this remind me:\n\nP3 will complete. It will fail primary endpoints. Remi will express excitement (despite the total failure) and success at the a) safety and b) post-hoc sub-group analysis showing compelling efficacy.  For example, people with mild AD who are between 55 and 70 and female but not this or that race. Or something. And you longs will believe EVER WORD OF IT. He may also discover a new indication. It’ll be whatever is currently hot if he does. \n\nThen hype the ongoing second phase 3. Stock will go to single digits then rebound to like $10. You'll see...\n\nAll opinions here!

The confidence range of difference is -2 to 1. In other words, it's 30% or so likely that the drug was more harmful than helpful even!  Most likely, no effect.\n\nYou mention placebo... there's never been a placebo controlled trial with completed results for efficacy for this drug. They have a trial group, and compared that to typical AD decline, but you just can't do that. AD is a very diverse disease with different trials showing different placebo decline rates.  They also re-test adas-cog pretty frequently which can cause practice effect.\n\nHendrix ran stats, including the finding that the withdrawal... was not statistically significant.\n\nI love the logic of you longs.

So let’s compare apples to apples it’s clear that the bar is set so low for success..now about the stat sig….this was just an extension of the ph2 study with a extremely small number of participants as openly admitted by SAVA….not to mention if the variance of the 2 groups in CMS study was large then it would indicate it is not actually a disease modifying drug since the placebo arm was still receiving the drug for 12 months prior to withdrawal..so the narrow difference is more meaningful and “consistent with a disease modifying effect”- Hendrix….the level of distortion you push is deceitful as your claim that you have nothing invested.\n\nThe defamation case has yet to conclude so really no point in arguing about it.  It may get dismissed it may not…it just shows Cassava is serious about their work and has nothing to hide. On the contrary, the shorts want this dismissed at all costs to prevent discovery.",

Execs get very large pay packages for where the company is at, similar to the luxury cult leaders enjoy\n4) various ideas underpinning which are not accepted by the mainstream of the field even a little bit. Most of the other alt theories have openness at least, for example microbiome theory of ad or immune dysfunction theory - not the dominant theory but everyone agrees it’s plausible. Analogy would be most religious cults have religious ideas that are very specific to them and not variations of broader movements",

Not going to get into the weeds of those issues.\n\nLooking ONLY at the science -- the P2 trial data, safety, and drug MoA -- this company is probably undervalued.\n\nWe know that in a [12-month 200pt open label trial of mild and moderate Alzheimer's](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-announces-positive-top-line-clinical-results), cognitive decline was virtually halted. Looking into the details it actually gets even better than that for mild pts, but regardless, that's the topline headline.\n\nThat's extraordinarily suggestive. It's suggestive but not conclusive because it was not a placebo controlled trial; it wasn't designed to show efficacy. [Evaluated against external control arms](/r/wallstreetbets/comments/149jva2/cassava_sciences_sava_cms_data_prediction/), the P2 data for this drug is absolutely phenomenal. But again, suggestive, not conclusive, if we take random placebo control as our only arbiter of proof (and resonably so).\n\nIt's important to mention that while random placebo control is obviously the gold standard, using external control arms, especially for degenerative diseases with consistent predictable progression (such as Alzheimer's) is [perfectly sound science](https://medically.gene.com/global/en/unrestricted/neuroscience/AAIC-2022/aaic-2022-presentation-delmar-using-an-external-control.html) and not at all the kind of fringe/junk science some people would try to imply.\n\nCertainly the P3 trials are not designed in a way to leave room for doubt; [they are large, expensive, randomized double blinded placebo controlled trials](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/cassava-sciences-initiates-phase-3-efficacy-trial-simufilam), and will definitively prove or disprove the efficacy of this drug to the highest standard with NO wiggle room.\n\nThe company is very clearly not trying to dodge a definitive answer with its P3 trial designs.\n\nWe know the drug is incredibly safe and has [none of the brain bleed issues associated with current AD treatment options](https://www.cassavasciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mri-data-suggest-simufilam-not-associated-amyloid-related).\n\nLastly, we know the drug's MoA is real insomuch as it is biochemically active and has a [real, proven, measurable impact on a specific protein binding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37762230/).\n\nI mention this only because it was a common (and now disproven) accusation of the early science that there was no proof this drug wasn't simply inert. The science now shows conclusively, with [independent verification](https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0090/ea0090oc7.5), that is not the case.",

          "body": "> the results are mixed at best, so calling it a cure is a stretch. It is best described as a treatment to delay the speed of AD onset\n\nPositioning the phase 2 results as some kind of mixed outcome is incredibly misleading. Halting cognitive decline for (a minimum of) 12 months is ground-breaking. Nitpicking over the \"it's not literally a cure\" portion of that is disingenous.\n\nIf the phase 2 data is confirmed by ongoing phase 3 trials, those results will literally be orders of magnitude better at treating AD than ANY existing approved OR trial drug.\n\n> the treatment developed cassava has shown limited statistical significance over placebo in limiting the neurodegeneration during continuation studies\n\nTrue but meaningless, as I'm sure you know. Your phrasing implies there was ongoing neurodegeneration in the continuation study, when in fact what it showed was both the treatment and placebo arms had the same LACK of degeneration that was indicated in the original study.\n\nIn other words, the lack of stat sig was because the placebo arm performed WELL, not because the treatment group performed POORLY. This can easily be used to make the counter-argument that it potentially showed Simufilam is a disease-modifying drug with lingering effect (since the placebo arm had just finished 12 months of Simufilam treatment).\n\nThe results can ultimately spin positive OR negative. Fundamentally the continuation study was too short and probably too small to show anything useful and is ultimately inconclusive for either side's argument.\n\n> cofounder and developer of the drug has been actually investigated by the FDA for falsifying data\n\nThat's a stretch bordering on a lie. The FDA has NEVER investigated Wang for falsifying data. Multiple 3rd parties have alleged that, but in every event where the FDA has looked, they've never confirmed those allegations.\n\nAt MOST you can say the FDA inspection cited Wang's CUNY lab for various procedural issues that should be improved. *Nothing* in that inspection implied or alleged data falsification, merely shoddy practice. (That is also true of the leaked CUNY investigation, which was not only never formally released but ultimately was formally *denounced* with a follow-up ethical investigation *into the investigation* being formally announced).\n\nWhich I fully admit is not great, but not nearly as unique an issue to Wang or the CUNY lab as it might first seem. FDA inspections routinely come out with important findings and making recommendations for procedural improvements.\n\nCritically, NONE of those issues have ANYTHING to do with the phase 2 trial data, the drug's safety/MoA data, or the ongoing phase 3 trials.\n\n> but who even knows if the data is real at this point\n\nTo use that inspection of Wang's CUNY lab to imply Cassava has somehow managed to orchestrate a multi-year conspiracy to undermine data collected independently from dozens of clinical trial labs used by virtually every single drug company in the US, under a trial design and process that's not only industry standard but also pre-approved by the FDA, is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nIt would call into question the validity of clinical trial data collected in virtually every drug trial undertaken in the last decade. It's an absurd implication to make.",
