Much like how brokerages issue a 1099-DIV whenever you make ANY profit from dividends, you'll have a form generated for you, and it has to be reported by you and the brokerage per law. The IRS doesn't care about losses because it will reduce your liability to a certain amount. But if you make any money, you bet your sweet regarded ass the IRS wants a piece of it.",
