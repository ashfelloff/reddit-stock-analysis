          "body": "the overall concept of options is not that complex. at a very basic level, an options contract is an agreement where you have the \"option\" to buy (calls) or sell (puts) shares of a stock at some price X in the future. you make money based on how far the price moves beyond X in the direction you want. the contracts can also be traded on the market, just like shares, and their current value depends on things like the price of the stock and how much time is left on the contract\n\n\nhowever the nuances are very deep and can't be explained in a comment. you should read more on somewhere like investopedia because there are a dozen caveats and things to learn. good luck",
