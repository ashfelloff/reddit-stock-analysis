  "score": 151,
  "selftext": "I just looked it up and something like 21% of shares are being shorted. Share price is down more than 30% in the last 3 months.\n\nTbh I don’t actually understand why shorting is even a practice.  It seems contrary to the entire spirit of investing in companies. \n\nSince I don’t understand why it’s even a practice, I certainly don’t understand why this company is being targeted.  I can understand people selling their shares if they don’t think the stock is worth anything, but not shorting it.  Did they have some bad publicity? Is there some anti-donut conspiracy?  ",

The great thing about the place was that you would just go on impulse when you see the red sign on because fresh hot doughnuts are so much better than the ones that are hours old. But now if you do that it's $2 and whenever I go the place looks abandoned. I don't know if they can pull out of it but I do think they have a problem and trying to just copy the Dunkin model by selling their stuff in grocery stores with elaborate toppings isn't going to work. It just seems like KK has forgotten what made them great. ",

Earnings would have an effect, but once they are priced in with expectation? Slow turtle pace and just trade near expected multiples. That's the spirit of investing, but you are just not noticing the flip side.\n\nEarnings will miss, or be bad, at some point. Without shorting you cannot invest in that direction, you can only lose because you bought too high and must sell at a loss or wait for earnings, news, or some other change to bring the price back up hopefully. Selling should continue to the new multiple, but it will 100% rely on FOMO like normal. It will not move like normal as it does now though since there are much less shares being sold, since the only sellers have to be those who bought anticipating the price would rise and must accept the loss or diamond hand. It's easier to diamond hand when you see the multiple not get broken down crazily to like half the expectation (ex. 3-6x instead of 9-10x)\n\nSo if you want the spirit of investing, it's not in the stock market anymore really. You will need to look for other opportunities where there is not a short option available.

Dunkin is more of a coffee place that also sells donuts and other food, Krispy Kreme makes donuts and they also have dogshit coffee. \n\nIn a time where people are more health conscious than ever, they're not gorging on donuts as much.
