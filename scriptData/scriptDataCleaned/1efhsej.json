Thought there was more risk to the downside so went further out to 5380/5365 for the puts, which allowed about a 1.5% drop before going in the money. The wing condors were set up to help finance an upward roll of the calls if they got tested. Luckily the 5487 resistance held for the 3rd straight day and I kept all the premium",
