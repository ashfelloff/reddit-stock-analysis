When NVDA was $400, everyone thought $1000 was a pipe dream, so the $1000 strike calls were dirt cheap.\n\nOn a 2x ETF* the stock can go up 200% that year, then crash 45% in one day and you lose everything. LEAPs compound better and are safer IMO. I don’t fuck with leveraged products.\n\nIf you buy shares on margin, you are going to be paying 5% interest every month on the loan.\n\nIf I buy $100k of leaps, it’s a sunk cost. They can’t margin call my shares, I don’t pay interest fees. If the play doesn’t work out, max pain is $100k loss. But most likely I would sell and recoup at 50% loss first.",
