Officials say they’re more confident that inflation is headed to the two per cent target, and said it’s “reasonable to expect further cuts,” if progress continues.\n\n> “With further and more sustained evidence underlying inflation is easing, monetary policy no longer needs to be as restrictive,” Macklem said in prepared remarks.",

It deteriorates rapidly and in a very steep line.\n\nThe economy is only doing well because very few people are affected by high interest rate right now. You have homeowners refinancing their mortgage in 2020/2021. Corporates did the same for their debt. That means these guys aren't feeling the effect of high rates at all until they have to move house, or borrow money to expand. So you have a few percentage of lower income people with credit card debt who's feeling this high rates and are completely miserable, and you have a big chunk of upper middle class or 1% who have a ton of cash and don't need to borrow any money. They're even gaining interest money from their cash.\n\nThis weird situation makes the economy even more prone to suddenly reverse its strength, because if you do get hit by high rates, it hurts a lot. For example, if a homeowner moves for whatever reason, his mortgage would double/triple. Think about how much discretionary money he would have to cut for that. Because of this, everyone is delaying moving/borrowing money as much as possible, but it will have to happen eventually. The Fed is hoping to cut rate before that day comes.",

But shelter, in the US, had historically ran at 3.5% prior to COVID. So if you exclude that component, the inflation target for the US would be closer to 1%. I'm assuming Canada would be even lower, because Canada has a much worse housing affordability issue than the US.\n\nI see economist doing this data cherry picking all the time to make the data looks better than it is. In 2022 and 2023, insurances were not moving at all and contributed to downward pressure on inflation. No one brought that up when they were celebrating the inflation fighting progress. Now that it suddenly hiked prices to catch up for the lost revenue over the last 3 years, every economist dismissed that as idiosyncratic factor. It's like playing whack-a-mole with inflation.",
