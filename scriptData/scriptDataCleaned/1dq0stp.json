Lower interest means higher profit, and lower inflation drives lower rates.\n\nThat being said, none of that logic applies to cash rich companies like NVDA - but logic is simply out the window there. Mark my words, a PCE below 2.6% tomorrow and you’ll be having extra spicy tendies for breakfast at 9:31AM tomorrow. \n\nMy money is where my mouth is. 800 shares of TQQQ and another 800 of NVDA locked and loaded. I normally sell weeklies on TQQQ for a strike about 6% OTM - just a little premium so my wife’s boyfriend has extra gas money, but not this week….TQQQ could realistically flirt with $80 tomorrow.",
