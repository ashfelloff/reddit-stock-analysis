I read those as October 24th… yess you have indeed been rawdogged. \n\nBut with 545 left… the Chinese market just dipped 😅\n\nToday clov went up like 20% \n3$ calls at .05 at open went to .65 with $150 at open u could have gotten 1800 at close. \n\nPdd is also going high. I ve been recently making money on that. But it just dipped from 155 to 142 aftermarket climbing back up. Maybe permanently maybe not. \n\nI think you can make a significant amount back in this Chinese market if you risk it all in a put or call on one of these Shanghai specials. \n\nBut don’t quote me if I’m wrong",
