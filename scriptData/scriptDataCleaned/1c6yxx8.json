If you don’t view a stock price as the result of a bunch of probability curves then you are thinking too simply about the market. \n\nTiming also matters. The price is not only a function of *if* something will happen but also how long it will take since you need to discount future cash flows into the present.\n\nI personally believe that these things will eventually be the future and AI will be the core business of TSMC in the future. But clearly the pre-market is showing that investors are adjusting expectations in the near-term towards a different direction. Granted it’s pre-market and only around -3% so I doubt a big day either direction.",

Auto chip demand is now forecasted to shrink versus expand. Smartphone sales slowdown is dragging on their smartphone chip line as well. \n\n* Investing **tons** of capital into advanced technologies for mainly the AI space. \n\n* Geopolitical risks remain high. \n\nIn summary, they are doing well to transition the business to satisfy AI chip demand. However, areas of their core business today are seeing softening demand. This puts TSMC in a highly precarious position as continued AI demand means dominance while any slip could spell disaster given the high capital expenditures and receding core business areas in smartphone/auto.",
