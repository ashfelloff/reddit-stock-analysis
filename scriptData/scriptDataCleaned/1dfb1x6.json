Portfolio was down 70% after burning away profits playing weeklies and revenge trading. Made a couple of Gs from guessing earnings correctly (META,SHOP puts; GOOGL,APPL,ORCL calls, etc.) but lost double that with weeklies and 0DTEs.  \nTaking this win as a blessing and a sign to stop trading options for the time being - regards.",
