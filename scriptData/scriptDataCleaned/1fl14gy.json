He had to slam on the brakes really hard, so getting back on the gas, may lead to a Skid out of the Apex. I'm not quite convinced of a Bull Case any more. Why? We've been seeing rolling recessions hit every industry, so if you were smart you just had to buy the dip as each got hit. If the Fed was actually instrumental in coordinating it like that, then soft Landing indeed. The only industry that hasn't had a full recession is Residential Real Estate, which takes a few years to see the effects.",
