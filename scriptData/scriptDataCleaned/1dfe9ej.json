There is nothing inherently different about a bank that would have it priced at lower multiples. The reason banks are priced at lower multiples is because they grow at lower multiples.\n\nIf JPM was growing at 40% YOY instead of 10%, they'd have a way higher PE. It's all about growth here. Banks are well-established and grow very slowly. It's the same reason Coke has a PE of 25 and Celcius has a PE of 70. One has already established its growth, and the other is growing at warp speed.\n\nI think the idea that every sector is priced differently has some truth, but again, it's not that we've all decided x industry only deserves y multiple.
