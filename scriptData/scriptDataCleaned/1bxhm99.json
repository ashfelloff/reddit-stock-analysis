  "selftext": "\n\n While everyone is waiting for FED to cut rates, I'm seeing it otherwise. Forget cuts, we might be looking at rate hikes later this year. Rising commodity prices are going to bring back scorching inflation. \n\n  \n**Common myth:** Interest rates control commodity prices  \n\n**Reality**: Commodity prices govern interest rates. Central banks are just data observers and just follow what the commodity prices and hence inflation tells them. What if the inflation still keeps rising? They just follow.\n\nAnd I understand that consumer demand is low.  \nInviting opinions from the sub.\n",

This post isn’t impossible at all, I think it’s possible rate hike talks come back onto the table. One thing is for sure though, this whole cuts are coming in July talk is a joke. If we see cuts it will be September or later and will be because the economy is crashing/banks are failing level of failure. \n\n\nFor the record I don’t think we’re going to have that, but that’s why I think we could see inflation climbing and potentially more hikes",

Without lowering the interest rate, they won’t be able to put downward pressure on the biggest item in the PCE.  This will have a devastating impact on the second part of the Fed’s mandate - unemployment.\n\nUE data has been interesting. Immigration has been helping to bolster the bottom line here while wages have held pretty solid.  More older people who have left have stayed out but they’ve been replaced by a lot of part time work.\n\nThe Fed is not going to be able to have its cake and eat it. If they want to get to 2% inflation, UE will be over 4%. If they want 4% UE they will need to live with inflation over 2%.  Based on comments so far I think most of them are inclined to live with higher inflation to keep the UE around 4% so long as the wage growth stays consistent.

This opinion is coming from someone who is a Philosophy major in university right now. Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha will have to deal with the phasing out of jobs as we know it as AI takes over, granted this may take 20 years or more. My opinion: finance will be phased out and next to worthless, and we return to a barter-and-trade system of producing goods and providing services in the next 50 years. Every meaningful career will be taken over by AI by 2080 for sure, and that’s assuming that something beyond AI like a self-conscious AI isn’t developed, in which case humanity as we know it is finished. When AI takes over all careers, no more money will be left and the consumer ceases to exist. Even the top 1% will not survive it, money loses value without someone to purchase things. The future will not consist of a wealth disparity, it will consist of a talent disparity… which I think is ultimately 100x more fair. That’s just my schizo rant.",
