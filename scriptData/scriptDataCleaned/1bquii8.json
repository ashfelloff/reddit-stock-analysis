Say you have $100k invested, and achieve a 0% return for 50 years. Then your final balance will be ~$36k. Now ofc, it’s unrealistic to assume a 0% return. Just remember that inflation rates and few percentages cut into your total return. E.g. if the market return 10%, with inflation being 3% and your expense ratio being 2%, then your net return is only 5 percent. You are missing on 2% compounded at 50 years, which added up to a lot over time. Basically what this graph is saying is that you can’t control your market return, or inflation, but you can control the expense ratio. So make sure your expense ratio is as low as you can find. \n\nP.s. ‘resetting’ your fund won’t change anything because the expense ratio is always a percentage.",

Like, an account that returns 1% a year and compounds yearly will ultimately make more than 1% times the number of years invested, because the 1% return from the first year gets added to the principle for every subsequent year, etc. What we're looking at here is the negative effect of compounding fees. A 1% fee in year 1 reduces the principle for every future year, ultimately eating into gains by a lot more than 1%.",
