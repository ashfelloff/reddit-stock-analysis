Living behind the dumpster behind the store will eliminate the need to pay rent. As an added bonus, picking through the food that gets thrown out will eliminate the need to buy food. No need for a car or gas living in walking distance. Assuming that all the remaining pay after taxes goes to pay off debt, the full balance could be paid off in under 56 years!",
