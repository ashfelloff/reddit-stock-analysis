We wont really know if it's just one of them or a few or all of them causing the shift in money flows into different sectors.\n\nNikkei news is usually good for giving the heads up in sentiment that a Japan cut is coming as they know the amount of money flowing through.\n\nThere has been a bunch of profit taking on tech and pulling capital from AI as investors deflate that bubble after being tired of waiting for realized gains to appear.\n\nThere are people starting to price in a recession now. No more humming and hawing about if there will be one like the past 2 years. Just look at Buffet, he didn't just sell Apple he also sold a lot of his beloved Coke and OXY. So he is either getting ready to die or he is pricing in a crash and/or recession.\n\nYellen is messing up treasury yields by selling tons of short term ones and people are still flocking into them, so that is also very telling.\n\nThe only reason I can rationalize why JPOW still did not sound like a rate cut had confidence for Sept is that the banks are kinda fucked and a cut would just amplify that effect.",
