They're undoubtedly a growing and fairly promising company, but a month ago they announced that growth had slowed by like 20% and their market cap has since halved. I'm holding a couple of leaps and buying the dip, but I think there's a lot riding on their next earnings report, so anything less than spectacular news might spell big trouble for leaps.",

I go to the gym 5 days a week and literally every single person there drinks them. even my gym buddy who is a diehard monster enjoyer has started drinking celsius instead. I personally have been drinking them for over a year I switched from bang and I never feel the same crash/shit feeling from the other drinks. No energy drink is going to be super healthy but they are definitely way better than the rest. I remember I spent a day searching every ingredient in them and confirming with one of my chemistry major upper grad friends bc I was super skeptical of energy drinks. The valuation is high but I still think it can rally further and compete with monster. It just needs to get the same advertisment.",
