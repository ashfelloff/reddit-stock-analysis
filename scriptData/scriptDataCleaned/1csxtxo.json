Ultimately the judge slapped it down because the board couldn't prove he wouldn't have accepted less, not least because he was already incentivized by being the biggest shareholder.\n\nThe EBITDA and revenue targets were aggressive but deemed achievable. It's the market cap targets that were crazy. To quote the judge:\n\n>To put Musk’s proposal in perspective, each market capitalization milestone increase of $50 billion required Tesla to grow in size roughly equal to the market capitalizations of each of Tesla, Ford, and GM as of early 2018. So, Tesla would have to grow an amount in market capitalization equal to that of the most significant domestic car manufacturers for Musk to earn a single tranche of compensation.\n\nTo quote Brad Buss:\n\n>those market cap goals were totally insane. I mean, you literally had to create a Ford, GM, or FedEx every ten months. Every ten months. And maintain it, right? So, okay, wow, that’s pretty nuts\n\nIf you thought this was easy then no doubt you put all your life savings into Tesla in 2018 and are now retired? You'd have been in the minority, since Tesla was the most shorted stock on the market back in 2017. [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/01/23/elon-musks-new-performance-award-plan-looks-like-a-winner-for-tesla-shareholders/?sh=7a7ceb6dad47) certainly thought it was a good deal for shareholders. Aon (who valued the option at the time) analyzed only a 45% likelihood of the market cap doubling within the 10 year option period, never mind increasing twelvefold.",

That was always basically a death sentence. This is called a leveraged buyout, and it's what happened to Toys R Us and every business that gets \"saddled with debt\". Twitter would have struggled to pay back the loan with the revenue it had at the time of purchase, today the business is likely worth less than its debt.\n\nThe purchase sealed the death of Twitter. While it crashes and burns, Musk is trying all sorts of dodgy shit to see what he can get away with - like charging for API - and these things will become the standard for social media going forward.\n\nOnce Twitter is dead, all its assets will be sold off. I think this is why they still use the twitter.com domain in spite of the rebranding, they want to maintain the digital footfall for whatever becomes Twitter 2.",

There is a big difference here. When a margin call is issued, the brokerage will sell on your behalf and can do so without warning. There is no recourse for a margin call.\n\nCovenants are more loosey goosey. The lender can pause it, ignore it or renegotiate it. The most stringent thing the lender can do when a covenant is broken is hold the loan in default. They'll do what's in their interest but they can't just push a button and get all their money back like with a margin call. That money is long gone, all dispersed to former Twitter stockholders.",
