If you wait for the right time of day and days you can get it really working for you. I sold a 7.50 a couple weeks ago for 12 days out for like 70 cents. The stock dropped below 7 then went back to around 7.20. Even when it dropped below 7 I was still in the green because of waiting for the right premium. I took the shares and sold some 8.00 calls on the rise up. Its been in this range for a decent amount of time but paying enough in premiums to stick around. I usually do 10-15 contracts and will scale out of them if it's really cheap to buy them back before expiration.",
