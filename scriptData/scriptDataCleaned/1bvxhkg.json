So Market Makers step in and take the responsibility of always offering both a bid and ask in the spread to ensure liquidity.\n\nHow do they do this without losing money? They hedge, they sell and buy on both sides of the option to neutralize risk. They use the formula to determine whether options are over or undervalued compared to the theoretical model, and play the opposite side. And they make profit by taking advantage of their trading speed and the size of the bid/ask spread.",
