It also plans to source [electric vehicles based on Hyundai’s Ioniq 5](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2024/10/04/waymo-bulking-up-robotaxi-fleet-with-electric-hyundais/) model for its growing fleet starting next year. Waymo is also shifting to a new lower-cost sensor and compute system that it says is more powerful than the one currently in use and that will help it eventually become profitable.\"\n\n  \nAnd apart from having Google's tech & money power, it's raising crazy money - [https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/waymo-investment-robot-taxis.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/28/business/waymo-investment-robot-taxis.html)\n\nAt this point it's hard to ignore its impact on Uber.\n\nYour thoughts ?\n\n",

If Tesla makes FSD very much better than it already is, Waymo is finished. There's no way they can compete with a $30k cab with their $250k of equipment.\n\nAnd either way, it will be a lot easier for Tesla to add LiDAR to their cars than for Waymo to produce millions of $250k cars. Even with LiDAR, Teslas would be cheaper because they're now a mature car manufacturer.\n\nThere's no way to know if Waymo is lying about how often their teleoperators have to intervene as well. Let's show them the same skepticism as Tesla.\n\nAll that and I still admit I don't know how it will all turn out. I'm sure you have no idea what you're talking about though. Quit pretending you do",

So it might end up like Google fiber, where they realize the costs and challenges are not justified by the potential profits.",

As of November 2023, Uber hasover 6.5 million active drivers and couriers globally. Owning so many cars, or even fraction of that would eat up the profit.\n\nThat piece of puzzle might push them in a direction to partner with more auto manufacturers/dealers/traditional rental car companies like Enterprise for supply. so business going back to rental companies instead of individuals. but don't know if the economics will eventually work.\n\nOr if Google comes out with a strategy such that automakers build autonomous cars using Google's tech along with regular cars, and people who want to  list their cars for ride sharing buy such cars instead of regular cars, that might address the issue.\n\nthat's a long shot. but that's what google has been doing since its inception with all its successful products.",

Who wins this crazy race between them, Tesla and Uber is a huge question. They are a clear front runner and have done a lot more doing than Tesla, who talks a  lot.\n\nWaymo raising money like this seems like a stroke of genius.
