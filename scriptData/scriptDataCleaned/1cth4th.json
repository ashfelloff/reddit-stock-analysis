There is no way that it deserves the market cap it's at now, which probably explains why they have pushed their earnings report back 3 times now, which I honestly didn't know you could do.

It cost me $28 a day until I bought it back to cover my short position.  Shorting DJT is not the way to make money. IMHO",
