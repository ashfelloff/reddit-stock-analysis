But Powell saying “sufficiently restrictive” was taken as concrete as you can get.\n\nThe jobs number pushed up the Fedwatch tool and it’s closer to 2 cuts by end of year now rather than just 1.\n\nThe Fed’s biggest problem is going to be housing.  High interest rates increase housing inflation by destroying mortgage demand causing rental rates to rise.  The new home builders aren’t as impacted since they can buy points still, but getting people to move from first to second homes has basically just dissipated to nothing. The Redfin ER detailed a bunch of this.  Those with existing low rate mortgages don’t want to move, those looking to buy and waiting are seeing their money eroded by increasing rent.\n\nIf the Fed is that adamant on their 2% target they are going to have to accept a hard landing.  If they do I could see them raise rates because it won’t matter then if they are taking us to a recession.  If the job market cools further though (and luckily our fed has a dual mandate) they may have to lower rates just to keep us near full employment.",

Since all the options are comically expensive, nobody is really buying either.  \n\nThe only real way to ease the issue is build more homes.  Except companies cant open new projects because borrowing is too expensive and nobody is buying.  Plus housing is sky rocketing right now, so developers are fine sitting what what they have, endlessly raising rent and letting their properties appreciate.\n\nThe one caveat seems to commercial properties which have variable rates or cant stop investing cuz rates are high.
