I can take profits before the day ends and not worry about swinging. The only thing I didn't like was not getting instant deposit immediately, but it makes sense because no margin.

          "body": "Your broker is able to see what will happen if your expiring ITM options are exercised. Specifically they can calculate if the resulting positions would exceed your margined buying power. In those cases your broker will either liquidate the option contracts at market value or exercise the contract and liquidate the resulting position at market value. If your account has enough MBP you’ll keep the exercised position.\n\nThis is why you’ll hear people complaining that brokerages forcibly close their positions around 3-3:30 ET on Friday. They are giving ample time to liquidate all positions while the market stays open. The illiquidity after hours introduces risk.\n\nI would say it’s more common to allow short/sold options contracts to exercise automatically, since you already needed to secure it with cash (puts) or shares (calls). Whereas you can buy calls for cheap that would far exceed your MBP when exercised. You’d need to purposefully liquidate other parts of your portfolio to prepare for exercise if you wanted the shares.\n\nRegardless, your question was probably more about: will you lose your unrealized gains on ITM options if you don’t do anything? and the answer is, your broker has a lot of discretion, so leaving it up to them means you don’t have full control over what happens, but they should still be getting you a fair market value. But you are better off closing your options at your desired price, and choosing whether you want rolled options, shares, or cash.",

Inversely, selling option premium sucks because we collect less but take on more risk.  I would be happier with a higher VIX as I like to sell premium.",

But for this example - did he buy early and then sell before close? And since the market was up today - the option price increased. But doesn’t time decay quickly for 0DTE?
