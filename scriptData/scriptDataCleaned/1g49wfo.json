The truth is, even if you do what I do, you won't be good at it until after you've taken some really awful trades and then looked at them retrospectively.  \n\nIn general, I trade ONE product, and that's micro S&P. It doesn't matter what you trade, but be ready to lose money on it for like 1-2 months, maybe six months or a year, while you refine your strategy. Some people have better luck with micro NQ, forex or even gold.  \n\nI use a mix of price action and volume indicators. I watch 1m, 5m and 1hr. I get a feel for the general daily trend by looking at the last hour and come up with a strategy based on that. Generally bullish = there will probably be SOME pull backs, but very risky to short because there's usually a bounce back when it hits support levels. Generally bearish = opposite and risky to long because it will boomerang and fuck you up.  \n\nBut generally on a bullish day, I can take a few long positions over 30-45 seconds, I go in on 3, 5 or as many as 10 orders of micro, and I only need about 4/5 ticks and I immediately pull out. Do that a few times a day and I'm up $200/300. On a bear'ish day, I'll take a few short positions, but I'm a little more conservative on when I enter, but when I do enter short, I tend to take larger positions like 15x/18x orders to maximize a drop so I don't have to make too many trades. My worst days have been during bear'ish conditions because there's more whiplash.  \n\nBut like the person I replied to said: I walk away fast. I'm happy with $60 or $75, especially since I didn't lose any that day.  $60-75 on a single 1 minute trade is like $3600 an hour. The same amount of time as a TV commercial...",

I like 11 to 13 EST because there's still a lot of movement, but it's easier to perceive. The bid sizes are 50-200 each tick instead of like 1500 lol. When you stop at a tick and see the volume go from 100 to 50 back to 120, you know it's a support/resistance and can position your entry. But when it's 1500 to 750 and then jumps another tick and then four ticks and then drops 5 ticks... Your RL will punish you hard on that chop.  \n  \nI tried my strategy at 9 EST and I got chopped up. After a few red days in triple digits, I crawled back to my PST window and had way more success.  \n\nIf you're talking about EST 9:30 to 10 but moving to 10:30 to 11, it sounds like we are right next to each other.

Buying into a strong trend that immediate breaks structure. I've made like 10 trades that made complete sense from a momentum perspective that have just...switched direction completely. I was doing much better when I was trading purely on RSI and trying to anticipate reversals instead of trying to trade with the trend. I'm so fucking angry with myself, I feel like I'm going to vomit. Bought a bunch of $87 calls on BSX today that expire friday on what looked like a dip within the VWAP range it's been trading in for weeks. And then today the market just decides it wants to break the structure. This has happened to me so many times now that I know I'm doing something wrong but I don't know what. I'm losing it.",
