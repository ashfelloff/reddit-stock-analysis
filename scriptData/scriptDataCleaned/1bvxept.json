He was clearly just destroying capital every day, every month, until this trade. It's also a massive lost of time that should be spent productively and enjoyably, developing skills, increasing income which can be used wisely to double down on option 2 below:\n\n2: Quit the bullshit, do himself a favor and own nothing but SPY for the next 20 years. YOU WILL NOT BEAT THE MARKET. This is only defendable decision and it will enrich you at a rate that far outpaces inflation at a time most critical as we run deeper and deeper deficits, YOU must own real assets, and buying the index is the only advisable path to do so. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck u/CFIL19",

Considering the low price of puts (at $0.05) compared to calls ($1.00) you would end up with way more puts which today would have helped but even a small qty of calls would have benefited if SPY had moved the other way.",
