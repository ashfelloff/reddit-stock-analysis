Hope for the best (most beneficial outcome for yourself and others) and you'll usually land somewhere between complete failure, and great success. \n\n Regardless, you'll always love yourself even when you're at a total loss.\n\nPs:   Karma is a beotch, the more people you fawk the more fawking you'll receive.  \n\nFree will allows you to heed or leave my advice/input, but time will teach you the truth behind my simple words if you ignore them.  \n\nI'm just an old man with nearly 60 years of life experience though and while occasionally I hate the decisions I've made, \n\nI've learned that if you don''t love yourself, you'll be unsuccessful in every endeavor, personally unlovable,  miserable, lonely and have no self esteem.  (Would you want to be around someone like that? Someone who's continually miserable, angry, disappointed, and constantly blaming you and others for their own failures?). It's exhausting.  \n\nWhat comes around goes around\" might sound cliche, but there is a reason cliches exist.",

However, some say he failed 2,000 times before creating the working bulb(with a limited lifespan for the controlled and tolerable need for replacement of course) \n\nEdison is also said to have said, \"I didn't fail 1,000 times. The light bulb was an invention with 1,000 steps\". This may be to illustrate the importance of persistence in achieving success.\n\nIf he hated himself... (And he easily could have) He would have never seen success.  however he was apparently quite a narcissistic prick. (For which he ultimately suffered but that's a different story)\n\nI'm sure the serious but sadly self loathing Nikola Tesla would have eventually delivered on his promises of free \"wireless\" electricity for all.  (Although White,Westinghouse and/or the federal government would have found a way to put Tesla in the ground anyway)",
