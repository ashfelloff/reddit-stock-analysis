Things I would look for are:\n\n- Further increase in overall DAU (50-60% would be great)\n\n- How much increase in logged in DAU (30% would be great)\n\n- How much ARPU went up respective to DAU(I would only use ad revenue to calculate that, if ARPU went up by 15-25%, that'd be amazing)\n\n- How much accounts receivable go up(more data licensing deals) (and extra 30 - 50 million would be good)\n\n- And obviously forward guidance. \n\nIf financials are good there likely will be a pop. Whether or not you sell the pop should depend on how big the pop is, and how good the information I mentioned above is.",
