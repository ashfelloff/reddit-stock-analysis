Dumped another 10%, to 16, but then you had a bull move and a pullback to 18 and theres a good entry for a move. You buy the first touch of 18 you get burned, you buy the pullback to 18 you get paid. I would look for the same again. A move below current prices. Then a break up abit above current prices then try to get in on a retrace to about current price.
