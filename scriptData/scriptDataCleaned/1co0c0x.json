You are replying to someone who is saying that layoffs and hiring can be decoupled - it isn’t necessarily notable to have layoffs without a hiring freeze (nor is it odd to have both at the same time).\n\nWhy do you expect this person to use that to explain something that has been widely reported as inexplicable and strange?",
