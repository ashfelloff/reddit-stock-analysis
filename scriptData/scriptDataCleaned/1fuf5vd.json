The Feds taking control of company, by law, would require them to only source parts from within the United States. For this reason, Obama wisely (although risky) allowed GM to operate it's own self without federal government oversight. The very same people that ran the company into the ground to begin with. But had the gov taken the company, it would have further been crushed by huge increased in supply costs by having to switch to domestic suppliers.\n\nIntel might be a bridge too far for takeover unless the gov is willing to input FAR more money than the company is worth in order to keep it floating. It's not likely that they'd end up making a profit on Intel like they did on GM.",
