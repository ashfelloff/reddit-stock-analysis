America sold their gold investments to pile into MAG 7 and bitcoin etfs.\n\nWe have seen only the tip of inflation.\n\nIf only half of the inflation was at this moment priced into commodities oil would not be below 80 a barrel.  So my hunch is the inflation we've seen so far is inflation from the past when there was a lot less of it.\n\nThe fresher inflation hasn't worked its way through Exters pyramid.  YET\n\nJust my opinion.\n\nYou ain't seen nothing yet.",

      "body": "High levels of migration are likely contributing high rates of rental inflation. If Trump is elected later this year, and if Trump enacts policies designed to reduce migration, an abrupt decline in inflation is a possibility. This could potentially accelerate the time table for Fed rate cuts in 2025. \n\nhttps://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/4238426-the-migrant-and-housing-crises-are-colliding-with-predictable-results/\n\n“If as little as 7 million migrants have entered the country — legally and illegally — during the Biden administration, the number admitted will have exceeded the total population of Massachusetts, the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. The economics of supply and demand virtually assures that the addition of so many new residents seeking housing will put upward pressure on rents and housing prices, especially if new housing supply is constrained as press reports emphasize.”\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/politics/trump-immigration-what-matters/index.html\n\n“While he did not employ an Eisenhower-like effort the first time he was president, Trump is bringing the pledge back.

It is probably smaller than Trump says.”",
