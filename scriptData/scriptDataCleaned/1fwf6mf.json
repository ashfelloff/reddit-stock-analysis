By November of the same year, his securities portfolios were worth $415 million.\n\nThe claim says DeVocht was twice advised to donate to the RBC Charitable Gift Fund in order to obtain charitable tax credits, giving approximately $8.5 million in December 2020 and then another $17 million one year later. \n\nBy October 2022, Tesla shares were in sharp decline, and DeVocht's investment holding company was forced to sell shares to repay loans from his RBC margin account. \n\n\"In time, the plaintiffs' security holdings were worth nothing,\" states the claim.\n\nNone of the defendants have filed a response.\"",
