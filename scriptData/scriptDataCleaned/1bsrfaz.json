      "body": "Anything promising with Rivian is happening at least a year or two out, 2025-2026. They could obviously have a runup by then, but their current situation isn’t too hot. They recently stopped construction on factory as well. They’re in a hunker down and hope to survive position right now. \n\nIf you believe in the stock buying actual shares right now would be the move, options unless they’re leaps that are years out aren’t a good idea",

          "body": "Completely agree with this take. But I do believe in Rivian long term. I have been holding off on buying as I could see the clear downward trend. My target is $8/share before I start buying in and then doubling my position for every $0.50 it drops below that. Only really nervous if it gets down below 5.",

                  "body": "Depends. At this time, I don't see them dropping much below 8. The nice thing about this strategy is that it keeps your cost basis within $0.50 of the ATL, so it only takes a little move to recoup any losses. But you are right. If it shoots straight down the toilet, it will clean you out. That is why I would only ever do it with a company I really believe in.",
