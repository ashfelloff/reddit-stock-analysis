I look for well-established stocks that have been suffering lately. Ideally, said stocks should have a solid history of consistent, if choppy, growth on the 5-year chart and maybe further.\n2. I consider whether the stock is truly undervalued. I do some research on the industry, read up on some news about the company. I have two main checks. First, I imagine the likelihood of the company falling apart within a year or a few, absent of something extremely upredictable. If that thought is laughable, I then see if there is substantially negative news with lasting repurcussions to justify a sustained drop. If I see the business sticking around, with no news of the sort I mentioned, I go to the next step.\n3. IMO, technical analysis is a weird self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not it makes sense, enough people trade off of it that it can be accurate, particularly with supports and resistances. So, I check if the stock price has consolidated or slightly rebounded from a support. If the stock has already tanked, but hasn't hit the next lowest support, I don't buy. I'll wait until it hits, and see if it stops dropping once it does.\n4. Finally, I will monitor the stock after buying it, with alerts if it drops below the support I initially referenced. I'll sell if the support is broken and watch the stock when it hits the next-lowest one. That's how I dodged the last LULU drop and bought back in at $300. We'll see how that pans out with earnings coming up.\n\nStocks I recently bought: ULTA, SBUX, HSY, SHOP, CVS, NKE, LULU.\n\n*Disclaimer: I've only been investing seriously for near two years, so we'll see if my strategy holds up in the long-run or if it's a load of bullshit. I usually hold my picks until it goes below the support, like I mentioned, or until it has gone up a few dozen percent at the least. I also make the occasional regard play, like a small bet on \\*bank stock that shall not be named\\* recovering after all the bank stuff last year. Spoiler alert, it didn't. My latest regard bet is ASTS at $7, so we'll see if that one pays off.*\n\nEDIT: I've been told that Fidelity calculates returns from changes in balance, including withdrawals and deposits. I've withdrawn maybe 20% of my portfolio in the past year for college expenses. Take that as you will.",

If qqq crashes 50% and you need to sell you would have lost a ~ 87.5% on tqqq, but if you just sit and dollar cost average (say during covid crash, and dollar cost isnt even necessary it just helps), you still end up way on top with tqqq and thats the \"riskiest\" normie leveraged one. Its ironically better to hold / sit&forget leveraged etfs even tho financial advisors will tell you different",

Whenever there's substantial downward movement, I look at the reason, look at supports, and consider exiting to lock in profits. For the most part, though, I do my best to hold for a medium term, at least. I absolutely do sell if continued upward motion seems unrealistic, or if I see better investment opportunity elsewhere. This usually lets me get 20-30% fairly simply, with substantially more on outperformers. I'm up 140% on my SPOT position, and made a decent amount from NVDA as well.",
