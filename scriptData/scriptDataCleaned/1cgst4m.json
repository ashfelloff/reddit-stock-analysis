Are you forgetting that former Jewish and Christians became Muslims?\n\nBut wait you are correct because in all 3 monotheistic religions they all talk about a covenant with God... right?

I guess it makes it okay in the eyes of God to conduct Genocide mostly against Women and children because that is what God would actually want.

I have a lot of jewish friends who are religious and even they cringe as they are learning about what Israel did since 1948 (since they were taught something completely different growing up). Its like the movie Kung Pow, they trained you wrong on purpose for laughs and here we are today trying to help you understand what is directly in front of your own eyes.\n\nI wish you do figure it out one day and I hope you can be saved (it is not anyone on this planet that can do that for you). We all make our choices and we all have to account for them one day as well.\n\nI can safely say, killing other humans is commonly understood as murder. Killing masses of people who have no ability to defend themselves is not what any of the \"books\" would ever say is a right path (since you want to go down the religious route of reasoning).",
