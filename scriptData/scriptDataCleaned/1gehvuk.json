But go ahead an be an apologist for a level of luxury you will certainly never reach, bootlicker. \n\nTo answer your question, billionaires should be taxed to the point they are incentivized to use the capital to put back into the economy because hoarding wealth should be as societally distasteful as leaving your shopping cart in the middle of parking lot.",
