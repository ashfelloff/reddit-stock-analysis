I invested $3200 into Robinhood starting with $0, and then every penny I could after that, which was probably about another $20k since. Now it's at $158k. I did hit a couple really good options for AMC, AT&T, and Sunnova, which I sold for gains and put right back into the stocks themselves, minus AMC. That was a one-time option play, which I still made for middle of 2025. None of this next week BS. Good luck my friend. You can do it!

The simplest strategy is to  look at super stable companies most impacted by Biden's reinstatement of massive business regulation in his first 100 days and overall interest rates. I found a handful that were down 90% who were thriving under 45 and got decimated by Biden's policies. The underlying market knows who's coming back, so i bought all of them at the end of last year. My worst performer is up 35%, and my best is up 280%. I did sell some of my options when they popped 800+%, but then reinvested the gains into the regular stock price when they corrected. $3200 popped to $27k and then gained to $163k over the last 11 months. I hope you crush it too, bro! There's not many of us with common sense left. Seems like people actually want to post loss porn rather than make money on WSB.",
