So like 1 contract per trade\n\n\nWithout even asking you or looking, I bet you were risking hundreds if not thousands per trade on top of not cutting losses early.\n\nYou let them ride down, probably even see glimpses of a reversal, ultimately to have them crash and burn.\n\nAnd the most likely reason you did this was because in the past, if you just held onto them long enough, they will eventually turn around\n\nI don't call that skill, that's luck pure and simple.\n\nIt's happened to me and now I have a rule, if the price does reverse I want an 80% break even target.\n\nSo if I risked 100 lost 90 and It came back to 80, I'm selling. The market is sometimes kind enough to let you recoup some losses. The problem is we become greedy and hope to be profitable from our once losing trade.\n\nIdeally you're never in this situation.\n\n\nOnce you are CONSISTENTLY profitable. Slowly up your positions.\n\nBut if you can't do this, stop and just paper trade. Put your money in a 1 month CD and don't look at it.",
