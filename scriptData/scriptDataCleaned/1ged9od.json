I doubt anyone is going to do that, it's not make or break but it's something that personally bothers me because they could do so much better. \n\nThe outside of the car can look however it needs to, although ICE cars are not aerodynamic and you end up losing range, but the interior should absolutely reflect the benefits of an EV.",

              "body": "Yep. They basically gave their market share to the Japanese (Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi, Mazda, etc) because of their refusal to adapt, innovate, and compete. Meanwhile they tricked their investors and themselves into thinking it was actually a good idea to abandon the small car market because profit margins were much higher on trucks/SUVs which they shifted their focus to. And then Ford/GM/Chrysler basically had the same attitude with EVs.\n\nAlthough it's actually worse than that. Because of how much less maintenance EVs require, the legacy car companies realized that an EV transition would result in much lower profits from part replacement and service sales - so they killed the EV (see GM's EV1 and the Who Killed the Electric Car movie). Because of that they never invested the necessary time/money/engineering talent into designing them the right way. But what they probably didn't expect, or arrogantly ignored, was a small upstart company named Tesla riding a global wave of aggressive pro-EV regulation in the biggest economies in the USA/EU/Asia.\n\nNow they're all desperately trying to catch up as Tesla slowly eats away at their market share in what is effectively a zero-sum game. The problem is, competing against Tesla is tough, really tough. And the regulations around EVs are only getting stricter. While to some extent GM and F have been more insulated against Tesla's success, because they mostly sell Trucks and SUVs, the increasingly strict regulations around fuel economy standards will force them to develop EVs or pay massive fines in the form of ZEV credits to those that do. The problem is designing EVs is nothing like ICE vehicles. Sure there's some overlap but the real important parts like the powertrain, drivetrain, and software elements, require an expertise that isn't native to ICE desiging/production.\n\nSo these are entire new teams, divisions, and people in disciplines outside of the companies core competencies that need to be set up and integrated within the company. And no one there really knows how to do it. So it's no wonder they've been struggling. It's really fundamentally a different technology than what they're used to. And to make matters worse these new teams have to deal with the massive amount of bureaucratic morasse endemic to these old car companies and stupid demands from higher ups trying to keep costs down by forcing them to use the same parts and pieces in their EVs as they use in their ICE vehicles. And those guys just don't know shit because they aren't engineers they're basically accountants. And that's how you get a retrofitted ICEv with an electric motor stuffed in the engine bay held in place by a bunch of brackets and it's a piece of shit.",

They also have to make an electric vehicle that allows for 3rd party creators to put their software in. They can't do what Tesla did, and build it all from the ground up, they don't have the time or people to do that. Which is why Ford, GM, and most other car makers have shit touchscreen tech. \n\n2.) Ford can't seem to make an electric car that A.) Anyone is excited to buy. B.) Most people can afford. C.)More than 2 models - a SUV and a Truck. \n\n3.) They have to deal with the absolute landslide of bad PR from the Fossil Fuel Industry who they were buddy buddy with for generations, who are basically demanding they \"stop all this bullshit.\" Running BS memes about how electric cars are dangerous, or useless, etc. So much so that any legitimate complaints (how if it does catch on fire, it does take way more water to put out, how chargers in your house, will mean a significant update to the building codes for firewalls etc, and a fairly substantial grid upgrade.). They are doing a bad job of counteracting that, which tells me that all levels of the company have not bought in on it. Thus, it's doomed to failure or at least a lot of lackluster starts. \n\nWhen they figure out all the parts to #2. I'll gladly buy a ford. But they are pricing them 11-17k over their gas powered vehicles for a vehicle with less power, less range, and less infrastructure. They are currently offering an included in home charger to go with any electric vehicle purchase. \n\nSo they are burning cash trying to get the battery tech where they need it. And they are trying to get Americans to adopt E vehicles. And they are doing so with 1/3 of a company behind them instead of the whole company.",
