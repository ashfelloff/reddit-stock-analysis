So statistically, like if you were going to bet on the short or the long side here, the long side does make a lot more sense. Getting to 30 or $40 by sometime in 2026, it's not that far-fetched and that's a 100% profit. What this guy is doing with the options? If he sells them into a real rip there is some money, it's just he bought a strike price where I would be looking to sell the shares, actually I would sell the shares a little before that but not too much, 40 to 42.50.
