  "selftext": "Gather round, friends. We’re cooking up some serious tendies today.\n\nAnd give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they’re doing to do this DD justice, but I’ve been quietly profiting off the best of y’all’s work, and I’d like to return the favor. If I’ve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can’t look past any formatting errors I may have, that’s on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it’s going to $100 by EOW.\n\nSo here’s the dealio… about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they’d be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA’s warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.\n\nEnter ELF. If you haven’t heard of ELF, I really don’t know what to tell you. They’ve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making “dupes” of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY’RE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price… all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and “guilt-free,” something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here’s why a broke Master’s student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:\n\n1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\n2. Piper Sandler’s Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.\n\n3. My fiancée knows practically nothing about stocks, but I’ve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn’t understand why I couldn’t stop laughing until I pulled up the chart… it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I’m still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here’s when she won me over—again, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: “People aren’t responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they’re responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‘slowdown’ is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?” Quite a thesis, huh? And here’s the kicker. ULTA’s last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA’s total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ––> ULTA is hurting because they’re selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ––> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ––>  My fiancée is a genius and way out of my league ––> Calls on ELF!\n\n4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it’s true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA’s warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that’s us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.\n\n5. My fiancée tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven’t fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don’t question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.\n\n6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it’s PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it’s their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you’ll agree it’s warranted.\n\n7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste “buy high, sell low” in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.\n\nTLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.\n\nPositions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don’t judge me for being poor and having only two calls… if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.\n\nNot financial advice :)",

ELF has had a lot of success with TikTok advertising to be sure, but in my view, they’ve been successful there because they advertise a lot more uniquely and authentically than most brands have been able to. I’m expecting the strategies that ELF used to thrive on TikTok will work for them elsewhere, and they’ve already begun to make innovative moves into BeReal, and Apple Vision Pro, among many others. And all of that is assuming the TikTok ban even goes through, which is still far from a done deal. Plus VPNs make it pretty easy for most their customers to continue using TikTok anyways. And I would like to think the loyal customer base they’ve built on TikTok would follow them wherever they transition. But I completely agree; how ELF pivots from TikTok (if it is banned) will be very important moving forward. I’m excited to see what they come up with!",

Sure, ELF could dramatically increase earnings this quarter by cutting their R&D, advertising, and expansion budgets. But in addition to betting on an earnings beat and guidance boost in a couple weeks, I also have a January 2026 leap. Shareholders cheered when Boeing reduced their R&D to boost earnings a few years back, but it was a shortsighted move. I’ll take a company with booming growth and a high P/E over a company with a low P/E and no growth prospects any day. Curious to hear people’s thoughts on this!",
