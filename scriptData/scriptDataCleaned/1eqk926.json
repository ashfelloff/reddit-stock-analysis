It would also force testing companies to devise a standard of testing that can tell the difference between someone currently under the influence vs the metabolites left in the body days/weeks after consumption.\n\n\nRemember that the main reasons why companies drug test are that the costs of testing are outweighed by the amount of money they get from federal grants and that they need to comply with workers comp regulations for insurance purposes. If cannabis was federally legal, it would likely end up like alcohol with regards to occupational drug testing for most companies. There will always be companies that have to test for industry related regulations and those that will test anyways for presumptive morality reasons, but those are the minority. The rest will test only for WC insurance liability purposes, which would require the aforementioned new testing standards.",

Marijuana has little to no impact on driving ability.\n\nIn closed course and driving simulator studies, marijuana’s acute effects on psychomotor performance include minor impairments in tracking (eye movement control) and reaction time (break latency), as well as variation in lateral positioning (weaving), headway (drivers under the influence of cannabis tend to follow less closely to the vehicle in front of them), and speed (drivers tend to decrease speed following cannabis inhalation).[21] Notably, these impairments in performance are more likely to be manifested in driver simulator tests than in assessments of actual on-road behavior, where changes in performance are consistently nominal.[22]For example, A 2001 study evaluating the impact of marijuana intoxication on driving proficiency on city streets among sixteen subjects reported essentially no differences in subjects’ driving performance after cannabis administration, concluding: “Performance as rated on the Driving Proficiency Scale did not differ between treatments. It was concluded that the effects of low doses of THC … on higher-level driving skills as measured in the present study are minimal.”[23]Similarly, a 1993 trial funded by the United States National Highway Traffic Association (NTHSA) evaluated subjects’ driving performance after cannabis inhalation in high-density urban traffic. Investigators reported, “Marijuana … did not significantly change mean driving performance.”[24]",

Their beverage-alcohol revenue increased 137% in the quarter to $76.6 million, up from $32.4 million in the prior year’s quarter.

They already have the networks established.\n\nI don't see any long-term investment in this sector, but the wave after rescheduling will be enormous.  \n\nI do have some reservations with it actually being rescheduled however. Democrats have a long history of teasing movement on these issues as a way to get votes for the next election cycle, saying they need your vote to get it done, but never actually getting it done in order to continually leverage the issue. They did so with gay marriage until the conservative Supreme Court came in to overturn the prohibition on same sex marriage. Clarence Thomas has written an opinion stating he believes cannabis should be legal and I think a conservative supreme court would uphold this if the right case was brought before them.  ",
