      "body": "Reddit is quickly becoming the standard discussion board/forum for the world.  I didn't see it before but I do now.  The advertising/AI possibilities are endless.\n\nDishwasher broke?  Ask reddit.  When someone in the thread replies you need part x, the algorithm links up to an advertising partner, and you see a direct link to the part.\n\nOn a macro level, this is huge.  The results of the next election are likely already available if you are able to link user data with location data based on someone's posts.  Use AI to strip any new accounts/suspected bots you now have an accurate microcosm of the political landscape... in realtime.\n\nCorporations could analyze data in their subreddits to address issues or identify QA issues every.  It gives companies a way to get free feedback from its customers without having to provide a self hosted forum + infrastructure .\n\nWill be taking new position of 500 shares today and will look to enter long dated calls.",
