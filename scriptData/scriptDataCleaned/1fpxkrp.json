Yesterday everything I touched lost, so thought \"well, 2.5x isn't bad, I can't take another loss today\"....put into shares so if it went wrong, I had time to recover(because I still believed in the fundamentals, was just scared, there was alot of red I believed in), then kicked myself ðŸ¤£\n\nWas bound to happen once I sold them, one of those days!\n\noh well, next time!!\n\nCongrats again!!!",

If the answer is no, have conviction and stick to your original plan.\n\nThat's at least my philosophy, seems to work for me.",
