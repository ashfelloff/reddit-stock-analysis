You can hold multiple type ratings, but you can't keep multiple currencies (it would be a scheduling nightmare to fly you in multiple types). Some aircraft are very similar and so hopping between them is a \"short course\" where you can take a checkride in a week rather than 4. For example the Airbus 330 is considered similar enough to the A 320 that you can do this. It's obviously much harder to go from a Boeing to Airbus and vice versa, so it takes ~4 weeks.",

Last July, the slide pack from a United Airlines Boeing 767 fell into the backyard of a Chicago home shortly before landing following a transatlantic flight from Zurich.\n\n> In December 2019, a slide pack also fell from a Delta-operated Boeing 767 in very similar circumstances on its final approach to Boston Logan Airport.",
