Then you can let the remaining 5 ride and not even care what happens next.\n\nI know this is WSB but being up 100% in 3 months is already really good, you can close for 600% or you can sell  2 and guarantee you dont' lose any of your initial money and let it ride. thats probably the best middle ground tbh",
