This is the reality of most Wallstreet degenerates….flying  little to close to the sun. \nThere is no reason you can’t trade modestly with options and make some really good extra money.

Can you quit your day job and just trade nope….just doesn’t work that way.\nHaving 50,000 and then buying insane options is nothing more than going to a casino…well the casino is better odds. \nI take my wins in stride and only out options in my area of focus, which is small cap. I only buy options at certain times when the evidence is strong: it’s not full prof but I know when to really pull the trigger. Do I always get it right….absolutely not. The point is you can only win in small margins. Keep the small wins and avoid the big losers and you can make good money that can do things for you. Pay credit card debt off, pay off or buy a new car or save it and buy some really expensive strong company stocks so over time your long play bet results is a big win…the win you were trying to get with one off option no chance investment bet.\nGo slow, be smart and don’t ever bet the ranch…you will, like 99.9 percent of this crew, go bust and it’s ugly when it does…\nNow bad to my 450 dollar average wins.
