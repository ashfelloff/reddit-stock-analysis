The only time they wouldn‚Äôt do this is if they were sure that the stock will drop more than 2.55 overnight on the day of the dividend. \n\nFor example: \n\nday of dividend: 35$, next morning: 34$. In this case, its better to cover the day before since the 1$ drop is less than the 2.55 fee.\n\nday of dividend: 40$, next morning: 34$.

And the only reason to keep the short position is if you expect the stock to drop much more than the dividend amount.\n\nThe other good news is it seems like not a lot of volume is needed to move this stock.. I can see the stock moving 0.5% in either direction with only 20k volume.\n\nThere's 7.5M shares sold short right now.. let's hope at least 2M of them cover. That should be enough to bring us to the mid 30s range :18630:\n\n(edit: honestly 1M short cover will probably be good enough)",
