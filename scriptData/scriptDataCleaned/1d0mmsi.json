Just passionate about accelerated computing, AI and powering human progress. Doesn't care so much about wealth and fame.\n\nThe Huang family also seems so damn wholesome. Both his kids went to great schools and work in the family business at NVDA:\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/author/madisonh/\n\nhttps://developer.nvidia.com/blog/author/spencerh/\n\nThis is how he met his college sweetheart Lori (now wife) while he was just a teenager:\n\n>Huang attended Oregon State University, where he majored in electrical engineering. His lab partner in his introductory classes was Lori Mills, an earnest, nerdy undergraduate with curly brown hair. “There were, like, two hundred and fifty kids in electrical engineering, and maybe three girls,” Huang told me. Competition broke out among the male undergraduates for Mills’s attention, and Huang felt that he was at a disadvantage. “I was the youngest kid in the class,” he said. “I looked like I was about twelve.”\n\n>Every weekend, Huang would call Mills and pester her to do homework with him. “I tried to impress her—not with my looks, of course, but with my strong capability to complete homework,” he said. Mills accepted, and, after six months of homework, Huang worked up the courage to ask her out on a date. She accepted that offer, too.\n\nVery different from some other billionaires that go around impregnating every woman possible \"to save the planet\".",
