You have to understand this Reddit group is a very small percentage of people and it’s easy to see crazy good gains and think that’s the only way. Luckily people post losses to help balance it out some but many do not compared to when they’re up. \n\nThe problem is people gamble money that could significantly alter their life if loss for options. Some win and most lose otherwise everyone in the world would be doing this. Gamble what you can comfortably lose and don’t get greedy. Seeing a $5,000-$50,000 gain is very addictive because you want to get even more. Best way to deal with losses is make smart and intelligent plays with an amount of money you can afford to lose. The worst is these people who YOLO huge chunks of money then get fucked and want to cry about it like what did you expect?",

On the same day/week we see some stocks swing below that and hit above 20%. You need to analyze and trust your research. Take NVDA for ex, it was at 140 went to 90, now it’s back at 125.    fundamentals didn’t change, AI will always be a next big thing until we reach near sentience (yes, I know this is a stretch but that is where we are heading to call a win) so people who sold when it went below are now crying. \n\nBottom line, do your research, trust the data you gather, don’t be emotionally attached to any play that’s when you lose big. Most of all, never go YOLO, it’s just too risky. Personally, I always set my limit of risky plays to 20% of my entire portfolio",
