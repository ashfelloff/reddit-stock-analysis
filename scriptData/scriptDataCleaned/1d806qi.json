There's a substantial number of people who think that Elon/Tesla can do no wrong and will rationalize just about everything. The current forward PE on Tesla is 70 and Tesla isn't growing anymore. It's clearly overvalued but the people who hold Tesla stock don't care. The market can worship Elon longer than you can remain solvent.",

          "body": "Something makes Tesla 10x as innovative as any other car company. Imo that something is Elon. Innovation requires that you destroy old ways. Few people are willing to do that to the degree that Elon is willing.\n\nA specific example of this is in the cyber trucks switch to a 48v system. That change should've occured in the 70s but every traditional manufacturer was too afraid to take the leap. Mind you that's not a technical leap, it's a logistics leap. No one wanted to put in the research, force the suppliers or deal with issues that may arise. That's 50 years of companies following the status quo. \n\nIf Elon isn't what makes Tesla special then idk what is. Tesla is in a league of their own. You see it in the cars, the stock price and the sales. He does many things that are inefficient but the pros still outweigh the cons.\n\nIf he's so stupid then why can't anyone else do what he's doing? If Elon has an IQ of 100 then the ceos of Toyota, Ford, gm, VW, BMW, stellantis and Mercedes all have an IQ of 50. Tesla may suck but everyone else sucks more",
