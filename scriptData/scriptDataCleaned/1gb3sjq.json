Achieving this milestone was highlighted as the company's most critical goal for 2024.\n\nThe B-samples of QuantumScape's initial product, the QSE-5, have demonstrated an energy density exceeding 800 watt-hours per liter (Wh/L) and a fast-charging capability that allows charging from 10% to 80% in less than 15 minutes.\n\n  \n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-soars-production-initial-b-120152202.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/quantumscape-soars-production-initial-b-120152202.html)",
