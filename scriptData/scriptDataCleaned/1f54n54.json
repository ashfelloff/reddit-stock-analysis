  "selftext": "Intel executives are working with multiple advisors to formulate options to address its [flagging business](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/intel-intc-gelsinger-skepticism-activist-layoffs.html), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThose advisors, which include Morgan Stanley and other bankers, will likely present Intel’s directors with options at an upcoming board meeting in September, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.\n\nIntel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.\n\n[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump) first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options. Spokespeople for Intel and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged publicly on Thursday that the company understood investor skepticism and was working to address it.\n\n“We realize we have to operate efficiently with nimbleness, with urgency,” Gelsinger said at Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.\n\nIntel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don’t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.\n\nThe once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today’s prominent AI models.\n\nAlongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html)",

Yeah sure they have a small dividend yield, but that price is also not adjusted for inflation.  \n\nAnd it's not just the stock price, since 2019 their revenue is down 25% in nominal dollars (Again, during a time we saw ~40% cumulative inflation) AND profits are down 90%+, and neither of these are one bad year, they're clear multi year trends.  It's trading at a PE of almost 100 still which may make sense for a fast growing startup with a lot of potential but not for a company that's been shrinking revenue and profits for years with no promising prospects.  I mean hell NVDIA is a crazy high flyer and their ratio is a bit more than half of Intel's. Sure PE isn't everything but it's a pretty glaring datapoint. \n\nI'd say if anything Intel shareholders have been astoundingly patient.  It's been a pure dogshit company for about a decade at this point, like shockingly badly run.  At this point putting it out of it's misery and selling off what value remains may well be the merciful thing to do.",
