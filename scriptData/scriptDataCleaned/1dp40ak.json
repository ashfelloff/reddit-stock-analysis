  "title": "Amazon Hits $2 Trillion Valuation For First Time Ever",
  "score": 583,
  "selftext": "Amazon.com Inc. has reached a $2 trillion market valuation for the first time ever as an artificial intelligence-fueled rally pushed the tech giant deeper into record territory. \n\nShares rose as much as 3.6% Wednesday to $193.04, pushing the market value to more than $2 trillion. The company is now a member of an elite club of a handful of peers that have surpassed the key market capitalization. Alphabet Inc. passed the $2 trillion threshold in late April, while rallies have pushed market values of Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. to more than $3 trillion. \n\nAmazon shares have whipsawed since the company’s first quarter earnings, when the cloud unit posted the strongest sales growth in a year, helping to power the stock back above the all-time high set in April. The stock rallied in June, recovering losses from the end of May to gain about 27% so far this year.\n\nShares of the megacap technology company have gotten a lift over the past year as the company cut costs and restructured its business to better take advantage of the AI frenzy. In addition, its key Amazon Web Services business has shown signs of re-accelerating growth, a major point of optimism for investors. ",

All that money goes into the US economy, churns around for a bit and eventually ends up being invested in something, usually real estate, equities or bonds. \n\nAt that point it stops moving.

If that thing is a profitless company or overvalued stock it will make little or no return and the money will sit there doing nothing, deflating slowly away.
