Sometimes it's hard to find coverage in situations where there's water damage because it's not a covered loss in most situations. It's just as much, if not more work to deal with requests for re-inspections and litigations. The easiest thing is when it's abundantly clear that there's a covered loss, I can sketch your home, throw a couple of macros into an estimate, make a couple changes and cut you a check.\n\nThe problems come when people start changing their story and/or lying. They tell one little lie about something because they think it's going to result in no coverage (half the time that's not the case) and then they tell another lie to make the first one sound more believable and suddenly I've got a whole fairy tale that makes absolutely 0 sense and it takes 10x the work to find and apply coverage.",

As an adjuster, Insurance work is very sink or swim. You have to know how to use your resources and comb through a policy with a fine tooth comb. It's impossible to train agents and adjusters for every situation they'll encounter",

I’m making up numbers, but it might cost $300/month to an insure a home against all risks, and of that $125 would be due to the flood risk. Because flood claims are almost always HUGE claims.  \n\nSo it makes sense to split it out, so then people have options with their flood insurance specifically. Like I could go get a different flood policy for $70 that has a limit that is half the limit of my regular policy, and take on the extra $55/month of flood risk.\n\n\nAuto insurance flood risk it isn’t the same because it isn’t as much of an issue as an *individual* risk. It’s an elevated risk in coastal regions for sure, but it’s not *such* an issue by itself that it disproportionately affects the math when buying comprehensive coverage.",
