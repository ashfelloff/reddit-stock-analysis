          "body": "So, explain to me where the money comes from that Coinbase is able to make on these ETFs. \n\nUsers who are engaging with the ETFs are paying very close to NAV and losing 0.25% per year in fees. My understanding is that ETFs don't have buy-in fees nor sales fee. They just charge an annual fee taken silently from the NAV of the fund. I think Coinbase takes 0.05% annually for BTC held. \n\nThat's something like $1M revenue per $2B AUM. With some (mythical) $1T AUM between all the BTC ETFs it custodies, Coinbase could earn about $500M/yr, which I'd consider to be about the best possible scenario and potentially only during limited, frothy, bubbles. However, If the ETF fee market got \\~23x larger, there's no chance that Coinbase would command the same fee nor the high marketshare, so $500M/yr in ETF custody revenues might never be possible for Coinbase, even if other tokens get ETFs.\n\nCoinbase's main source of revenue is Bitcoin trading. Lately, they've touted their subscription service as being \"diversified revenue\", but its like a monthly fee instead of per trade. People won't want to pay an unnecessary fee and you'd expect many traders to move over to free unlimited trading ETFs. Since the ETF came out, tons of trading has moved off the platform (in my opinion), because you can trade the ETF for free. If anyone I knew asked how to buy bitcoin, I can just respond $FBTC. I don't have to tell them to download an app, get an account, do advanced trading so you don't get scalped, get 2fa hardware device / crypto hardware wallet, etc. Many retail investors will prefer using their broker, rather than maintaining an additional account with significant security risks and massive fees (2%+ per buy AND sell w/o advanced trading).\n\nThe main thing I've heard from Coinbase (only listened to part of last call) is that they think the ETFs will be good for the crypto space, which will also be broadly good for Coinbase. I'm not sure regular people care that there's a bitcoin ETF, so I'm not sure it is really drawing in business. You might as well have told people that reticulated splines are now 50% off. Have you met any regular people getting orange-pilled? I have not. \n\nTL;DR - Trading revenue will get decimated by ETF. Subscription, custody, base income gonna be weak, especially over time. I'm short, so shits probably gonna rip on earnings Thursday.",
