A few thoughts on why I’m bullish: \n\nThey project to have 0.55-0.80 EPS in 2026, and they almost always outperform their guidance. Should they accomplish the top end of that range, boy oh boy is Wall Street underestimating their value…\n\nLending is going to be firing on all cylinders - they just started a new business originating loans and selling them to other clients which is just straight cash to the bottom line. Trump presidency certainly squashes the student loan moratorium for good, bringing back revenue for refinancing those loans which used to be their bread and butter. \n\nMember growth continues to break their previous records - they’ll start adding 1M members per quarter soon. NBA, NFL, and TGL will be in full swing, further accelerating their growth. \n\nIn sum, they are stealing tons of market share from legacy banks, and there is SO MUCH MORE to steal. The transfer of wealth is real, and is beginning to occur. Younger generations are clearly adopting SOFI at higher rates, and as they continue to do so and their incomes rise, SOFI’s growth will only accelerate. \n\nAt the end of the day, superior products win out. SOFI offers a massively superior banking experience in comparison to legacy banks. Can you imagine opening a Wells Fargo or Bank of America account 🤢 get out of here. \n\nOverall, extremely bullish for the next decade of SOFI’s growth.",
