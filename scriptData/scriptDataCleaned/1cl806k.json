  "score": 430,
  "selftext": "Warren in recent interview explained how the increasing taxes are the main concern for him.\n\nSo he sells a huge chunk of apple's stake because he fears Biden's new 45% cut from capital gains proposal, obviously he will make less money selling apple down the line at $200 than selling it right now for $180 if the taxes increases. But it's also a good excuse to make the move and crash the stock 10% and buyback at $160, a win win situation, that's the privilege these large hedge funds have. blah blah blah, same old story, tell me if Im wrong.",
