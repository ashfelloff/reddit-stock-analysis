This settlement, which includes the state of Hawaii and Maui County, is still pending court approval and is not an admission of liability. The August 8, 2023 wildfires led to 102 deaths and the destruction of over 2,000 structures, including many homes. Lahaina, the former capital of the Hawaiian Kingdom, was heavily impacted. Fire victims filed over 450 lawsuits seeking compensation for property damage and personal injuries. This settlement could help Hawaiian Electric avoid bankruptcy, similar to what PG&E faced after California wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nMarket cap on 8/3/2023 prior to disaster:  $38/share X 110,000,000 shares = 3.8B\n\nI estimate the share price will reach 19.2 after earnings on Friday August 9 when they announce details of how they will be financing their 2B liability. They may have around 150M to 500M in insurance to offset part of the $2B.  They own a bank, American Savings Bank - perhaps they can finance part of their loan.  They can sell bonds to finance and also raise rates.  Wall street bet these guys would go bankrupt and now they will not.  Ultimately because HE makes about 200 million a year in profit (5 yr avg) and has a monopoly on power in Hawaii, I see no reason for HE to re-establish to over 3B market cap. I estimate in \\~5 years the share price will be $30+.\n\nThe markets have not had a chance to absorb the settlement news. They'll performtheir own DD and price in the settlement this week. I expect an uptick on Monday and then after earnings Aug 9 as big large institutions to begin buying after details of HE financing their liability are announced on their earnings call after market.\n\nI'm not factoring in that the stock is currently 24% shorted either!\n\nHappy trails!\n\nEdit: My positions amount to a YOLO:\n\n502 shares @ 17.95\n\n(2) Jan 16 2026 15C\n\n(1) Dec 20 2025 20C\n\n(1) Sep 20 2024 20C\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hg1ggmduqngd1.png?width=2493&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba477c990f9f2583c114385f5acd806b50192df4\n\nFor fun, i posed the question to ChatGPT:\n\n**Q:** a wildfire takes place during a wind storm causing power utility pole to blow over. the downed lines spark a fire that causes 5.5B in damages. the utility is publicly traded prior to the fire at $38 and 110.3M shares. a settlement is reached with the power utility liable for 2B damages. the company annually posts a profit of $2/share. they have a 500M insurance policy to partially offset their liability. they do not have to start paying damages from the settlement for one year. how long will it take for the utility to regain its original market cap?\n\n**Skynet:**   To determine how long it will take for the utility to regain its original market cap with the revised annual EPS of $1.73, we need to adjust our calculations accordingly.\n\n# Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Original Market Cap Calculation:** 4.1894B USD\n2. **Settlement and Insurance Policy:**\n   * Total settlement amount: 2B USD\n   * Insurance coverage: 500M USD\n   * Net liability after insurance: =1.5B USD\n3. **Annual Profit:**\n   * Profit per share: 1.73 USD\n   * Total annual profit: =190.819M USD/year\n4. **Impact on Market Cap:**\n   * Net liability impact on market cap: 1.5B USD\n   * Adjusted market cap after liability:  =2.6894B USD\n5. **Profit Contribution to Regain Market Cap:**\n   * The utility will use its annual profits to cover the liability.\n   * Annual profit available: 190.819M USD\n6. \\*\\*Time Required to Cover Liability:\\*\\*​≈7.86years\n\n# Conclusion:\n\nAssuming the share price and market conditions remain constant, it will take approximately 7.86 years for the utility to use its annual profits to cover the net liability from the settlement and potentially regain its original market cap of 4.1894B USD. This calculation assumes no other changes in market conditions or profitability.\n\nLets just round up and say in 10 years this should be around $38 a share again!  I'll be 58 and can take some sweet gains.  !Remindme 10 years\n\n**Edit 2024 08/24: Markets appear to be selling off globally and there appears to be an increase in the chance of a recession. Everything across the board likely will be red on Monday 8/5/2024. Please consider  that markets are looking to be opening lower on Monday 8/5/2024. Do not buy at open. However, this is an opportunity to put in some low-ball bids and maybe get lucky with some positions. Suggest waiting til earning to learn how they will finance their debt!**\n\nThis is not financial advice. All investments carry the potential of loss.",

Maui FD claimed they put the fire out and left the scene!!! later in the day it re-ignited and ended up destroying Lahaina. Maui county didnt sound sirens and the Maui police blocked people from escaping the town due to suposed 'live electrical lines' -- HE informed the fire and police on multiple occasions that day that the entire town had been de-energized!  There is an ATF report that Maui county so far has refused to release to the public, because likely it will expose their gross negligence and hand in causing 5.5B worth of damages and lives lost!",

I have a different theory why they are not releasing the report and why as investors we should be careful what we wish for. This is why:\nNow if the report showed Maui was more liable then tax payers would be happy the evil corporation was paying more than their fair share. NOW imagine if the report said that it was mostly HE’s fault… citizens would be mad that their tax dollars are paying and that HE should pay the whole bill. Also I don’t think the ATF report will look at liability rather than just purely fire causation. They are not the DOJ or lawyers. They are forensic. They will simply confirm likely what we all know. there was a fire. The county thought it was out. They left. It came back. \n\nIt’s far more likely that the ATF report is being held back so Maui county citizens don’t derail the settlement before it is done.",

There is a possibility that it may even sell off a little since some folks will react to the $1.99B number vs the original $1.5B anticipated. Since the statement clearly says that no responsibility is taken for the fires what this actually looks like is HE is doing the county a solid and in reality they will get a lot of assistance in both raising rates and issuing bonds to cover the bill. This situation is very different than PG&E. \n\nSo I don't expect this stock to go 2x in the very short term from here like I expected before. There will be some short squeezes though and these are not as predictable, but I expect after earnings when they clarify the path to payment, then we'll see an immediate leg up followed by a gradual climb.

I do agree that unless there is some new negative piece of information, it should move up following earnings. One thing to notice is the language used by the CEO in the press release of the settlement. He was very positive and very accepting of the outcome. No where in the release was it implied that this was a difficult situation. What this tells me is that even though the bill looks large-ish ($1.99B), the path to payment is one that the company will easily handle and that will be because of some agreement with the county and the insurers perhaps including raising rates, bonds, or something we don't know. This will all come out in the earnings. If I wasn't holding a significant position already I would have bought more this morning.",

I like 15.65 as an entry but highly unlikely . will have to be watching pre market and especially volume. If institutions are buying in we should see a noticable volume spike from friday to monday.  AVG daily volume on HE is about 2-3 million. when the first rumor of deal vol was 8 mil spiking to 22 million.  there's a huge gap at 22.63 so look for that to fill when we get there. set an alert!\n\nmy strategy to add monday is see where we open, set limit orders -.25 -.5 -$1.  vix is high and this will be day traded on the news. paper hands will be taking profits so capitilize on dips. use RSI and 5m EMA such as the 8 EMA to add if we have a solid trend.",
