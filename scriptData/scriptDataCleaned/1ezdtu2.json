One of which is the inherent price of the underlying. Another is the TIME left you have to exercise the option. Thanks to OP for surprisingly close round numbers.\n\nThe value of the option is about $4400. It is a $15 call on an underlying that is trading at $22. \n\nIf OP exercises the option... OP will buy 100 shares $15 per share (the strike) for a total cost of $1500. With shares trading at $22 a share, OP profits $700.\n\nIf OP sells the option... OP receives $4400 (value of the option). They can then buy 100 shares at the current trading price of $22 for $2200, leaving them still with $2200 from the sale of the option in the first place\n\nOption 1: OP has 100 shares that can be sold for $700 profit right now.\n\nOption 2: OP has 100 shares that cannot be sold for profit, but also has $2200 leftover. Clearly, the better choice.\n\nEDIT: My math off as correctly identified by replies. Didn't read the UI correctly but the theme still applies. Leaving up  cause this is WSB and who cares. \n\n\nWSB translation: sell option = tendies + stonks.... exercise option = no tendies + stonks.",

I've seen advice on several websites illustrating this issue as well, giving up present extrinsic value is almost never worth it... the only case in which you \"end up with more\nmoney\" when exercising early is if the stock then goes up more than the additional profit lost by exercising instead of selling, and even then it's somewhat likely that the extrinsic could have increased due to IV bumps if the price increases that much more before theta decay would have offset it\n\nedit: I suppose there's maybe some edge cases related to forcing a gamma squeeze (VERY VERY unlikely) or having the marginable asset at a lower cost basis? You could turn around and sell covered calls against the low cost basis shares and theoretically recover the difference in extrinsic that way?",
