It's always employees doing stuff for Elon.\n\nPlus as far as I know: Hughes was eccentric. Where as Musk is eccentric and also just holds lot of outright bad opinions. Bad treatment of workers. Some very suspect I assume apartheid upbringing opinions. Can't take being criticized or not being in good limelight.\n\nThen again I'm willing to be educated on ills of Hughes, but as far as I know he was industrialist and engineer who really really liked airplanes and flying. Which is also why he was his companys test pilot. He was part of the team designing the planes and as avid flyer the one who would take first flights.
