  "title": "PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",
  "score": 296,
  "selftext": "This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.\n\nI was originally inspired by the DD in “Drill Baby Drill” to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of “why” the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)\n\nI have \\~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).\n\nI will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:\n\nIn general, the thoughts are this:\n\n**PAA Business**\n\n**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)\n\n**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.\n\n**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)\n\n**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.\n\n**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.\n\n**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \\~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.\n\n**“Undervalued” -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \\~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.\n\n**PAA Army**\n\n**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**\n\n**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).\n\n[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bev413gfdctc1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3ee9af7c38cd1e18e5dd0427e3e492d4584aee\n\n**Macro**\n\n**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‘Muricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - “this shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.”  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)\n\n**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.\n\n**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.\n\n**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \\~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.\n\n**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).\n\n**Geopolitical**\n\n**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\\~$75), that would mean an average of \\~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.\n\n**Brazil -** lets see what happens here…\n\n**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.\n\n**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.\n\n**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)\n\nSome sources:\n\n**PAA Business**\n\n**Location of Pipelines**\n\nPAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the “good guys” (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qywuf2eecctc1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e1b0ec24b59f75edbffcfc738edaeba6741fec5\n\n[With inventories at lows, and SPR \\\\\"drained\\\\\" and economies heating up, its a recipe for more demand](https://preview.redd.it/adbh9elfcctc1.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6655397cc68a0175bf9656900299ff98b34b129)\n\n[Saudi needs \\> $90 oil to balance budget.

I think 2025 is a bit crowded and I like the extra delta that the MMs would need to hedge on the 2026s.  Shorter dated calls are also an option as that could positively affect the price.**\n\n**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**\n\nToo tired to write more...\n\nPositions:\n\n1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22\n\n1200 Jan 2026 calls from $20-$25\n\nI would be happy with 1%-2% increase a week in the stock, we have 9-21 months for the LEAPs",

We do not need oil at $X or some increase in Y amount of demand.  What PAA needs to make money is more volume of oil.  If other sources are not able to be used, or econ is running hotter then thought, then demand will increase and their pipes cover the 2 most important areas, permian and canada.  I honestly think oil can stay flat but the relative increase in their volume could go up as other areas have issues.  You can see \"demand\" increasing due to cuts in supply (OPEC+) or raises in the crude price etc as proxies.\n\nTo be clear actual demand does not even need to increase, just demand from the areas they have pipelines has to be above their price targets of $75",

Rate cuts are back on the table and the market is rallying again.  Yesterday, we saw it rally back to 17.72, which is where we were immediately following the divi pay out, and I think we hit a limit sell wall because of that. But I also have some speculations that similar to how MM are low balling bids, they’re attempting to keep the stock price within a certain range to keep bleeding these calls and scalp as many as they can before they let it rise fast again. We did the funny thing to the stock and squeezed it higher, faster with the volume of calls. They’re just trying to shake the tree for whatever they can.",

You can look at the opening bell period of the stock for the last week and see despite an early opening run up and the stock typically opening higher, it’s always met with a high volume dump with a considerable price drop. Why might they do this? Well, my guess is that they’re incentivized to keep the stock price as flat as possible, that way any time the stock dips, they can lower bids and asks on contracts, thus causing us retailers to panic and scoop up anyone who sells out of fear. I have this estimation because the contract asks never rise with meaningful intraday gains, meaning that there are MM now only lowballing bids, but keeping their listed asks low too because they know if they can keep the price of stock within range, they can always buy them back at the same price or even lower. But I could be wrong and this is just the choppiness of the market right now ping ponging on inflation data. Probably a bit of both. But it is odd to me that good news inflation data sent the stock on a dip. Rate cuts at all this year would be good news for us. Still ample time for your calls. Yes, even the august ones.  The price on stick stock can move relatively fast and easily with its float (that sword cuts both ways. As we see now) so I’m not concerned at the moment. As many others have said, not a bad time to average down your position.",
