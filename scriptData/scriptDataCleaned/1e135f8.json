They obviously just tried to blame all of it on us as patsies as one bad rating wouldn’t affect them. \n\nI’ve vowed to never use Air bnb again because of this as even a host with a great rating can turn out to be a scumbag.

I am pretty unhappy with how the platform has changed. For me personally we charge what the market will bear and our cleaning fees are very reasonable, ($45 for a 1200 square-foot apartment with a kitchen, bedroom, living room, outdoor area, and hot tub. )probably because we do the cleaning ourselves and that’s just how we like to operate. I think it’s sad that most hosts see the platform as a get rich quick scheme and the company itself has done very little to pushback on crummy hosts.",

I suspect the majority of airbnb stays have zero issues on both sides.\n\nHonestly I don’t know how Airbnb hosts can do it. The accelerated wear and tear on a home is crazy. We stayed at a $2M+ house that’s only 10 years old and there was just a ton of stuff that was broken or worn down due to heavy use by guests. Another place was a family home that’s been in their family for 100+ years. I’d be scared shitless letting random people stay in a place like that. I guess getting paid lots of money helps but it’s still a ton of work…",
