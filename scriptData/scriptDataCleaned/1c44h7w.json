  "score": 138,
  "selftext": "I used a baccarat board to chart the daily SPX returns from Monday, Jan 1, 2024 to Friday, April 12 to see if any discernible pattern. The results are quite interesting as a baccarat player.\n\n\nThe Blue Player wins are if SPX was up from previous day. Red Banker wins are if SPX was down from previous day. I did not put a threshold for \"ties\" or trim for any order of magnitude. So, if we were up merely 0.01% from previous day, that still counts as a Player win. For perspective, the absolute value of average 1D deltas this year was +/- 0.56%. \n\n\nSo if I were to place some bets for the next 2 days (Monday and Tuesday), the bottom 2 rows on the bead plate chart (table on right) looks like strong pattern for Player to hit the next 2 days!\n\nThe caveat is that we were in a massive bull run so if we continue trending down, this wouldn’t be obvious here, but other charts indicate we’ve got a bit more juice left for a week or 2 of upside before we crash 10% to sub $500 on SPY.\n\n",
