My sister, brother, and I were raised with ZERO understanding of the stock market, and then there is the added barrier of being female. People don't talk to me about the stock market at dinner, or on dates, or even in my hearing 99.999% of the time. \n\nWhen I told my step-mom I had started playing the market over the summer, we were at lunch. We were in downtown Seattle surrounded by skyscrapers eating at a place with sidewalk seating. She started off just looking uncomfortable, but finally actually came outright and said she wasn't comfortable talking about money. Especially in public. I couldn't believe my ears. I was like, where do you think most business deals are made? Downtown at lunch is probably one of the most common ways and times.\n\nAll of this is to say, the ignorance you laugh at is no joke. Just getting started for me was like crossing a huge barrier.\n\nI'm not the OP, but I absolutely support anyone trying to learn, no matter how stupid the question. \n\nYou can probably tell I ended up becoming a teacher too, can't you?",

A put allows me to sell 100 shares of my stock at a predetermined price, independent of the stocks market value. For example, if I think the stock is going to down to 90$, I would buy a put with a strike price at 95$. This allows me to, at expiry of the contract, sell 100 shares of my stock at 95$, even if the market value of the stock is 90$. This is beneficial to me because instead of losing 10$/share, I only lose 5. You can think of puts as insurance, I pay a price (the premium) to mitigate my loss in the even the stock goes down. With 1k at 100$, shares I would lose 10,000$ without buying puts. If I buy a 95$ strike put, I will only lose 5k + the cost of the put.\n\nThis is the intended use of options. \n\nThe way WSB uses them is to buy the 95$ strike put with 0 shares of the underlying stock. Once the stock reaches 90$, one would sell the contract to a bidder. You make money because the put allows you to sell 100 shares of stock at 95$ even though market value is 90$. This essentially gives the contract a value of 500$.",

If Nvidia tanks on earnings and it literally drops down to $20 a share, you are now only holding roughly 12 million dollars, or a 52 million dollar loss.\n\nHowever with the small investment of 1 million dollars into these protective puts, if Nvidia actually does drop that much you'll be able to re-capture the value of your shares through the puts. (Because puts go up dramatically in value when the stock price drops)\n\nSo the 1 million dollars is ensuring the 64 million in a way.\n\nIts super weird for normal folks like us to think because 1 million dollars can be life changing money. But to the super whales who float around at the top 1 million is nothing. I know of a family who owns Nvidia shares at $8 a share. They own tens of thousands of shares.
