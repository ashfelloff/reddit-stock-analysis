Stocks go up and down every day.  There’s always another chance if you don’t go broke.  This sub is good in a lot of ways: it helps you identify movements and patterns, sometimes give good DD and advice, but it’s a double edged sword if you’re looking at other people’s gains and saying “why not me? I’ll just yolo it and become rich too”. You need a plan and the discipline to act on it.\n\nIf momentum goes sour, don’t be afraid to walk away. Throw away 20 instead of 200. If I see gains of any sort I’m happy and if I see them approaching 20% I start looking to sell as soon as the momentum stops or reverses. You can always buy back in at a higher strike if the momentum picks back up. I have lost out on many gains by not holding for longer, but I made money even when I “lost” and 10-40% is a significant gain, don’t let anyone convince you it’s not.\n\nIf you can’t be disciplined on short expiration, consider long-expiry.
