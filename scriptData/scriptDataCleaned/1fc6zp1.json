  "score": 230,
  "selftext": "1. Sales. Tesla sales are down, and I think they will keep falling. There’s no EV winter, Ford etc. are doing fine. People are buying EVs, just not Teslas.\n\n2. Leadership. Musk has spread himself too thinly. Spends his days tweeting random conspiracies, aside from running idk how many side companies. Seems he has shiny object syndrome and clearly the attention isn’t on Tesla right now.\n\n3. Competition. Chinese EVs are better. Cheaper. He said it himself. Americans will eventually catch on and shift to those. \n\n4. Regulations. Trump gets elected, he will favor fuel/hybrids. He could’ve made Biden-Harris his allies as they clearly care more about climate change, EV stuff - but he’s alienated them more than ever. \n\nHe’s also alienated his core customer base (climate conscious left-wing folks, right wing folks mostly think EVs are gay)\n\n5. His public (mis)behavior. Going on full jousts with the biggest western governments while cozying up with the dictatorships (Saudi, Turkey) won’t serve him. His lack of content moderation and refusal to cooperate with the world’s largest govs can cost him big. See Pavel Durov’s current situation. \n\n6. Stock price. Tesla is overbought. Has been for a while. Was fine when it was seen as the highest growth EV contender, but its subsiding with competition. He’s been pushing for it to be valued as an AI company but it’s not happening. The $56bn payout that was just approved shows he probably thought that money was more productive out the company versus reinvested.\n\n7. X is bleeding cash. He’ll probably sell some $TSLA stock to reinject money into it since he’s not letting it go bankrupt and most likely won’t sell it either.\n\nBased on the above. I call a top.\nThoughts?",

Elon was, at one point, seen as being a visionary leader, but past failures to meet deadlines and politics have soured most fans. It is now seen as supporting right wing radicalism to buy Teslas, a reversal of previous virtue signaling. It’s just not COOL to have a Tesla anymore regardless of whether you’re on the right OR left. \n\nRivian has been seen as having more interesting offerings. I think for now Tesla is safe with Biden/Harris national protectionism with the 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs, so Tesla will have a bit of a cushion. But at some point even $16k Chinese EVs at $32k will still be cheaper than model 3’s.",

In almost (3) years it hasn't even scratched near the surface of that level.\n\nAll of the things you said may be true, but they would all be the reasons why this stock has been tanking since the top. Fun fact, before being named as such, all the \"mag7\" companies previously topped in Q4 2021 before a silent crash in 2022. Tesla lost -75% during that time. They barely have recovered half of what was lost then.\n\nAs far as losses on Twitter, they pale by comparison.\n\nMusk has admitted the private value of the company is less than half of what he paid (a loss of over $22B) and his legal threats to the advertising industry have sent any and all advertisers running far away from the platform but mostly that all just shakes sentiment in Tesla because investors can't comprehend how a guy could be so brilliant as to invent cars or spaceships but can't figure out how to sell digital ad space.\n\nTesla has never regained ground like they've lost, but look on the brightside, it'll be a while before any other company in history loses as much as what Nvidia did last week. I guess that's got to be some kind of relief lol",

      "body": "1. Sales are roughly flat from last year, but trending up.  2024 auto sales have been flat worldwide.  This is not a Tesla problem, it's an expensive product that's mostly financed in a high interest rate environment problem.  Most consumers are waiting for rates to come down to buy new cars, as reflected by the fact that the age of the worldwide fleet is at like a 20 year high.  EV's on the other hand continue to grow in 2024 compared to 2023.  ICE sales are declining.  And most major manufacturers are backing off BEV to focus on hybrid, including Ford \n2.  Leadership is fine.   No evidence Musk is spread thin.  The company continues to innovate.  But I love how you think you're a good judge of where Musk's attention is based on your time browsing the internet.\n3.  Chinese EV's are good, because they are heavily subsidized by the Chinese government.  Because of this they will likely be banned in the US (like Huawei phones) and will have massive tarrifs in the EU.  Tesla can compete with the Chinese.\n4. Regulations: If Trump gets elected and the IRA credits are eliminated, Teslas non-China competition will crumble.  No OEM can make an BEV that is affordable without the credits.  Tesla can.  If Harris wins, credits continue and it's business as usual.\n4.5. Core Consumers: people on reddit greatly overestimate how much the average consumer pays attention to politics.  Seriously, like, 10% of consumers care about politics enough for it to decide a major purchase.  For instance, how is the Tesla MY the best selling car in America with such an alienated customer base?\n5. Public Misbehavior: see above.  Also, if eventually Republicans start buying EV's, they love Musk now.  So maybe he's just winning a new demographic.\n6. Stock Price: it's way oversold.  Kinda priced appropriate for auto, practically no valuation for energy, self-driving, or robotics.\n7. X Bleeding Cash: Musk has made clear that he wants to accumulate Tesla stock.  He wants 25%.  With latest comp package (if approved) he's at 21%.  He's not selling.  If he needs money for X he can sell SpaceX shares (huge market for that) or XAI shares.\n\ntl;dr If you want to pull stuff outta your ass I'll pull more factual stuff out of my way ass.
