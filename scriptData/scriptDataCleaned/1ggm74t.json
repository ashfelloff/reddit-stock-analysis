  "selftext": "\nAmazon the greatest company in the world. Delivery infrastructure is insane. FedEx and UPS can barely even hire drivers right now. Amazon stole USPS business right from the grubby little hands of FedEx. AWS is top notch. Half of Americans have a prime subscription. New storefront dropping that will compete with Temu prices, at a fraction of the shipping speed. Growing streaming catalog, Thursday Night Football, audiobook and ereader market segmented, exceptional customer service. Bezos keeps his customers happy. He will keep his stockholders happy. He may make his drivers piss in water bottles, but they get paid weekly and at a decent wage, so it’s no worries. Amazon should be the most valuable company in the world. \n\nPOSITION\n500 shares @ 186.36\n\nNo options, cus the only OPTION is to buy this company and see it hit 230 by EOY. ",
