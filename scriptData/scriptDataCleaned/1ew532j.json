I understand it's leveraged due to 100 shares so gains and losses are large... But it's not an obligation.\n\n\nIf you buy an option for $100 bucks of 100 shares and it turns out you bet the wrong way (and if you acted and took the shared anyways you'd take a massive loss), but can't you just... Not buy them? You're out the 100 bucks, but nothing more. I don't understand how you could lose 50k in options. Just don't exercise the options if it went the wrong way?\n\n\nI mean, I must be misunderstanding something here because it makes no sense.

I’m looking for some hope and just wondering what makes you say that? It sounds like the contracts were supposed to be announced I. March and it was just ‘days away’ then, and then nothing. Who’s to say it isn’t the same now?\n\nLike don’t get me wrong I’m all aboard this (rocket) ship, I just am trying to figure out a timeline of how long I can expect to have my money tied up or if I should trim my position a bit",
