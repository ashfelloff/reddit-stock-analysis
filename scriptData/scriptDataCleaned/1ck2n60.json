I sure hope it is not a joke man”\n\nAfter a while of fun and sarcasm they hang up.\nIf someone wants to put me in jail, there are proper procedures for such to happen, and I do have legal insurance so let them come! 🤣\n\nJoking aside, I am flabbergasted at the incompetence of all countries’ authorities for not planning ahead for all these scams and for not moving a finger to try to crack this down.\n\nTrying to file complaints iin FBI or Interpol is just a joke. Only SEC has proper filling forms (of course…\nbecause authorities care about capital). The rest is just either broken or too hard. And we should have ways to forward emails to authorities or departments that should busy themselves with such things. Social media chats should be able to be attached with complaints for authorities as well.  All pretty much a wild west rn.

I once bought from one exchange (BSE) and sold the same share in another exchange (NSE) accidently and ended up being both long and short in the same stock. Thankfully shortselling is banned in India and you can only day trade with shorts so I avoided losing a bunch of money. \n\nAnd coming to the options market it isn't the 1 call= 100 shares in the US. Here there is a lot system by which you can buy around 50,000 shares in an option?? Or something like that. Never even tried to go that deep cause it gets deeper and deeper.",

But anyway this is how it works. \n\nWe have expiry every day of the week(And there's no stopping here. The National Stock Exchange has recently introduced a new index contract as well) . Literally every day. \n\nThe liquidity in these option contracts are insanse especially in two indices namely Nifty(The highest) and Bank Nifty(Second highest). \n\nSo, on an expiry day, the price of a contract could go from 20 to 300(last week a contract value went from 0.8 to 150 in under 10 mins) in a matter of 30 mins and 300 to 0 in a matter of 30 mins. \n\nThere's a category of contracts which are usually called Out The Money(OTM) contracts to which usually all the pathetic retail loosers like me will flock towards. And 95 out 100 days these option values will go to zero and on the remaining 5 days these contracts can easily zoom to 10x to 20x in a matter of minutes. Most of us loose money just by the dream of catching these 5 days. \n\nThe basic obvious strategy here is, if you sell these OTM contracts, most probably you'll be profitable. There are people(Indian traders) here who not even knows shit about just basic mathematics making tens of thousands of dollars in a day with a big capital and just by selling options and let alone Jane Street.",

      "body": "That chart is bullshit. It compares volumes in number of contracts and not in an equivalent currency notional. The NSE is intentionally lowering the contract size of their options every 6 months to pump up those fake numbers.\n\nDon't get me wrong, even in USD notional the volumes are impressive, but nowhere near the US and not a multiple of the US as this graph would want you to believe. \n\nAs usual with India, this is just another cheap scam.\n\nAnd on top of it, this low contract size actually becomes a nightmare: since you need to trade 100 contracts instead of 1 and on top of it the NSE arbitrarily limits the number of contracts per order you send, it's a nightmare where you need algos to send for example 10 x 15 lots to just trade the same notional as a simple order of 5 lots on the US equity market. This creates massive artificial traffic that most normal companies just trying to trade have difficulties with, and the NSE itself is really bad technology wise so they can't handle this traffic properly, and during busy market conditions it all becomes a frozen shitshow. The NSE exchange has really subpar technology and staff, and have made no effort to improve despite creating themselves these arbitrary difficulties. \n\nUS exchanges should look at NSE with disgust, not envy.",
