Mpox main way to transmit is through sexual contact. Danish company , pushing for approval to administer vaccines to 12-18 year olds. Money grab... and money trap. Too soon after Covid vaccine fiasco , this wont work\n\n[ECDC says the risk of it spreading everywhere is low](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/mpox-risk-assessment-monkeypox-virus-africa-august-2024.pdf) (The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)",

It is continent-wide in Africa.  One has to think that if this were continent-wide in Europe or Asia or North America the WHO would have declared a global health emergency sooner, but here we are.\n\nThe problem I have with your post is that it is so binary: panic or ignore.  \n\nThe general public, (and politicians), are pretty terrible at dealing with nuance.",
