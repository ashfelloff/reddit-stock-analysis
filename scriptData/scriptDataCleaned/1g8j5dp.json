Also I don't believe GAI will ever turn into general AI as the largest models have already consumed the entire internet for training and there simply is almost no more data to pull from (and no using AI to generate data is not a solution here contrary to popular belief)\n\nLast but least we have asinine valuations in most things remotely related to AI.

These companies are still training their own LLM‚Äôs, but for research and development purposes rather than as something to do day to day work. That‚Äôs why you see MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, etc investing in nuclear energy. They need to get their operating costs down in order for businesses to justify the cost. That, and the fact that compute is increasing at such a rate now that absurd amounts of power are likely going to be required to run the next generation of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù.\n\nHowever, I would argue that LLM‚Äôs have changed the world already. We‚Äôre just not all aware of it. I guarantee AI is being used to steer the discourse of nations online. It‚Äôs propaganda on a level that most can‚Äôt understand the implications. Russian troll farms are now Russian bot farms. It‚Äôs also being used to pick targets in Israel. Sadly, the first major changes AI is going to make aren‚Äôt likely to be the ones that change the lives of working folk.
