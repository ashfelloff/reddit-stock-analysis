It's mostly Eli Lilly (Ozempic/wegovy) and Novo Nordisk (Zebound/Mounjaro) but includes others such as Amgen and Viking pharm (which had its stock jump from 10 to 80 when it's new drug results came through even if it's dropped back to 50 for some reason).\n\nThese drugs aren't going away and will keep making more and more money as the new ones come out even if it's a few years for those new ones to get through the FDA approval process.  Billion dollar industry and will be growing and growing.",
