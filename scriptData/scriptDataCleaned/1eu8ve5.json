I had roughly 1000 shares and eventually in 2022 I sized them down to a couple of hundred and moved my funds into SPY. I of course wish I still had the thousand shares but hey, gains are gains. I don‚Äôt expect this stock to stop climbing as they are really the only company doing what they are doing. ",
