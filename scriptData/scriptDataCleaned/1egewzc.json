Made money at the start but I‚Äôm just a perpetual bull and I just throw money at NVDA and QQQ calls on any dip. \nI get payed every Friday and I deposit my whole check on Thursday a day before the check comes because Robinhood lets me use the buying power instantly. This week I got impatient and withdrew early and now I‚Äôm down -1000 üòÇ\nMaybe my qqq and NVDA calls expiring 8/9 will save me ",
