          "body": "The stock market ( S&P 500 ) is making new all time highs, but only a few stocks are contributing. The rest are actually declining.   \nUptrends with weak breadth like this tend to be vulnerable. \n\nTypically what ends up happening is either   \n1-Market leaders stop pushing the S&P 500 higher, they become weak and join the rest of the market & drop.  \n2-Market laggards join the leaders and market health is restored.\n\nTypically #2 happens when there's an intervention by the fed. Namely a liquidity injection or a rate cut.  \nSo what this tells me in a nut shell is that the market will continue to be weak and only a select market leaders will continue to rally, until the fed starts cutting rates later in the year.",
