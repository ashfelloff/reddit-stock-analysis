  "selftext": "I fail to see the trillions business that Musk and all the analysts parroting for robotaxis.  It‚Äôs a stupid idea built on fantasies.  Here‚Äôs my argument:\n\n1. Every single Tesla owner I know won‚Äôt lend out their cars. The lending out is the stupidest idea ever.  Every car owner I know won't lend out their car either.  Tesla will have to run their own fleet which will increase costs, maintenance etc.\n2. Percentage of people willing to take a robotaxi daily are low; like Uber.  At best; it‚Äôs will be an Uber like service with limited use cases:  Traveling, airports, designated drivers etc.\n3. Costs are astronomical when you add up all your small daily trips.  Two kids household in the US suburbs with limited public transportation.  I take approximately 8-10 roundtrips a day, sometimes more on the weekends.\n\nFor example: $7 per trip according to Musk: commute(2), kids school(2), kids activities(2-4), leisure or Starbucks or McDonald‚Äôs or family visits(2). $60-80 per day= $1500+ per month and that‚Äôs assuming every trip is $7.  Why not just own a car at    that price?\n\nEdit: I forgot to add the emotional, pride and freedom of owning a car.  US consumers love their cars and trucks more so than guns.  A lot of people will die rather than give up their cars.\n\nEdit: All the pro responses are parroting the same spiel that Musk, Woods and analysts are spewing.  No examples, no numbers, no market.  It's \"Believe me, it will happen\".  Same as the metaverse, Vision Pro, 3D printing, 3D TV which were all touted as the next big thing but ended being a limited market.\n\nTheir car and energy businesses will be fine but the trillions robotaxi business has always been a fantasy.   This ain‚Äôt about the stock price or where it‚Äôs going.  TsLA never traded on fundamentals anyway.  ",

The idea is you have local drivers do the local pickup and deliver. And where it makes sense that would be in electric trucks. The long haul portion would be autonomous. So for example, local driver picks up truck load shipment in a Chicago suburb, takes it to the terminal in Chicago. Autonomous truck takes it from Chicago to a terminal in Dallas. Local driver makes delivery in a Dallas suburb. This actually solves some other trucking industry problems but creates some other problems.\n\nIt's being tested heavily in Texas because laws there allow driverless trucks. Interstate 45 between the Dallas and Houston is the main testing zone. They are very very close to it being ready and I wouldn't be surprised if it happens this year or early next year. They have already racked up 1 million miles testing it.",

If your battery life was 15y when driving X hours per day, driving it 2x X will kill it waaaay faster. This goes for anything in the car - tires, seat condition (which will require more money to clean the car), coolant, and so on. \n\nAnother thing is that you want your car charged in the morning. What about if you have some sort of emergency drive during the night, that will happen once per year but it will be the moment when you need your car the most. It is a lot of whataboutism but some cars will crash simply because the state of the current tesla self-driving car is not even close to what is required for such a service. \n\nWe have \"Spark\" in my country (renting an electric car to drive around the city), and there are a lot of complaints - hygiene is shit because some people are shit, involved in crashes, smoking in the cars, cars left with flat tires, and so on. Anyone thinking it will be better when other people aren't around is just delusional. \n\nAs someone who worked in AI companies before, we most likely will not have a massive robotaxi service in our lives. There is a massive difference between training models to create AI porn and training models for unpredictable environments where \"the best\" decision is not always \"the best\". You can have all the data but the data isn't much with the right algorithms to process it, without the ability to process it fast enough, without the understanding the intention of the rest of the environment.",

Ridiculous.\n\nOnce true self driving is attained, automobile manufacturers will no longer be incentivized to sell cars to consumers. Why? Because the value of owning capital (ie cars) for the business of transporting people will skyrocket. Why sell a car I built for a one time price when I can put that car on the road for my own company's taxi/rental service for ongoing profit? \n\nSecond, economies of scale and labor are going to seriously drive down the price of rides. It's going to become infinitely more affordable to use a monthly subscription AI taxi/rental service than to buy your own vehicle. The more it becomes a cultural norm to have cars built into the public transit model (imagine a monthly transit pass for your city includes an Ai car share service for last mile delivery), the more car ownership becomes a unnecessary luxury, like owning your own moving van. \n\nThird, government regulation is going to reduce the appeal of personal ownership significantly. The transition to AI driving is necessarily a universal one. The safest roads will be those that *only* allow AI drivers, and the systems safety improves universally: by which I mean, there won't be good and bad AI drivers, they will all get better together. Human drivers will quickly become an outsized risk on shared roads, and there simply won't be a good reason for governments to allow them. Much like they don't make tanks street legal even if they let you own one. \n\nThe notion of personal ownership of vehicles is a long standing one, culturally, established will before cars (we owned our own horses, buggies, coaches, etc). It's definitely a new phenomenon that will take getting used to, which is why people have a hard time letting go of basic premises like continued personal ownership. What you need to grasp is that some things are changing in *fundamental* ways, while other things (the wealthiest class will continue to control capital) remain the same.",

      "body": "This is a very bad take. Regardless of what you think of tesla (robotaxi doesn't have to be tesla anyway), robotaxi is genius.\n\n1- You don't need lending for a robotaxi business. Sure, that's an idea that can be explored for people who want to make money out of their car, but you can have dedicated fleets of robotaxis, owned by the company.\n\n2 - Robotaxi will be significantly cheaper than uber, because it doesn't need a driver, and that's where most of the cost is. Lower price = more users. Also, not everyone is 'MURICAN. I don't own a car. I work from home. I take an uber whenever I need to travel inside the city. I would love robotaxis and would take them all the time. As things stand now, it's cheaper for me to uber than to own a car already.\n\n3 - See point number 2. Cost per mile will be MUCH lower with a robotaxi.\n\n4 - At best, it will be like a MUCH better, MUCH cheaper uber, which will allow it to be much less limited in terms of use cases. Maybe I won't take an uber for a 100 mile trip now because it's expensive, but if the cost per mile drops significantly, it becomes a viable and appealing option.\n\nAll in all, once you have self driving cars (and this WILL happen sooner or later) robotaxis are a given. It's obvious. You just hate Musk (perfectly justified, he's an idiot) and Tesla (less justified other than the musk factor, but sure). Robotaxi itself is a great idea and opportunity. Try removing tesla from the equation, think about it as Uber without drivers at 1/3 or 1/4 the cost. How about then?\n\nRobo taxis will be a multi trillion dollar business. The only question is when, and what companies will win at it. We're still very early, obviously.",
