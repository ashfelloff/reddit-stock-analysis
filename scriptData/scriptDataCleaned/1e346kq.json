  "selftext": "$SHLS has had a rough year , with selling pressure and poor sentiment taking stock down over 65% in the past 3 months. The company has recently communicated, that they feel their share price is too low and the markets are disconnected from the true current business conditions and it’s impact. A buyback was announced around $7 with a portion being accelerated = buys at around $7, insiders adding at current levels and the 2-3 predicted rate cuts will be a big catalyst. All the above will allow for a catch up trade for $SHLS with its peers, near term $10-$12. \nNFA & do your own DD. ",

One of the reasons for the downward  pressure over the last year was because of that. The results are probably positive considering the insider buying that’s been going on recently. \n\n2)Higher interest rates have really screwed them. Their order book also came in lighter than expected last year which compounded with everything else. With potential rate cuts they should go up.\n\n3)the stock have been HEAVILY shorted. Average of 22%, though now it’s down to 17%.",
