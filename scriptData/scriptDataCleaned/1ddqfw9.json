  "selftext": "I just googled why Apple went up today. I opened the first link, an article titled “Apple shares close at record high after company”.\nIt says:\n“Apple introduced a range of new AI features during the event, including an overhaul of its voice assistant Siri, integration with OpenAI's ChatGPT, a range of writing assistance tools and new customizable emojis.”\n\nChatGPT integration sounds good but the product is not new. Siri I hate. Writing assistance I don’t need/want. And finally there are the customisable emojis. Is that where we stand with AI? One of the biggest company in the world uses AI to create emojis? Wtf? If we progress at this rate, we may get AI supported fonts for text messages.",

AI tech was steered in a way where a model really only needs to produce something that looks good not be correct.\nIts probably Human nature to be generally more interested in creating something cool looking and stupid rather than boring and intelligent.\nAI at this point is literally only good at tricking you into thinking its smart, through cool looking pictures and smart sounding words.\n\nDon’t mind that all models literally just take your prompt and turn into a response based on a set of rules and probabilities (using a given set of rules that may contain all sorts of falsehoods) no matter how incorrect or ridiculously illogical they may be.\n\nUnless you wanna get philosophical, AI currently does zero „thinking“ and has zero factual knowledge or understanding.\n\nunless we reach that point all we’re gonna get is „le writing assistant“ and „le photo inpainting“",
