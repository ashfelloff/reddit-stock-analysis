Safest option is bonds or index funds, but if you're trading options you're not trying to be safe. Just make sure options aren't the highest percentage of your portfolio. Keep the total cost of your options below 10% of your total portfolio value. Also consider buying LEAPS instead of short term out of the money options. \n\nYou can also do spreads to hedge your risk. If you think an expensive stock is going up, you can buy both puts and calls so that if you're wrong and it crashes you don't lose as much. Doing this means you're also betting on volatility, so you lose more if the stock price doesn't move at all. Typically I'll buy calls with OTM puts with a shorter term as a hedge.",
