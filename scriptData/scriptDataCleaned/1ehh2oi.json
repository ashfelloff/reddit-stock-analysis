My wife literally cannot have a facebook because she got hacked by fucking ISIS lololololol (probably actually just some edgelord but I prefer to think it was actually ISIS).  They put up a huge banner of the ISIS flag on her front page, and a bunch of pictures of terrorists flexing with AKs.  So she freaks the fuck out.  I'm dying laughing but trying to pretend to be concerned.  The email she had connected to the account would have worked, but the hacker also changed the recovery email and phone number.  Over and over they'd send a recovery email, but it would go to the hacker.  So finally she gets a person on the phone, explains the situation.  They say the one last thing they could do would be to send an email to the very first email she had connected to the account. She made the account over a decade ago, no longer has access to the original email she used to open the account, ditto phone number.  So she's fucked.  \n\nBecause she was freaking out about having her name associated with those images, they deleted her account.  But now her actual real name cannot be used to open a Facebook account. \n\nIt was fucking hilarious",
