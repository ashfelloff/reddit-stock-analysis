Even if the price keeps rising slowly, your contracts can lose money\n\nAn example... I bought puts on GME right at the top, when IV was some ridiculous number like 400%, and since prices were so high, I went with a low strike price, something like $150..

So if I placed a call on RKLB at $5 (let’s say 1000 contracts like OP),and exercised the option when it reached the strike price of $7.5, would I essentially be buying the shares for $5 from people who placed puts at a strike price of $5, or am I interpreting it incorrectly? \n\nAlso, if this was the case then could I theoretically have bought 100,000 shares for $5 per when it reached the strike price of $7.5 and sold it all for a profit of $250,000 or does it work differently?\n\nI’m sure that my theory / thought process is wrong somewhere, I’m just not entirely sure how this all works. Thanks for your replies!",

                          "body": "You’d be buying the shares from the person who wrote the original contract. \n\nSo say I write that 5$ call, you bought it from me for 1$ ($100 contract cost) when it hits 7.50$ share price, you could execute the call and you would be purchasing those 100 shares for 5 dollars each- 500 bucks, but then they’re worth 7.50(750) at that current value. But factor in the 100$ you paid for the contract, you’re at 150$ profit \n\nYour math works out, just the mechanics of where the shares came from was off.\n\nOn my end, I’d have to give you 100 shares for 5 bucks. Which, if I have those shares, is fine you get them, I don’t make as much money on them because I could have sold them for 7.50 instead. But if I am writing a cal contract, I probably bought those shares way less, like maybe a dollar each.\n\nSo those 100 shares cost me 100 dollars, and I’m selling to you for 5$(500$) and the contract was 100$, so I made 500 bucks, you’re getting shares with a higher value than they currently are, it’s a bit of a win win.\n\nOr, because the value of that contract is intrinsically linked to the value of the underlying shares, you could just sell the contract itself for similar value (a bit less given ask/bid differences when buying and selling contracts, and whatever fee your brokerage has)\n\nFor example. Instead of executing and having the shares for my strike price, I sold a call today, the ask bid spread was a full dollar (4.70 to 5.70) the value I’m shown is 5.70, but it didn’t go through, or it takes a while to go through, so I entered a sale value of 5.50 it went through immediately and I made 20 bucks less. Not a big deal.\n\nYour theory is right, but learning more about the mechanics of options will be important.",

I’ve only just turned 18 so I just want to get a better feel for the markets and don’t really have the intention to trade options any time soon, but this is very helpful. \n\nJust one quick thing - when you say “wrote the original contract” is that a short call? So you’re betting on the contract not reaching its strike price (which I assume is the only point when the buyer of the contract can exercise their right to buy the shares at a lower price), thus you’re betting on the share price not increasing by a lot, but only making a profit on the premium? \n\nAnd if that’s the case, would that mean short calls with long expiration dates have very high premiums because they have more of a chance to be ITM?\n\nThanks for all your help, as I’ve said I am very very new to this haha",
