My opinion is that this week's price movement with what the 10/18 options chain was at and is at currently there is the potential for a short term rugpull.",

      "body": "I had a similar idea, but I went much shorter. \n15Nov covers both the election date and next FOMC, which to me are potential banana skins.\n\nThe first can be a risk event that gives a reason to take some profit close to ATHs which maybe takes some momentum and triggers a 5% pullback. Outcome could be seen as bearish (or bullish, either way there is uncertainty). The second could be spicy if they don‚Äôt cut since data has still been pretty strong. \n\nI don‚Äôt like the theta bill on longer dates like this when the trend is up is too strong, so I chose more tactical. If there is no pullback in next month I think the next catalyst will be in 2025, so didn‚Äôt want to pay for the decay over the following 6 weeks to take us into Jan. Maybe reassess in Jan. \n\nAnyway always good to see differing views.",
