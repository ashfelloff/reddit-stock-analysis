      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

This is from ChatGpt:\"Does a US government cabinet member have to sell stock they own in a company they lead or own?\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nChatGPT\n\nYes, a U.S. government cabinet member must divest (sell or otherwise dispose of) stock in a company they lead or own if their position creates a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Ethics in Government Act and other ethics laws require that government officials, including cabinet members, avoid situations where their personal financial interests could influence their official actions. If a cabinet member owns or has a leadership role in a company, their position in the government could create a conflict of interest when it comes to decisions that may affect that company or industry.\n\nHere’s how it works:\n\nConflicts of Interest: If a cabinet member holds stock in a company they lead or own, it could create a potential conflict of interest, especially if their government decisions would impact that company's business. For example, if the cabinet member is overseeing an agency that regulates or works with that company, they would be required to take steps to eliminate the conflict.\n\nDivestment Requirement: To resolve the conflict, the cabinet member is typically required to divest (sell off) their holdings or leadership position in the company. This is meant to ensure that their financial interests do not influence their governmental duties.\n\nRecusal and Blind Trusts: If divestment isn't immediately possible, the official may be required to recuse themselves from decisions that would affect the company. Alternatively, they might place their financial assets into a blind trust, where a trustee manages the assets independently, without the official's involvement.\n\nIn short, yes, if a cabinet member owns or leads a company, they must take actions—such as selling their stock or stepping down from leadership—to avoid conflicts of interest and comply with federal ethics rules.\"",

For example, if the cabinet member is overseeing an agency that regulates or works with that company, they would be required to take steps to eliminate the conflict.\n\nDivestment Requirement: To resolve the conflict, the cabinet member is typically required to divest (sell off) their holdings or leadership position in the company. This is meant to ensure that their financial interests do not influence their governmental duties.\n\nRecusal and Blind Trusts: If divestment isn't immediately possible, the official may be required to recuse themselves from decisions that would affect the company. Alternatively, they might place their financial assets into a blind trust, where a trustee manages the assets independently, without the official's involvement.\n\nIn short, yes, if a cabinet member owns or leads a company, they must take actions—such as selling their stock or stepping down from leadership—to avoid conflicts of interest and comply with federal ethics rules.\"",
