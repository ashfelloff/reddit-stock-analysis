Not every “stranger danger” looks like the creepy movie pedos, they’re often more likely to have means and wealth to cover up the diddy parties. I’ve seen this trend of like “put on this blindfold and you’ll get to meet Mr beast or get this free giveaway challenge” type stuff and if your kid is chronically online with no self protection instincts they’d likely fall for something as stupidly easy as that if the person is in a cybertruck. Kids very easily conflate wealth with authority",
