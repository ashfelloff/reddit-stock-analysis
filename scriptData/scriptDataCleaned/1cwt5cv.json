  "selftext": "Hello fellow WSB enjoyers, I interrupt your usual programming to write this about a hidden gem stonk from the Beaver State: Dutch Bros (BROS). \n\nDutch Bros is an Oregon-based company where they set up these [little huts ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Bros._Coffee#/media/File:DB_GPDowntownstore.png)and sell both coffee and sugary drinks that Americans are addicted to. There is very little real estate needed, no bathroom, and you best believe the products have a high markup. \n\n  \nDespite expanding rapidly (literally opening 45 stores in like 14 states) Dutch Bros had positive income last quarter, and everything from same-store sales to revenue is way up YoY. This is impressive, as opening new stores in new places could potentially raise revenue while lowering same-store sales because of the legwork it takes to advertise a new brand, but they are managing to profit, increase same-store sales, and enter new markets all at once. \n\nReading the bear case I found a few points people are making against investing in Dutch Bros. Here's why they're all wrong.\n\n  \nAbility to continue expanding: Dutch Bros has plans to open 4000 more stores in the coming years, and they have 800+ open today. I think that this is not only reasonable but they could honestly open even more stores long term. I'm from Oregon, and not only does my little town of 10k have a Dutch Bros but where I currently live, Eugene Oregon, *has 12 stores in a city of 200k*. We have Starbucks (though one of them was just vandalized) as well as small coffee shops, but Dutch Bros still manages to operate 12 stores in a 200k city that mostly consists of broke college kids. I highly doubt they will be able to operate at the same stores per capita in most other areas, but even managing a fraction of this would allow them to open thousands more. \n\n  \nBranding: The article I read raised questions about the moat (or ability to prevent opponents from entering the industry) as well as their ability to raise the brand's profile. While I am a WSV regard and not an expert I think that Dutch Bros is in a position to easily create a strong brand. Not only is Dutch Bros seen as a cool young person brand, they already have a number of aesthetic designs that they sell on products. I couldn't find any on the official store website (wtf guys you're dropping the ball here), but my friend used to work at Dutch Bros and would come over with everything from coffee mugs to shirts (a quick google search will show you some). I am a soft drink fiend and so I haven't been to Dutch Bros in a while, but I'l pretty sure you can buy these in stores. \n\nThe Dutch Bros Logo is straight up good-looking, their drinks have lots of pretty colors, and their drive through is an efficient and cost effective model. Dutch Bros is already a brand with a cult-following in the PNW, and there's no reason this won't be the case across the country. \n\n  \nI'll end with two more bullish points:\n\nThe first is that people are boycotting Starbucks because for Palestine. To be blunt this probably isn't going to stop because it's unclear how Starbucks is really helping Israel in the first place. An article I found from the University of Texas said Starbucks revenues decreased 20k and the other coffee shop had a 25k increase because of this, and if this happens across the country Dutch Bros will get more business, not to mention the loyal customers they may get when the people who start going to Dutch Bros keep going there by force of habit. \n\nThe second is that Dutch Bros has a lot of markets it can expand into. [https://www.dutchbros.com/locations-](https://www.dutchbros.com/locations-) This won't load for me right now but when I looked at it a couple of days ago I saw that DB is still absent from a lot of huge markets. The fact that they can operate without these markets and are still making a profit and rapidly increasing their revenue means that as they start moving into LA and the NorthEast states they'll have room to grow. \\\\\n\n\n\nTLDR: Dutch Bros could be for coffee what Nike is for sports apparel. They are expanding rapidly and making money while doing so. \n\n  \nThis is not investment advice, invest at your own risk. \n\nPositions: 125 shares though I sold a covered call before earnings. I'm planning to add to my position as time goes on. ",

      "body": "Dutch Bros has demonstrated impressive financial growth and resilience over the past few years, as evidenced by their income statement and balance sheet. The company’s total revenue has shown a robust upward trajectory, increasing from $497.9 million in 2021 to over $1 billion in the trailing twelve months (TTM) of 2023. This strong revenue growth is coupled with a significant improvement in profitability metrics. Operating income has turned positive, moving from substantial losses in 2021 to $72 million in the TTM of 2023. Net income has also shown a remarkable turnaround, transitioning from a net loss of $12.7 million in 2021 to a net profit of $12.6 million in the TTM of 2023. These improvements underscore the company’s enhanced operational efficiency and effective cost management.\n\nOn the balance sheet front, Dutch Bros has significantly expanded its asset base, with total assets growing from $553.7 million in 2021 to $1.76 billion in 2023. This growth in assets is supported by a substantial increase in equity, which has more than tripled from $213.7 million in 2021 to $675.9 million in 2023. The company has also improved its liquidity position, as evidenced by the positive shift in working capital from a deficit in previous years to a positive $67.1 million in 2023. While the company’s total liabilities and debt levels have increased, they remain proportionate to the overall growth in assets and equity, indicating a balanced approach to leveraging for growth. Additionally, the improvement in tangible book value and invested capital highlights the company’s strong investment in tangible assets and overall financial health.\n\nIn summary, Dutch Bros' financial statements reflect a company on a strong growth path with improved profitability, an increased asset base, and a strengthened equity position. These factors combined suggest a solid foundation for future expansion and a positive outlook. \n\n**TL;DR:** Dutch Bros is crushing it! Revenues are up, they've flipped from losses to profits, and their asset game is strong. Equity is tripling, working capital is back in the green, and they're investing smartly. 🚀📈 Dutch Bros to the moon! 🌙🚀",

Combined, that's ~12 million.    \n      \nThe metro area of LA is ~18.5 million, and NYC's metro area is ~19 million.     \n     \nMy point/joke was that NYC and LA drink more coffee, which hilariously holds true for the broader definition of the PNW that sometimes includes Western MT, Northern Idaho, or even Northern Cali. I'm not exactly sure where the border is....but now I also feel like I've over explained my joke, and it's not funny anymore. It probably never was, idk. Cheers.",

People usually don't buy frozen drinks in the middle of winter.\n\n\nThat being said, with climate change, there won't be much of a winter anymore.",

      "body": "Couple things,  hard to expand in this market,  no matter where you go in America the people are really starting to feel the pressure of the inflated economy and spending $5.00 on a drink is less likely than it was in the past.  \n\n\nCouple that with commercial real estate and building prices and growth is becoming more difficult.  \n\nLastly need.  As a consumer am I in need of this product? No.  If they opened one tomorrow a couple blocks from me would I go? If so how often?  I would at least go once but after that I like many other people have started to have to shore up their money/financial situation.  Start cutting back on expenses that once you just shoulder shrugged off and most of these “cut” expenses are little things that add up.  \nFor example you have Hulu Netflix and amazon prime for streaming.  People are having to pull back to just having one as they are all continuing to increase their subscription rates.   Going out for coffee at Starbucks v making it at home has already started happening as Starbucks has seen a decrease in sales.   Going out for fast food or to eat has seen a pull back especially for large chains in particular.\n\nNot saying you are wrong, they very well may succeed but in this economy I don’t see how they could afford to rapidly expand or be able to convince me to spend $6.00 on a coffee/sugary drink in todays world over the Starbucks or Dunkin’ Donuts that is already on every corner.  At least Starbucks has one thing going for it and that is the WiFi and the ability to get business people in there for a cup of coffee/tea while you have an online meeting or are speaking with potential clients and to bring in your laptop, order a cup of coffee and you can stay all day.   That alone helps Starbucks immensely. I work from home on the computer and own my own business.   I can sit all day at my house or go out for a coffee around noon and spend the afternoon sitting outside Starbucks feeling motivated and better to just to outside. Granted this is still rare for me but if I’m going to BROS, DD or Starbucks there must be a reason other than just to go buy an overpriced coffee.   \n\nI live in a small town we have 5 local owned coffee shops, 3 dunking donuts and 1 Starbucks.  \nGuess who gets the most business for coffee?  None of them.  The most coffee comes from a local diner where you can buy a breakfast for less than $10 and get stuffed while unlimited coffee cost 99 cents\n\nThat’s what people want these days is to feel like they are getting a good deal for their purchase.  Please explain how BROS will do this",
