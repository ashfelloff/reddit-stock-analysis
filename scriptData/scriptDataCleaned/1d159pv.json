Yes that's right Google has Workspace (Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, Calendar). They have 3B users and a lot of small companies use them over Microsoft Office. My company does. Perfect place to roll out AI tools.\n\nAnd let's not forget Google has one of the largest most business critical ecosystems of them all, their Ads ecosystem.

They’re working together to integrate their AI related services. They’re partnering to accelerate AI startups using Google cloud and nvidia hardware.\n\nGoogle is partnered with Intel, Qualcomm, ARM, etc in order to create an open standard AI accelerator software ecosystem to challenge Nvidia CUDA.

Sure Google flopped on launching AI first, but theyre still best positioned to succeed with it.",
