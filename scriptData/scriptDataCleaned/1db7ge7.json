  "selftext": "This was my first ever crypto trade, back when BTC was $619. I ended up cashing out all of my holdings in 2017. In total my holdings would‚Äôve been worth $14.3 million today. I had mostly Dogecoin, ETH, XRP, Dash, Monero, and BTC. How do I get over the fact that I could have $14.3 million today but instead have zero crypto? It makes me sick thinking about it and it really does make me depressed. I had all winning trades and if I just held onto all of my crypto my life would look 100 times different than it does today. Anyone else go through this? Idc if you talk sh*t, just looking for some advice. ",

Professional traders get stopped out for a loss, sometimes miss opportunities, and sometimes get out too early. Why? Because while you can get odds in your favor, every trade can be different and unpredictable. That is why you need to have short memory, just forget and move on. There are many people who even make money in a trade, and then when they get out, and see it going further, start complaining and saying what ifs. My hind sight bank account is full of millions, and so is probably every other trader‚Äôs on the planet. But the right mentality, is not to dwell on what ifs, but rather figure out why it happened, what you could have done better, and learn from that situation. So, when you see a similar predicament the next time, you will be ready. One thing should always be remembered, markets always give opportunities to those who keep an open mind and open eyes. If you missed one, or two or three, there will always be four, five and six to catch the next time. If you live in the what ifs, you just going to eat yourself alive on the inside.
