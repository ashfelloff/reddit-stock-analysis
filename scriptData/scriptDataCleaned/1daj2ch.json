I’m truly baffled by the anti musk hate or even aside from that… people’s apparent inability to comprehend logic and legislation. Even the first court didn’t just say “it’s too much”. That isn’t a reason for voiding a legal contract. Discussions on the approval process for the contract etc would be the intelligent and only valid counter here… but I don’t seem to see that anywhere. \n\nReddit was solid 10-12 years ago, started dying around 2018, and fully died in 2020/2021. It’s become no better than IG and used to be a place where the more intelligent and logical folk discussed things and had real discourse",
