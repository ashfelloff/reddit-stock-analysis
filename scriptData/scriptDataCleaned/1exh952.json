The govt sells bills to the Fed, in return for cash that the Fed literally pulled from nowhere. The Fed ends up with a bunch of Treasurys on their balance sheet. They receive interest payments on those Treasurys, but then they just refund that interest back to the govt. And the govt gets a bunch of money for nothing and chicks for free.\n\nThe Fed can also work the other way, which is quantitative tightening. They can sell their Treasurys to the open market in exchange for cash, then hold that cash on their balance sheet and basically take it out of circulation.\n\nThe stock market has tracked the total amount of money in the economy with slavish consistency since 2010, so tracking the Fed's balance sheet (and how much money they are printing or sucking up) is just as or more important than rates.",

The squeeze cycle is usually what triggers the cascading leading to recession.\nOnce companies stop being able to increase margins by raising prices, they begin to cut costs.\n\n\nThis works for a while, but inevitably, the cost cutting has a bounce back effect. Too many positions are cut, leading to increased costs.\n\nAt the same time, many companies will try to lower costs o increase sales volume. This works for a short time.\nAt some point, the cumulative loss of disposable income due to job loss and cut hours causes companies to start losing money.\n\n\nThis is the breaking point where many companies go under, causing an unemployment spiral, which is basically the start of the recession.\n\n\nWe're about 70% of the way there.",
