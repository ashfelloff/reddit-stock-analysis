  "selftext": "Nvidia reported earnings after the bell that beat Wall Street expectations, and provided stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.\n\nNvidia shares fell 8% in extended trading.\n\nHere is how the company did versus LSEG consensus expectations:\n\nEarnings per share: 68 cents adjusted vs. 64 cents expected\nRevenue: $30.04 billion vs. $28.7 billion expected\nNvidia said it expects about $32.5 billion in current-quarter revenue, versus $31.7 billion expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount. That would be an increase of 80% from a year earlier.\n\nRevenue continues to surge at the chipmaker, rising 122% on an annual basis during the quarter, following three straight periods of year-over-year growth in excess of 200%.\n\nNet income more than doubled to $16.6 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter, from $6.18 billion, or 25 cents per share, in the year-ago period. \n\nNvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom. Nvidia shares are up more than 150% this year after soaring almost 240% in 2023. Its market cap recently eclipsed $3 trillion, and Nvidia was briefly the most valuable public company in the world, though it is now second to Apple.\n\nRevenue in Nvidia’s data center business, which includes its AI processors, climbed 154% from a year earlier to $26.3 billion, accounting for 88% of total sales. It also topped StreetAccount expectations of $25.24 billion.\n\nNot all of those sales are AI chips. Nvidia said Wednesday that $3.7 billion in revenue came from the company’s networking products.\n\nMuch of its business is targeted at a handful of cloud service providers and consumer internet companies including Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla. Nvidia’s chips, such as the H100 and H200, are used in the vast majority of generative AI applications, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nMany customers are waiting for Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip, called Blackwell. Nvidia said it shipped samples of Blackwell chips during the quarter, and made a change to the product to make it more efficient to manufacture.",
