What effectively happened is that not only were the securities they owned effectively worthless, but they also owed massive amounts of money to anyone who bought the CDOs.¬†\n\n\nTo put it more succinctly, the entire banking system essentially found themselves with owing a massive amount of money while having effectively no revenue stream of their own.¬† This was kicked off by what would typically be a small recession, but catalyzed into a disaster as mortgages started to default.\n\n\nNow, a recession isn't necessarily going to be as bad as 2008 just because the economic indicators are similarish.¬† Equally, a recession isn't going to be minor just because mortgage defaults don't happen.¬† Rather, how severe it becomes essentially revolves around how exposed various sectors are to a recession, and it's effects.¬†¬†\n\n\nBanking institutions aren't doing the exact same incredibly idiotic things they were doing in the 2000s.¬† They may, or may not, be doing something else that is incredibly idiotic.

I doubt he believed any of these things but if he said the truth, inflation would have been higher as people would have expected higher inflation and would have been more willing to raise prices and pay higher prices. I think something similar is happening here. They need to say it‚Äôs a soft landing so people don‚Äôt panic. I‚Äôm hoping for a soft landing. I think the government and fed also hope for a soft landing as that creates less political turbulence for them. The corporations are the ones that hope for hard landings. Corporations have become too big to fail and the government will do whatever it takes to keep this show running. The hard landings leads to very lucrative bailouts and leads to inflation, increasing the dollar value of stocks and properties.",
