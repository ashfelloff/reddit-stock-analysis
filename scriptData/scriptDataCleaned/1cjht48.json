It's always been inflation, which comes out in 2 weeks. The Fed silent period is also over, which means next week could be a repeat of what happened after March 20 when basically all Fed officials walked back Powell's FOMC dovish tilt.\n\nWith the April non-manufacturing ISM employment down to 45, and prices going up to almost 60, April doesn't look like it's starting too well. It's basically the worst of both worlds, and if the employment number doesn't get revised up later on, it could be an early alarm signal that the service sector is starting to roll over.",
