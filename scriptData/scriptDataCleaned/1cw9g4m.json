  "selftext": "My dog was bought at peak recession in Nov. â€˜09. I swear he is a fucking living representation of the economy. 2020 gets cancer big time thought he was gonna die.. Nope.\n\n He has surprised each and everyone of us how long he has lived. I believe he will die in the next recession. The fact that he is still hanging on is absurd. Heâ€™s a 15 y/o golden retriever and still jumps up like a goddamn pup. Just like our economy. Iâ€™ll buy another dog to predict the next recession. Thank you ðŸ«¡\n\nGreat dog btw. Bearish bets on his life would not have paid off but at this point itâ€™d be a miracle. Like our economy holding on another full 2 years.",
