  "selftext": "I was looking at the balance sheet of apple in a video I was watching and it showed that apples equity has been going down a lot from 2017 to 2021 .When they looked closer at the equity statements they concluded that it was because they were doing large share buybacks, so cash was used to buy the stock ie assets were reduced as cash is an asset.\n\nHowever even though cash was used to buyback stocks , the stock in itself is also an asset and the price of apple stock has only gone up from 2017 to 2021 so this should more than counteract the effect of assets reduction due to cash being used to buy back shares and thus equity really shouldn't have changed significantly because of that .",

      "body": "Apple’s equity has been declining despite share buybacks because, while cash used for buybacks reduces assets, the repurchased shares are retired and not held as assets on the balance sheet. As a result, both assets and shareholders’ equity decrease, reflecting the buyback’s effect. Rising stock prices don’t directly counterbalance this reduction since repurchased shares are no longer accounted for in equity.\n\n\nEdit:\n\nYou have to remember, buying back shares is like paying back debt in a way.  Apple corporation can’t own voting rights in itself.  When a company buys back its shares, it’s cancelling out the initial process of issuing the shares which raised capital.  The shares themselves are retired.\n\nEdit #2:\n\ntreasury stock is part of equity but is reported as a negative or a contra-equity account on the balance sheet. It represents shares that a company has repurchased from shareholders and is no longer considered outstanding. Because treasury stock reduces the overall shareholders’ equity, it is subtracted from total equity.",
