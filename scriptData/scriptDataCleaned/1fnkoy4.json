      "body": "Sold the calls expiring end of this week for 40% profits, but kept the stocks for the next few years. I am positive about Micron for the long term and there is no point in selling at such a low P/E. They should rise much higher next year when their supply from the US and Indian production units comes online. Both are getting significant incentives from their respective governments. Once they go live in India, they get significant protection from duties as opposed to competitors from the rest of Asia. Similarly, the CHIPs Act will get them the funding they need for US production.\n\nI think they are well-placed to capitalize on their investments.",
