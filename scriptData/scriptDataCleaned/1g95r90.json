              "body": "hmm.. how much? Well, if I were building an economic model, I would start off asking the question, does it provide a solution that people would pay for? If so, what problems will it solve, and how much might that be worth to your targeted market?\n\nI think this product reinforces the notion that you are going to get fucked if you make bad options trades. For most people this would result in more thoughtful decisions, and less bad trades. However, there may also be a minority of people who would find this type of activity encouraging, which is why I would install an \"inverse\" switch, so that if getting fucked in the ass was an incentive, we would not lose market share to Boeing, who is still fucking two astronauts vigorously as I type this (and they appear to be willing participants).\n\nI'm still interested in bringing this venture public, and think that I can get both Cathy Woods and Jim Cramer to sign on, as long as we tell them that our \"losses carried forward\" will be epic. I know at the very least, Cathy likes to make sure she is prepared taxwise to be able to earn a lot of profits while ensuring her \"losses carried forward\" mean she won't be paying taxes until well after the rapture. And I think Cramer just likes fucking anybody who will watch his show.\n\nTo finally get to the point, we are selling these to people who either want to get fucked as punishment, or want to get fucked as a reward. Basically, options traders; the sadistic weirdos who would 0dte Grinder if they thought they might be able to post epic loss porn on /wsb. So, to honor all those who like to get fucked, I think a price point of $100,000 works, and we can partner with TSLA to add it as an option in all of their vehicles, I would think that an extremely high number of the Cyber Truck owners would pay for it without question.",

It has a grid system that you can put \"widgets\" onto and can resize to your preference. You can make it as simple or complex as you want. Right now my setup just has index charts with their respective option chains showing bid/ask/deltas and an orders widget to edit on the fly. I'm more excited for their futures release tbh.
