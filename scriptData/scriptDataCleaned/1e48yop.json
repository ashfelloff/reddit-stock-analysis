The amount of data processing that goes behind the scenes for all these games is incredible to the point digital marketers from these companies are similar to hiring an ex google engineer in the digital advertising space.\n\nAdd to that the data science that goes into keeping you playing. There's a reason why a bunch of people are on level 2300 still playing. They are/were also competing with thousands of other clones since \"creating\" a mobile gaming app isn't exactly difficult.\n\nThe difficult part is the stuff I mentioned above - they released their first game in 2012 just when mobile gaming was kicking off so I wouldn't be surprised if they also pioneered the user level analysis for gaming apps.\n\nTo give an example: Candy Crush probably spends millions of USD per day on app campaigns. Lets assume a user plays the game for 90 days average. What Candy Crush had to figure out (and did) how to model if these users that downloaded the game today would be profitable at the end of 90 days. The alternative would be spend $1m today, wait 3 months realize they're not profitable users, optimize campaigns and then wait another 3 months. Or imagine spending $1m for 90 days only to realize that on 91st day that your campaign wasnt bring in profitable users. There goes $90m down the drain.\n\nSo they 'track' your every movement in the game, your every click, your every interaction so on and so forth until millions of lines of data are created and patterns start to emerge. Oh the sort of people reaching level 10 within the first half hour of playing generates $100 in revenue at the end of 90 days.\n\nSo great 10000 of these people download your game you break even sounds simple enough. But then how do you find these people? How much do you bid for them? How much would I have to pay you to complete level 10 within the first half hour of playing? Maybe you would charge $10, a kid might charge $5 etc. etc.\n\nLets say you pay $10 - great 100.000 downloads - what's the ratio of downloads to level 10 in firsts half hour on average? data says %5 - well shit only 5k people of that 100k will reach your goal, half of what was required. Back to the drawing board.\n\nThere's so many minute little details that goes into making a game successful especially in a space where you can create a game from your bedroom with minimal funds to the point that where anyone can do it being successful isn't by chance. Hell I didn't even get into creatives and the thousands of A/B tests they do just increase download rate by %1.",
