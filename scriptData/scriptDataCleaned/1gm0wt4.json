Forget it will rip countless TAX PAYING hard working undocumented folks from their citizen children and grandchildren after decades in this county.

You guys who are cheering 🥭for being a boon to the economy clearly don’t understand what happens if this plan and/or his tariffs go through. We’re fucked.",
