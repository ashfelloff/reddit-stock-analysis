You have a perspective on money that‚Äôs very much putting it up on a pedestal , if this amount hurts you this much, trading isn‚Äôt for you. But also you can jsut invest. Stock market has many approaches. I‚Äôve made and lost this much while having zero ‚Äúregular‚Äù income and feel nothing. This is likely why I have nice some profit today off funded accounts. Made really all of it back and have a lot of experience and a bankroll now that I know will keep growing from here. I blew up tens of thousands at the start . But this type of shit will not work in the stock market. I lost 20k+ while in college and no income lmao. I didn‚Äôt cry like this, I just went to class the next day and looked at charts more while in class. The results we see from you today are a product of this mentality most likely . Also maybe you feel less bad about the money maybe it‚Äôs bein wrong so many times in a  Row because clearly there wasn‚Äôt even anything besides one early\nUptick in the chart which is likely the product of overleverage on short term expirations. You can trade those, but you definitely gotta have balls bigger than ‚Äú20k L is the worst feeling in the world‚Äù eat some damn food you depressed fuck you‚Äôll be fine you literally have a job ü§£",

Also study what bitcoin is and why it is an optimal asset, study the cycles, go down that rabbit hole ( Micheal Saylor deep) and thank me later.\n\nWhenever you take an L in life, don‚Äôt feel sad for yourself, its only a lesson you had to learn, stand up restrategize and go back fighting harder, you would make it.
