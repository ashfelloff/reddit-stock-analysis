  "selftext": "I believe we're just starting in the rotation into small caps, and that Tom Lee is right that there's going to be a 30-40% gains in Russell 2000 (IWM) ~~by end of year~~ in 10 weeks. Lee thinks the economy is going to slow down and that \"inflation will drop like a rock.\"\n\nI know that might be controversial but that's not the part I'm looking to discuss. \n\nAssuming Russell 2000 will go up 40% ~~by end of year~~ in 10 weeks, what kind of call option would you buy here? I've sold a lot of covered calls and puts for small gains, but never bought calls before, so was wondering what the play with (like for example how much into the money would you go?)\n\n* Thank you /u/C63SAMG911 for catching my mistake.",

I’ll target the 1/17/2025 expiry since the 12/31/2024 expiry date has low OI and try to maximize gains given your expected price.  \n\nIn the money - 200c @ 29.1 ask, 100 at expiry for 240% gain\n\nAt the money - 220c @ 15.4 ask, 80 at expiry for 420% gain (blaze it)\n\nReasonably out of the money - 250c @ 4.7 ask, 50 at expiry for 960% gain\n\nInsanely out of the money - 280c @ 1.4, 20 at expiry for 1330% gain\n\nThe farther out of the money you go, the higher the reward for correctly timing a huge move.

Small cap stocks outperformed large cap stocks 11.99% to 10.35%. But basically all of that premium came in one nine year window between 1975 and 1983 when small cap stocks were up more than 1,400% in total. Small caps outperformed large caps 35.3% to 15.7% per year in that time. Take away that outlier and the long-run returns are much closer.1\n\n>One explanation for the strong outperformance during that period was the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) by Congress in 1974, making it far easier to pension funds to diversify into small stocks. Another was the turn of investors to buy small stocks following the collapse of the big-cap Nifty Fifty stocks earlier in the decade.",

Don't chase a ten bagger, lock in your profits after you've achieved your objectives. Then you can look for the next opportunity. Also, probably wise to cut your losses if you're down and close to expiration. Theta decay will rip you to shreds I'd things are going the wrong way.\n\n\nAnyway that's how I do it.

Id buy and hold small caps and buy a put on a stupid yolo ai company like meta or Tesla or even something just simply overpriced like wing but that’s me. Hard to short but not impossible.\n\nHonestly tho most large growth swings are from hype and stupidity and tech companies that sell vague products marketed as fix alls are way more prone to that than simple companies with obvious roles in the market. Hence why I’d buy a put in something over priced as the veil is pierced rather than buy a call for something practical. \n\nOR you could buy a call for a company that is shifting into the tech space from not being in it previously.

Because options would offer better returns if OPs thesis is right. If he's planning to play a 10-16 week breakout, and he's confident in his thesis, then options would yield much higher returns than holding the underlying, while being less risky. Buying IMT/ATM leaps is basically locking in a 2X leverage at the very least if this thing keeps running.\n\nSee u/paypertrade 's figures here:  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e9mvo2/comment/leflgk4/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e9mvo2/comment/leflgk4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",
