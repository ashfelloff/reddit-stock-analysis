  "selftext": "The below chart comes from [the FDIC's latest quarterly report](https://www.fdic.gov/news/speeches/fdic-quarterly-banking-profile-first-quarter-2024). According to the FDIC, total unrealized losses are $516.5 billion for the quarter. This isn't an actual loss since it wouldn't be realized if all of the bank assets can be held until maturity, but that seems like a big freakin' IF. \n\nIf on the other hand a large group of people decided to cash out their money all at once, it would be very bad news for that bank.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wzfgxgx0i04d1.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=957439ee21e65172dee070a05b6b7b495845e107\n\nI have no idea what this means exactly but it doesn't seem very good for a lot of banks. What would be the play here?\n\n🤔",

This is most likely to happen when the mortgage-holders just walk away, allowing their collateral to be seized and sold by the bank rather than waste money paying their mortgage. Maybe this happens soon, when Trump tries to sell a tower or two to pay his bills. Maybe they kite it down the road for years.\n\nThe play is to figure out which banks have the most commercial real estate exposure (CBRE, for example, has tons) and buy puts that stretch out as far as you can. The problem is that you're fucked, they're not gonna collapse until after your puts expire, and also you're fucked because the government can see this coming and will just give them free money and you'll lose and they'll give themselves big bonuses.

      "body": "Coming back to this thread after doing some work b/c as the comments suggest it feels like a fools play. But there are some banks such as Valley National Bank, Hope Bank, and Bank OZK where CRE loans as a percentage of total loans jumps out at you. If there is truly something like 2 trillion of CRE debt floating around there, how can you ignore this? These percentages were calculated using the banks most recent 10K filed in 2024 for year 2023. I am not a banker so I have questions about some of these numbers and won't pretend to know what it all means.\n\n**Valley National Bank**\n\n* CRE exposure to total loans: 64.3%\n* Net loan charge-off .13%. \n* Net loan charge-offs increased $42.9 million to $62.0 million in 2023 as compared to $19.1 million in 2022. \n* CRE charge offs increased by 346% from 2022 to 2023.\n\n\\*CRE charge offs increasing by 346% in a year?? That can't be good. What I don't understand is how the percentage of total loans charged off as a loss by default is only .13% — which is great for a bank. Can it be they aren't realizing a significant amount of their losses? This is where I get hesitant to make a bet.\n\n**Bank OZK**\n\n* Net charge offs .13%, up from .04% last year ... again very low but a decent jump from year before\n* CRE 72% of total loans\n* \"Any unexpected deterioration in the credit quality of our commercial real estate loan portfolio would require us to increase our provision for credit losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be liquidated as easily as residential real estate. If we foreclose on these loans, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than residential properties because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral.\"\n* \\^This is directly from their form 10K. They are telling us the risks, but when will this materialize?\n\n**Hope Bank**\n\n* CRE 64% of total loans\n* .22% net loan charge offs up from .08% recovery last year (another decent jump)\n\nAnyone with more knowledge have any feedback? I didn't dig into treasury holdings for these banks because I feel it's pointless to try and predict a run on banks. That being said, the FED has delayed cutting rates for a while now. First it was a call for a March rate cut 2024.. that didn't happen. Then they wanted a cut for June and July meetings... didn't happen. Here we are in September and they want a 50bps cut. Rates have been higher for longer and a further delay of cuts/bounce in inflation is not off the table.",
