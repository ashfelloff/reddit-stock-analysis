              "body": "The odds do not drive the truth and knowledge that the market has. It's possible that any large fund with an interest in improving a candidate's odds could sink money into the betting market, but that is a transient. The dominant force of any betting market is the true outcome, so if one candidate got a boost but in reality was losing, then a) the fund would lose money (poor incentive to start) and b) the odds would rebalance anyway as knowledge is distributed and updated. This transient is obviously less apparent as more people and money participate in the betting market (no one player can overwhelm the odds). But basically, someone could whale in a betting market to change the odds, but no amount of whaling is going to change the underlying knowledge and outcome. It would just be losing money unless they were right, which is the point of betting. There is a total incentive to bet in a way that supports what you know about reality, and a total disincentive to bet in a way that you want to change the perception of the odds, because if you are against the winner, you will lose, and if you are for, then you just followed the first mentioned incentive.",
