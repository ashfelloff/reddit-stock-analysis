  "selftext": "1. Neutron, Rocket Lab’s medium class vehicle, will be a better Falcon 9 imo because it was designed for reusability from the start. Cutting-edge carbon fiber body had already been battle tested with electron, and it’s likely each Neutron first stage will eventually be capable of 20 flights (landing propulsively as F9 does. 9 archimedes engines will power neutron and the first production Archimedes was tested at 102% power, which indicates the engine should be ready for first flight in mid 2025. \n2. Peter Beck is all the genius that Elon is without the personality disorder and behavioral baggage. He’s a genius engineer who founded the company back in 2006, and has grown it into what it is today. \n3. Electron reached 50 flights faster than any launch vehicle in history (even faster than F9)\n\n4. Company on track to do $400 million in annual revenue this year; their last quarter was their best ever.\n\n5. Space systems currently makes up 2/3 their revenue, which is higher margin and less lumpy than launch revenue. \n\n6. Rocket Lab’s end game is to build & operate their own constellation, just as SpaceX has done with Starlink. Peter hasn’t specified exactly what the application will be, but he hinted on this last earnings call that they have a plan, but he’s keeping his cards close to this chest. \n\n7. Company should be profitable sometime in 2026 because Neutron R&D will be greatly reduced after first flight. \n\nI own 12,000 shares. Do your own research, thanks for reading. ",

By then there will be more info about the direction they plan to take regarding a constellation. \n\nTheir recent record breaking quarter saw $100m in revenue, they plan to sell Neutron launches for $55m each with plans to eventually ramp up cadence to one a month by 2030 which seems pretty high potential for a $2.5b market cap company.
