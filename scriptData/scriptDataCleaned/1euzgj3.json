                      "body": "I'm not saying everyone should experience true homelessness to understand the meaning of life and develop a special kind of fortitude, but I think people who have been through it due to circumstances, obviously have a different kind of experience to the vast majority, which could help them. It's certainly not a \"romantic liberation from the rat race\" because this isn't what anyones aspires to. It's not anyone's ideal. \n\nalso, the formerly homeless dude (who has an ease about him and a happy-go-lucky attitude like he has no worries) I was basing my remarks off of actually was homeless in a country other than the USA and like he says, if you're going to be homeless, then his country is a good country to be homeless in due to all the social supports, government safety nets, etc...that make being homeless comparably 'easy' compared to say, a country like Sudan and even the USA. He's also unique in that he's never touched drugs and alcohol and lives a clean lifestyle as much as possible. He's also travelled all over the world, which I think also gives people different and valuable perspectives. He gives the impression that he's not attached to anything material or any person and that is freeing. Also, that he could easily live a nomadic life and actually recommends it. But he has money now.\n\nEven being able to know how to do camping is a kind of resourcefulness a lot of people don't have.\n\nI get that a lot of people in the US are working three menial, low-paying jobs just to survive. They're living pay-check-to-pay-check and even then, sometimes living out of their car. Even people who are doing slightly better are one serious health condition away from being in suffocating debt and/or financial ruin. That is an anxiety-inducing situation, which would also worsen your health. This narrative that some people aren't \"working hard enough\" is absolute BS because clearly they are working really hard. It's propagated by the wealthy and it clearly serves their agenda to pay people peanuts and for them to enjoy the spoils of other people's hard work.",
