Yes Boeing needs to get back to being the company we were pre MD merger with engineers running the company and not accountants. It truly felt like they bought us and not vice versa. We need to get Spirit back in the fold and get back to being the company this country needs it to be. The ramifications of Boeing going under would cripple our economy as it’s not just the 170K that work here it’s the other 2.5 million in support/supply chain and all the companies that depend on the income from aerospace jobs to shop,eat, rent, vacation ect. Then take in accoyfor what it means for our national security as we make many many incredible platforms for our military. As for space, shits gonna happen. The helium leaks will be taken care of.
