  "selftext": "[Macy’s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/M/) decision to close nearly a third of its stores will spark change in malls and communities across the U.S.\n\nSome of those transformations may catch shoppers by surprise.\n\nThe retailer said in late February that it [plans to close about 150](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-will-close-150-stores-open-new-bloomingdales-bluemercury.html) of its namesake locations by early 2027. Macy’s has not yet revealed which stores it will shutter. When CEO Tony Spring announced the move, he said the stores that Macy’s will close account for 25% of the company’s gross square footage but less than 10% of its sales.\n\nThe company plans to invest more in the approximately 350 namesake stores that will remain, and open new locations for its better-performing brands: higher-end department store Bloomingdale’s and beauty chain Bluemercury.\n\nYet the closures will be the latest catalyst that pressures malls to evolve to changing consumer tastes. Macy’s is shuttering stores as the growth of online shopping and demographic shifts mean some small towns or regions can no longer support a bustling shopping center.\n\nMacy’s closures will ultimately be a good thing for many malls and customers, said Chris Wimmer, senior director at Fitch Ratings who tracks real estate investment trusts. The department store’s exit will accelerate the inevitable demise of “low quality malls that really don’t need to exist anymore,” Wimmer said. The closures will give the owners of healthier malls a chance to breathe new life and relevance into a shopping center.\n\nIn those malls, which tend to have better locations and owners with stronger balance sheets, he said owners are “itching to get their hands on their Macy’s” and free up prime real estate.\n\nMacy’s owns the majority of its namesake stores. That dates back to when mall owners would give department stores a space to draw shoppers and make money by charging other retailers rent.\n\nMacy’s closures will also make way for real estate developments that may better match the changing demographics or economy of their surroundings, whether through construction of a medical building, a retirement community or a grocery store.\n\nBut Wimmer acknowledged some of the closed Macy’s may be a tougher sell, and their exit could be the nail in the coffin for a mall that’s becoming an eyesore.\n\n“If it’s in a really bad location where no one wants to spend money to knock it down, then it could rot,” he said.\n\nShoppers walk through the Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, a shopping mall in Arlington, Virginia, February 2, 2024.Saul Loeb | Afp | Getty Images\n\n# Downsizing department stores\n\nMacy’s is trimming its locations as department stores and malls alike dwindle.\n\nMacy’s has left many malls already. It has closed more than a third of its namesake stores over the last 10 years. As of early May, the company had 503 Macy’s stores, including a small number of [other concepts outside malls](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/03/macys-to-open-up-to-30-new-stores-in-strip-malls.html).\n\nOther anchors have downsized or disappeared from malls, including Sears, Lord & Taylor and JCPenney.\n\nThe number of malls has shrunk as well. Real estate firms typically divide malls into class A and B, which have higher occupancy rates and lower sales density, and class C and D, which have lower occupancy rates and higher sales density.\n\nThere were 352 shopping malls classified as Class A and B at the end of 2016, according to company reports, S&P Capital IQ and Coresight Research. That fell to 316 malls by the end of 2022.\n\nThat decline is sharper among Class C and D shopping malls, which fell from 684 malls in 2016 to 287 in 2022, according to the companies’ research.\n\nWeak U.S. malls have become weaker, and the strong shopping centers have become places where all [retailers](https://www.ainvest.com/news/impact-of-macy-s-store-closures-on-shopping-malls-a-shift-in-retail-landscape-24081000584586a40f63f9cf/) and consumers want to be, said Anand Kumar, an associate director of research for Coresight. He expects that trend to continue. By 2030, he said, top-tier malls will draw a greater share of total mall spending and more lower-tier malls will either close or be forced to convert more space into non-retail uses.\n\nAt some distressed malls, Macy’s may be the last anchor that remains.\n\nKumar said the U.S. doesn’t need as many malls as customers buy more on retailers’ websites. He added many of the fastest growing retailers in terms of store count, such as [Dollar General](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/DG/), [Five Below](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/FIVE/) and [T.J. Maxx](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TJX/), want to be in suburban strip centers rather than malls.",

Esp in high density cities. \n\nAnecdotally going into a Westfield here in Oz, a lot of the stores now are either high profile high cost Lego/Apple or deliver a service food/hair-dressers/physio/electronic repair etc. things that can’t be delivered online.\n\nWhy pay rent for a brick and mortar store when the main shop window is in everyone’s pocket? \nThis decline has been playing out in the UK Debenhams, House of Fraser, BHS for the last decade. \n\nDollar store etc. or stack it high and sell it cheap stores will probs have a place in lower cost areas simply ‘cos the delivery doesn’t make sense BUT you could argue that Temu is the dollar store on steroids so I think cities in 20 years will look very different to today (as they did 20 years ago). And shop reduction will be one of the main differences. \nIn an ideal world we would reclaim some of these spaces for green public spaces but they’ll probably all be flats. \n\nAnyway; invested in Shopify and Amazon for the long term. Do like Temu but if they IPO’d like Wish before it you would always worry this will just go tits up and links to slave labour and China make it a non-starter. Imagine USA will increase tax on low cost goods to push back against Temu as most of the purchases are under the limit. \n\nThanks for coming to my stream of consciousness xoxox",
