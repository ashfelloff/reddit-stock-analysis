They already can't even get a license from FCC to operate the sats they do have in the sky because they cause major interference at close bandwidths. \n\nASTS is putting 5G capable, streaming video, video call capable satellites into orbit. They've already signed up almost every major cell phone carrier on the planet as partners, not even counting the US government and Google to boot. They are miles ahead of the service offering Starlink is suggesting, and best yet, they only need ~100 satellites to complete their constellation. So when people say \"Elon is doing it,\" those people are misinformed. Elon is years behind on direct to device service. His starlink service providing wifi using a ground based dish is amazing to people living in remote areas. But ASTS is offering direct to mobile device service through phone carriers with minimal extra cost. The potential is huge.",
