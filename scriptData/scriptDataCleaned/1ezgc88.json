  "selftext": "* Powell said \"the time has come\" signaling that rate cuts could soon lower borrowing costs for American consumers and businesses.  This will also lower mortgage rate and boost the housing market.\n* The weakening in the labor market with slowdown in hiring and the increasing unemployment rate.  Combine with progress made in lowering inflation signaled the time has come to lower interest rate. The concern is keeping rates too high for too long with throttling growth that could plunge the economy into recession.\n* The Federal Reserve is increasingly confident that inflation will continue to cool and reaching the 2% annual rate target.\n* The size of the rate cut will significantly depend on the upcoming employment data to be released on Sept. 6th.",

I'll answer - not for your benefit because you're being a prat - but just in case this information is of use to anyone else who might make the mistake of thinking you know what you're talking about.\n\n\"pricing in\" is one of the stupidest terms in use because people don't understand what it means. \n\nThey think there is some magical machine that prices in every eventuality in an ever shifting market like its a mathematical certainty. \n\nPrice in means \"our best guess based on current probabilities and that guess will shift constantly\"\n\nThey aren't pricing in 100bps of cuts before year end. That would be financial suicide and also impossible because we aren't remotely close to there yet and yields change as the bond market trading changes. \n\nThey would bleed money like a stuck pig if they made a wild guesses that far in advance and got it wrong. No one has a crystal ball.\n\nAnd it would be a wild guess because the \"pricing in\" shifts constantly. It is defined by what occurs in the daily trading on the bond market which fluctuates like any other market. There is no magic machine or mystical oracle.\n\nIf you want to understand what that looks like day-to-day, minute by minute, then check out the CBOT or ZQ futures which are the Fed Fund futures (of differing time periods).\n\nIf you prefer your data a little more easy to understand because you're better at reading pictures than charts (which I'm guessing is the case), then use the [CME TOOL](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html) and be very sure to note how much it shifts day to day, month to month, etc. \n\nFor example, when the Japan carry trade unwound and the market shit itself in early August, there was a spike in probabilities of bigger rate cuts, yields tanked, bond prices went up.\n\nThen people stopped panicking and everything reverted as they priced in the new likelihood of less severe cuts. \n\nThese are not stagnant numbers. They are probabilities. They shift as the market shifts, information shifts, economy shifts and geo political events shift.\n\nWhich is why I said they've priced in 25bps for Sept. now (almost absolutely) and that number appears absolutely secure based on Powell's chatter at 10AM today. And that can number can still change.\n\nThey absolutely and categorically have not priced in a 100bps cut by the end of the year. TLT/TMF would have gone parabolic.\n\nCURRENTLY (and it will change), they have priced in a range of everything from a 175bps to 75bps, by Dec. fed meeting - not year end - assigning each bps range with a probability.\n\nAnd this will change EVERY DAY until the rate is locked.\n\n> which is literally 3-4x what the Fed/every other financial institution/economist is forecasting\n\nWho exactly do you think is \"pricing in\" this stuff? A wizard?\n\nInstitutional entities make up a great portion of bond traders who  trade daily and that's where the yields and prices get defined by trading (as those yields and prices reflect what the trader believes is most likely).\n\nThere is a SWATH of institutions and economists who thing the Fed is full of shit. Go google it. You'll find 4,000 articles.\n\nAnd the Fed doesn't even know for sure. They also project and adjust.\n\nTo be very clear, Powell hasn't confirmed a 25bps cut because he can't do that before the next meeting. \n\nThat's just what the market has priced in as of now because it seems like the highest probability.\n\n> could bond yields/mortgage rates actually rise even if the Fed cuts, but not as aggressively as was once thought?\n\nAnything is possible. It's a market. But work through how that might happen...\n\nThe Fed rate defines what banks have to pay to borrow money. Then banks tack on more points as they lend that money out to customers in loans, mortgages etc.\n\nLet's use mortages as an example (although this absolutely works with bonds/t-bills as well).\n\nLet's say the Fed rate is at 5% so banks grab some of that money and lend it out at whatever they want. Let's say they lend it at 7% in the form of mortgages. They net 2% profit on that trade.\n\nThen the Fed drops its rate to 4% so banks grab that 4% money and lend it out. \n\nOne bank decides to lend it out in mortgages set at 9% so they can get a 5% profit.\n\nEvery other bank lends it in mortgages set at 6% so they can get a 2% profit.\n\nWhich mortgages do you think sell?\n\nDo you think the basic LAW of supply/demand will dictate that the 9% mortgage will ever sell in that environment?\n\nNo. So they have to drop the rate.\n\nLike I said, it's the same with yields. They fluctuated with the market and the cornerstone of that market is the Fed rate because that determines the base rate for everything.\n\nAnd yields, in turn, define the price of bonds/treasuries.",

The other side of this is if the fed actually cuts rates significantly in September, 50 bips plus, this will crater the usdjpy carry trade and likely cause a significant down turn in big tech stocks which that alone could affect certain real estate areas negatively. I think the likely outcome is the Fed cuts 25 bips and it has little to no impact on the broader market.\n\nEdit: if you are looking for lower mortgages that are attainable from the Fed cuts I think it’s atleast 2 years out if not 3.",

I think each cut will help more than than the last, but its hard to know which one will truly tip things over. \n\nPeople with low rate mortgages who want to move have been waiting. Some can wait longer others cant or wont. How many people are in each segment of the spectrum is hard to know. \n\nPeople who are first time buyers are likely to see that and some of them will hurry to try to beat that impending increase in demand. \n\nThen there are the sellers. Some sellers are forced to sell for a variety of reasons and that is the bulk of the current market beyond the new home builders. The number of people willing to sell will increase or decrease for a variety of reasons. People lose jobs. They find somewhere they want or need to move to. \n\nThen there is the fact that mortgage rates aren't absolutely tied to the federal rates. They tend to move a bit in anticipation of that. Rates are expected and the mortgage rates are already declining. Probably a bit of supply and demand because the buyers are willing to wait a bit for those rate cuts so the finance guys drop rates a tad to encourage them to sign a few months sooner. \n\nAll I'm saying is that the spot where we have a lot of buyers and sellers could be a long ways down in rate or it could be really close. I think you are right that its probably a bit more than 50 basis points, but if I had to guess it will be a bit above the 3% mark by a decent amount. The sweet spot will likely be around 4-4.25, but the curve will likely show a lot more activity starting at 50 or 75 basis cuts from where we are right now.  Once we get below 4 it will become a frenzy and prices will possibly spiral up as a result.",

If rates drop to a hypothetical 3.5%, that same $1000 month on a 30yr fixed will get you about 230k of purchasing power.\n\nWhich is great!\n\nHowever, this means that more people will want to enter the market because of good rates. More demand, same supply, means that house prices will go up.\n\nSo rates go down, you can spend $1000 a month and get a 230k loan now instead of a 160k loan....but that house that was originally 160k is now being sold at 230k anyway, so you're in the same spot you were before.",
