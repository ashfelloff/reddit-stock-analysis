  "selftext": "Beyond Meat (BYND) is a heavily shorted company as many of you are aware with a high short interest of 39%+ its float.\n\nOn the start of June 27 th trading day BYND entered the regsho inclusion list where the stock has huge price increases on regsho.\n\nWhat is regsho?\n\nAs defined in Rule 203(c)(6) of Regulation SHO, a ‚Äúthreshold security‚Äù is any equity security of any issuer that is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, or that is required to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act (commonly referred to as reporting securities), where, for five consecutive settlement days:\n\nÔÇ∑ There are aggregate fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more per security;\n\nÔÇ∑ The level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issuer‚Äôs total shares outstanding; and\n\nÔÇ∑ The security is included on a list published by a self-regulatory organization (SRO).\n\nA security ceases to be a threshold security if it does not exceed the specified level of fails for five consecutive settlement days.\n\nA security can be added on this because the failures to settle can be a sign of high shorting and improper naked short selling as you can see from the stock‚Äôs high short interest.\n\nWhen BYND is on regsho it is extremely hard to short with limited liquidity and the high cost to borrow rate (IBKR‚Äôs retail fee\n\ncurrently at 111.7216%), there is also a prime rate but that‚Äôs for the bigger players probably around 15-20% which is extremely high regardless. This can lead to an increase in the price of BYND.\n\nAfter T+13 (13 trading days after its been included to the list) force covering begins where they are forced to cover the amount on the first day of regsho inclusion until the stock is off regsho.\n\nThe last two times BYND has been on Regsho the shorts ran the stock up on t+13 th day.\n\n[BYND Chart and regsho trading days](https://preview.redd.it/lce8w2oo8d9d1.png?width=1777&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc37f1671f306c73c0986791d6c8a54739857199)\n\nAs you can see on feb7th BYND entered regsho (see teal lines on chart) and leading up to t+13 the stock‚Äôs price gradually increased and the t+13 th day they decided to cover all their obligations which lead to a huge pump.\n\nThis happened to be also the earnings day of bynd where they decided to use earnings as a cover.\n\nFC on the chart stands for forced covering where they have to force cover their obligations.\n\nFC +1 means they have to cover whats due on the first day of regsho.\n\nFC +2 means they have to cover what‚Äôs due on the 2 nd day of regsho. Etc.\n\nFast forward to the last time BYND was on regsho on Apr25th (see purple lines on chart). Again the stock‚Äôs price increased leading to the t+13 th day of regsho where on the t+13 th day they covered majority of their obligations which lead to the huge pump\n\nNow BYND has entered regsho on June 27 th where the regsho just about started. In the past this has lead to a huge priceincrease in the stock as the shorts are now incentivized to get off the regsho list by covering their obligations. Mind you they might not run the stock up on the t+13 th trading day, it could be earlier or later where they wait for earnings on Aug 1st or after it. Also the November regsho run it took 1month for them to run it up\n\nSo we got BYND on regsho and ETF FTDs that are coming due.\n\nMy Positions are: 8c July 19th , 9c July 19th , 10c Aug16th, 12c Aug16th\n\nThis is a regsho cash cow cycle. Milk responsibly.\n\nAlso this is not financial advice.\n\nTLDR: BYND is on regsho and when on regsho it has lead to huge price improvements.",
