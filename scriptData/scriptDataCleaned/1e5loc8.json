Ford, Chevy, Jeep, Honda, Toyota, Subaru, BMW, Hyundai, Nissan and more all have electric vehicles that they produce and sell. Tesla's valuation is multiples higher than other automotive manufacturers based on hype and unrealistic projections of unsustainable growth. Even if you account for the side products that Tesla produces like the Powerwall, Tesla's P/E ratio is insane. The average Automotive manufacturer P/E ratio is around 10. The average P/E ratio for a Utilities company is 21. Tesla's P/E ratio is 75. At the end of the day Tesla is massively overvalued regardless of whatever industry you consider it to be. Combine overvalued with a low quality product, I think I would rather invest elsewhere.",

This is due to how they control most of the relevant minerals markets and thus have companies that are vertically integrated. This along with gov subsidies and their expertise in mass production can push the prices so low, the tariffs won't matter.
