  "selftext": "Tandem Diabetes Care ($TNDM) is likely going to be acquired in the near future (TL;DR at end):\n\nI discovered the following two reddit posts, both pertaining to an unexpected blackout period at the company that this person works at.\n\n[Important stuff highlighted](https://preview.redd.it/fw6khq2dm31d1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=a39ee3623f7dc0a64f012daf8eb32157cc352809)\n\nI first saw the latter of the two posts by happenstance on Friday, an hour after it was posted. Both posts have since been deleted. I have concealed the stuff that would easily allow people to find this person's u/ because I don't want to (directly, at least) cause them to get in legal trouble -- but I'm sure that it's still somewhat straightforward to find these posts and comments. I'm also sure that idiots will claim that this is all an elaborate attempt at a pump and dump, which is their choice. \n\nThe blackout period likely points towards this company being acquired, due to it being the first unexpected and company-wide one in the 3 years that this person has been at the company. It isn't related to an upcoming earnings report, as their last one was just on 5/2. TNDM has 2,400 employees, so suddenly preventing all of them from trading indicates that the information is related to the entire company (and isn't due to something like a data or product release). They'd also have defined a clear end date to the blackout if it was related to some kind of data/product release (aka, something where they could control when it happens) -- the indefinite nature and uncertainty of it suggests ongoing negotiations.\n\n[Another comment underscoring that this blackout is not normal](https://preview.redd.it/cr6f3qkjm31d1.png?width=903&format=png&auto=webp&s=47c7db90cd7c24f8e0c046f69490b32fbafb5b35)\n\nWith that being said, below is how I found the company that this person works for:\n\n\n\n[Context](https://preview.redd.it/51d3fus4x31d1.png?width=905&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6727f02994c04169dc831bcf95fb5905ca9c6e1)\n\n[The breakthrough comment](https://preview.redd.it/s0vsik6ix31d1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=7352c1afb1e75ee5a1a2be68435ce7317f936a61)\n\nSo, this company makes insulin pumps. That narrows things down a lot.\n\n[Posted in r\\/sandiego a decent amount](https://preview.redd.it/opo724n4z31d1.png?width=919&format=png&auto=webp&s=38dd16c68349c5ff07401bc24c25d392792c4d14)\n\n[The stock is up over past year](https://preview.redd.it/1kw1oavyz31d1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7a05dfb44edbab66543f0fe284a3a6d85ebcbf4)\n\n[This company's ESPP period just ended](https://preview.redd.it/fpdetgwc041d1.png?width=904&format=png&auto=webp&s=7ec5fceea65042fe50918057dd66454a140da076)\n\nWith this information, I looked through publicly traded diabetes biotech companies and found $TNDM. Based in San Diego, up nearly 60% in past year -- and the kicker:\n\n[Same ESPP end date](https://preview.redd.it/ct2nqyez041d1.png?width=673&format=png&auto=webp&s=89705cbf41e920062413dd80aa03c6a7d316eae2)\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that this person works at $TNDM. Good luck finding another company that makes insulin pumps, has a presence in San Diego, is up over the past year, and just had their ESPP period end.\n\nAdditionally, I went through the company's Form 4s that were filed on Friday ([SEC Filings | Tandem Diabetes Care](https://investor.tandemdiabetes.com/financial/sec-filings)). **All 7 officers increased their positions by at least 39.5%** during this past ESPP period, despite the stock already being up 231% from the Nov. 10th lows. Additionally, **none of them voluntarily sold ANY shares** -- the only reductions in their positions were due to the company withholding shares for tax purposes related to RSUs. To not take any gains off the table when the stock has already gone up this much would be stupid -- unless, of course, they were certain that it was going to go higher. These people clearly know something good is going to happen and are going to profit big time.\n\nThere are also minor highlights like 115% institutional ownership and some unusual call buys that happened last week, but these are essentially irrelevant to my thesis. The combination of the unexpected company-wide blackout period and bullish insider activity make it clear that something good is going to be announced soon -- reading between the lines, I find it likely that this good news is the company being acquired.\n\n\n\nMy Position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/km6dk5o4kl1d1.png?width=1179&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee891d9ef1f9c09aa8be0955eec34e1a727f1791\n\nMost blackout periods take between 2 weeks and a month, according to the SEC. This is obviously not a guarantee, they can take longer. I'm going into 6/21 calls regardless and will roll them back as necessary. Biotech M&As have averaged an 87.5% premium since 2020, so this is an opportunity to make a huge amount of money with a comparably low IV. Unfortunately, the spreads on this suck, so buying shares is much more straightforward. \n\n  \nTL;DR -- I randomly saw a reddit post about an unprecedented / unexpected blackout period at their company, went through OPs other comments and found the company ($TNDM). Am betting that this blackout is related to an acquisition. NFA.",

The market is supposed to grow to $21.5B-ish by 2032 (CAGR of 17.2%). A larger company would probably be able to reduce costs and take market share through advertising, etc. So, I can definitely see why another company might want to acquire them.",
