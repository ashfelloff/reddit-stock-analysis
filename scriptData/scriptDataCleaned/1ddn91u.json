  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Hello, I'm really new to investing and ive been researching a lot. I've found some videos that were really helpful in terms of \"checks to do\" before buying stock in a company. I'm hardly someone who knows a lot of finance so i like the idea of having some rules of thumb to go by.\n\nCurrently I have 4 checks:\n\n1. If P/E > 30 then it might be overvalued\n\nGo to yahoo statistics -> search for company -> financials:  \n2. On the Balance Sheet, check that totalCurrentAssets/totalCurrentLiabilities > 1\n\n3. On the income statement sheet, check that (Operating Income / Total Revenue) \\* 100 > 15\n\n4. On the cashflow sheet : check that free cashflow is increasing each year / staying steady\n\nWhile the guy in the video who explained why these checks are done made complete sense to me, as I said before, its not like i have the expertise to argue with it. Im curious about your opinions. Do these look like good rules of thumb? And if you have any others, please do let me know :)",

(e.g., if P/E is high, is there a growth or outlook reason that justifies it?). \n\nSimple answer is that good investment analysis will always require that you take multiple factors into account. \n\n> If P/E > 30 then it might be overvalued\n\nGood P/E varies by industry. You should always contextualize multiples appropriately. Growth industries and growth companies will have higher P/E. Alternatively, a company could have much lower P/E and still be heavily overvalued relative to peers. \n\n> On the Balance Sheet, check that totalCurrentAssets/totalCurrentLiabilities > 1\n\nFine, but all ratios are subject to industry performance. Different companies have different cash and working capital profiles. \n\n> On the income statement sheet, check that (Operating Income / Total Revenue) * 100 > 15\n\nAgain, different industries, different margin profiles. Can't apply these universally. \n\nAlso it's margin growth that ultimately matters. If it's below this criteria now but will be higher than this criteria in the future, that will be a better play than simply looking at where it is now. \n\n> On the cashflow sheet : check that free cashflow is increasing each year / staying steady\n\nThat's OK, but you need to be cautious of capex in FCF. This could be depressed in a given year because they're making heavy investment into something that will change the financial course of the company (or which is driven by a one-time issue).",

For example, a company that overpaid for an acquisition can have an inflated balance sheet with goodwill, a company might value a \"corporate jingle\" as an intangible asset, etc.\n\n- Income statement. Does the company produce enough earnings to cover its debt? Are earnings trending down or up?\n\n- Cash flow is important, especially if the company pays a dividend. If cash flow is less than the dividend, it could be a sign that it might be cut, especially if current assets and shareholder equity are growing low. In fact this is what convinced me not to invest in Whirlpool, it seems almost inevitable the dividend will be cut unless they rapidly turn things around. And dividend cuts almost always lead to an immediate drop in share price.",
