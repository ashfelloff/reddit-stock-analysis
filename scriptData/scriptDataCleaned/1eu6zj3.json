  "selftext": "https://themarijuanaherald.com/2024/08/dea-official-marijuana-set-to-be-rescheduled-by-october-thousands-of-comments-already-analyzed/\n\n\"The public comment period for the proposed rescheduling ended on July 22, with over 43,000 comments submitted. The DEA is currently analyzing these comments, with a final ruling anticipated within the coming weeks.\"\n\n\"The proposal to move marijuana to Schedule III was first published by the DEA on May 21, initiating a 60-day public comment period. With that period now concluded, the DEA’s focus has shifted to reviewing every comment, as required by law. According to the DEA official, this process is progressing as planned, despite the volume of comments.\"\n\n“We’ve already analyzed tens of thousands of comments, but do still have thousands remaining. At this pace, we are still on track for a final rescheduling announcement to come prior to October,” the official stated.\n\nFor those unaware, rescheduling will bring in the end of the draconian 280E tax for USA based MSOs companies and improve their bottomline as soon as its in effect...This is the major reason as to why rescheduling is important to those companies.\n\nAnd a disclaimer: rescheduling is not descheduling, the drug will remain federally illegal unless it's removed from the Controlled Substances Act.\n\nIt feels like this wait is finally coming to an end.\n\n\nPosition: 850 shares of MSOS @ $7.90 average, going to increase it to 1000 shares before October, all-in.\n\nNot Financial Advice.",

You can't take a prescription to a pharmacy and get weed, because it's a S1 narcotic. After rescheduling, new rules will have to be laid out for doctors and pharmacies. Local growers will need to meet very specific standards and licensing to provide to the medical market. There is no actual medical cannabis industry in the US, just dispensaries that can sell to people with a prescription because of loopholes in state laws. You can't go to your GP to get a prescription, go to Wallgreens and get it filled, and have your insurance cover it. After S3, you will be able to, but only from licensed providers. Tilray already has international quality control standards and licensing. They can jump right into that market.

I'd put big money on them being ready to jump into action as soon as either the schedule is reduced or it's fully legalized.\n\nI also wouldn't count out Big Pharma. Weed can basically be prescribed to anyone at this point because we have so much research vouching for its' efficacy treating so many different conditions. Once it's Schedule III and can be legally prescribed I bet they'll be pushing it like they were Oxy. \n\nNo one can have the patent but so much free insurance money is up for grabs everyone and their mother will be producing it to get their piece of the pie. \n\nPills and vapes also shouldn't be counted out. Almost all naturally occurring phytocannabinoids can be synthesized from CBD. We're producing more CBD hemp than we can consume. Many people myself included are producing their own vapes of custom mixes of all the various cannabinoids legalized under the 2018 Farm Bill. \n\nBig Pharma has definitely been researching that and likely already have many formulations to target specific effects already in hand. They'll also be able to move very quickly with a large CBD market to buy from and no worries about meeting Federal growing standards when dealing in chemically isolated tinctures, vapes, nebulizers and pills, they also have a significantly longer shelf life.\n\nEveryone seems to only consider the comparatively tiny weed companies but as soon as we hit Schedule III Big Tobacco and Big Pharma will rush in. I believe long term it will stabilize into something closely resembling the wine market with Artisanal producers holding a huge chunk of the market but before then Pharma and Tobacco are going raiding.\n\nI wouldn't even be surprised to learn Biden's push for rescheduling was heavily \"encouraged\" by Pharma and Tobacco so they can get a foothold before companies like Mood corner the market.",

Reschedule just does nothing but make it still complex and illegal majority. \n\nBasically anyone doing Rec is in the exact same boat (no banks,federally illegal, no stocks) and people doing medical would need to meet fda requirements for labs that’s would have to be established and high cost pushing people to black market due to prices.",
