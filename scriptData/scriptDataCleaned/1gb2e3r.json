  "selftext": "Hey guys, quick DD today since I only got 7.2 minutes left on my Wendy's break.\n\nI got 3 earnings plays for yall:Â **DexCom Inc**,Â **Deckers Outdoor Corp**, andÂ **Skechers USA Inc**, they all report today after the bell. Lets get right into it:\n\n* **DXCM**: DexCom, Inc. is a company that develops, manufactures, and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for diabetes management (source: Google). When you look around and compare people today with 10 years ago, donâ€™t you notice how fucking fat everyone is today? A salad costs more than a cheeseburger, these days, I see people wearing glucose monitoring patches like theyâ€™re a fashion statement. Diabetes is booming, so expect green dildos today.\n* **DECK**: Now, the people who actually work out and donâ€™t have diabetes, I keep seeing them running outside wearing HOKA. A couple of years ago, if you asked me if I knew the brand, I wouldâ€™ve said itâ€™s some random aliexpress shoe, but now I see more and more people wearing HOKAs. I actually dig the design and colorways. But thatâ€™s not theÂ **sole reason**Â (ba dum tss) I expect DECK to perform well today. Deckers doesnâ€™t just own HOKA; they also own UGG â€” yes, those boots your mom wore in the early 2000s. Fast forward to 2024, and I see every girl at my college wearing them. All those snowflakes have been stocking up last quarter, so I expect UGG and HOKA will bring this stock to valhalla.\n* **SKX:** Theyre dogshit (respectfully)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wk1gi19bfpwd1.png?width=393&format=png&auto=webp&s=fce0370ca13f7086e9168c6c4d4f9d85cbf1921e\n\n**tldr:**Â **DXCM & DECK go up , SKX go down**\n\nMy positions:\n\n[total position: $22.5K using 5x leveraged CFD's \\(europoor\\)](https://preview.redd.it/1dv8uw1fspwd1.png?width=963&format=png&auto=webp&s=32d6cbd6cfd7a16120e5876b6aa0748fcc972f62)\n\n*This is not financial advice, pleas do not sue me, do your own due diligence.*\n\nGod bless America\n\n  \nResults\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/egtjzs7lnwwd1.png?width=651&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8e423108b95c4dc7262cbf61a186e09c585e2e0\n\n",

Think last earnings season he had a 70-75 percent hit rate but I didnâ€™t really keep track like that to verify. Someone can correct me once again all I know in corgi we trust.
