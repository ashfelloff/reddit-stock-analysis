  "selftext": "Back in 2020/2021 tons of new EV companies were being taken public with the promise of becoming the next Tesla. After all, how hard is it to produce EVs profitably? Get a car frame, slap on a battery, program a UI, and you're good to go, right? Wrong. Pretty much every EV stock other than Tesla has shit the bed. They all discovered that manufacturing is hard and lost tons of money in the process. It turns out that it took more than a pile of cash and some promises of greatness to create a profitable EV company. \n\nFast forward to today and we have the same thing happening with nuclear stocks, specifically with ones promising to design and build nuclear reactors. OKLO has about $250m in cash with no proven reactors or revenue for years to come, yet it trades at a $2.2B market cap. NNE has about $30m in cash with lots of promises and no revenue for years to come and trades at a $600m market cap. NNE is also being sued for lying in their IPO documents and misrepresenting what they're capable of. How many people here truly understand what it takes to build and run a nuclear plant safely? None, and yet tons are willing to \"invest\" in these companies. Some of you \"long-term investors\" are going to be taken for a ride with some of these companies at these valuations. A ride straight down. Good luck and remember to post your loses, and for people who actually know valuable information about nuclear stuff, please do share.",

There has to be investment and expansion somewhere to grow and build these.  The machine shops and fabrication shops to do this work are covered up in navy work.  There is going to be heavy Gov investment in this area outside of the large major players due to the shrunken supply base compared to what will be needed.",

BWXT making nuclear subs and in no way is just nuclear if nuclear shits the bed, plenty of other defense products to keep stock up - great history with US govt. Same with Westinghouse- Cameco is massive in the nuclear space but is Canadian and can’t get US contracts? Now they can as they are 50% owner of Westinghouse with Brookfield who are huge and won’t let Westinghouse and by extension, Cameco fail. Now Cameco is vertically integrated in nuclear with a foot in US. I think this is a good play with the risk dispersed if nuke doesn’t take off and last should be ok. \n\nThese 2 and UROY locking in prices of uranium now for indefinite royalties as uranium in US rises (especially with US wanting domestic uranium and non Russian)",

The major auto makers would often collaborate or at a minimum share parts between platforms to reduce the cost.  The first Tesla wasn't even really bespoke, it was a modified Lotus with bespoke body panels.  Tesla was unprofitable for a long time, and also only got over their initial first delivery hump because of a DOE grant that was part of an Obama administration sustainable energy program.  And they still didn't turn a profit for years.\n\nIt takes a long time to get a reactor built.  New designs take a long time to be reviewed and approved, and for good reason.  If something goes sideways  it can have catastrophic impacts to health and safety.  It takes years to get a plant built as it goes through the community planning process.  And in all that time that it takes to get it up and running there is a lot of room for people to be taken by \"the next great thing\".\n\nTrue advances in any technology are great, and a lot of people recognize the issue of climate change and how power hungry data centers are.  But advances in technology also mean more efficient use of power and materials to do the same thing.  For me that is how companies really separate themselves from the pack, if they're coming up with a more efficient product, running their operations more efficiently, truly innovating and rapidly meeting a need.

      "body": "Hi,\n\nI think that an important distinction has to be done between nuclear and uranium\n\nNuclear stocks are companies that build reactors.\n\nUranium stocks are companies actif in the fuel of reactors\n\nI think indeed that investing in nuclear stocks is much more risky than investing in uranium producers.\n\nNuclear stocks **in the West** have a lot to study, to reinvent.\n\nIn China, India, Russia reactors are build on time and close to budget. And they finish a lot of new reactors each year!\n\nIn the West we had that in the 80ties and 90ties. But now the West lost that, and has to reinvent that level of nuclear reactor construction.\n\nUranium producers or near term producers/ well advanced developers on the other hand have a very bright future\n\nThe uranium sector is in a structural growing supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple years time\n\nThe near term producers, like Peninsula Energy, Lotus Resources, Global Atomic, and smaller uranium producers steadily increasing production, like EnCore Energy, Uranium Energy Corp, Denison Mines, will greatly benefit from this structural shortage, but they are too small to solve that global uranium supply shortage.\n\n**Kazatomprom, Cameco, Orano, CGN, ..., and a couple smaller uranium producers are all selling more uranium to clients than they produce (Because they are forced to by their clients through existing LT contracts with an option to flex up uranium demand from clients)**. Meaning that they will all together try to buy uranium through the iliquide uranium spotmarket, while the biggest uranium supplier of the spotmarket has less uranium to sell.\n\nAnd the less they deliver to clients (utilities), the more clients will have to find uranium in the spotmarket directly.\n\nThere is no way around this. Producers and/or clients, someone is going to buy more uranium in the spotmarket.\n\nAnd that while uranium demand is price INelastic!\n\nAnd before that announcement in August 2024 of Kazakhstan that they will produce 17% less in 2025 than previously promised, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qyh0a0spsvd1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28caec6d98a1eea89c5f90e245bc8884e8e6c02b\n\nSource: Cameco using data from UxC, 1 of 2 global sector consultants for all uranium producers and uranium consumers in world\n\nKazakhstan represents \\~45% of world uranium production.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

The latter 3 have almost no liquidity so be careful. \n\n$ccj is the largest Western (2nd overall) producer of uranium. They own half of Westinghouse which designs nuclear reactors and also working on SMRs.\n\n$sruuf is a spot uranium trust. I've been buying more whenever it trades at a discount to NAV of 15+%.\n\nSMRs will be a working product, as they are basically just smaller versions of the big ones we have. I'm specifically talking about the water cooling ones. We already have small nuclear reactors in submarines and aircraft carriers. The main issue is probably going to be an economic one. Regulation is still expensive, still take a long time to get approved, and they don't have economy of scale as they are producing less energy. \n\nTheir argument is prices will go down because it will take less time to build and government red tape will be easier to navigate for smaller builds. They can build it directly next to a data center and sell directly to tech companies. \n\nSMRs will likely be a thing, we just don't know which design will be the Tesla. So maybe spreading out your bankroll between a couple can pay off if one goes to the moon and the others go to zero. \n\nI think I might have just talked myself into buying $oklo and $smr",

When I was there in 2016 time frame we had a DOS based plc hooked to fax machine that printed out every line of code in the plant line by line just like in the Simpson’s an it was so outdated we had to 3D print our parts to rebuild the fax machine. lol The maintenance teams are great at making old shit work. \n\nIn the 70s it took them 16 years to build and $11 billion roughly spent. In 2016 the two reactors produced roughly $3 million in profit a day (1.5m per reactor) no telling what that is now or what that was 20 years ago. CPNPP averaged roughly 6% of Texas produced energy with its two reactors. \n\nNuclear Power has a bell curve to be profitable and provide clean energy for decades. UAE’s 4 reactor Barakah plant is a great representation of this however, the US private sector relies heavily on the government whom is currently afraid to take a risk on nuclear and they have been steadily declining to do so for years. Due to this lack of investing and advancement we’ll continue to hinder ourselves by not taking those necessary risks to drive efficiency in Nuclear power.",
