              "body": "You don‚Äôt need to have a margin account to day trade. You can make day trades with a combined value no greater than your total cash in your account without using margin and without having a day trading account. So if I have $5000 in my cash account I can make 5 $1000 trades. Or any combination up to $5000. But once my trades add up to $5000 then I have no more available cash for that day and I‚Äôm done. The money settles the next day (well 2 days for stocks 1 day for options, soon to be 1 day for stocks also), and then you can do it all over again the next day with whatever cash value you have at that point based on the results of the previous day‚Äôs trades. If you want to make unlimited trades within one day then you need to have minimum $25k in your account and you can apply for a day trading account and if you get it then your trades settle immediately and you just trade as much as you want in a given day. If you use margin with less than $25k (non day trading account) then you can only make 3 ‚Äúday trades‚Äù per week or whatever your brokerages rules are. So to avoid that rule just don‚Äôt use margin. Just use a cash account. In order to have a day trading account I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a requirement to use margin , I think the only requirement is $25k balance, but I could be wrong about that.",
