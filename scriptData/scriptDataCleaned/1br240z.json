  "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said that a new inflation report released Friday is \"along the lines of what we want to see,\" sticking to an assertion that inflation is still on a \"bumpy path\" to the central bank's goal of 2%.\n\n\"It's not as low as most of the good readings we got in the second half of last year, but it's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see,\" Powell said during a question-and-answer session at a San Francisco Federal Reserve conference.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-inflation-reading-along-the-lines-of-what-we-want-to-see-feds-powell-170723786.html",
