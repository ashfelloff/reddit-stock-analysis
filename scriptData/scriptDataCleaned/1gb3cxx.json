  "score": 66,
  "selftext": "> Tesla Inc.’s shares surged after the carmaker reported surprisingly strong earnings and forecast as much as 30% growth in vehicle sales next year.\n\n> Third-quarter results were buoyed by Tesla turning a corner with the Cybertruck, which generated profit for the first time. Lower material costs, an expanding energy business and sales of regulatory credits to automakers that need help complying with emissions limits also contributed to Tesla’s best quarterly earnings in more than a year.\n\n> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk offered an upbeat outlook for 2025, citing the rollout of more affordable models that Tesla has yet to identify. “Something like 20% to 30% growth next year is my best guess,” he said on a webcast.\n\nmarket looks bullish on _best guesses_ o.0",
