There are some exceptions, of course. For example, the S&P 500 dropped significantly after the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008.\n\nHere are some additional details about the chart:\n\nThe chart shows the S&P 500's performance after 26 major political and military events, dating back to World War II.\nThe average return of the S&P 500 one month after these events was -1.2%. However, the median return was 0.9%. This means that half of the time, the S&P 500 was positive one month after the event.\nThe average return of the S&P 500 three months after these events was 0.1%. The median return was 2.5%.\nThe average return of the S&P 500 six months after these events was 2.0%. The median return was 4.0%.\nThe average return of the S&P 500 twelve months after these events was 9.0%. The median return was 10.3%.\nOverall, the chart suggests that the stock market tends to recover from major political and military events over time. However, it is important to note that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.",
