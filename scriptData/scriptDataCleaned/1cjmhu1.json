Grocery store frozen pizza with 1.50 costs $15.\n\nThose markups are fucking insane.  And the food quality at that level sucks.\n\nThe trick is go to the nicer, more expensive places.  Ohana for example is all you can eat of a pretty solid assortment of grilled meats (steak chicken and shrimp) and really good appetizers and one of the best desserts I’ve ever had.  Before Covid it was like $45/person, I think it’s $60 now.  That’s a markup from what you’d pay at a good Brazilian steakhouse but not much.\n\nThe nicest restaurant at Disney is Victoria and Albert’s which is coat and tie celebrity chef Michelin star dining.  It’s like $300 a person which is competitive with the outside economy for that level of dining experience.\n\nThe higher up the dining scale you go, the less you’re being ripped off",
