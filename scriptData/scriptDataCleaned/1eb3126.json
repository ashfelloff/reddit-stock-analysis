And they have made the executive decision years ago to outsource 100% of it to third parties and not implement any sort DR plan if there is an issue with this.  Or even maintain a skeleton crew of IT staff.   Many of these organizations do not even have a functioning IT department/infrastructure and instead rely on consultants to do everything.  I'll also add that I can guarantee that all the organizations that were impacted have laid off/\"outsource\" IT staff over the last decade+ (and paid their execs huge bonuses for \"cutting costs\").   I put \"outsource\" in quotes because very often they will play semantic games, like replacing staff with SaaS that really still requires maintenance to be safe/effective. \n\nAnd as you can see, this can work fine for many years (and even decades!) until it doesn't.  I.e., I was predicting stuff like this happening in the early '00s and it eventually did.   If anything I'm surprised it took this long.\n\nThat said, I have worked in environments that do \\*not\\* trust their critical infrastructure to third-parties and not exposed to risks like this.   But I have to admit they suffer from other issues; like exorbitant infrastructure costs, technical debt and issues hiring/maintaining staff that can maintain custom environments.",

They had documentation online fairly quickly for remediation. They also had quarantine routines in place so if boot looping systems could get online for a short period, it fixed itself.
