Having the mindset that the money you put into stock market is already gone will make you happier and not just worry about numbers going up and down. Because when you are too focused on the number, you loose your mindset and get trapped in the mood. Instead, focus on your mistakes and figure out what you have done wrong. Good luck, you will get there.",
