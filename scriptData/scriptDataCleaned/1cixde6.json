Even the tablet market where they popularized the format with the iPad existed before Apple made it more common. Also Apple is more of a hardware + services ecosystem company so a mainly software upgrade cycle is something they should lag and follow from behind in.

                  "body": "It depends on how we define the term.  Apple was often the entity that took geekbro tech and made it genuinely consumable by (and desirable to) the general public.   So there were MP3 players well before the iPod, but with sucky and complex interfaces and various limitations, and they weren't something everyday non-technical people wanted own, even if they could figure them out.\n\nA tech-oriented geek observer might say that Apple wasn't a leader in that sense, because they didn't invent the technology or whatever.  A more business-oriented observer would say that Apple was *the* leader and *the* driver of that technology.\n\nAnother critical example was Steve Jobs convincing the recording industry to grow up and get over file sharing, and to start selling music on the Internet in earnest instead of stupidly hoping it would all go away and the world would go back to CDs.  Apple's iTunes didn't have much that was *technologically* new, but what it did have was content, and that was a result of Jobs steering the record industry into embracing online delivery --- in retrospect, a Herculean task that perhaps no other tech company could have done.    Again, online music delivery existed before then, but it sucked and it was deeply restricted by an overly cautious content industry.",
