Both Russia and Israel conflicts can/ will end by next year as Israel is only killing civilians and if they actually killed Hamas then they can’t fear monger and we got Russia by the ropes. Deals can be made. But it all depends on the election and what America thinks is important. If the rhetoric is we need to be stronger then stonks only go up. If not then the p/e will have to meet reality and prices will plateau or come down. \n\n  With both wars, just look at the facts. It’s one sided. Ukraine nor palastine wants war nor Lebanon or Iran. It’s just terrorist aka bullies Russia and Israel who are war economies, are the ones pushing for it. And both are losing support internationally and internally. Something has to give. It truly is a 50/50 shot. It could escalate further or we could see a change in leadership and direction. This is truly a gamble",

While we might disagree on the good/bad guys of the middle eastern wars, I won’t say you’re wrong that Israel doesn’t want war. Netenyahu (probably misspelling it) is a warmonger who will probably get his way and we could see a further escalation between Israel and Iran\n\nHowever, I do believe that the conflict in Ukraine could drag for a while. Putin won’t be able to maintain power if the war ends regardless of who wins. If Russia somehow wins, the international stage won’t allow it, and the economy will end up in shambles. If they lose, the nuclear option is quite likely (and then all my stocks are cooked). In my opinion, Ukraine and Russia still have another year or so before something can be worked out. Plenty of time to take gains",

Also Israel only wants war because bibi is a corrupt politician who has been exposed and without a war to distract he will lose his position. But without forgiven support they can’t wage war with Iran and Iran keeps saying they don’t want war. So that’s why elections matter so much. In 1 month  you will have your answer. I think we can genuinely pressure Russia into making a deal and stopping the war. But then idk what will happen even 5 mins from now 🤷",
