  "title": "DELL. Another INTC?",
  "score": 101,
  "selftext": "DELL seems to have gotten some of the fiercest devaluation (except for INTC) the last month. Similar to Intel, they're now terminating tons of jobs to clean up their expenses and get leaner looking forward. \n\nIs this a genuine restructuring and pivot to their AI business or is this a panic measure similar to INTC because they're hemorrhaging funds and need to cut their losses somewhere? \n\nWhere do you stand on DELL? They're getting bloodied right now, but overall they've been doing well and have grown significantly over the last year. Is it all AI hype? \n\nPersonally I think DELL, like all major AI tech stocks will face this correction in the short term and grow significantly in value in the years to come as the AI race actually takes off and consumer AI products become more and more commonplace. I'm not sure who the winner will be in the end, but I can assume DELL branded technologies and software will be present in the corporate working world.",

Its a legacy hardware company, nothing else. They just happened to sell some hardware right now that is used in datacenters. That really is it. DELL didnt change at all. It doesn't deserve any higher multiple or whatever than what it usually has just because they sell stuff that is used in datacenters. Its still a low margin hardware company. IIRC the servers \"that are used for Ai\" arent even profitable. \n\nStock is just coming back to reality, thats it. Its not a bad company by any means, but it wasnt and will never be a \"growth ai tech company\" that is just complete bs.
