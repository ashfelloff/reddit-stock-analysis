Poor kids thank God they don't have to eat another shitty frozen dinner. Their menu items are improving too, faster than any other big pizza chain. \n\n  *Home Depot* (HD): There are an insane amount of Americans who gain a hobby of gardening/home improvement, and suddenly they find themselves in home depot multiple times a week. \n\n  It markets itself too, people who don't go to home depot have shitty grass. Alpha Dad's who can build a swingset post that shit on Facebook. Whenever I see a Lowe's I feel like I'm in the projects by comparison. \n\n  And real contractors/construction companies live a significant portion of their life in that store, those people memorize the aisles. They have an outstanding reputation too due to what Arthur Blank has done in terms of charity.\n\n  Y'all got any? Sometimes word of mouth DD is the best.",

I remember when some people would feel ashamed to mix and match various sportswear brands. \n\nThere's also a lot of legacy brands that turned themselves from something that kids would clown on eachother for wearing into \"premium\" type brands, like Champion. They partly accomplished this by collaborating with brands that were considered \"cool\" like Supreme. Brands are still important to an extent, but the landscape changed and Nike wasn't able to navigate the new reality as well as others.",

The strategy for these companies is to game search rankings rather than traditional brand-building but I wonder if completely demasking the mystique of branding causes some consumers to just look off-site instead.\n\nMost people know intellectually that many brands are bullshit but that doesnt mean they dont still work on them. Some people feel more comfortable with a purchase when they can lie to themselves about the relative quality and prestige of a product and where it comes from, but seeing an entire page of identical items with different random letters printed on them makes that harder to do. Sort of a \"you dont want to see how the sausage is made\" situation, combined with choice paralysis.",

              "body": "That crust looks really satisfying with a fantastic crispy edge. They are using the technique popularized at Pequod‚Äôs, where you cook the pizza in a pan and the edge cheese and pepperoni crisps up and even burns. So so tasty.  \nI really like the amount of sauce and cheese here and the doneness looks pretty good.  \nMy constructive criticism of this pizza is too many olives, too many onions. Both should be diced more finely. Ideally you would add the onion after the cheese begins to melt so that the onions dry a bit and brown and sweeten as a result.  \nIf I paid $30 for the pizza you show I would be quite happy!  But for $50 I would expect perfect craftsmanship which would include 60 percent less olive, the onions prepared as I mentioned, and about 30 percent less other toppings. Also I would expect it to be in the oven ornin a second oven to cool and further cook the top, about 5 minutes longer.  $50 for a pizza better be a pizza beyond reproach.  \nThank you so much for sharing and reading my adhd coffee marijuana pizza review!! :)  whats the name of this place?  Can you chat it to me if its like a secret?  :)",

Then the pandemic hit and you couldn't get anything at Home Depot and what wood you could get was trash.  It was understandable, but as the pandemic eased up, nothing changed. I was buying a lot of wood and I just couldn't get it at HD. I rarely went to Lowe's because they didn't have a lot of the stuff that HD did but I needed something and we have a Lowe's and HD side by side a few miles from where I live, so I tried them. I was surprised to find that not only did they have what I needed but their wood selection and quality was way better than HD.  Neither store has what would be called \"Premium\" lumber, but it was pretty darn good and good enough for what I needed it for. \n\nSo I kept going to Lowe's more than HD for about a year.  Even now, HD's lumber selection is not what it use to be prior to the pandemic but it's gotten a lot better. And you would think in the PNW with all of our timber that getting lumber would not be a problem.  Well, except Oregon and Washington are hording all their timber and only the private companies are actually harvesting it. The state would rather see it burn and rot on the ground rather than use it for building, but that's a whole nother story.\n\nI find Lowe's to be much better in a lot of ways over HD, although HD does have stuff because they cater to construction people more, that Lowe's doesn't have as much of. But HD has not fully recovered from the pandemic, at least in my area and my opinion.",
