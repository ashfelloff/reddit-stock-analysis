  "selftext": "I've been looking at Trinity Capital ($TRIN). It's had its ups and downs in the past few months in the stock. They seem to using a KeyBank for their funding via a wholly owned subsidiary LLC to fund secured and non-secured loans to a number of mid-size startups for 10+%. Not sure what is really securing these loans. I'm not seeing how they're making back their cost of capital unless their warrants turn into something or sell these loans off to someone. Seems like a lot could go wrong with these small/midsized loans. Their payout ratio is 100%+. Yet off they go. Someone is buying up calls. And now they want to refi their bank loan? And yet Moodies has a strong buy? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nhttps://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/trinity-capital-prices-100m-notes-due-2029-93CH-3352413#",
