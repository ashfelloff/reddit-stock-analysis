Last Monday I bought 0dte call for .06 and sold at .10 next day bought at .10 and sold at .16 and day after that bought at .16 and sold at 1.06. Then after that went all the way up to 400 and today lost it all but doesn’t matter bc it really only started with 6$ so irl just lost 6$ between last Monday and today.\n\nYou shouldn’t hold these for long periods of time because theta is like sandpaper and a option that far OTM will disappear real quick, that’s y small profits when still small and then if you can build up then u can get closer itm.",
