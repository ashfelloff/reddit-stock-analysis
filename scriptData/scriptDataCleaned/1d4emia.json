What does that mean in terms of Trump 's ownership of DJT? (He's got about 60 percent) Does he have to fire sale ? Does the company have to reverse split and acquire the stock from him? \n\nEither way, it looks like it would put pressure on DJT'd price and make calls worth more, right?",

And the stock hovering around 50 dropped into the 40s, and returned to 50.\n\nOn the other hand, if a stock is a huge bubble, any event could be the thing that pops it, and it's amazingly hard to predict.
