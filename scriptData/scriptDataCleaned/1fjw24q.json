  "selftext": "Buy the rumor, sell the news. That's the  saying. And sounds easy right? The hard part is simply remembering which rumor we're talking about. You might think the rumor is \"its gonna be 50bps\". But rumors have layers. And that is just a micro-rumor on the meta-rumor. For how many goddamn months have we been hearing the goddamn rumors about will they or won't they....get us off this plateau and lower interest rates. The rumor has been \"they will lower interest rates\"\n\nThe \"news\" in the saying refers to the moment that rumor becomes fact. When it becomes history. Old news. Tomorrow is that day. The cherry will have been popped.  Tomorrow will be the peak of the collective interest in interest rates. It will be front-page news. It will be the Super Bowl for gambling degenerates around the world. People will explain it to their children, and remember it like they remembered 9/11\n\nAnd after the joyous rapture of finally reaching this climax, then \n\nTHANK FUCKING GOD we can finally all get on with our fucking lives and get back to our regular programming.  \n\n\n[Live it up, finance nerds](https://preview.redd.it/cpv2rs1ggipd1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c4077a836b436366a320f70f775625debdffa9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE SINGULARITY HAS BEGUN\n\n  \n\n\n  \nI'm not sure if you're paying any fucking attention to what nerds are building these days. Let's look at a few examples: \n\n- To start, Waymo has solved self-driving. Tesla is on the cusp of doing the same\n\n- Tesla and like 5 other companies are about to come out with actual fucking cyborgs. Robot slaves are almost here. Be sure to treat yours nicely. \n\n- People are already falling in love with chatbots (imagine cyborgs v2?)\n\n- TSMC and Nvidia turn literal sand into rocks that can teach themselves anything \n\n- People want these magic rocks so bad that nuclear power has been resurrected from the dead so we can use the hot rocks to power the smart rocks\n\n- Oh and OpenAI just dropped their new model o1, creating yet another way to turn more GPU cycles into more intelligence. Except this time, the algorithm is less efficient. A \\*linear\\* improvement with \\*exponential\\* increase in GPU/energy. Meaning demand for GPUs just ...shot up... again (sounds crazy, but I see at least a doubling here). Nvidia isn't the only beneficiary here, but I expect that capture 90% of this newly discovered demand (more on this in another post)\n\n[$200 before the gopher sees his shadow](https://preview.redd.it/o5trxpcnhipd1.png?width=828&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6a067248a3b70438c6db77c81fa12e92603341)\n\n\n\n\n\nPOWELL IS A GENIUS\n\n  \n\n\nOn to the main story of the day - what is Mr Pow-Pow gonna do? \n\nHe's smart enough to understand that the stickiest part about inflation is housing. And no amount of low rates will ever solve housing. We can't choose to spend less on housing. Millenials and zoomers are fucking crammed in together. Housing has a supply issue. Not enough of it. And how is that solved? Build more. What does that cost? Money.\n\n  \nAs paradoxical as it sounds, the solution to inflation has now become more money. We need construction to boom. Luckily, it is starting to. \n\nPowell also knows how to get a good price. How to \"stretch\" out his bps for the biggest societal changes.. Remember how skillfully he used the mere suggestion of rates drops to heat the economy up earlier this year. He got all that for 0 bps. \n\nSo how can he get the most bang for his buck here? Start out with a bang. All else equal, a 50 bps now will create a bigger \"push\" of excitement through society than would two 25 bps back to back. He knows this. He'd rather give you 50 pbs now than 75 bps over 3. That's strategy - focussing on the war not the battle. So he creates a giant sigh of relief. He'll give us more up front. A nice little surprise from Santa Clause\n\nThen the tapering will be slower than expected. That will get dialed back as the initial push shows to be effective. It'll be a classic Powell Tease. \n\n[HE'S BACK](https://preview.redd.it/0fl33yq1cipd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2a7be47a5cf12cf2080edcbca884990130a774a)\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE GREAT ROTATION IS A MIRAGE\n\n\n\n\n\n  \nWe are entering an Age of Great Monopolies. Yes, the S&P500 is concentrated. But look around - globalization and rapidly changing high-tech have made economies of scale that are completely unbeatable. The richest people in the world have hundreds of billions of dollars. That is the new normal. \n\n  \nAre you really gonna drop Amazon...or Nvidia...just to scoop up companies that have higher debt, because now that debt is worth slightly less? You want banks ridden with corporate property debt and underwater T-bills? Amazon will have next hour delivery. Tesla is going to have i Robots. People are already falling in love with sex robots. \n\n  \nThe singularity is here. This is what it looks like. You may not like it but this is what peak acceleration looks like. That means you should be expecting exponential growth, and looking for companies going through it. Buy and hold or calls if you have too much money. \n\n\n\n[stay on left side to get rich ](https://preview.redd.it/50qpsmsxkipd1.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=b81ee9459b6d60c8161553e5caef30f22b00d7ff)\n\n[expect more headlines like this](https://preview.redd.it/jv02xtkhiipd1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=cff31953fa88892218d6bd3a3f909d317f9ea68f)\n\n\n\n\n\n[I like the stock](https://preview.redd.it/10x1910lkipd1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e60c6940d8a88379e4bce4100ab4548812139371)\n\n",

You have to remove money from the supply and the only way to do that is to tax the rich and redistribute what's out there already. If we keep printing and spending instead of taxing and spending the world gets worse for those without the capital to keep up.
