As the Boomer generation begins to retire in earnest and start divesting and stop making contributions is there enough investors out there to close the gap or is this a ticking time bomb set to implode?\n\nUpdate: wow, feel like I touched a nerve here",

I’m like massive tax hit to pull that much out but he is moving what he doesn’t use into an Ira.\n\nThe interesting part is he forgot he had it and didn’t know how to access it and was surprised to find he had so much in it. He’s been divorced for 25 years. His ex, my MIL got half the 401k at divorce. She was going off about how can he afford that and he must have stolen it from me In the divorce. We were like dude, that was 25 years ago, he’s earned money since and has had inheritance when his parents died.. my wife has access to all his accounts And we know his finances. We also helped him through the divorce and I found a couple hidden bank accounts that were outta state. So she’s a bitch but anyway.
