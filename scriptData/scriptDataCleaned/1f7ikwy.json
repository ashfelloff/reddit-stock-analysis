      "body": "Almost all of it boiled down to one decision made by Paul Otellini (N-3 CEO) to use DUV on 10nm to save costs, instead of EUV like everyone else. That's why INTC was stuck on 14nm for *six years*. And because the product team was so tightly integrated with the fab team, the entire product pipeline was more or less stuck. Mismanagement compounded the issue (e.g., could've made the move to EUV after 1 year of failboat, but BK was a terrible CEO). \n\nLunar Lake will be important because it's essentially sending the message that the Intel product teams are 100% split from IFS and they can and will choose the best process technology (e.g., TSMC N3) for launch. If Lunar Lake is as good as the rumors, it should also work towards encouraging investors that INTC can make a competitive product when the process node is normalized. The downside? Your margins are impacted because TSMC is a monopoly for anything 3nm and below (Samsung fabs are slowly turning into a joke).\n\n5N4Y (5 Nodes in 4 Years) is also critical because after being stuck on 14nm so long, it should at least encourage investors that INTC is serious at making a comeback. With GNR and SRF launching this year, it should show to customers/investors that Intel 3 (\\~TSMC N5) is capable of mass production. 18A also looks extremely healthy, with Panther Lake booting into Windows on A0. And their only external 18A customer also taping out.\n\nNow the biggest problem of course is that doing all this is exceedingly expensive. PatG overall made the correct call, his biggest mistake is expanding into so many *new* factories concurrently and miscalculating how fast China was de-coupling from the West (gee, who would've thought that you making new factories in the West would've pissed Xi off and Xi would retaliate economically).",
