COST grows EPS at 13-14% CAGR. When (not if because mean reversion will eventually happen) it's rerated down to a 30 to match WMT, it'll have to grow EPS at 22% CAGR to match a 50 PE.

I actually owned it around a decade ago. stock went hyperbolic and then they had some huge e coli contamination outbreaks. many sick customers, lots of bad press. I got out. the PE was already insane for a fast casual diner. how could this burrito fast food be worth the PE? somehow they survived it and kept growing at an absolutely insane rate. im still blown away today by it’s valuation. it’s never looked reasonable to get back into since then. currently has a PE ratio of 48….that is nuts to me. I wouldn’t touch it. but it has survived and grown substantially. i just dont see where the future grown can come from. I wont invest in it but it keep growing…",
