The big money center banks could be a play, but they also get access to much bigger, less risky business.

Less risk / reward I guess but if the idea is they’re essentially committing fraud then that could come out anytime.  But their quarterly results could still be good.  Your money though, maybe their numbers are horrible this quarter and they tank 20% and weeklies are the correct play.\n\nI guess I’m saying you should decide why you’re buying options and what catalyst you’re expecting to drive the stock in a direction then buy with dates related to that.  If I were to open a position in cvna, and I have thought about it, I’d probably buy 20-30% OTM leaps.  I currently have no skin in the game though",
