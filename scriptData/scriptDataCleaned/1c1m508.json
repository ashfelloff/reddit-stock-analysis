But more often than not, it affects only a few things first (as cash is generally created by the government for specific purposes either by policy or directly), and then everything all at once very quickly. This is when the debasing of the currency sets in and affects the prices of everything until cash is destroyed (deflation). And this is where we are now.

Up 1%.\n\nIf PPI is less than CPI (relatively to previous print) then consumers are getting squeezed but companies are raking it in. This is very bull, up 2-3%.\n\nWhether it ‚Äúmisses‚Äù or ‚Äúbeats‚Äù might throw a twist in, but the above will be what happens at the end of the day.\n\nRemember, stocks are priced according to how the companies are performing, NOT the ‚Äúeconomy‚Äù.\n\nStocks don‚Äôt give a shit if everyone and their pet parakeet are maxed to the hilt and drowning in inflation as long as the companies are making more money.\n\nRegards.‚Äù",
