Even got my prediction in today’s price move nailed. \n\n“Why is everyone so bad at this.\n\nStocks go up when rates go up because the FED is giving their stamp of endorsement that the economy is strong enough to handle those higher rates.\n\nStocks also go up in high inflation because stocks are a hedge against inflation.\n\nSo higher rates and higher inflation is HIGHER STOCKS x2.\n\nStocks go down when rates go down because the Fed is telling you straight up the economy is weak and needs a boost.\n\nStocks go down in DEflation (not DISinflation) because prices go down which means earnings go down.\n\nBears who think it will go down when inflation and rates goes up are WRONG, in fact it’s double wrong.\n\nBulls who think stocks go up with disinflation and rates dropping are WRONG.\n\nTomorrow PPI if it goes up more than CPI then companies are getting squeezed and stocks drop.\n\nIf PPI is equal to CPI (relatively) then flat which is bull. Up 1%.\n\nIf PPI is less than CPI (relatively to previous print) then consumers are getting squeezed but companies are raking it in. This is very bull, up 2-3%.\n\nWhether it “misses” or “beats” might throw a twist in, but the above will be what happens at the end of the day.\n\nRemember, stocks are priced according to how the companies are performing, NOT the “economy”.\n\nStocks don’t give a shit if everyone and their pet parakeet are maxed to the hilt and drowning in inflation as long as the companies are making more money.\n\nRegards.”",
