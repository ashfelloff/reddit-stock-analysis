  "score": 930,
  "selftext": "> Boeing Co. raised around $21 billion in an upsized share sale, one of the largest ever by a public company, shoring up its balance sheet as it burns through cash.\n\n> The planemaker sold 112.5 million common shares for $143 each, according to a statement. The stock was priced at a discount of about 7.7% to its Friday closing price of $155.01 each. \n\n> The company also sold $5 billion of depositary shares that represent a 1/20th stake in mandatory convertible preferred shares, the statement said. \n\n> The infusion of funds clears one of new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg’s most urgent tasks. Boeing’s balance sheet was strained by years of turmoil and the fallout from a strike, now in its seventh week, that is crippling manufacturing of the company’s main cash cow, the 737 Max jetliner. Boeing needed the capital infusion to maintain its investment-grade rating and fund its production ramp-up once the walkout ends.\n\n> The company is on pace to use around $4 billion in cash during the fourth quarter, which would bring its free-cash outflow to around $14 billion for the year. The planemaker expects to continue burning cash through the first half of next year as it restarts its factories, including the 737 Max assembly lines.\n\n> The shares closed down 2.8% at $150.69 each on Monday in New York. The stock has declined roughly 42% this year, the second worst performance in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. ",

      "body": "Boeing has successfully raised about $21 billion in a substantial share sale, one of the largest ever for a public company, to strengthen its balance sheet amid ongoing cash burn. The company sold 112.5 million common shares at $143 each, a 7.7% discount from its previous closing price of $155.01. Additionally, Boeing issued $5 billion in depositary shares tied to preferred shares.\n\nThis capital infusion addresses urgent financial needs under new CEO Kelly Ortberg, especially given the ongoing strike that has halted production of the 737 Max, Boeing's key product. The company is projected to use approximately $4 billion in cash in Q4, resulting in an estimated $14 billion free cash outflow for the year. Boeing anticipates continuing cash losses into the first half of next year as it works to ramp up production post-strike. The stock closed down 2.8% at $150.69 on Monday and has seen a 42% decline this year, marking one of the worst performances in the Dow Jones Industrial Average also if you're looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation",
