  "selftext": "I really would like to shake hands and cross swords with the man responsible for pumping NVDA today. I picked up 10 130 calls yesterday exp Friday and they are up 500%. I had to use all my green crayons for this one. From the bottom of my heart and hopefully the back of my throat, I want to say thank you for making me green on the year.\n\nI sold 5 and am riding 5 for Friday. Whichever of you regards push it past 130 on Friday, I promise the Lancaster suite is on standby and ready for you to use whenever (behind the Wendy's in Lancaster, CA). ",
