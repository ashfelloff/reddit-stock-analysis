I'm a computer scientist/engineer/software dev that's worked on web3 even. The \"tokennomics\" looked fake even after shorting it for months not belieiving it. That's literally the worst part of this. I lost a few thousand keeping a short on Luna expecting the fall of it. I was the gayest gay crypto bear. The computer scientist in me looked at the data and all the exponential growth seemed like bullshit. I continued over and over to try to keep a short on it only to be liquidated repeatedly (funded by my shorting other cryptos that failed like ICP), I decided- it must work then if I can just get destroyed like this over and over, then went all in, full bull. \n\nRug pulls, ponzi schemes, and other scams generally just make money for a single person or group. But a competitor to tether didn't seem impossible, especially as legitimate exchanges started to take it up as the primary trading currency instead of tether, and the paper backing of tether was just as sketch. If anything, tether was looking more on the collapse as outflows to UST began. Coinbase even had Luna. I was like, if tether collapses, so does everyone else, so who cares? My biggest failing was pressing that trade button to switch my 130k USDT to 130k UST for a few pennies. Cost me 2 years of savings and security as well as a solid year of regret. I even almost wanted to drown myself in a bathtub after it happened as a person already dealing with depression and nothing to show for it except tax capital gains loss carry-overs.",
