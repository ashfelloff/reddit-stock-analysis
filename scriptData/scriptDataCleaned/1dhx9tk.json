You buy options based on the chart, while you buy shares based on the fundamentals of the company, or where it will be in 5 years.  Nobody in his right mind would buy NVDA based on its chart now.   Still buying on the fundamentals makes sense, IMO it's obvious NVDA will be x times worth more in 5 years.  But if you're buying options based on that, you're gonna have a bad time, and greeks will fuck you one way or another.",
