  "selftext": "So hurricane Hellene flooded a small town in North Carolina called [pruce pine](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5133462/hurricane-helene-quartz-microchips-solar-panels-spruce-pine). Why does it matter?\n\nThey seem to be the largest US supply for the purest quality silicon on the world. Everyone making chips uses them, even China.\n\nWhile Brazil and Russia also produce some silicon it's not the same volume or purity. The purity there is the only source required by some manufacturers.\n\nThe flossing has been a long the river, and severely damaged the rail line, the only commercial route the silicon is exported through.\n\nIn 2008 a fire shut the plan down too, and some articles talk about how it impacted the market.\n\nI'm still on my first cup of coffee. But there has got to be a play here I'm too dumb to see besides shorting someone.",
