  "title": "McDonald's (MCD) Q2 2024 - Triple Miss",
  "score": 81,
  "selftext": "I wanted to share some insights from McDonald's latest earnings report for Q2 2024. Unfortunately, it wasn't the best quarter for the fast-food giant. Here are the key highlights:\n\n**1. Triple Miss:**   \nMcDonald's missed expectations on profit, revenue, and comparable sales. This has raised concerns among investors and analysts.\n\n**2. Profit Miss:**  \nAdjusted earnings per share (EPS) came in at $2.97, below the expected $3.07.\n\n**3. Revenue Miss:**  \nRevenue was $6.49 billion, up 2.01% year over year, but below the expected $6.63 billion.\n\n**4. Comparable Sales Decline:**  \nGlobal same-store sales, which include company-owned stores and franchisees, decreased by 1%, compared to an expected increase of 0.84%.\n\n**5. Extension of $5 Meal Deal:**  \nMcDonald's is extending its popular $5 meal deal through August. This deal was launched at the end of the quarter on June 25.\n\n**6. Impact on Franchisees:**  \nThe extension of the $5 meal deal might put pressure on franchisees trying to maintain profitability amid increased promotional activity.\n\n**7. Market Reaction:**  \nMcDonald's shares dropped 1.2% in premarket trading following the report. The market's reaction highlights the significance of these misses in the current economic environment.\n\n",
