Just in case this rockets and I made a ton of money. \n\nMy real recent buys started at $4 and then AT&T joined, Verizon joined, and I did more research and digging on the ASTS sub and I kept selling other securities and buying ASTS. I have buys at 2,4,6,8,9,10,12, and so on. \n\nThe more I saw, the more I liked it. It helps that there are awesome contributors like Cat_SE and KookReport (the first I can think of) that publish their own research and insights.",
