Two questions:\n> They take out more loans to cover the old ones.\n\nWouldn't this make the first loan essentially incur interest over their lifetime? Does that come out cheaper than paying the capital gains tax? I understand the interest rates would be lower than regular loans, but the banks still must have some incentive to provide them.  \n  \n>When they die, all the loans get repaid at a stepped up basis, lowering their tax burden.  \n\nIf I'm reading the US tax code correctly, anything over 13M is taxed at 15-40% with estate tax when the assets are inherited. Seems like when it comes to assets in the billions, the amount saved with this strategy would be marginal in the long run, compared to this sum.  \n   \n\nAnd as a side note, while I wasn't the one who questioned the claim, people here do tend to repeat straight up myths or wrong information all the time.
