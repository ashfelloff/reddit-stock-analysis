I mean, do you change the oil in your car every month or do you \"defer\" until you actually need it changed at 3k miles? I don't know think anyone is proactively changing their oil early so why would you expect an airline to approach maintenance that way? Anyway, you can't \"defer maintenance\" as an airline.

The difference is that normally there should have been a door there, but when the airline purchased the plane when they mentioned the number of passengers they plan to fly with that plane that additional door was not needed so boeing (spirit actually) put a plug in it's place. The number of doors on a plane is driven by the number of passengers so that the plane can be evacuated in a certain amount of time.\nI know this is not really important to the subject at hand but i enjoy reading about how aviation works.\nThere is a guy on youtube who is a pilot and flight instructor that makes these amazing videos of aviation incidents. His channel is called mentour pilot and here is the video where he talks about this incident and explains what happened:\nhttps://youtu.be/ROeGKs4xTfs?si=Y_WRoFyRUnNuZPOm\nHis videos are like really high level in production value for youtube videos, like every one of his videos could be broadcasted as a documentary on tv in my opinion.",
