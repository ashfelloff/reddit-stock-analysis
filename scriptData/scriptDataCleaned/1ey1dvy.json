  "selftext": "Hello fellow doorknob humpers!\n\n\nHow has there not been more autist level discussion about what’s going on with Sirus XM Radio and Liberty Media’s merger? Specifically about how our favorite regard bought Siri it seems by the handfuls.\n\nFor those not knowing what I’m talking about Warren Buffet bought SIRI stock recently. Link here from the fool: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/15/why-is-warren-buffett-buying-more-sirius-xm-stock/\n\nPretty weird that Buffet would buy Sirus XM stock and not Liberty Media stock if they are simply going to merge? Some sort of expected move here?\n\nFor those wondering Sirus XM is trading around $3.30 and Liberty Media is trading around $78…\n\nALSO volume for Sirius XM (SIRI) has exploded lately but price has barely really moved much. The biggest gain it saw was about 5% in a week .\n\nI guess what I’m saying is, if it’s good enough for Buffet it’s good enough for this idiot!\n\nCalls for 10/18 at $4.50 strike \n\nOooga Booga!",

If you look at Berkshire's adds at the last report they added a bunch of all three. I'm guessing Buffet started buying lsxmk and lsmxa, but if SIRI drops in price the whole play becomes idiotic anyways, so he started pumping SIRI as well.  SIRI's last price x8.4 still is about 14.5% more than LSXMK. So if you buy LSXMK currently you'll make 14.5% when they merge. NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE... just my understanding of the Buffet play.",

I get the arbitrage part, but if people are truly hedging with the tracking stock then the gap should have been closed or at least you see the tracking stocks rise in value as SIRI is going down due to the short positions. But we’re not seeing that, we’re seeing the tracking stocks staying flat or even dropping with Siri. And that’s WITH Buffet on the bid, on both sides. I’m scaling into a big position on the tracking stock. Like buffet says, when the tide goes out you’ll see who has been swimming naked.",
