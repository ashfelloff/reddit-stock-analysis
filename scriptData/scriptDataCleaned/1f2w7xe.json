While I understand morbid humor at some point you gotta cut it especially when it comes to money, money rules the world and guy acts like 150k is something so insignificant like it was just some pixels on a screen. There are homeless people on the streets sleeping on cardboards, maybe let's be more serious here and encourage less people becoming like that. You can joke about it as much as you want til you're the homeless on the cardboard.\n\nI'm just wondering why it took this guy 150k loss for him to stop? This is mental illness, an addiction, he has a serious issue, normal person would've stopped long time ago and cut their losses.
