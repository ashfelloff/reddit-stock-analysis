The Schwab help desk told me if the 504s don’t get assigned I’m naked basically on these SPY shares. Am I fucked? Like if SPY opens down 1% or something am I going to have to sell these shares for an even greater loss? PLEASE HELP!",

Schwab exercised my long calls as you can see in the post, but the owner of the short calls didn’t call my shares away until way way later. After hours of frustration and fear, all I did was realize max loss on the trade which was around 4.7k. The long calls were for 505 so 6500 shares of SPY were purchased automatically by Schwab at that price, and much later on they were called away because of the short calls at a price of 504. So -$6500 there + the premium I made from selling the spread which was $1800 left me with a loss of $4700. I am now going to reevaluate my life choices. Thank you for all the wonderful, insightful and hilarious comments guys. Cheers",

Now it looks like your long 65 505 calls were exercized for you, but the 504 call which you were short 65 of obviously got exersized too (so you got assigned in them). The shares of the two legs (+6500 and -6500) should cancel each other out.\n\nIf (which is unlikely) you do not get assigned on the 504 calls then you make 4 dollars (with spot at 508.01) times 100 per option.\n\nBut highly likely you were assigned. I would call with your broker though to verify. And ask if assignments are processed later than exersizes.\n\nIf the stock expired between your long and short leg (the two different calls, the 504 and 505) you would seriously be short 6500 stocks. This is no game.\n\nIn your case I would make sure you clean up your position before expiry if you dont want to be left with stocks.\n\nAlso, if you get assigned just before expiry then you are still covered by your long calls so no sweat.\n\nUsually early assignment only happens when htere is a dividend coming up and being long the calls would cost you money over the div (as the stock goes down with the dividend)",

Then you have to borrow from a bank, to pay the money  back to the brokerage company, because banks have a cheaper loan interest rate, than borrowing money from the stock market.",
