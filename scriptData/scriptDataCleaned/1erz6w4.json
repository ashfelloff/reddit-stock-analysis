  "score": 757,
  "selftext": "Family-owned candy giant Mars, whose brands include M&M’s and Snickers, said on Wednesday it would buy Cheez-It and Pringles maker Kellanova in a nearly $36 billion deal, making it the biggest deal in the packaged food industry.\n\nMars will pay $83.50 per share in an all-cash deal for Kellanova, representing about a 33% premium to Kellanova’s close on Aug. 2, before Reuters first reported that Mars was exploring a deal for the Pringles maker.\n\nShares of the company rose 8% to $80.45 before the bell.\n\nThe deal for Kellanova comes as sales growth at U.S. packaged food companies including Kraft Heinz, Mondelez and Hershey have taken a hit as budget-strapped customers hunt for cheaper, private-label alternatives to pricier branded items.\n\nThis has spurred dealmaking in the packaged food sector as companies seek scale to weather the impact of price inflation and weight-loss drugs weighing on demand.\n\nThe deal dwarfs Mars’ $23 billion takeover of Wrigley in 2008 and would bring under one roof a slate of popular consumer brands including Mars’ Twix, Bounty and Milky Way chocolates as well as Kellanova’s snacks portfolio of Pop-Tarts, Rice Krispies Treats and Eggo frozen waffles.\n\nThe acquisition is not expected to go through too many antitrust roadblocks due to the limited overlap between the two companies’ offerings, legal experts had told Reuters.\n\nKellanova, which split from WK Kellogg Co. last October, is rooted in a salty snacks business in the U.S. and around the world, and selling cereal outside of North America. WK Kellogg was left with the North American cereal business of Kellogg, the original parent company.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/mars-to-acquire-cheez-it-pringles-maker-kellanova-in-36-billion-deal.html",

Not sure what that translates to in terms of market share and im not sure anyone actually tracks it. I doubt Walmart, Amazon or Costco actually report their store brand stuff specifically in financials and even if they did, do they break it down by product? \n\nI wouldnt be surprised if generics already accounted for around 30% of the store shelves soda sales. Coke just has a major advantage at restaurants but b2b is a different story. Very hard for anyone to break into b2b because businesses care more about consistency and reliability than about a infinitesimal price difference that wont even make a blip on their bottom line. They lose far more money when things arent reliable than how much they might save by going with a competitor product. Thats true for many things in enterprise, not just soda.",

I don't know about the soda specifically but for instance Kirkland batteries and diapers are made by Duracell and Kimberly Clark respectively. Sara Lee makes Walmart's Great Value bread and Kellogs and General Mills makes their Great value cereal.\n\nThese grocery stores don't have their own manufacturing facilities, they just have existing companies make their product and they may have different specs of the existing product.\n\nAgain I don't know about the soda specifically but I'd bet good money that Coke or Pepsi probably makes that Sams and Kirkland cola you're talking about.",

This is because obesity tends to be highly correlated with wealth. In other words, if we had charts that showed obesity rate by wealth over time, I bet you it has barely changed and ill bet they actually declined the last 50 years. But we prefer to chart it against all people instead of wealth and perception is that \"its getting worse.\" It isnt. We are just getting \"wealthier.\" Life is easier than it used to be. And now our limitation is time to exercise not time to gather food. This is a good thing and its just part of the cycle. \n\nSo relax. Have a Twix.",

Do you want someone stopping you from playing sports or doing something that has any risk? Because sports have a huge chance of injury and cost us billions a year in insurance as well. Where is the outrage that the NFL, NBA and MLB are causing kids injury? Ultimately, its none of our business as long as they are not hurting anyone else. So yes, when i see that obesity map, I see absolutely nothing to worry about and neither should you because fat folks arent forcing food down your throat. They dont hurt you or me.\n\nFurther, we as a society, have no shortage of money. If there were an issue with paying the bills, then sure, you can complain, but that isnt the case and our economy has done nothing but boom since the entire anti-obesity crusade began (since the 90s). Not only that, innovation and invention hasnt slowed even one bit. So once again, that map might as well be toilet paper. In fact as long as we keep innovating the way we are, I could care less if everyone starts to looks like people in the Walle movie. Dont care even one iota.\n\nIve seen enough senseless deaths from cancers to accidents and shootings that I encourage everyone to enjoy their short lives. As long as you dont hurt others, do what you like. If you get joy from eating a steak lathered with butter, go do it. If you like having bulging muscles go for it. Still be productive and work, but enjoy your food. I dont care if you are fat or yolked. But complaining about obesity? Come on man. We have better things to do with our time than babysit.",
