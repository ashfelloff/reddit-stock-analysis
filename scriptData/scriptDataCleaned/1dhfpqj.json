  "selftext": "Check this out. My Boomer ass has been buying/selling/writing options since before my Gen Z grandson was a gleam in his Daddy's eye. This  anime watching, no pussy getting lil bitch thinks I just bake cookies and knit socks all day. No, bitch. I'm writing strangles on NVDA and sneaking Viagra into your grandpa's lemonade.\n\nAfter exiting my position and profiting over 20k, I turned on The Netflix and watched \"Wolf of Wall Street\". It reminded me of how much of a loser my grandson is, so I gave him a ring on the old rotary phone. I tried explaining to him that I repped Theta Gang, but he was clueless. \n\nHe tried giving me a poorly thought out fantasy football parlay, which I immediately dissected as a  loser. This kid will be living in a dumpster behind Wendy's before the year is over.\n\nTL;DR: My grandson doesn't understand options trading or get any pussy.\n\nPOS: Long 233 shares AVG $44 per",
