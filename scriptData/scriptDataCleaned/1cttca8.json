  "selftext": "For anyone paying attention you will have noticed that $ASTS shot up 68% today on over 1700% of normal volume. This is no mere flash-in the pan meme trash. The company signed a commercial agreement with $T (AT&T) announced yesterday on the 1Q earnings call. See here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240515925684/en/\n\nSome Background:\nThis company is launching satellites to serve 5G wireless directly to unmodified cellphones. If you understand anything about radio frequency transmission (which none of you do, of course), you will understand that there are no easy shortcuts around antenna aperture. The geniuses at ASTS will win the race because they have just gone ahead and built the biggest possible antenna that they can possibly send into space. SpaceX is attempting this, but they will not be able to deliver the same or even similar service as ASTS. Their satellites are just to small.\n\nThe total addressable market for this company is literally anyone with a cellphone. (read: huge, trillions huge). They’ll sell the service to mobile network operators (MNOs) who will then sell you a roam anywhere package for some fixed monthly cost.\n\nWhy buy now:\nDerisking is over, the company has proven they can deliver and they are beginning to launch the constellation this summer. The commercial agreement with AT&T is likely to be the first of many. If AT&T can get onboard, why can’t you?\n\nThere is a substantial amount of info at \nr/astspacemobile\n\nSpeaking the language of WSB, see this post specifically: https://redd.it/1ctnu5d\n\nCurrent price: $4.03\nPrice Target: $318 (+7800%)\n\nEDIT: Up 12% after 8 minutes…\nEDIT2: ASTS is up another 24% on 493% of normal volume before 11:30am. Get your tickets for the moon landing before it’s too late 🚀🚀🚀🚀",

No one knew whether they were going to go bankrupt, launch a sat, delay a launch, dilute (again) or announce a massive deal like this from one day to the next. It honestly looked like they were actively sabotaging the SP at some points.\n\nThe AT&T deal is the first of about 5 milestones. The next big one is the FCC approval for their big sat - that looks nailed on - the FCC have said they want to be at the forefront of direct to cell and this tech is it. \n\nIt looks like they've also made a deal with FirstNet already which will be huge for the SP, but there's no details of the funding or terms yet. It would be a long term source of revenue with potential to roll out globally in the short term.\n\nThe sat launches and AT&T roll out will have a huge impact too. \n\nIf they hit these there's no reason it won't go up a few thousand %. Market potential is ridiculous.\n\nAs I said, the downside is there's absolutely no way of knowing what the clowns will do next, so it's risky, they've said they won't dilute this year, but I really wouldn't trust them.",

Here's my best guess: This will run for a bit - days, weeks, maybe a couple of months, chopping its way back up to $6-$8 per share. There will be lots of bullishness. Then one day, you wake up and check the share price, and it's down 30-50%. Hopefully you sold before the dump, so you can buy back in at whatever the new low is without averaging. Least that's how the last 4-5 cycles have gone. I've been trading this stock for years. It's made me thousands, buying the dips and selling the rips. It cost me $1500 when they announced they were issuing new shares a few months back, I was caught off-guard. But I locked in $1300 profit today just before closing, letting the rest ride for a week. This is a great stock to trade. Beware becoming a bag holder for large $ amounts. \n\n\nEdit: price target $318.00 gtf outa here. Maybe when I'm old as grandmas socks.
