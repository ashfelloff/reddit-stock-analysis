I‚Äôm expecting to see them putter around that level until the announcement, at which point I think Powell will most likely start with a 0.25% cut, just based on how confident he has been in the economy, and possibly a 0.5% the following meeting to start giving it some juice.\n\nExpecting markets to get over the usual September madness and climb higher in the 4th quarter.

And the market has shown pretty strongly, what it thought about that. Purely from where we are today I¬¥d predict rate cuts of 50/25/25. Because that would work better and still be more conservative, than 25/50/50. \n\nThe general blabbering about a panic with 50 I don¬¥t buy for a second. Pretty much everybody at this point got the feeling, that we are behind the curve and need to get ahead of it, if we want to steer it. Just like the Fed underestimated inflation at the beginning (as I did), and then had to act stronger, than intended, if it is to slow on jobs, it will have to steer stronger later.\n\nAlso: Fear of a market panic is not, what the Fed is looking at. If it did, we would have seen to 25 point cuts by now.\n\nHiring is slowing. More and more companies are thinking about layoffs or already laying off. Once the Fed allows that to turn into a layoff cycle, it will be much, much harder to stop it. Unemployment is currently still very low. But that is no thanks to the Feds and it is most definitely not the Feds job to get it to 5 % or higher just for good measure.\n\nAs for the strong economy: It is. However it is beginning to level to the rest of the world. And no, neither Europe nor Asia offer any hints, they are pushing, if the US doesn¬¥t pull the wagon first.\n\nI do agree, that the markets are likely to rise to the end of the year, but the real push will likely come after the elections. A cut of 50 may however carry us over there much easier. Especially with liquidity reentering the market.",
