  "selftext": "I wanted to share a screenshot of something I noticed in Ko. It also happens in lots other companies as well.  See the picture, this was the level 2 option data for the short, near  expiry option.  This is a fake spread. I know because as soon as you place an order the entire ask changes much tighter to the bid. My theory is they are taking advantage of people who don't have access to the level 2 option data.  On think or swim for example, the automatic sale price defaults to the mid point.  If you can't see what's going on in the chain, you may think that's fair value and buy. Then you are instantly red twenty percent or more.\n\nTldr, make sure you never sell or buy at the mid price or you could get scammed",
