A lot of nuclear tech has been revolved around limiting the amount of material so you can avoid having to solve for meltdowns.  Since a meltdown is not a concern with limited fissure material, the plants become more versatile.  Overall nuclear efficiency hasnâ€™t really increased per se - it was extremely efficient to start with - but design efficiency given that smaller amounts of material wonâ€™t cause a 100 mile radius to be uninhabitable for 100 years is a major benefit lol.\n\nComparative to other forms of renewable energy, nuclear is the only one that can run for 24 hours, requires no specific weather, and really has no size and space limitations.  Hydro requires moving bodies of water, wind requires sustainable pressure changes and lots of space, solar only works part of the day and requires a tremendous amount of space.

So to get 1 GW you would need 10 -- 100 MW plants built. I'd feel better if they had a 250 - 500 MW option but they seemed to poo poo that. They don't want to make it into a construction project but 10 MW's is a construction project. The state will easily step in and say we can build you 1 thing and it will take 5 years. \n\nMaybe they could put 3 of those suckers side by side and say 300. I don't know. \n\nI will invest something and see how the quarters go from here. Not expecting this to be parabolic by no means for now.

So distributing out multiple plants across a campus to match with the portion of the data center managed can keep things 1:1 for now which is think allows for better management than having to bring a large amount of power online.\n\nUnlike other types of power, once nuclear gets going, itâ€™s hard to turn off, so itâ€™s not like you can just dial it back. If you build large you need a way to toss the excess back on to the grid somehow and I think thatâ€™s a much harder problem to solve.",
