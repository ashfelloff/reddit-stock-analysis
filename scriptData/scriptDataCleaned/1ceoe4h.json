  "title": "I'm highly against the potential opening of the market to 24/7 trading, after spending the last 3 years in crypto futures. Here's why:",
  "score": 1285,
  "selftext": "As a trader, you thrive on volatility. You thrive on movements. With the market only \"open\" for a set period of time, it essentially ensures that - if there's going to be volatility or movement - it's far and away most likely to occur within the timeframe that the market is open (obvious exception being futures, but even then - large movements after/pre-hours are comparatively rare). This ensures faster, more efficient movement - allowing active day-traders to make money within that timeframe.\n\nI've traded crypto futures for the last three years. What I've seen most frequently happen in said 24/7 market, is that you'll see long, extended, seemingly endless periods of consolidation, punctuated by either a rapid, \"almost random\" high-volatility movement, or a very slow, progressive, multiple day trend. While said movement \"may\" occur within standard US trading hours, it may also occur outside.\n\nIn traditional finance, with open market hours, you're far more likely to see some sort of decent movement occur nearly every day within open hours. It feels consistent, repeatable, and has a feeling of market efficiency \"correcting & moving the market price to where it's intended to be\" within the short timeframe where the market is available.\n\nBy opening up trading to 24/7 hours, I expect movements will be much more similar to crypto; in terms of either huge sudden movements at any given sudden time after 2 days of extended consolidation - or long, slow-moving, protracted movements that generate insecurity in your position and often premature closing of position.\n\nThe only ones who benefit from 24/7 markets are 1) Algos, 2) Institutional players entering and exiting large positions incrementally, and 3) Longer-term swing traders. \n\nThe daily volatility will largely disappear, without the need for entering/exiting positions within a specific timeframe.\n\nNow eviscerate me and my expectations and tell me why I'm wrong",

(Hint: when you buy during low liquidity time frames like pre market and after hours, your bid/ask spread is going to be insane, sometimes as wide as 20-50 cents depending on the stock you're trading. And if you buy 100 shares of XYZ, you instantly lose the spread difference x number of shares cause your order will be hitting the ask or bid depending on which way your order is.)\n\nLearn about premarket and after hour trading to understand how stupid it is to get excited about 24/7 trading.",

The daily auctions provide the necessary reset points and create market fairness.\n\n24/7 would be a game changer from a liquidity standpoint which would ultimately be better for retail.  Currently after hours trading can be volatile but a 24/7 market would smooth some of that out by bringing in additional liquidity for buying and selling.  This would be beneficial during earnings season but could potentially depress spikes (which is better for long term investors by affording lower overall volatility).\n\nI’m in favor of a 24/7 marketplace.  If there needs to be a test, it would be best to let ETFs go 24/7 first then if that’s successful, let equities go 24/7.
