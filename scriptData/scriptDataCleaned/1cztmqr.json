The yokes are meant to average inputs and if a pilot wants to take full control it is literally a button press. Edit: mind you. Two pilots should never be using controls at the same time anyway, which they are trained to communicate to eachother. This is why when 2 pilots are flying there is always a pilot in command who is flying while the other only operates radio, nav, and auxiliary controls at their command.\n\nThis is not even the same league as a computerized trim runaway error that nosedives your airplane into the ground unless you can run through an obscure checklist while your forehead is pinned against the cockpit windshield.",
