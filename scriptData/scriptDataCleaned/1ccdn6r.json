  "score": 55,
  "selftext": "Today even after positive earnings meta fell because they indicated that their next earnings would be not good as what analysts expected. Also because Zuckerberg spoke about mixed reality headset during earnings call which made it go more lower. I think it also went down due to its spending on reality labs. The earnings call is very risky to play and investors must see the future expectation of the company rather than checking out the past quarter. The stock market is more about future rather than the past. But do you reckon this will be the case for MSFT too Tommorow ?",

They beat estimates and that's great, but forward guidance is everything now. There's realistically 2 quarters in which we have a high probability of not getting ANY rate change. At this point, forward guidance is everything.\n\n\nI'm surprised tsla shot up. Those people have to be real regards.
