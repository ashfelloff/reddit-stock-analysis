          "body": "Selling covered calls means you own the underlying.  The only real \"loss\" you have is if the contract is exercised and you sell the underlying at a lower share price then what the stock is trading at.\n\n\nExample: you write a contract for a company you own a 100 shares of at a strike price of 75 dollars when it's trading at 60 for 2 weeks at a 1.0 premium. You make your premium off the contract.  Before the 2 weeks is up, the stock is trading at 85 dollars.\n\n\nYou made 1600 dollars (underlying sold at 75 + your 100 dollar premium).  Your \"loss\" is 900 dollars because if you wouldn't have written the call contract you could have sold 100 shares at 85 dollars a share. (This simple example is assuming your buy in for the position was 60 dollars a share)\n\n\nIn the end you made money($1600), but you could have potentially made more($2500).\n\nIf the stock never trades over 74.99 a share over those 2 weeks, then you just made 100 dollars over 2 weeks by offering someone the right, but not the obligation, to buy 100 shares of the company at 75 dollars.  Easiest 100 bucks you'll ever make in this lifetime probably.\n\n\nCash secured puts are the same concept. The money to cover buying 100 shares at your strike price is in your account, and stays in your account for the duration of the contract, when you write the contract. You get exercised and the stock trades lower than your strike price is the potential \"loss\".\n\n\nThese are probably the least risky options plays.  downside is that they lock up liquidity for the life of the contract for not big returns... normally.\n\n\n\nIf this isn't potentially life ruining enough you can try naked calls.  that's when you do not own the underlying.",

You have to weigh the cost of buying to close the contract to exit the position over the potential \"loss\" on what the underlying is trading in regards to your strike price.\n\nYou can also \"roll up\" a covered call contract, which essentially is buying to close the contract and selling to open a new one at a higher strike price.  Same concept, you need to weigh the potential costs involved against your potential loss, as well as locking up said liquidity for the duration of the said contract.\n\nMost people recommend selling covered calls on stock you wouldn't mind selling in the end anyway.  Definitely would not recommend selling (especially longer contracts) on stocks you think are extremely bullish or going to rally.

It takes money to make money selling CCs.\n\nTo give you an idea:\n\nThe above example was pretty close in numbers to my SO position earlier this year: traded sideways at 62 dollars a share for awhile.  My buy in was actually in the low 40s so I already made my money and had been soaking up dividends on it for awhile.  Sold a 2 month CC at a 72 dollar strike price, and on the last week it rallied to 80.\n\nI could have rolled up, but I already made my money on it and didn't want to have my liquidity in that account locked up any longer.  I was foaming at the mouth to open a position w/ nvda at 115 dollars a share.  If I rolled up, my 8000 or so dollars on the position would have been untouchable.  Buying to close was a bit expensive for my taste -- even being 8 dollars over my strike price.\n\nThe contract was exercised, I made profit (not as much as I could have), but I threw that profit into a better opportunity immediately (Nvda).\n\nSO is currently trading at 92.  I think it exercised at 80 if I remember correctly.  I technically \"lost\" 800 dollars of potential profit on my SO position, but I turned around and sold nvda at 140 last week with a buy in of 112 on it once my money freed up.  By leaving 800 bucks on the table, I made way more profit on another position.  And in the end, it was over like a 62 dollar premium or some shit.\n\nSo... sometimes it's about giving a little up to get a lot more.",
