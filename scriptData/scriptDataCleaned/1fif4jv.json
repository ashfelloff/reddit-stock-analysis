Programs get cracked/hacked because they're *just obfuscated*; someone with enough skill and time can bypass all restrictions. Cryptographic security on the other hand is pragmatically completely infeasible (e.g. it'd take a billion years to crack an SSL connection that lasts a few hours/days) no matter if you have access to the best supercomputers on Earth (although quantum computers may change it in the future)",
