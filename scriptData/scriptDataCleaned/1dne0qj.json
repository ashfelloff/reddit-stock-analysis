  "selftext": "Oneok is a stock I have been following for awhile and sat in on shareholder meetings. It appears that every time it hits above $80 every couple years they split the stock and it tanks down to $15-20 and then slowly builds back up. Is this history repeating again? I feel like if it tanks again its a great buy. They work in transporting natural gas which is still a growing industry.",
