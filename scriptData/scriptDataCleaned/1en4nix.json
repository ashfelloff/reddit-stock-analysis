The defense sector is way too concentrated right now.\n\nI keep an eye on this field, and you're starting to see the govt granting contracts to smaller players now. The feds realized that their budget-cutting post Cold War (necessary) and their relentless pushing of defense mergers afterwards (maybe not so much) ended up getting the US military wedded to about 5 giant conglomerates. Those guys are now all too big to fail, and are pretty much free to get their Boeing on and act regarded while wasting a ton of public money. \n\nThe feds are a decade or so late to realize this, but the good news is they're taking steps to course-correct. Time will tell if it's a genuine effort to re-seed and diversify the field, or if it's just a short-term ploy to get the big boys motivated with a couple hot wars looking imminent.",
