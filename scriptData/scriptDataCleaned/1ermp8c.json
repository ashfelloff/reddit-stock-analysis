NVDL is up 1383% since its inception in late 2022, NVDA itself is only up 600% in the same time frame. 2.3x year-on-year outperformance despite only having 2x daily leverage. Leveraging in and of itself isn't inherently a bad thing as long as you know what you're doing with it. That said, Nvidia is stupidly volatile right now and has the potential to absolutely ruin your day if you leverage it too hard, I'd personally rather buy it on margins for the time being instead of going NVDL but both will probably print over the next year",
