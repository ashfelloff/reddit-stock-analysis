It's like buying CSCO at $50 and then 5 years later checking the price to see it's.... $50 - Stop listening to morons on this board that think INTC is the next big thing. They are literally spending 10s of Billions just to get back to equal with TSMC. And when they do, they will still be in a low-margin, highly commoditized business. The day of making 50% profit margins on CPUs is over. And they don't have anything remotely similar to CUDA to break into NVDAs territory. They've tried before when NVDA was still a baby and failed miserably. What makes anyone think they can do it now with NVDA more entrenched than ever ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/24reav1d6kdd1.png?width=1279&format=png&auto=webp&s=c01950cd386137e0c8dabe5f219983f24fe490bc",
