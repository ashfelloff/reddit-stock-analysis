  "selftext": "US stocks were higher on Wednesday as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated the Fed will likely cut interest rates this year amid inflation's \"bumpy\" path downward.\n\nThe S&P 500 (GSPC) rose about 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) popped about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) led the gains, rising more than 0.4% after the major gauges closed Tuesday in a sea of red.\n\nIn a speech at Stanford University on Wednesday, Powell doubled down on his belief that inflation was on a \"bumpy\" path down to 2%, but that central bank officials expect to lower rates at \"some point\" this year.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-stocks-cling-to-gains-as-powell-says-rate-cuts-likely-at-some-point-this-year-162051958.html",
