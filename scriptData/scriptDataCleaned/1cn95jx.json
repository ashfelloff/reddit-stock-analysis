But it will greatly change Intel's outlook if TSMc decides its new direction is worth pursuing. \n\nRemember, its not hard to achieve low nm or even 16A chips. Its hard to do it cost efficiently and have enough high yield % to make it worthwhile. Intel's biggest weakness in fabbing is that they are an American company. USA workers are always paid disproportionally high (even though you hear american's bitch on being underpaid on reddit) and work really low hours (40ish?). 60-70+ hours are common for Fab plants like Samsung/Tsmc. \n\nI personally will never invest in an American fab company until AI is developed enough to replace most of its workers.",
