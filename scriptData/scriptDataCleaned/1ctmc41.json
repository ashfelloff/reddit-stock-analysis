  "selftext": "I was scrolling Reddit to get backtest ideas. Long ago, I had heard of “[the White Girl Index](https://nexustrade.io/library?id=96a78edc-94ac-430e-8ad4-691322a49d73)”, a collection of targeting investments that adult white women would buy. This included Target, Starbucks, and Lululemon.\n\nWhile scrolling through the comments, [a random Redditor proposed something that I found interesting](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9n31xf/comment/e7jd3qq/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). The “Neckbeard Index”. From his comment:\n\n>I humbly propose the Neckbeard Index:  \nNVIDIA  \nAMD  \nPEP  \nDPZ  \nNFLX  \nAMZN  \nTSLA  \nBTC\n\nOut of curiosity, [I decided to try it out in a backtest and saw this crazy result.](https://nexustrade.io/library?id=41194368-aa82-47a1-a7c4-b5d1f3e5620c)\n\n[The \\\\\"Neckbeard Index\\\\\"](https://i.redd.it/8yhtue34hu0d1.gif)\n\nThis portfolio is up **over 550% in the past 5 years**. If you look at the other metrics like sharpe ratio and sortino ratio, it's also much better than SPY.\n\n# Call to Action: Let's Make a New Neckbeard Index\n\nu/compounding wasn't a psychic. He just noticed trends and if you decided on it, you would've gotten LOTS of money. It's time for us to make a new neckbeard index.\n\nObviously gaming stock will be in it, but what else? NVIDIA still? AMD? I'll create a portfolio with the top upvoted comments.\n\n**EDIT:** \n\nMy comments seem to be hidden, but I’m reading through all of the replies. \n\nSo far, we have\n\n* HOOD (by far our favorite brokerage)\n* The stock that cannot be named (originated from  this subreddit, plus we’re gamers)\n* RDDT (self-explanatory)\n* NVDA and AMD (our gaming computers)\n* DPZ (c’mon)\n* WMT (where we buy our video games and tendies\n* AMZN and MSFT\n\nWhat else should I add to the list?\n\nOther possible stocks:\n* movie theater stock (undeniable shitstock)\n* COIN (do we like crypto?)\n* marijuana stocks (hot garbage but decriminalization) 🤔\n* LLY\n* DIS\n* CMG\n* CRSR\n* NFLX",

Their business model is bad for investment since they simply just slap their brand on their product, most of their design IPs aren't even that great and majority of the expenses comes from manufacturing cost(aka ordering from other companies such as Seasonic, Samsung, SK Hynix, MU, etc)",
