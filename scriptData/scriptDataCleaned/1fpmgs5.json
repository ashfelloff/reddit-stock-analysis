Altemus said he had received information from NASA that it would be in the September timeframe. Which could be later, like NSNS. Earlier on the call, he acknowledged it can be hard to predict and sometimes takes longer than anticipated. While they are confident, nothing is actually confirmed:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4eynd9xvw2rd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccefc006a349906ed560c84e1aa88b9d2efd12b7",
