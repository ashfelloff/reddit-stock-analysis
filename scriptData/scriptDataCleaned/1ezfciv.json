The stock trades at 82x 2024 earnings, or 19x 2025, which is basically the market average multiple.\n\nConsensus basically implies that Intel is going to have this dramatic recovery from 2024-25 and then grow in line with the market average from then on.\n\n>Guys Intel isn't going under, the government will float it if all else fails\n\nBut even if we take it at face value, this is still a silly argument. GM shareholders got zeroed when the government bailed it out. Split-adjusted, Citigroup is still down over 90% compared to before the government forced it to dilute shares as a condition for a bailout. Just because Intel will survive doesn't mean the experience can't be very, very painful for shareholders (the same applies for Boeing, which is the other company where you hear this argument often).\n\n>They could liquidate the company and the profit would be more than the share price\n\nNot that it matters for the stock, but assuming you're referring to P/B < 1, that is very misleading if you actually go through the balance sheet. 30% of Intel's book value is Goodwill, which is worth nothing in a liquidation. Another 10% is inventory and almost half is PP&E, both of which would have to be heavily marked down if Intel was actually liquidated. Book value does a very poor job of measuring the value of a company like Intel, and as a result, P/B = 1 is nothing more than a psychological anchor.",
