No. It‚Äôs not responsible to make these types of bets on options, especially on meme stocks, and especially if you are gambling money that you need to live on.

It's also the only publicly traded company that focuses on LGBT, with an LGBT CEO and board of directors. If they can continue to expand, targeting to international markets older demographics and monetizing existing users this can be $10-$20 billion dollar company.
