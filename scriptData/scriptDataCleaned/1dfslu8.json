No. It’s not responsible to make these types of bets on options, especially on meme stocks, and especially if you are gambling money that you need to live on. I have disposable income and sold my calls earlier today, what I have in calls now is a fraction of what I made today so it’s not a big deal if I lose it. Buying stocks on the other hand I think is a reasonable and relatively low risk move.",

It's also the only publicly traded company that focuses on LGBT, with an LGBT CEO and board of directors. If they can continue to expand, targeting to international markets older demographics and monetizing existing users this can be $10-$20 billion dollar company.
