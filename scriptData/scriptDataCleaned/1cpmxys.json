They generally only go all-in once they have a tight ass case with mountainous evidence. It's definitely not something that happens overnight. I'd say give it time.  \n\nEven something like the recent FTX/Scam Bankman-Fraud case where it was so blatantly fraudulent from Day 1, it still took SEC several years of case-building behind the scenes before he suddenly got arrested in Bahamas and the whole thing toppled over overnight. It's very slow, imperceptible, until one day it isn't.\n\nBut yeah the general corruption of landing upwards into various cushy lucrative compensation gigs is fucked up for sure",

          "body": "The numbers add up and I spent over a decade in the business. \n\nPeople say that because they heard Caravan's gross profit per unit and think it's impossible. I thought the same till I did 5 minutes of research.  For Q1 they averaged 2600 per unit retail and 800 per unit wholesale.  This compares to 2200 retail and 1000 wholesale for CarMax.\n\nCarvana,  for some reason, adds the wholesale to their retail for a 3400 per unit profit but wait there is more.  Carvana packages up their loans and sells them as securities and adds that profit to their gross per unit.of wholesale cars is just added to their retail profit.  That's why (how) they reported 6400 per unit in Q1.\n\nCarMax, by comparison makes most of it's money from their own financing arm keeping those loans on their books.  So they make a ton of money this way but it's not added to their per profit unit.\n\nTheir Q1 volume was way up and if they can continue to grow like this their valuation starts to make more sense.  On the other hand if this may have been a temporary spike due to tax returns and their partnership with Hertz to sell EVs.\n\nUsed car sellers in general have a tough road ahead due to rates remaining high.  New car inventory is rapidly increasing and it's easy for manufactures to offer incentives especially on financing to move more units. (As you may have read Tesla just introduced .99% APR financing for the model Y) New car incentives both lowers the sales volume of used cars and lowers the value of the cars they already own.  This was reflected in Carmax's guidance but not Carvana's. \n\nPersonally I think the stock is over valued but I also was shocked to see they sold 1/3 the number of cars as CarMax with no retail locations.\n\nYMMV but if I was buying anything it would be end of year puts.",
