  "selftext": "TLDR: Schwab hates you; RH, WeBull and TastyTrade kinda think you're an okay bloke\n\n\n\n\n**Outages**\n\nSchwab had the worst outage, with what looks like a system overload from the volume of people trying to log in. The outage lasted up to 3 hours for some. It was about 2 hours for me.\n \nIf you had puts in your Schwab account, I am truly  sorry. You probably left some heavy gains on the table.\n \nFidelity, IBKR, and Vanguard (and probaby others) were all down for the open for quite a few, but none as bad as Schwab. But it was only an open with the 3rd highest VIX in history, so what's the most important 30 mins between friends, am I right?\n\nWhat matters is you're trading with a \"real\" brokerage. \n\n\n\n\n**The Overnight Session**\n\nOvernight trading venue Blue Ocean fucked up hard last night. They stopped the trading session early, at 1 am. Worse, they canceled executed trades. As both Robinhood and IBKR use Blue Ocean, both got fucked and fucked hard. Canceled trades took like 8 hours to clear up.\n\nThey have also canceled tonight's session (Aug 5).\n\n\n\n\n**That's it, I'm done with [insert your broker]**\n\nWell, you can judge for yourself how each handled the 3rd highest VIX spike in modern history. I was already getting fed up with Schwab, myself, so I'm for sure done with them and their shitty tech. \n\nAs for where to go, RH, WeBull and TastyTrade apparently all had zero issues with the open. The overnight session problems were a Blue Ocean problem and so if you decide on a \"real\" broker like IBKR, that ain't gonna fix the overnight issue. (Overnight is new enough and low volume enough, that I'm a *little* more forgiving, and it's not like there are other options for retail.)\n\n\n\n\n**Tinfoil Hats**\n\n*This was planned to stop retail from buying the dip!!!1!!1!*\n\nI doubt it. Looks like most of the so-called \"real\" brokers have subpar infrastructure that can't handle massive volume. They just got swamped and Schwab showed itself to be the worst at handling the volume. \n\n\n\n\n**They did you a FAVOR**\n\nBullshit. Absolute, uncut bullshit. They are brokers, not our fucking parents, and (most of us) aren't 12. \n\nHad puts? Go fuck yourself. \n\nWanted to buy the dip? How about you eat a dick instead.\n\nWanted to liquidate one set of positions in order to rotate into 3x bull etfs? Sorry, bro, this is \"for your own good.\"\n\n\n\nConclusion: probably RH calls at open. (They are totally about to raise the Gold fee and this is going to give them some new customers. And they're about to have literally all my money)\n\nEdit: I've been told IBKR does, in fact, have a separate overnight venue, but I guess they sometimes route orders through Blue Ocean. Do with this info what you will.",
