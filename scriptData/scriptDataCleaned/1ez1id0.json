Worst of all is you probably aren't the guy that can 180 your lifestyle on your spot, it's probably going to be really hard to transition from being a re-gard to re-sponsible adult.\n\nIf you wanna gamble, that create a real budget and the gambling money isn't allocated to investments/savings, it's allocated to entertainment, that comes out of your money you're allowed to spend on eating out.",
