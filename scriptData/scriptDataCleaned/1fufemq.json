This is one of those short-term calls and shares(Wall St 6 mths short term, not WSB regarded weeklies and 0dte short term) and long-term puts and shorts kinda thing. China's central management essentially gave up trying to prop up the economy through individual sector based liquidity in the form of government funding and investments, they know all the corrupt fuckers involved throughout the chain will try to take as much money for themselves as possible. Dumping money into the market was the eventual answer they reach after constant denial and demonizing of Feds printing measures, it'll attract both domestic and foreign capital greeding for the printer. Ironic how a country pretending to be commies eventually have to rely on capitalism to save their dying economy despite barking about the evils of it for 7 decades",
