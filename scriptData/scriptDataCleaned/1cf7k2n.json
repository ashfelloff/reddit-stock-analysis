  "selftext": "This weekend it was confirmed Bytedance is refusing to sell Tik Tok. China is giving the middle finger to Uncle Sam and a golden handshake to Daddy Zuck. \n\nAll those millions of American viewing hours have to go somewhere, and no one is positioned better than Meta with Instagram Reels. \n\nX is still bleeding money and Apple has pulled back on the Vision pro. Llama 3 is incredible and integration is happening as we speak. \n\nThey‚Äôve beat earnings quarter after quarter and this recent pullback of 10% is a MASSIVE over correction, and I believe the company is set to see a quick legendary run up despite fears of a BaNkInG CrIsIs or stock market crash. Let üåàüêªs fear monger while you profit. \n\nI‚Äôm in for 2k in calls expiring this May. \n\nNot financial advice \n\nEDIT: For all the regards saying this should be a long term play, here‚Äôs your gold star ‚≠êÔ∏è. But short term calls are DIRT CHEAP and betting on them is how you make money. \n\nThink of it like a Jack in the Box. You don‚Äôt know when the monkey will pop out but you want to invest before he does. ",

                      "body": "If I were the OP (wanting to go long on META long-term and don't have the capital to buy a LEAPS which costs like 10k), I would open a call debit spread (buy call at a lower strike and write call at higher strike on the same expiration, June 25th 2025 or something). The debit would only be a couple of hundred bucks but give you leveraged exposure to the long side, and having a short leg would balance out your theta decay and potential IV changes. The downside is that your return is capped, and if the stock price appreciates rapidly in the near term, the spread won't benefit as much from the movement as a plain long call.   \n  \nOP's rationale is long-term, and they should act accordingly rather than buying short-term calls and hoping for the best. I think understanding option Greeks + IV and trading spreads really encourages you to think of investments as expressing your view on the market, and options provide much more ways to do that (other than just stocks will go up or down).",
