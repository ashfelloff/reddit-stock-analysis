  "score": 150,
  "selftext": "The Senate just officially passed the bill that news articles had been talking about for week. In this bill, TikTok has to sell itself or it will be banned. Keep in mind that despite the discussed possibility that a US company may come in to buy, there is virtually no shot of this happening.\n\nChina has already criticized the bill thus it will block a potential sale even if TikTok wanted to sell it: https://www.wsj.com/tech/tiktok-ban-chinese-owners-bytedance-1a857a06. In other words, it‚Äôs pretty much a guaranteed ban. \n\nIG reels is the only legitimate competitor to TikTok, and contrary to what some people have said here, the user base is actively growing. Given that earnings for META are also coming in, it‚Äôs time to buy calls. META has gone down over the last couple of weeks so this can‚Äôt be priced in either. The Senate wasn‚Äôt expected to pass this bill until the House decided to lump in the TikTok bill with foreign aid packages to fast track it. This only happened a few weeks ago and META hasn‚Äôt reacted so I‚Äôm going all in\n\n525C 4/26\n\n\n\n",
