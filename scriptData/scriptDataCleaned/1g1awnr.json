  "title": "GOOGLE: The Real Leader In AI, Robotics and Self Driving ",

  "selftext": "This is a follow up  post to my analysis of TESLA VS WAYMO. \n\n\nRight now OpenAI is the clear leader when it comes to developing AI. Everyone else is playing catch up, however there's one company that doesn't get enough credit - GOOGLE. \n\n\nGoogle is the one that actually did most of the groundbreaking work in AI. They're the pioneers of technology in the field of AI. \n\n\nYou must be thinking Why didn't we hear about this if they're the pioneers of AI? \n\n\nThe reason is that Google failed to be the first one to commercialise it. \n\nGoogle had something called \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS.\"  It was basically a division of Google solely focused on Ultra Ambitious Projects. \n\nAI research and development was a part of it.\n\nIn 2014 Google acquired DeepMind Labs that was founded in the UK in 2010.\n\nDeepMind introduced neural Turing machines (neural networks that can access external memory like a conventional Turing machine), which is basically a computer that loosely resembles short-term memory in the human brain.\n\n\nThe Founding Research and Development Team of OpenAI, actually came from Google (DeepMind).\n\n\nNow going back to \"PROJECT MOONSHOTS\" - in 2010 Larry Page and Sergy Brin turned  \"Project Moonshots\" into \"X COMPANY\".\n\nYes, it's called X, and they did it before Musk LMAO. \n\nThis is what X Company does -\n\nX's mission is to invent and launch \"moonshot\" technologies that aim to make the world a radically better place.\n\n A moonshot is defined by X as the intersection of a big problem, a radical solution, and breakthrough technology. \n\nWork at X is overseen by entrepreneur scientist Astro Teller, as CEO and \"Captain of Moonshots\".\n\nThe lab started with the development of Google's self-driving car.\n\n\nSELF DRIVING VEHICLES are a brainchild of X Company. \n\nThey are also working on some secret projects (presumably alongside the US government).\n\n\nWhile Google fell behind OpenAI in commercializing and marketing of AI, they are still a leader in everything related to AI, Machine Learning and Fully Autonomous Vehicles. \n\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n\nTLDR;\n\nGOOGLE IS EVERYTHING ELON MUSK IS CLAIMING TO BE. \n\n\n\n. . . . . \n\n\nEDIT 1 : My Thoughts On DOJ Case Against Google and A Potential Breakup \n\n\nIf (a big if) DOJ actually wins against Google and is able to break them up, the most likely scenario is a spin-off of Android and Chrome. \n\nIMO, this is not a bad thing if you're looking at the bigger picture. It will get DOJ/Anti-trust lawsuits worldwide off Google's back, without really impairing their ability to develop AI and other futuristic tech.\n\n\nEven this can potentially take years to materialize, if it ever actually happens. So personally I'm not bothered by it. \n\n\n. . . . . .\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n. . .\n\nhttps://x.company/projects/\n\n\n. . .\n\n\nhttps://deepmind.google\n\n\n. . . ",

A real world example would be a pedestrian crossing the street at night.

It will warn you if you are driving in very dark conditions with dings and \"multiple cameras blocked or blinded\" errors. I mean, it's a vision-based system. It needs vision to be able to work. It isn't a 100%/0% success switch - the less light it has, the worse it is at detecting stuff it should be detecting. This is a physical limitation to their approach.

You can't deny the issues with him, and how distracted he is right now. \n\nAlso, I never said that robocabs won't happen, however \"when\" is super important here! Full Autonomy happening in 2025 vs 2029 are two very different things and as you can see the market has reacted accordingly! \n\nElon has not only been promising the Real Autonomy, but he has explicitly said that Tesla's current valuation is only justified if they can solve the Autonomy and without that it would be valued much lower. \n\nNow he has been promising FSD (the actual Autonomy) for years now, and finally this event was supposed to be him actually launching it, and not merely announcing that it'd be released sometime in future! \n\n\nThis is why Tesla sold off yesterday, and I expect it to fall lower, because it was priced for perfection and nothing less!",
