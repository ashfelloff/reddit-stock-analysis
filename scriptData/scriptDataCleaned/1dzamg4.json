AMD is nowhere on AI, ARM architecture is slowly consuming x86 share, and Intel is doing its best to hold its share and moving towards manufacturing as it sees the death of x86 - AMD is pinned. NVDA is at least growing and has monopolistic margins, ARM has the capability to capture x86 share in PCs and servers, and continues to grow in mobile and embedded.\n\nAMD is a dog in comparison but gets 250x p/e.

It's basically a small cap at an extremely overvalued price.\n\nEven softbank sells it.\n\nBut hey, it went up 10294738% in the past months so it has to be good! Right?",

If you have a need that MIGHT be useful, it will become developed, and thier great at doing things that others cannot. And then these become world wide adoption of a product line, and their in it to make multiple skews of sed product. and not ONE type of one item, just, products, w dissimilar qualities. Lets say, there is a blackberry w some set of features, these guys get one available first, then BB and all co that rely on BB for income and are part of a supply chain, become dependent on what and how and when ARM produces the said item. Their also attempted to make multiple products that can do similarly to one large co as what can work w smaller segments of tech and said co that might rely on them for said item. Also their profit margins on many of their most popular items are REDICULOUSLY HIGH, making each one that is a success, A MASSIVE MOVE (or what other large co at the moment can consider a massive move) in dominance over tech in usually many skews of the (it) item and similar products. sorta like someone getting a new item in store and THINKING when thier buying it that THIS item is an easily accessible item, that provides more value to them than their actually needing, or know how to device from that item. I can say an example is the TomTom GPS, when that was released, no other consumer grade item that was easy to use, no overhead to a user after purchase, is durable and can be taken anywhere, and used in almost any scenario where you are mobile and want a GPS location based map device. Then think similar items, possibly Garmins, other items like boat GPS, and many different skews for these items, and having massive dominance over that item type for almost every skew in major co world wide, and for an long term dominance, is why their co is though of as a value even when thier stock is lower priced, or their just worth more than what the co is worth on paper, no one else does what the co arm does, well, no one does it as well, and w that much competence. Sry if my English is not perfect, trying to tell a story is hard when I am sure others have already said similar things here in the thread as I did.",
