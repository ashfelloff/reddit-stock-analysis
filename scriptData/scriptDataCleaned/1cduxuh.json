It is used on the highway only, and what it does is it keeps the car in the lane, and doesn't rear end the car in front. It's similar to what most car manufacturers offer. This is what the article refers to.\n\nAdvanced autopilot, the next tier up, used to cost $99 a month, and was also highway only. It was able to change lanes and take exits automatically. \n\nFull self driving (FSD) is able to drive on city streets, stop at stop lights, make turns, and navigate traffic.

There were little ads in the back of Popular Electronics (a publication of even greater interest to me) offering plans for a “voice typewriter”, and so it’s not much of a stretch.\n\nAlso still waiting for: how the car would know where you want to go.

Autopilot comes from planes where the plane follows the path, but it doesn't do literally everything and won't bring the plane to complete stops and land and all that (some planes DO have self landing capability though)  but still requires a real pilot, just like the car's autopilot.  Full self driving (unlike a car and planes autopilot) will ACTUALLY do all of that (full stops, unlike plane autopilot and car autopilot) and can even park itself.  Again, you don't actually care, you'll just downvote anyways since you don't care about facts and are just here to circlejerk.",

Kind of like how a plane's autopilot will follow the trajectory but is not the same as self landing and won't bring the plane to a stop.  Full self driving WILL do all that.  You can just put  in a gps location and the car will actually start, navigate, come to complete stops, can autopark...so it'll actually fully drive itself.\n\nBut note:  Both in a real plane and in a car, there has to be a real driver/pilot present.  It actually does make sense if you look past the circlejerks online.  Just think of autopilot like a smarter cruise control that can autosteer too.",

I only tried it because they gave a month free trial...I still don't think it's worth the price....but it's impressive for what it is...the fact you can actually use it anywhere  (other manufactures will often have things limited to mapped highways and whatnot).  You can even customize behavior for how 'chill' or 'assertive' it'll be (assertive will be more likely to pass people on a highway, where 'chill' is more likely to slow down and match their speed/the passing threshhold is lower'.",

And would lead to accidents without frequent intervention from the driver. Even on highways. I can just keep listing shit off lol. It cuts people off, abruptly breaks at 65-70mph on a highway when no one’s in front of it for seemingly no reason at all, I’ve seen it change lanes with no turn signal active, tries to make right turns on red when there’s a no right on red sign. \n\nIt requires significant supervision. To the point that you may as well just drive yourself with the free Tesla driver assist features. Have you tried it? Because saying it’s 100 times safer then the average driver is incredibly generous. At this time atleast until further improvements are made i wouldn’t consider it “safe” nor would I consider the FSD feature worth for the money.",

Interventions have been due to driving too slowly or cautiously (coming to full stops at stop signs) which is annoying for cars behind me. I’ve driven hundreds of miles on V12 now and I don’t think it did anything I’d consider dangerous. Maybe I have just gotten lucky, but I am also hearing from a lot of other people on V12 that they’re seeing a huge improvement.\n\nAlso, a lot of people don’t realize that highway driving is still using V11, I have had way, way more interventions there.",
