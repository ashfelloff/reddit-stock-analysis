Only time you can do anything market order sell or buy is in real time, any other trade would be a limit order like in your situation with your flight with no wifi, youd set a limit sell before you board the flight and if the price target hits that limit then it will sell for you, if not then it wont, or you could set up a stop loss but i wouldnt recommend doing that they like to do flash crashes to trigger stop losses",
