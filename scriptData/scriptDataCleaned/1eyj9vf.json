  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\n1. 3 days ago, China approved the construction of an additional 11 reactors, while they already approved an additional 10 reactors in 2022 and 10 reactors in 2023\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-20/china-approves-record-11-new-nuclear-power-reactors?leadSource=reddit\\_wall](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-20/china-approves-record-11-new-nuclear-power-reactors?leadSource=reddit_wall)\n\nAnd now you will say to me that reactors take 20 years to be build ;-)\n\nWell, in China not! China builds domestic reactors on time (in \\~6 years time) and close to budget.\n\n[Source: IAEA](https://preview.redd.it/iouvr7jzs7kd1.jpg?width=618&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=69f54310565e4df9caf35f44b449dfb555118ecc)\n\nHere is the overview of the 60 reactors currently under construction (\"start\" = Estimated year of grid connection) in the world: [https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/plans-for-new-reactors-worldwide)\n\nWhat does 60 reactors (of which 30 reactors under construction in China) mean?\n\nToday we have 439 reactors operating worldwide, 60 additional reactors under construction and more future reactor construction starts.\n\nSo 60 reactors under construction and more future reactor construction starts approved is a lot!\n\nSource: [https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme](https://world-nuclear.org/information-library/facts-and-figures/world-nuclear-power-reactors-and-uranium-requireme)\n\n**Only problem, there isn't enough global uranium production today and not enough well advanced uranium projects to sufficiently increase global uranium production in the future.**\n\nOn page 10 you get an idea of the global structural uranium supply deficit: [https://www.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://www.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)\n\n2) We are at the end of the annual low season in the uranium sector. Soon we will entre the high season again\n\nUranium spotprice is close to the long term price again, like in August 2023 (end of low season in 2023), which creates a strong bottom for the uranium price\n\nHere the uranium spot price and LT uranium price: [https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price](https://www.cameco.com/invest/markets/uranium-price)\n\n**Why a strong bottom for uranium price?**\n\nBecause it becomes very interesting to buy uranium in spotmarket to sell through existing LT contracts instead of doing all that effort to get more production ready asap.\n\nEach time spotprice nears or is under the long term price, much more buyers of uranium in spot will appear\n\nAnd we know that the global uranium sector is in a structural global deficit that can't be solved in 12 months time...\n\nI'm strongly bullish for the uranium price in upcoming high season\n\nThe uranium price increase in 2H 2023 was a preview of a more important upward pressure on the uranium price in 2H 2024\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the uranium inventory created in 2011-2017, that was used to solve the structural insufficient global uranium production since early 2018, is now mathematically depleted!\n\nNow that lack of uranium has to come from a lot of new uranium production capacity.\n\nGood luck with that!\n\n**Bonus for the investor:** During the low season the discount over NAV of physical uranium funds, like Yellow Cake (YCA) and Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN) become bigger, while in the uranium high season those discount become much smaller and even sometimes become premiums over NAV\n\nSprott Physical Uranium Trust (U.UN) share price today gives you a discount over NAV of 12%: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)\n\nNote 1: a post of mine 9 months ago: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17ub1kz/a\\_global\\_nuclear\\_renaisance\\_in\\_progress\\_while\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17ub1kz/a_global_nuclear_renaisance_in_progress_while_the/)\n\nNote 2: I post this now (end of low season in the uranium sector), and not 2,5 months later when we are well in the high season of the uranium sector.\n\nNote 3: I just learned that I can post pictures in comments, so I made a comment with a picture of 1 of my uranium positions\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

Even if taxes scale up, a global supply shortage could send uranium prices skyrocketing. \n\nCommercial nuclear power costs increase, driving up energy across the board and accelerating consumption of other forms of energy. Non-renewable energy supplies are consumed more quickly increasing energy costs even further. \n\nFrom this you get increased investments into other forms of energy production technology.",

So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from anuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nThat's 1 of the reasons why uranium demand is price INelastic\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\nCheers",

You can take a position in physical uranium funds, like Sprott Physical Uranium Trust\n\nHere you are not subjected to the mining related risks that uranium companies have.\n\n2) You can take a diversified position in the uranium sector through Uranium sector etf's, like Sprott Uranium sector (URNM)\n\n3) You can invest in individual uranium companies, to get an idea look at the holdings of Sprott Uranium Sector ETF : [https://sprottetfs.com/urnm-sprott-uranium-miners-etf/](https://sprottetfs.com/urnm-sprott-uranium-miners-etf/)\n\n**This isn't financial advice.

And right now we are at the end of the low season.\n\nDuring the low season the upward pressure on the uranium spot price weakens and the uranium spot price goes a bit down to be closer to the LT uranium price (That's the uranium spotprice decrease from 106 USD/lb in January 2024 to 80USD/lb today, while the LT uranium price continued to increase in that same period)\n\nIn the high season the upward pressure on the uranium spot price increases again and the uranium price goes back up faster than the month over month price increase of the  LT uranium price\n\nToday we are at the end of the low season in the uranium sector and the uranium spot price is now at the same level as the LT price. Here much more stakeholders (producers/utilities) will enter the spotmarket, especially starting early September to buy pounds that get under the LT uranium price => Creating the bottom for the uranium spotprice, waiting until others start to enter the uranium spotmarket (high season activity) to buy the last needed pound to complement the pounds they get through LT contracts\n\nAnd what is the difference between 2018-2023 and today?\n\nAnswer:\n\nInventory X, the global uranium supply saver since early 2018 is now mathematically depleted\n\nInventory X is what I explained in a 30 pp long report in August 2023\n\nThis isn't financial advice.

Well at first the those 2 funds will also go a bit lower, even though less hard than miners. But that will creat huge discounts over NAV.\n\nAnd due to the uranium shortage those huge discounts over NAV will be bought by investors, but I expect also by utilities short on uranium as a hedge to the much higher uranium prices they will have to buy in the uranium market and with final purpose to become the biggest shareholder of those physical uranium funds, meaning the physical uranium funds will recover much faster than the miners in a scenario of a broader market correction. \n\nNot saying that there will be a broader market correction in coming months, just taking that scenario into account in my diversification of my uranium exposure.\n\nSo investing in the physical uranium funds make me sleep much better, because I'm covered by the fundamentals of the uranium market.\n\n\n\n2) There is seasonality in the uranium sector due to different factors:\n\n(1) Uranium market is a very small markt with not so many participants (retail investors for instance can't buy uranium in the spotmarket for good reasons...).

There's just no demand for it to flood the market, so it's price controlled by governments to keep bad actors from obtaining it without raising flags. If anyone was serious about renewable energy, everyone would be advocating the building of nuclear power plants. As it stands, building nuclear power plants is a sign of economic decline. It's an easy economic stimulus with a guaranteed return on investment. If anything, it reduces the dependency on coal and natural gas, so it reduces the import influence of buying coal and NG exports. The price of crude would go up, as NG prices fell, because of global petroleum product dependency and the lack of income from the side collection of NG which would only be used by small countries that can't afford the front costs of nuclear energy. Producers of NG would gain influence from small countries until nuclear power supply lines are able to reach those countries. A country that chooses the nuclear path reduces their stake in NG/Coal, which lowers their imports, which limits shipping and, therefore, sea presence. China is a gigantic importer of coal/NG and already has a substantial sea presence. Going nuclear is simply the smart thing to do. If anything were to be affected by China's decision to ramp up nuclear power production, it would be Australia's NG exports and the global price of NG... but the short term would have no effect since manufacturing demand for NG/coal is globally on the rise, especially when constructing those power plants. I'd consider more short-term imports, like metals and other construction materials. But uranium? No. They'll over supply before unit commissioning if anything and simply match demand as units come online. There's no race for uranium... now, a war that targets ng/crude facilities when big governments are trying to \"build\"? Better keep an eye on your oil prices!",
