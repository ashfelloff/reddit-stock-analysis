  "selftext": "Hola fellow regards,\n\nToday I am going to dive into Money Market Funds, a topic that recently grasped my attention after a back and forth with one of our own, u/InterPeritura , compelled me to produce a write up of the current assumptions and overall misunderstandings involving this type of investment instrument as well as interest rates in general. Ultimately, this post is meant to elucidate why Money Market Fund Assets increasing during ATHs for equities is a harbinger of coming economic (both monetary and financial) distress.\n\nIf you already know what these are, please feel free to skip to \"**Times when money market fund assets increased while equities increased**\" section of this post.\n\n**What is A Money Market Fund?**\n\nTo begin, I want to talk about what a Money Market Fund is not. It is NOT a Money Market Account. The difference between the two is that a Money Market Account is insured by the FDIC up to $250K, offers rates that are typically higher than typical savings accounts, and is more accessible than funds kept in the MMF. \n\nMoney Market Funds in contrast buy short term debt-based securities, cash or cash equivalents such as CDs and BAs (bank acceptances), and commercial paper. They can also participate in the repo market which adds another level of complexity to their composition structure and overall risk profile. They are NOT FDIC insured so there is no guarantee of principal.\n\nA MMF is also NOT a Mutual Fund. A Mutual Fund is NOT restricted to regulatory determinations to hold a large amount of low-risk fixed instruments like government or municipal bonds. Mutual Funds can buy equities and corporate bonds, making them higher risk with higher reward. \n\nCitation: https://www.investopedia.com/money-market-account-vs-money-market-fund-whats-the-difference-7557816#:\\~:text=Money%20market%20accounts%20and%20money%20market%20funds%20are,in%20an%20MMF%20is%20insured%20by%20the%20SIPC.\n\n**Who invests in Money Market Funds?**\n\nAnyone can invest in the Money Market by directly buying the fund or indirectly through the securities that these funds buy which are primarily short term “liquid” assets with low risk of default. The typical MMF investor is likely buying into the fund in order to decrease risk in their portfolio during times of market uncertainty. However, many people overlook the glaring regulatory issues surrounding commercial paper being used as acceptable means of money market fund composition but that's a topic for another day.\n\nMMFs can buy commercial paper and other securities and use those as collateral for other borrowings in overseas and onshore monetary facilities. Individual investors cannot participate in buying Non asset backed commercial paper. (You shouldn't want to anyway). Meaning banks and high credit financial companies can use unsecured commercial paper in repo operations with MMF managers who themselves are typically part of a financial institution. (Not with the FED but in the private repo market between intermediary financial entities like offshore banks and financial corporations). \n\nCitation:[ Sec3(a)(3) of the Securities Act](https://www.mayerbrown.com/-/media/files/perspectives-events/events/2021/02/commercial-paper-programs.pdf);[ FED1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/cp/about.htm)\n\n**Times when money market fund assets increased with equities (Hint: it's the opposite of “outgoing procession”)** \n\nNow that the background information on what MMFs are and how they operate have been clarified somewhat, I will now present data showing why increases in money market participation alongside increasing equities is actually a sign of trouble to come. \n\n**Current contemporary retail misconceptions:** \n\n1. Interest rates falling make money market funds less attractive.\n2. Dropping interest rates makes money market fund participants switch to investing in equities. \n\nThe above two assumptions are the reasons why I made this post. This is because the above assumptions are wrong. They exist as a direct result of misinformation regarding why investors use these funds. The reason investors use money market funds, especially government and treasury type MMFs, is due to a desire for having cash in a liquid market where it will earn returns relatively risk free **in lieu of better investment opportunities elsewhere.**  \n\nNow ask yourself: “why would decreases in interest rates be linked to less participation in MMF and more money in equities?” The answer is....it doesn't. Interest rates in the short term (not long term), as we all already know, are influenced by FED policy. And by now we should know that the FED is primarily concerned with price stability and keeping unemployment low (how well they perform these duties is debatable). So, if central bankers are considering cutting rates, this means that current macroeconomic conditions are unfavorable for either one or both of the above-mentioned FED mandates. Poor economic future outlook is **NOT** a boon to equities, which should be obvious.\n\n Basically, MMFs exist as a facility for investors to use to park cash while they wait for better opportunities in the market. Their main pros are high liquidity and low risk. **Liquidity and risk management** are the reasons money market funds of this type are used.  We only need to look at 3 graphs to show us that money market funds increase in their attractiveness as economic conditions become more volatile and uncertain and only begin to decrease after the equities market bottoms out which will be used as our proxy for sentiment changes. \n\n**Exhibit A**: Dot Com Bust\n\nLeading up to the dot com bust, the fed funds rate started at 6.5 % in Q3 of 2000 and ended at 1.7% by Q3 of 2002 after the end of the recession. Picture 1 (blue line is 6.5% while red is 1.7%) \n\n[Picture 1 \\(blue circle is 6.5&#37; while red is 1.7&#37;\\) ](https://preview.redd.it/fd1ph6rxd75d1.jpg?width=1103&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be6419ef9cb5885c20f31b4fa69b408ce71b3091)\n\nDespite interest rates lowering, Money Market Fund Assets continued to increase and did not begin to decrease.... until the recession was over. At the same time the S&P 500 went from $2592 in Sept of 2000 all the way to $1412 by Sept 2002\n\n[Arrows are color coded to correspond with fed funds rate during the period discussed.](https://preview.redd.it/ivchfo22e75d1.jpg?width=1337&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a07ef62a650b68855ccde845e2ca09fd9f7ae50)\n\n[Arrows are color coded to correspond with fed funds rate during the period discussed.](https://preview.redd.it/sws1rfp7e75d1.jpg?width=975&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b16635b27febf6f9534572a49d2af71570fbde20)\n\n**Exhibit B**: Global ~~Financial~~ Monetary Crisis\n\nThe date is September 6th, 2004. The federal funds rate is sitting at 1.48% (green circle). Three years later, on September 10th, 2007, the fed funds rate was 5.25% (orange circle)\n\n  \n\n\n[pic#4](https://preview.redd.it/8y6w0bgfe75d1.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ca2b3825b8da0c50996b315fea314b680c920392)\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this time, money market funds did, in fact, increase in net assets (See pic #5). However, in 2008 when the GFC was well underway, Bernanke slashed rates all the way to 0.15% by Sep 7th, 2009 (purple circle). Yet, despite the lower yield on money market funds during this time, net assets increased until they peaked in Q4 of 2008 and remained relatively level until Q2 of 2009 (See purple line in pic #5). \n\n[#5: MMF assets INCREASED while rates were lowering in the recession \\(shaded region\\)](https://preview.redd.it/26sc49rke75d1.jpg?width=1154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d611f3850c5e0074b635e3423e8fb5f9b0aa324b)\n\nThis decrease in Money market fund net assets coincided with the bottom in equities that same year. Money remained “sidelined” until macroeconomic confidence was restored. (See pic #6). \n\n[#6 Purple line in pic 5 and this pic show that sentiment change in the equities market corresponded with decreasing MMF utilization](https://preview.redd.it/sixt0kyne75d1.jpg?width=899&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=180e81645801d2846c1d2d006062ec023e2cd42f)\n\nAre we seeing the pattern here? Money Market Fund utilization is not tied to interest rates. They are **tied to macroeconomic conditions and sentiment.** MMFs are increasingly used when macroeconomic sentiment and outlook begins to increase in uncertainty and typically reach highest net asset values when sentiment around equities change. They are NOT tied to interest rates.\n\n**Exhibit C**: Covid Lockdown Recession\n\nMany people forget that, prior to COVID, macroeconomic sentiment was leaning toward a weakening economy and a looming, but slightly obfuscated, recession. Again, same pattern with economic uncertainty increasing and Money Market Fund net asset values increasing while equities rise. \n\nIn response to anticipated macro weaknesses, Powell began to cut rates halfway through the Q3 of 2019 starting from 2.41% in July of 2019 all the way to 1.55% by November of 2019(See picture #7). \n\n  \n\n\n[Pic #7. Red dot is 0&#37; interest rates in March](https://preview.redd.it/bipydjlnf75d1.jpg?width=895&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d705a939570ba5c1419823a147b228e4ef3e4f4)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, during the last half of 2019, MMF increased in net assets despite the decreasing interest rates(See picture # 8). \n\n[Pic #8 :Increasing MMF utilization alongside decreasing interest rates](https://preview.redd.it/hmeyhhdvf75d1.jpg?width=1355&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=346b8c15a40e6a48a09e3c421c5fedeb99442a2a)\n\nAll of this occurring while equities reached ATHs in December and would tread water until Covid in late february/early march caused mass selloffs (See picture #9).\n\n[pic #9: Between black and green lines, S&p increased while MMF asset increased \\(See pic#8\\)](https://preview.redd.it/gv1obvm1g75d1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a5eaaa7978461ddbc8a01d8b4ca20b7caab9b53)\n\nThe unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus policies and packages make this data series harder to interpret. However, we can infer that the V-shaped recovery in equities following the intervention from the FED that wiped out many veterans in this sub was indicative of a sentiment shift. Again, MMF net assets corroborate this relationship with sentiment being the deciding factor as net assets began to decrease and level off until late 2022 and early 2023 when they began rising again...the same year everyone was expecting a recession to occur. \n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, if there was a causal and directly proportional relationship between interest rate levels and MMF net assets, there would not be so many instances of money market funds being over utilized during periods of interest rate cuts. MMFs are primarily utilized by private investors, institutions, and companies to manage risk while keeping capital in highly liquid assets in uncertain market climates. NOT for the enticing interest rate. \n\n**TLDR?**: There is no observable correlation with money market fund asset increases corresponding with rises in equities later. This means cash in those instruments are not used later on in equity markets but primarily to keep current cash liquid and earning interest to a relatively safe degree. Powell cutting interest rates is a sign that a recession is already underway and will be a time when market sentiment will be at their lowest and most uncertain, MMFs will actually be increasing in net assets while equities fall.\n\n**Positions?** I am currently building a QQQ short position in LEAPs with strike prices in the mid 300s. Will update once it is above $10k\n\nThoughts?",

Not only have most of the companies in this composite blown past their expected future earnings, they did so while economic and geoploitical uncertainty has never been higher. People have been expecting a recession since 2023...and we have one. Just hasnt hit Ameica yet.\n\nLook at the news. Do you think Australia's central bank cut rates for shits and giggles? Same thing with the ECB. Its because Europe as well as the rest of the world has been in a recession since basically the beginning of 2023. We are feeling it here too. That latest jobs report? Go look at full time increases vs part time increases and youll see why the jobs market is not actually as strong as it has been advertised. \n\n The only difference is that it has been blunted by perception of the equities market as a picture of the overall ecnonomy (news flash: its not) and the AI boom has lead most indicies higher due to the mega cap tech corporations in the space. But they ALL cant capture that future value and some of their valuations have to give.  And they will, all at once. \n\nAmazon was poised to take over retailers through ecommerce that would later take off, but their share price tanked during the dot com bust. Same thing with microsoft despite their industry leading software at the time.  I can see the same happening with NVDA and the tech stocks in the AI space.\n\nEdited for spelling",

                  "body": "People give the FED too much credit. Their power is 98% Market Psychology and 2% Policy. \n\nCurrent contemporary economic theory states that Interest rates being lower are monetary attempts at stimulating the economy by incentivising banks to lend. The erroneous assumption is banks lend when interst rates are low. \n\nThe truth is lowering interst rates simply makes borrowing more enticing (increases demand) which makes lending more profitable (due to lower supply). The balancing act between banks competing for new demand for debt products like business loans should increase lending and afford companies in need of funding to stay afloat or even invest during times of economic turbulence. Hence, the idea that lower interest rates aid in stimulating the economy during downturns\n\nBut banks also evaluate aspects like credit worthiness AND economic conditions in the macro sense and in the more specific industry sense. This means that banks also consider economic conditions and if they are bad they wont lend.\n\nLowering interest rates is a response to worsening economic outlook. A worsening economic outlook makes banks less likely to lend in the first place. This is why economic policy is two fold: Fiscal(US Treasury, Congress, stimulus checks, Presidential Acts like the Inflation Reduction Act) and Monetary (FED). \n\nBut fiscal stimulus during election years and governmental power shifts take longer to implement.\n\nBanks lend most when sentiment is high and lend lest when sentiment is low. Thats why the FED strategy is 98% Market Pyschology. By the time the Fed starts lowering, the damge to the economy is already done.  Lower interest rates, in theory, makes an economic recovery easier and faster. But there is a lag. This lag is where the most money is made and lost.",

But If we’re talking following the trend and looking for the start of an actual bear market, for technical analysis signals I’d say the 10 month/200sma is what can often be a signal for the SPY or QQQ.  Especially if the previous all time high had a lower RSI than the one just before that.  But even then it’s no guarantee. I’m just some guy on the internet. Like in reality I don’t know shit and no one else does no matter how much technical analysis and research they’ve done.  Look at Michael Burry,  he’s smart and knows a ton and how often is he getting clowned for being completely wrong and he’s the fucking BIG SHORT GUY.  They made a movie about his short play and he’s wrong all the time.  anyone confidently calling the top or guaranteeing a QQQ short will work out at this exact moment because INSERT REASONS is suffering from a bad case of the dunning Kruger effect.  I like the 200sma as a signal for a bear market but then again the 200 was broken by qqq back in October but quickly recovered. Safest signal would be breaking the 200 then failing to sustain a recover back over it for more than a few days.  But I only use those signals personally to know when to rotate to a bigger cash position in a tax advantaged account not to try to find a good spot to\nShort the market.",

QQQ short makes sense because most of the largest market cap components represent concentrated / crowded trades, which should reverse and be a source of funds as various holders reevaluate their portfolio strategy during and after a drawdown, e.g. whether we're entering a persistent inflationary regime due to trends toward deglobalization, demographic / aging / replacement level issues, and Left & Right populism.\n\nSome flies in the ointment include liquidity watchers like Michael Howell that believe this is a fairly standard expansionary cycle for global liquidity, and he foresees a peak in late 2025, perhaps even into 2026. Another fly is the expectation that budget deficits aren't coming down no matter who holds the WH / Congress. Good for nominal GDP, if not also a stimulus for ongoing wage / price inflation. Another is how growth in the structured yield & dispersion trades respectively have put a lid on index volatility. Look into Cem Karsan for more on this topic. \n\nI'm thinking of building a small short position for the election window using year out LEAPS (6/20/25) on SPY. You can get put insurance ATM for about 4.5% of SPY's value, which is a pretty good price. QQQ for 5.7%.",
