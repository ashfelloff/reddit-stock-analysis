They integrate new components a hell of a lot quicker then dell,  into there custom designed and fully modulair systems. SMCI has its main facilities in silicon valley next door from NVDA, INTC, META etc. and they are granted early access to prototype boards which they uses to get products out day 1 of launch.",

So i take back my statements about them lacking a moat.\n\nSMCI however is a good company, they design custom server housing (racks), power supply units, motherboard, PCBs etc. They work really close with the big tech companies to prototype and directly integrate there feedback into the design process, meaning SCMI is fast and create products the customer actually wants. They are also not as new to this as people assume form the stock, the founder started his company in the same year Nvidia did, and they personally know each other.\n\nhere is just a random example on real world innovation from super mirco computer.
