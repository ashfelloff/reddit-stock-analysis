      "body": "Okay hear me out, I was in your position In August 2023, it is imperative that you play your next couple of moves carefully. Do not try to make any more home runs with this earnings season . If you do, greed is gonna step in and you're gonna end up losing more than what you started with. Small gains for the next couple months until this victory sinks in, otherwise you're gonna end up questioning your life decisions in the next couple of weeks/months. \n\nEither way... Good job!! on your play today!!! Take some of that money out and get yourself something you've always wanted, (something inexpensive ofc)",
