If the answer to 1) is no, then you don’t even need to move on to 2: you should sell and move the money to something else (treasury, cd, VOO, VT …). If the answer to 1) is yes, then onto question 2.\n\nNo matter what stock you buy, there is risk in having all your eggs in one basket. That’s why people diversify by buying index funds. These index funds already hold quite high percentages of NVDA, AAPL, and GOOG. So, if NVDA has ballooned to be 50% of your account, then it would be the wise move to sell down to a much smaller level. What is a good level? Depends on your conviction in NVDA, how far you are from retirement, and how ok you would be if it lost a lot of value. Personally, I would recommend based on the information you provided, sell down so that NVDA is less than 5% if your portfolio, and buy VOO with the proceeds. If you wanted to sell all of it, that would be fine too.",
