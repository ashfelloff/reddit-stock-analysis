  "selftext": "1. SMCI and AMD‚Äôs failure to perform will continue to bring the semiconductor market down tomorrow. The only reason why the burn was offset was due to Papa Powell giving the bulls a nice massage in the form of market calming. Every single serious question he was asked he deflected with ‚Äúwe gotta wait for the data‚Äù. The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward \n\n2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward \n\n3. Aside from Apple earnings there are no more positive events coming up that can justify the hype carrying the stock\n\n4. I bought calls\n\nBless up peeps üê• \n\n",

VRT is a great company and also a great partner in this exact same space so diversify that holding. Next, ASML guided upward the exact same way. More to come towards the back half of the year. Buy the dip. The reason for this is that their business model is completely different and cyclical to Nvidia's. 1 is pre-sale nvidia and 2 the other is post sale installation to nvidia. To put it in perspective, Jensen just delivered the 1st H200 to OpenAI. That took me by surprise. The 1st? I thought they had a million of those things out by now.\n2. Supply chain constraints are the lifeblood of Nvidia's business. This is simply supply and demand microeconomics. While it may hurt an SMCI it does nothing but drive Nvidia's prices up. Also, this has a smoothing effect that I think will play out with Nvidia just posting strong earnings because it's not even fathomable how many chips are needed and what is even actually out there.\n3. Everyone that is directly relating to Nvidia is actually posting good news that nobody is paying attention to. Samsung just had record earnings from selling phones and HBM memory. TSM reported strong demand for AI chips over their other chips that have nothing to do with Nvidia. Qualcomm just posted AH good earnings. Meta, AWS, Tesla, and Microsoft all reported increased CapEx spend to just purchase and do more and more AI. Meta got hammered for spending too much on AI lol. It's crazy.\n4. Bonus. Nobody caught this zinger on the Microsoft call and this directly relates to Nvidia. The throughput you can obtain from Microsoft is being crushed downwards because they don't have \"enough\" capacity. They posted a +7% AI spend for their Azure revenues. An analyst asked Microsoft why wasn't it higher (effectively) and the response was because they just don't have the capacity to meet the demand. I can verify 1st hand this is true. They even went further to say that for Copilot they have dedicated capacity so that the demand doesn't affect Copilot usage.\n5. I think Apple is a sleeper here. What better time, unless they drop after earnings, to buy Apple. If there is a time to get in it's now. The Rabbit and Pin are stupid and people will do all of those things on the IPhone and Galaxy phones. No need for another device. It's coming. QCOM Just reported strong growth on strong demand for the newest and latest AI phones. How will that AI work? From GPT on the Iphone.\n\nYour calls may be fucked",
