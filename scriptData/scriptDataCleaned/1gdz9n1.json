  "selftext": "Volkswagen is considering widespread pay cuts and layoffs as well as the closure or size reduction of its plants in Germany, the company’s works council said Monday.\n\nThe Volkswagen management recently presented plans to the council that include a 10% reduction in pay across the board, as well as wage freezes in 2025 and 2026, according to Daniela Cavallo, head of the works council. All factored in, the body estimates workers will suffer pay cuts of around 18% over the period.\n\nVolkswagen also intends to shut three factories and downsize all other plants in Germany, Cavallo said, adding that sweeping job cuts were part of carmaker’s plan.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/volkswagen-planning-forced-layoffs-and-10percent-pay-cuts-labor-union-say.html",

China's car industry is prob the most fair in the car industry when compared to its peers. \n\nIf your going to complain about the production side, due to the \"late comer advantage\" Chinese Car makers likely started with the latest production line design/machines, while older brands have older production line tech which cost $$$$$ to upgrade then have to nuke the factory workers due to reduced human input like it is happening with VW with op's post. \nThis isnt a replace a single machine type of upgrade, but an entire plant of upgrade. Granted any company would wary to upgrade/create a new plant for \"minor\" upgrades which I dont blame them. I think most car companies are doing it for EV while keeping their older lines for non EV. \n\nYour saying \"zero regard for human saftey\" like a slogan but have zero idea of how things work in production lines. You also cannot do slave labor and lack of human safety in car making being it fucks the entire production line. A single accident stops every item behind it, working shit hours will cause mistakes, having untrained labor will cause mistakes, etc hell just cleaning up the accident is like at least an hours of delay. JiT production lines (which is what most car companies run on thanks to Japan) REQUIRES to have human safety as its priority.",
