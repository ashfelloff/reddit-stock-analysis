It was understood that it would try, but it was tried in just 4 days of growth on very high trading volumes - 1.5 times higher than usual. \n\nUsually high turnovers occur during quarterly expiration conditions (September and March this year) or during a major collapse (August 5-6, 2024), but even more rarely ... when a local high is forming. \n\nThe last time there was comparable volume on an isthay breakout was in December 2021 when a high was formed, then the market fell about 25% for a year. \n\nThe market rose 5.55% from Monday’s low to Friday’s high. The last time it happened was on 27.12.2021 (5.75%) at the moment of maximum formation. Another indicative breakout was 03.24.2000 (7.21%) and then the market formed the peak of the dotcom bubble, the high was updated only at the end of 2007 and consolidated 6 years later (more than 13 years of recovery attempts).\n\nDuring the week 3 trillion of capitalization or +5.2% of market growth was created by 614 companies with 48.3 trillion of total capitalization. \n\n●The top 100 companies contributed 2.2 trillion in gains with a combined capitalization of 34.8 trillion.\n\n●The top 50 companies contributed 1.87 trillion in incremental capitalization to the entire market with a total capitalization of 28.8 trillion. \n\nThe top 5 companies contributed 837 bln: Nvidia - 317 bln, Tesla - 222 bln, Google - 101 bln, Microsoft - 100 bln, Amazon - 96.5 bln.\n\nOver 1,000 companies (a quarter of all US public companies) showed a combined decline of 252bn, with a capitalization of 7.7 trillion, or about 12.5% of the entire market by capitalization. The leaders of the decline by scale were: Johnson & Johnson - 12.3 bln, Philip Morris and Pfizer - 10 bln, AbbVie - 8.6 bln.\n\nThe major contributors to the market growth pattern were:\n\n- Technology: 1.37 trillion or +6.4%, contributing 46% of the total market growth or 2.4 p.p. to the overall growth of 5.2%\n\n- Finance: 438bn or +6.2%, contributing 14.7% or 0.76pc.\n\n- Business & Industry: 363 bln or +5.5%, contributing 0.63 p.p.\n\n- Consumer Staples: 326 bln or +5.7%, contributing 0.56 p.p., but Tesla alone contributed 222 bln, and non-durable consumer goods were down 0.3% or minus 8 bln.\n\n- Commerce: 234bn or +4.4% contribution was 0.41pc, where Amazon contributed almost 100bn. \n\n- Healthcare: 122bn or +2%, contribution was 0.21p, biotech and pharma were mostly down.\n\n- Commodities & Utilities: 69bn or +1.9%, 0.12pc contribution, where utilities declined and growth was generated by oil & gas and metals.\n\n- Transportation & Communications: 55 bln or +3.3%, 0.09 p.p. contribution.\n\nThe breakout of the isthmus with record momentum at very high rates and the market rising broadly is a reversal pattern, just as it was in the bubble of 2021, 2000 and 1929.",
