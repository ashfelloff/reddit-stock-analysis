Watch as it opens on Tuesday, and the Chinese people go berserk to buy the stocks and the fomo kicks in. \n\nThis thing is ready to take off!!!🚀🚀🚀\n\nOf course it's an artificial pump, but never ever fight any government hell bent on injecting a trillion dollars as a stimulus. We all saw what happened here when The Fed decided to pump the market after the covid.\n\n\nFor me this is not a long term investment. Like all the pumps before, this will eventually end. I'm here for the ride while it lasts. \n\n\nMy Positions: 10/18 calls \n\nDADA\n\nNIO\n\nLexinn Fintech_\n\nand various other Chinese Stocks. \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nDisclaimer For The (fellow) Degenerates:\n\n\nTHIS IS A GAMBLE AND IT CAN GO BELOW ZERO SUPER QUICK",

I see some post from Chinese forum that people are moving money out and open account, and it likely to see a pump again on Monday. Also, the stimulus are not fully injected yet, people are trading with emotion to get this high. Also, a lot of people are speculating as well, but the history usually is speculating people would eventually jump on game, and this happens before. So I would say this party would last for a month least, but this is not a investment advice.",

                                  "body": "I bought 2 calls in Chau because mainland stock would directly reflects on it, China has max limitations 10 percent on CSI stock soars per day, so I personally would expect 15 percent soars in first a few days, and correction would likely happen after that, but bull trend probably will kept. Also, today has a news update, a few hours ago,  state government announced they will introduce detail on stimulus policy on next Tuesday 10am which is 10pm in ESt, and Shanghai exchange extend the time period of placing pre order from 9:15 -9:25am to 9:15- 9:30am. Base on social media observation, I think a lot of people are still questioning if this is a real bull market, but also a lot of people are worrying if they can successfully buy their stock on Tuesday due to the mass. I would say betting on next week would be a thinking on  whether you think Chinese government would disappoint everyone after so many news. I know the anything but china and Chinese government stereotypes in here, but believe it or not it’s your call, at least for next week. Again, this is not investment advice, I hope this is helpful",
