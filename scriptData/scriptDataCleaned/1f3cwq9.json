That's 4:1 leverage, so **this $1.4M account has exposure to about $5.6M in assets.**\n\nOften I get asked \"So when will you delever and stop?\". And I really don't know. It makes so much money that it's hard to want to stop.\n\nWhen I [started](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/).
