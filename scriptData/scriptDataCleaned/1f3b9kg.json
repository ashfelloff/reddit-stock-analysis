  "title": "S&P 500 Additions Sept. 6 ",
  "score": 191,
  "selftext": "The S&P is rebalanced four times a year. Two weeks before the rebalancing, they announce which companies will be added and removed from the index. The next rebalancing occurs on Sept. 20, which means they will announce the additions and deletions to the index on Sept. 6 after the market close.\n\nS&P rebalancing is one of my favorite trades because it has asymmetric risk-reward. If the stock is added to the index, it usually goes up 5-10%. If it isn't added, it usually only goes down 1-3%. I've made a small fortune in the past with this technique by successfully predicting the additions of Palo Alto, Blackstone, and Crowdstrike.\n\nThe S&P 500 selection committee does have some requirements for a stock to join the index. Generally speaking, the company needs to be profitable for four quarters and have a minimum market cap of 18 billion. The full list of requirements is here on pages 7-12 of the PDF file. [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf)\n\nHere is list of potential candidates based on market cap: \n\nNOTE: Some of these are not profitable and therefore ineligible for S&P500 inclusion. This is not a comprehensive list, there are dozens of potential companies. Do your own DD.  \n\nApollo Global\n\nPalantir\n\nWorkday\n\nDoordash\n\nAres\n\nDatadog\n\nApplovin\n\nSnowflake (unlikely because of stock volatility)\n\nCheniere\n\nTradedesk\n\nSquare/Block\n\nDell (maybe a float issue? Otherwise, I am unsure why it hasn't been added yet)\n\nVeeva\n\nPINS\n\nVertiv\n\nHubpot\n\nCarlisle\n\nCloudflare\n\n\n\nHere are a list of companies that are ineligible companies to save you some time:\n\nRoblox (negative EPS)\n\nAtlassian (neg trailing EPS)\n\nCoinbase (neg trailing EPS)\n\nArm (ADR)\n\nCRH (Not eligible until next rebalancing)\n\nMy theory: The last few additions to the S&P 500 have been a humiliation for S&P. Crowdstrike had a massive outage and SMCI is being exposed as a fraud. They will probably pick a safer company this time. SMCI might be removed from the index at this point because this is the second time they've had accounting irregularities. \n\nWhat are your favorite stocks for inclusion on Sept 6th? They usually add and remove 2-5 companies every quarter. The number can be higher or lower because of M&A, bankruptcies, etc. \n\nIf you want to know if a stock is already in the index, you can type the name in the filter section on this site.
