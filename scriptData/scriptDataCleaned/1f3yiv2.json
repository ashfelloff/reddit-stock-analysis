With futures,  it's going to be the same instrument (or few) over and over, so it's easier to focus more on the price action. Futures are also traded 23 hours a day Sunday-Friday, so you can practice with lower volatility sessions at night. I also spent a lot of time soul searching and overcoming emotions and psychology- Mark Douglas, Tom Hougaard, Nick Radge, DayTraderNextDoor, etc. Plus I just freaking hate working for anyone else and committed myself to being successful.",
