They only opened 3 of the 28 terminals they bought, and they aren’t going to increase profits until mid late 2025. They took on yrcs unprofitable contracts to prop up revenue. If SAIA and Odfl missed, Xpo is guaranteed to miss with the cash burn, depreciation, and amortization payments, it’s a 10% drop after earnings maybe more. While Odfl and SAIA had 15-22% drops Xpo has already taken hits from the 52w high because they were falsely propped up from the yrc acquisitions. I may not know the auto industry, or tech industry, but I know trucking. All my major wins have been from trucking plays, I lose when I jump into shit I don’t understand bc I like to gamble. 105 17 may 24 puts guaranteed to print, high likelihood of 100 17 may 24 puts printing.
