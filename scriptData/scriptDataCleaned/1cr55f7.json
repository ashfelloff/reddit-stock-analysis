  "title": "ATB analyst: MSOS holdings trading at deep discount after strong Q1 ",
  "score": 20,
  "selftext": "\nConsider Multi-State Operators (MSOs) like Trulieve, Curaleaf, Green Thumb Industries, and Verano. Despite positive Q1/24 results, the sector remains undervalued, trading at an average 2024e EV/EBITDA of 8.8x compared to an analyst's base-case sector valuation of 11.8x.\n\nAccording to an ATB analyst, as most companies have reached positive Free Cash Flow (FF) generation, investors could start valuing the sector based on FF multiples or yields, offering significant upside potential. Additionally, with US cannabis poised for exponential growth upon re-scheduling, MSOs are trading at an attractive average 5.2% 2024e FCF yield.\n\nHowever, a significant $1 billion short interest across the sector is preventing the true value from being realized. This short interest presents an opportunity for investors who recognize the long-term potential of the industry. \n\nNotably, call option activity has been spiking for weekly and monthly May 17th/May 24th strikes, indicating increasing interest and potential volatility in the near term.\n\n",

Seems like a big headache with DOT and states, not well versed on if this helps with cash flow b/c of what already exists.\n\nLegal states can already accept debit/credit cards (mine anyway) none of these companies are selling product in my dispo’s. Privately owned money makers. State determined how many and “lottery” system. They sell eachother’s products and keep the prices high. Bank in Oklahoma will allow you to bank with them/loans already lol. Population 35k city with 70+dispos and equivalent grow ops.\n\nTHCA kinda weird even though it converts to THC when lit (can legally order online in most states b/c of 2018 Farm Bill. THCA = good to go, THC > like .xx something perfect = illegal. No high from eating THCA unless baked. \n\nFuck this whack shit, it’s seed/grow time and/or back to the black market. People will see",
