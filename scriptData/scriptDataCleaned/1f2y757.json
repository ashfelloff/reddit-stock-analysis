  "selftext": "Hello guys,\n\n  \nI just had this thought and wanted to get some feedback before I act on this tomorrow.\n\nTLDR: January NVDA ITM calls cant go wrong. Likely they're gonna hit the earnings out of the park so I can just cash out, and if not, the price will bounce back anyways to be ITM again by January.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sbnd6lv16bld1.png?width=970&format=png&auto=webp&s=325938097df0e0690ca25050497ccddcd04c15d5\n\n  \nNVDA is trading right now around $128. How bad could it go after earnings? Normally a miss for them is just the market moving sideways, not up. But even if they do miss earnings badly and the stock drops, itll just come back up over the next few months right? Hyperscale AI market isnt going ANYWHERE. \n\nBest case, NVDA kills earnings and I make hella money the next day at open.\n\n  \nWhy dont I just buy a shit ton of ITM calls tomorrow that expire in January and profit?",

That won't be BECAUSE Nvidia has a bad quarter, but we could see some of the warning signs on their quarterly report. A more likely outcome is Nvidia warns that customers are losing interest in their chips and people start re-evaluating every stock that hyped AI across the market, causing a correction (a drop of more than 10%).\n\nIf Nvidia beats expectations, it means the firehose of corporate spending is continuing and will keep supporting the economy as a whole, which means stocks can keep rallying.",
