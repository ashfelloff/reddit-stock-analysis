  "selftext": "The stock heat-map will look like a freshly mown lawn by the end of the day tomorrow. These stocks are primed to roll on good news on Powell‚Äôs end. Powell cannot allow the economy to slip under the conclusion of Joe Biden‚Äôs tenure. It is undeniable that the thought of ruining this election for the Democratic Party with a hawkish speech tomorrow has crossed J POW‚Äôs mind and is slim to none. If the economy crashes, there is no chance Kamala gets elected. The public will shift their gaze to a more authoritative business person, Donald Trump. \n\nIt is my humble belief that J pow will bless us with a calm, confident, and data-focused .25 base point rate cut. \n\nLast week, when they cut rates in Europe, we saw a massive uptick during the latter part of week. \n\nThese are my positions - mainly stocks that I like, but also some lottery tickets in there in case they takeoff huge. \n\ngood luck to all participating tomorrow\n\n",
