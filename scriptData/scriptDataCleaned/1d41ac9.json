[https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robot-every-person](https://www.uipath.com/rpa/robot-every-person)\n\nThis massively inflated the predicted/planned revenue growth but this was of course an impossible pipe dream.\n\nBasically the attended deployment method doesnt work or scale and the licensing of such deals is very expensive and not popular.\n\nNow Microsoft power automate does basically everything Uipath does for almost free (included in E3 enterprise licenses) and any innovation over the last 3 years is just AI window dressing (which MSFT will do eventually).\n\npeople left holding the bag are F'd and i personally predict this company will go bust as MSFT continues to develop their Power Automate offering.",

I think UiPath is grossly overvalued and this value is based on the \"A Robot for Every Person\" and the \"Citizen Developer\" ideas...both of which, after working with them for 5+ years I realize are just not viable. \n\nIt is not a technical issue, but a business case issue. The business benefit is not clear, the costs are very high and it is difficult to scale. On top of that, with Power Automate, Microsoft, in my opinion, has already won the desktop-side self-service automation battle. \n\nOn the back-end, a lot of companies will reach a saturation point of high-value use cases where they can use RPA and will no longer increase their spend with UiPath. Nascent AI-companies will start encroaching on more complex use cases and RPA adoption may suffer.",
