I sell various spreads throughout the week at different levels. The spreads on Robinhood for example are easy to see and only grouped if they're the same exact long/short positions. Fidelity on the other hand will randomly assign them into \"strategies\" like taking random long and random short positions and group them into iron condors or butterflies, or whatever.\n\nWhen I try to close them out, and timing is sometimes important, it's impossible to remove the legs that don't belong.",
