  "score": 80,
  "selftext": "I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:\n\n# Continuing to Cut Costs\n\nAmazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.\n\n# AI Strategy\n\nAmazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.\n\n# Prime Day\n\nPrime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.\n\n# NBA Rights\n\nAmazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.\n\n# Investors Over Employees\n\nAndy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.\n\n# Summary / tl;dr\n\nI'm a highly regarded individual and don't have numbers to back my thoughts up, but I know Amazon well. Earnings will show big profits and strong outlook. ~~I don't have any position yet but will update tomorrow, just planned this over the weekend. Hoping the stock falls a bit Monday, but regardless planning to buy some ITM 5/3 calls with a breakeven price around $183-185.~~\n\n\\[Edit\\] see comments for my position, 5/3 call $177.50 3 contracts bought at 8.90/c.",
