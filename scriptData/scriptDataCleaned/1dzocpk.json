However around 28nm the underlaying transistor technology transitioned from MOSFET to FinFET. Although FinFETs are not physically smaller they deliver density, power, and performance improvements that were inline with continued shrinkage in gate length of MOSFET. So TSMC 16nm node was not really using transistors with gate length of 16nm but they provide equivalent performance. It‚Äôs marketing term  sure but it‚Äôs also a way to help customers understand what to expect. It‚Äôs kind of like switching to combustion engines but still using horse power as measurement to help people understand how much power roughly they‚Äôre paying for.",
