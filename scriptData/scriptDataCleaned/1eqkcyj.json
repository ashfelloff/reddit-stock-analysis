The thing that \" is evident in the long-term charts of UVXY and VXX. These funds have a nasty tendency of absorbing negative roll yield for most of their existence. Because both UVXY and VXX purchase short-term VIX futures, they have to sell the front month futures and buy the back month futures. They must do this regularly. However, the term structure of these futures is usually in contango, which means the front month is cheaper than the back month. The fund pays out this difference to the market in exchange for the convexity offered by the VIX futures in the event of a market selloff. The negative roll yield is effectively an insurance premium paid for protection from a market crash. There is no free lunch.\n\n\"The UVXY, and UVIX plus a few other etfs are known as widow makers. They always reverse split.\n\nSVIX and / or SVXY are the safest bullish bets in the market at present .\n\nThese short the rise we saw in the recent VIX spike.\n\nOur stock market fundamentals are strong, with 79% of reporting companies beating earnings solidly.\n\nThe recent volatility , imo, was a reset of multiples or a \" correction \" that offered up some very good dips on high quality stocks.NVDA hit 90 and that was some 17 points ago.\n\nThere are many other examples one could cite.\n\nGuidance for our S& P companies are solid and the thing most are overlooking is that the growth and guidance suggest forward pe ratios that are still reflective of investment grade criteria",

The odte power to influence stock prices and the dark pool profiting off violent swings is very lucrative for the hedge funds . A few other factors but when the VIX spikes and the market corrects, the bulls and bears are like two boxers in the 5th round of a 12 round match and both are strong with something to prove. I don't think we can say all is clear and i put odds of violent swings at very elevated right now...\n\nWe have conflicted media and no real agreement on valuations and absolutely no sec oversight or else the VIX would not have spiked to 65 in a healthy market\n\nThe algos will dump trillions in market cap in hours\n\n  \nthe vix could spike right back to 29 for all we know at the moment",
