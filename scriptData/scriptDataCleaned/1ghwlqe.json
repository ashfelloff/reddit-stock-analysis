Actual financial planners (like for retirement planning) advise this for individuals also. The difference being that individuals has slightly better options since they are dealing with smaller amounts of money and can take advantage of different accounts with different tax treatments. \n\nThis is why that it is advised for individuals to invest in BOTH a Roth account and a Traditional account, and then a Brokerage account if you have money left over (most won't). \n\nThis is because a Roth account effectively locks in your current tax rate forever. If you are paying 20% taxes, but a tax increase increases your taxes to 25%, you have locked in that 20%.\n\nA Traditional account does the opposite. If you put money into a traditional at 20% and taxes in your specific circumstances goes down (say through new tax credits for retirees) to 15%, then you get that 5% discount on your taxes when you withdraw. \n\nThis is tax diversification and is super important in retirement planning. It shields you from potential tax increases by having Roth investments, while allowing you to take advantage of future tax discount opportunities using a Traditional account.",

Actual financial planners (like for retirement planning) advise this for individuals also. The difference being that individuals has slightly better options since they are dealing with smaller amounts of money and can take advantage of different accounts with different tax treatments.\n\nBuffett can't exactly do what normal investors do and we can't exactly do what BRK does either. \n\nNo one on WSB or even most elite investors could [just call up the CEO of BofA and broker a \"special deal\" for preferred shares with a guaranteed yield along with a guaranteed minimum exit price](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-invested-5-billion-bank-of-america-made-fortune-2020-10-1029690339). WB also brokered special deals with other companies like GS before. Same shit with brokering certain investment deals in Japan/China. Also he's taken over many smaller companies. \n\nOn the flipside, BRK has to meet certain requirements as they are not only a publicly listed company but also get their funds from GEICO. So leveraging up massively or yolo into 0DTEs isn't ever an option. BRK also has to file quarterly 13Fs and sometimes Buffett will trim stocks under the 10% just so as to avoid needing to do insider reporting. Some folks thought he fucked up hard in 2020 by not only NOT buying the Covid dip but also dumping out of his airlines. Reality is likely that he dumped out because those airlines needed huge cash bailouts/injections but the government might be less willing, unwilling, or willing but giving less if BRK/Buffett was holding a large share. It's not just the public optics of bailing out a billionaire but also the government might just say \"Ask your investors like BRK/Buffett first\". There are regulations on what BRK can and cannot buy as well as how much along with different proceedings.\n\nIn the sense of small investors mirroring Buffett, it's probably best to take it as a grain of salt or added factor instead of being a pure mirror since most small investors aren't rich, aren't restricted, can't broker special deals, and have different goals. I see BRK as an extra vetting tool where if they buy a company, I'll assume they did some homework on it. Doesn't mean it will 5-10x in 1-2 years since that's not really what they aim for anyways, but it doesn't mean AXP, BAC, and AAPL will probably have decent returns and won't collapse like Enron or Luckin.",
