Typically bottleneck refers to the manufacturing throughput capability of a functioning line. This is considered a yield issue due to process, not a bottleneck. It likely isn’t even the bottleneck even with these yield issues, but the yield issue itself is functioning as a constraint limiting the output of the fab to a percentage of total starts. Still, they will have a true “bottleneck” elsewhere in the fab. Usually photo (lithography)\n\nI hadn’t read this until now but honestly that’s a good place to have this sort of issue. If it was an alignment issue caught at packaging, that’s a different order. The cycle time is low once at packaging which means any fixes are quickly implemented and out the door\n\nGood news",

As higher and higher speed is requried, more direct connection with smaller pitch is needed to minimize impedance, which means misalignment is very unforgiving.\n\nThis part is extremely important because if the connection failed, then all the previously good chiplets are either unusable or underperforming compared to design specs as the connection doesn't allow high speed connection. So there are two yields to keep track of now, chiplets fabbing yield and packaging yield.

Maybe we should go back in time to when the Xbox was a joke and tell them to stop investing, and to do a big fat chunk of stock buybacks instead. That'll be profitable in the long run!
