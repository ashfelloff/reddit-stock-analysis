      "body": "The market once again went into irrational euphoria unsupported by macroeconomic and financial backing - another market hysteria, 2.6 trillion Nvidia capitalization with fierce buying as if 6x growth since early 2023 and doubling early 2024 didn't happen.\n\nNvidia has created 1.2 trillion in capitalization since Dec. 23 (including May 23 pre-market) - more than the capitalization of all publicly traded companies in major countries around the world combined, and that's just capitalization gains. \n\nNvidia's importance (in terms of triggering value creation in the financial markets) dwarfs any macroeconomic report, any Fed statement, and even geopolitical events, overshadowing the media agenda with the hype around AI.\n\nThe fact is that Nvidia's annual revenue is 80 billion (potential 110 billion) with earnings of 42.5 billion (potential around 60 billion), i.e. a forward P/S of around 24 and a P/E of 42-45. At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart). Not because Nvidia is bad (best technology solutions on the market and great products), but because the market is crazy.",
