My guess is this super hyped 50:1 split will bring in the regards that don't have a clue how overvalued it is and that will provide Bill his exit liquidity.  They control the float. He has a 2 BILLION dollar position and management owns the rest. Managment gets cheap options and the company buys them back at full retail markup.\n\nThere are essentially no retail holders now ahhhh but there will be after the split.",

          "body": "I don't own chipotle but honestly this. \n\nPoor folk over value their own dollars when it comes to products/services that aren't intended for them. This post is only slightly as regarded as one like\n\n>WE MUST HIT FERRARI WHERE IT HURTS MOST\n\n>OUR GAS TANKS ARE TOO DAMN EMPTY. THEY ARE GETTING TOO COCKY. WE MUST RISE UP TOGETHER.\n\n>I REFUSE TO STAND BY HELPLESS IN A WORLD THAT SQUEEZES ME FOR MORE AND MORE. I WILL NOT LIVE IN A WORLD WHERE MY HORSE POWER IS SMALLER THAN IT USED TO BE. IT SHOULD BE BIGGER NOW NOT SMALLER!!!! AS A SINGLYLAR APE I AM WEAK BUT TOGETHER WE BECOME STRONG.\n\n>JUST LOOK AT THE STOCK PRICES LIKE HOW THE HELL CNA MY LAMBO BE GETTING SMALLER AND MORE EXPENSIVE WHILST THE STOCK PRICE IS CLIMBING?!?! IMMORAL I SAY!!!!! ESPECIALLY THE FUCKING SALES WHO REFUSED TO GIVE ME MORE SEAT LEATHER OPTIONS YOU BITCH\n\n>MEANWHILE THEY FOCUS ON 50:1 STOCK SPLITS?!? AND PROBABLY STOCK BUYBACKS NEXT? ARE WE FUCKING BECOMING THE BOEING OF AUTOS HERE???\n\n>FUCKING SHORT $RACE FUCK YEAH\n\nReality is that ALL fast food companies have been hiking prices since the pandemic to test their pricing power. The truly smart never ate to begin with, those who were a bit brighter ate more when it was cheap and cut back as prices went up, and the dumbasses keep paying like regards and then make an OP.\n\nBut the truth is that Chipotle, LVMH, or Apple don't give a shit if poor fucks can't afford their products so long as their core customer base can and will continue paying. To that point, Chipotle is still able to charge a premium because it's near restaurant quality but cheaper without the tipping. Also quality is way better than say McDonalds at close to if not lower price. Other fast foods have not really started cutting prices and even if they did most folks who aren't poor college kids will choose Chipotle over the outright industrial slop their stuff like Taco Bell or Jack. \n\nThe time to push back against CMG as a consumer was a while back. The time to short CMG is not now (now isn't a good time to short anything, but 🌈🐻s gonna 🌈🐻). I wouldn't buy CMG now but I wouldn't buy it even when it was cheaper. Not my area of expertise even if I do eat there sometimes. Where I do feel I have expertise is in luxury because of where I work and what I've invested in before. And I can tell you this: rich people keep winning and they'll keep spending. You don't compromise on quality or exclusivity to reach more folks. Watering down your brand is risky if not a death nail. You stick to your core customer base like LVMH does instead of watering down like CPRI did. Disregard the poor or those you can't afford because it's often not worth the time and effort to cater to them when you have highly profitable and easy to cater to customer base. Same with Ferrari vs Maserati. In CMG's sense they never were for the broke fuck who couldn't afford anything over $5. Even during their early years they were a premium that was double of taco bell or half the calories of a dominos pizza. CMG ain't going for those customers so they can revolt all they want. CMG =/= MCD. If anything their whole business model is that they are NOT bottom quality tier fast food.\n\nOP's just poor and/or cheap but doesn't have the awareness or wherewithal to realize he's kind of a bum ass who can't afford CMG and that CMG doesn't give a fuck about losing him. It's kind of as silly as screaming online that we should all short women because he's not getting pussy. Reality is most women don't give a fuck about OP, me, or the average guy \"shorting\" them or not \"wooing\" them because they've got tons of better dudes lined up jumping at them already.\n\nDisclaimer: I don't own RACE nor CMG. I do eat Chipotle but less than maybe a few years ago. Do own some TPR and LVMUY. Men love bitches. Bitches love bags.",
