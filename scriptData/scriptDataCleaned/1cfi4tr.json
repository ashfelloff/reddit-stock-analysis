They followed the  expectations they set for raising, but then they set expectations in December for 4-6 cuts in ‘24. We are now expecting 0-2, and 2 is seeming less and less likely. They have not followed set expectations for cutting, because inflation has begun to rise again. Everyone is simply waiting for the first domino to fall. Maybe a bank over-leveraged in CRE goes down, maybe a hedge fund blows up, maybe war escalates and oil goes to $200/barrel, maybe mass layoffs occur, maybe more than one of these happen. Until then, fed will hold rates, or potentially raise as long as inflation persists. This will continue to put pressure on banks with heavy investment in CRE. There are at least 6 regional banks over 100% invested in CRE. But also, while everyone is focused on rates and the fed, yellen is in the background, quietly running the liquidity pump. Needs to inflate asset prices to save her rich banker cult mates who’ve got themselves in a bad position, while transferring all the risk to managed 401ks.",

These changes were intended to put more money in the pockets of middle-class Americans, allowing them to keep more of their earnings and potentially stimulate spending.\n\nFor businesses, the tax cuts significantly reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, making the United States more competitive globally and encouraging investment, job creation, and expansion. Additionally, the TCJA introduced a new tax deduction for pass-through businesses, which are businesses like partnerships and S-corporations whose profits are taxed at the individual level.\n\nCritics argue that the tax cuts disproportionately benefited corporations and wealthy individuals, as they received the largest tax reductions. However, supporters of the TCJA argue that the cuts helped spur economic growth, job creation, and wage increases across the board, benefiting workers and businesses alike.",

The Fed raises rates to try and stop the economy from overheating, using inflation as the central gauge. The market knows this.

Getting to that point where growth slows enough and inflation follows even more would be a bullish event, as I stated earlier, all that risk-free money would be set free to go back into equities and THEN the next cycle can begin where the next time the Fed raises rates, it would ideally be from growth led overheating and not from black swan covid inflation.",

              "body": "Fed hiked rate from 3% to 6% in 1 year to fight 3% inflation. Inflation hasn't hit 2% yet, and the economy was still running hot, risking inflation being sticky and won't go down all the way to 2%. Fed chair Greenspan correctly realized the economy was running hot due to higher productivity (because of widespread computer adoption). Higher productivity allows for higher GDP without putting upward inflation pressure. So he allowed the economy to run hot, did a mid cycle adjustment by cutting rates 3 times, and let inflation slowly go down instead of forcefully bringing it down quickly by causing a recession.\n\nIt was the classic soft landing case study in Fed history that probably every Fed chair tries to emulate. \n\nYou see some similarities to that in today period. Inflation is roughly 2.5-3% core PCE YoY. There's higher productivity last year, possibly due to AI, possibly due to higher people joining the labor force. Economy is running hot, but it's not putting much upward pressure to inflation. There's concern about inflation being sticky at around 3%, but not a lot of concern about inflation heating up (said by Powell himself). The Fed wants to get a few cuts in to prevent rates from becoming too restrictive, but they don't necessarily feel the need to cut all the way down to 2.5%.",
