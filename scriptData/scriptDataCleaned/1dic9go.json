      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Most of the time people are just negative as if it's bad to make money without YOLOing. I guess a lot of the sub just feeds into dreams that *you too* could make 20k off of 400$ and people don't like to be reminded that most of the time you need a sizeable investment capital and a bit of time to make good money and not just 3 weeks and whatever's left over from your paycheck",

Your goal is that the value will go up from where you bought it and you can sell it before expiration for profit. Then you sell it and your position is closed.

So basically while you don't pay money upfront to open the position, you're risking possibly thousands. Your goal here is that the contract either expires worthless, meaning you get to keep the premium, or you buy back the position to close it, which depending on what the price is can be for an overall profit, but not 100% of the premium, or it may be more expensive so you pay more than you made for it, so it's a loss.",

The only thing you should keep in mind is that a lot of brokers seem to have very favorable order fills on their sim accounts which can give the wrong impression to many.\n\nThe ideal timeframe depends on many factors, but generally the longer you can afford and the closer strike price towards current price you can afford is best. At the money long dated options are as safe as can be. As a general rule of thumb, which you can adjust once you have a feel for time decay, I try to buy options that last a third longer if not twice longer than the time between my purchasing them and the time I am expecting a movement to happen or have happened. For example if I am expecting an event to make a stock jump in a week I'll buy an option that expires 2-3 weeks out at least, so that in the timeframe I am expecting the movement to take place time decay is minimal. If you buy one that expires a day after the expected shift then you run the risk of the option going in the money too late and still making a loss. \n\nHow often I make money? About half the time currently. I only recently started actively trading options myself but I'd done a lot of reading up before hand. There's a lot more to profitability than just making the right entries. You also have to make the right exits. I've cut some winners too early and let losers run too long. Classic trading issue. I suggest you do a lot of reading and practice to understand what kinds of returns to expect and what time frames work best for you.",
