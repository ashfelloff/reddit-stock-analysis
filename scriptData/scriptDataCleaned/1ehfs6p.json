  "selftext": "Roblox earnings flew past quarterly estimates and delivered upbeat financial forecasts.\n\nThe videogame platform posted a fiscal second-quarter loss of 32 cents per share, narrower than the loss of 39 cents Wall Street had penciled in, according to FactSet. A year ago, the company lost 46 cents per share.\n\nBookings, a form of adjusted revenue preferred by videogame analysts, were $955.2 million, soaring 22% from a year ago and above the consensus call for $898 million.\n\nFor its third quarter, the company is calling for bookings between $1 billion and $1.025 billion, while analysts have forecast $967 million.\n\nFor the full year, it now expects bookings of $4.18 billion to $4.23 billon, higher than a prior range of $4 billion to $4.1 billion. Analysts were calling for $4.08 billion.\n\nThat guidance boost stems from confidence in the business, Chief Financial Officer Michael Guthrie told Barron‚Äôs. ‚ÄúConfidence in some of the steps we‚Äôve taken over the past few months to improve top-line growth and the success of those investments and the fact that we, of course, that we believe they‚Äôll continue for some amount of time,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that simple.‚Äù\n\nRoblox stock was rising 4.5% to $43.39 in premarket trading Thursday. Shares have lost 9.2% this year through Wednesday‚Äôs close.",
