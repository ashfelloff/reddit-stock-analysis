Still possibility but I feel otherwise - at LEAST going back to $140 (1 yr back price) in short term - probably at or right after August earnings call if not earlier.\n\n1. They will probably have to cough up all their contract $$ due to liability at the MINIMUM so meager revenue/profit they booked in prior quarter(s) are GONE. They will have to adjust down the profit severely.\n2. Any FUTURE renewals will also be SEVERELY hampered in terms of cost that they can charge. If a company had $1 million/yr contract for 3 years (Usual industry term length) and it is their first year and if they have $5million loss, they aren't paying anything for 2 more years and most likely will NOT renew as they will spend next 2 years trying to move away from them.\n3. No NEW clients are going to sign up or will only sign on with liability limit waved but if this starts to happen, there is no way CS can get liability insurance large enough to cover anything CLOSE to what is needed. In turn, there is no way new contracts are signed without any liability insurance in place.\n4. with no $$ coming in or in limited supply, they aren't able to retain top talents thus they will start jumping to competitor and their product will no longer be competitive. In long term, their product will probably be bought out in firesale and will be re-branded under another company.",

Lower forecast profit\n* Their insurance premiums are about to make what happened to recent car rates look like a tiny blip\n* Lawsuits, lawsuits, lawsuits. You know there are 100s being prepared right now. Funds hate lawsuits. They create an undetermined element of risk to a stock because there is no way to know how much the payouts will be (See: JNJ)\n* Sales calls - Just imagine being a CRWD sales rep trying to close a deal in the next few months. Bigly discounts. And I don't think $10 vouchers to Uber are going to cut it.\n* Competition will pounce - This is the time for PANW and others to make their move, even at the cost of revenue. Easy talking points for sales reps: \"Remember when the world went to shit for a day? That was not us.\" - So, lower sales and more discounting.\n* Pelosi owns PANW... Enough said\n\nI expect the true pain to evidence itself on the earnings call. Stock values are all about projections of the future. I am dubious that call will go well.

It's market cap is way to high, this is a company that has a PE still over 450; that number only makes sense if investors are expecting future exponential growth - other tech companies have a PE in the 30 - 45 range.  This company is valued entirely on speculative growth, growth that will now be significantly stunted at best but in reality it's likely their earnings are going to shrink significantly going forward.\n\n  \nThis company was way overbought before the BSOD madness they unleashed on the world.  CRWD is likely to unwind back to double digit numbers; if they bottom out at the tech standard market cap for earnings the stock will sit around 30.  As long as it's trading over 200 put the bumps.",
