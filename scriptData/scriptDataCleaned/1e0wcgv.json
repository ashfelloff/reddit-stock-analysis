      "body": "You have to be extremely careful especially when dealing with 0dtes. Sometimes the market acts irrationally but today's pullback was predictable. CPI data was priced in via the massive runup we saw throughout the week so far (a jaw-dropping +1% yesterday) and it was a sell the news, recalibrate type event. \n\nGood CPI data means a rotation from large cap (SPY) to small cap. If you bought 0 dtes under the assumption that CPI data would be bad and thus everybody would be clinging onto SPY for dear life, then before the market even opened you should have revised your thesis and aborted your plans to buy calls. \n\nIn the end though it comes down to risk management. I personally was incredibly devastated losing 5% of my port in the worst decision I've ever made in my life (fomoing into NVDA at ath and then paperhanding it at the literal lowest point) and swore off gambling. Hope you do the same. Swing trade stocks, long dated options, and if you have to do short term, play market overreactions. 0dtes without a thesis? Without risk management? That'll spell doom for your port faster than Genshin Huang can sign tits.",

If you buy long dated SPY calls you're more likely to be right, 2+ months out. But there's a lot of bouncing off of these ATHs. It bounced twice off of 549 and after it cracked 550 it blew past 560 as well, again all the financial tabloids and junk news making headlines about it. A pull back was very likely, and they'll keep on doing that shit until EOY probably as people are getting skittish of a massive pullback after another year of massive growth. \n\nDays like these is exactly what you wait for to buy calls.",
