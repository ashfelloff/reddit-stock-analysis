Stocks will meteor before then, just sell most of your holding in the late run up for a decent return, then sell the rest IMMEDIATELY after the news for a potential massive return. They will inevitably crater within a few days of legalization when people realize there is a decade+ before they reach even their minimal potential as agricultural commodity stocks (not a high growth sector, historically, lol).

These options are already trading cheap, but if Polestar makes significant strides in the EV market, partners with a major player, or sees a sudden surge in popularity, these could turn into gold.\n* **Why It Might Hit**: Polestar has potential as an EV underdog. If they can capture a slice of the booming EV market or if sentiment shifts favorably towards them (think new models, tech breakthroughs, or unexpected partnerships), the stock could skyrocket, and these calls could be worth a lot more.\n* **Why It’s Risky**: Polestar is still an emerging player in a competitive space. If they fail to gain traction or if the broader market turns against growth stocks, these options could expire worthless.\n\nThis play is for those who are betting on the long-term success of Polestar in a big way, with a small initial investment that could pay off massively if everything goes right. It's definitely a YOLO move, but with a potential EV boom on the horizon, it might just pay off.\n\nOR, Accumulate a significant number of Polestar (PSNY) shares while the price is still relatively low. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)",
