  "selftext": "“Apple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\n\nNvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a $3.1 trillion market cap as of writing. Apple now trails only Microsoft, which has a nearly $3.2 trillion market cap as of writing.”\n\nPretty impressive rally by Apple. I think they have presented one of the more marketable and useful presentations regarding how their AI features will help everyday users. Also Apple Intelligence is an elite name.\n\nSource: https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/aapl-all-time-high-wwdc-2024/",

              "body": "I'm also happy. I just limited out on AAPU near its current levels (34) this morning when I was sleeping, sticking with my self-imposed restriction of only rarely holding levered funds for a very short period of time when I have a very good reason. I'm holding my normal apple shares that I bought pre-earnings over a month ago, after being uncharacteristically out of apple for more than a year. The content of WWDC was completely [in line with my expectations](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1d9wdst/aapl_and_wwdc_on_monday_expectations_for_ai_and/l7kxcsz/?context=3) with the exception that I forgot that apple doesn't do hardware announcements at WWDC and they are pretty secretive in general. I do still think that Apple AI will run TSMC LLM ASIC inference chips on Apple Silicon in the cloud but I could be wrong. I was watching WWDC on my vision pro (brought to me by, in part, by historical gains in Apple stock) and watching a separate window tracking AAPU's ~4% declines and feeling like other traders were watching a different stream.\n\nOver the last months I've also read a lot of comments made by people dragging Apple as a buy, and a lot of comments by people who are either angry or mystified over this week's apple gains, so I thought I would write an essay breaking all the reasons for the rally.\n\n* First off, Apple hasn't had revenue growth for well over a year, and its growth has been tepid for two years. Obviously, you want to own companies that are growing when they are growing, so Apple's stock price was stagnant or down over the last 18 months, while it was entirely discounted as an AI player while the AI chip stocks and AI-branded Mag 7 players ran away (with the exception of Tesla). At the very least, the street is now expecting positive iPhone growth this year, which is the dominant source of Apple's revenue, as its 2 billion+ users begin to upgrade. I personally don't expect Apple to blow us out of the park next earnings, but I do expect consistent and steady growth in iPhone purchases. I'm pissed that I have to upgrade to test the new Siri on a phone, but AAPU more than paid for that this week. After WWDC, I held AAPU until this morning, expecting that dedicated analysts would make their case to fund managers as to while WWDC was actually a big deal, despite the initial sell-off.\n\n* I think Nvida is best positioned to monetize B2B AI on both the hardware and software front (with NIMs and other software/LLM bundle and omniverse digital twin offerings, while I'm ST bearish on the overvalued software sector as a whole). But, I think that Apple is best positioned to capitalize on consumer-facing AI (again, with 2 billion+ users). Most people don't need AI that can one-shot hundreds of lines of code (which AI can't do now, but will be able to do in the future). Most of those 2 billion people need AI give short, confidential, and accurate answers to quick questions (which Apple AI will do this year) and act as an assistant (make three different cost-effective itineraries for a trip and execute on all the purchases for one with an okay, pull up all the news or websites that I will find interesting this morning based on my past behavior), which will happen soon-ish. \n\n* At WWDC, Apple subtly laid out their case of how they are moving forward with AI, which aligns with what a lot of experts have been calling for over the last year. This is that you have your own private on-device AI and own private Apple cloud AI, which interacts with other apps and websites, which will increasingly run using AI agents and novel LLMs, on your behalf. For most people, especially younger generations that are very locked into the Apple ecosystem, the amount of time they use their meat sticks on phones and keyboards will dramatically decrease. Yeah, Microsoft can do this too. But, Microsoft has a very long and problematic relationship with on-device privacy, starting with Windows 10, and progressively getting worse since then. If your AI knows you and is doing stuff for you, you want to be able to trust it. You don't want it to tell Microsoft, Meta, or Google all your pressure points that will result in you making a purchase. These three companies are all in the personal data-broker business, where all your data is supposed to be anonymized, but a programmer with a budget who knows anything about you can know almost everything about you. You also don't want personal AI to cause problems for you while acting as you on your behalf. Also, the difference between great AI software and pretty good software can be huge if you know that the software will inevitably make mistakes and do things that you don't want it to do. At WWDC, apple laid out their business model for the next decade, and it is clear that they are serious and have put a lot of work into it.\n\n* With regard to stocks, future performance will depend entirely on the monetization of AI. Apple can and will monetize AI through their new effort in many different ways. We don't know what Apple's current deal with Open AI is, but it is important to remember that Google pays Apple to use their search. Google turns this finders fee into ad revenue. As AI becomes more accurate and its critical thinking ability improves with retrieval augmented generation, which is critical for accuracy and reducing hallucinations that make AI a b*llshit machine if you ask it a truly complex multi-part question and is critical for an AI managing an OS. Apple will own 2 billion+ eyeballs and they can decide how they monetize those eyeballs and how much they want to make per eyeball at their leisure. \n\n* Whether or not they are currently using ASICs, Apple's official entrance into the AI cloud is a really big deal. Particularly, Apple can capitalize on its decades-long role as one of TSMC's most important customers. Through 2026, four companies have reserved the bulk of TSMC's entire 3 nm production line those companies are NVDA, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple.](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2024/06/11/news-major-clients-reportedly-fully-allocate-tsmcs-production-capacity-until-2026-3nm-process-in-high-demand/) Right now, if you are a different company or startup that wants to use the best technology to run your AI, you have to go through one of those four players, be satisfied with lower-scale or older-tech production, or wait until 2027 to start production and 2028 to launch. In AI years, 3-4 years is an eternity. We already know the players that will compete at the highest level between now and then, and Apple is one of them, thanks to their historically close relationship with TSM. Apple has been an AI player the entire time the stock was sleeping, and this week, the catch-up trade went into high gear. Apple doesn't hype all the great things that it plans to do to juice share prices, Tim Cook only reports on what Apple has already done in secret (though Apple is a leaky ship, so you can know a lot about what they are trying to do in secret of you read all the macrumors sites and cross-reference different rumors posted at different times for consistency). \n\nThese are the reasons why apple stock went up. People like me waited a year from the last WWDC to make a big bet before this WWDC. The lion's share of my portfolio, in order, is NVDA, TSMC, and AAPL. \n\nWith regard to how long to hold aggressive positions and when to get taxed on profits, I am super sensitive to major Mag-7 level companies notably cutting back on spending, or accelerating their layoffs. I am hoping these indicators will give me a month or so to load up on dry powder/go conservative. I will also keep an eye out for signs of absolutely imminent trouble with China, which would also crash almost all stocks everywhere. With NVDA, I am also on the alert for any reports of Blackwell water cooling failures. Water cooling is really hard to implement, especially when water pressure can't shut off for years, and leaks can't happen for years, or there will be disastrous financial consequences. I've been through many crashes, and it is critical that you watch the biggest customers of your biggest positions to see verifiable trouble ahead. But, I think I stick to evidence based investment with regards to taking profits, and I don't see evidence yet. \n\nThere is a lot of talk on CNBC about Cisco's crash after the dot-com bubble. I used to own Cisco. There were plenty of warning signs. Cisco's biggest customers were WorldCom, Sprint, and AT&T when it had massive year-over-year revenue growth. Two of those companies are no more. WorldCom was an Enron-scale case of outright fraud and they were buying Cisco routers to keep up appearances. Sprint over-extended its Cisco purchases. These stocks hit their highs months before Cisco hit its high. Cisco had tepid 15% YoY growth, down from massive revenue growth, the month it crashed. If NVDA's YoY growth goes from very positive to mildly positive, then that is really bad at these valuations, because trends in revenue growth have significant correlations, and going from great growth to okay growth can signal an inflection into a decline. So, I'm not going to try to get out at or before the top, I am going to wait until earnings numbers come in before running for the hills and rotating into bond proxies with good dividend yield.",

Who knows what happens in their product brainstorms and what's the focus on their roadmaps - they've done a good job of keeping things under wraps and also don't announce things unless they're ready. But when they announce - they don't fail. They embed it into their ecosystem, they ensure it works, and make it accessible to the masses. Until I see signs that their culture has changed, or that they start skipping steps in their rollouts, there's no reason to think Apple won't be quietly making smart moves and adapting to the latest while everyone else is announcing layoffs and stock buybacks, and making abstract promises about the latest technology trend.\n\nThis news combined AI integration all while guaranteeing sales for their next 5 iterations of iphones and other key idevices at a time when people were thinking their devices have peaked.

My Masters is in Data Science - Analytical Tools track.\n\nI couldn't even begin to count the number of models I've worked with, much less built myself.  Whether in school, my day job, or something personal. \n\nIs something running locally on a phone more limited than something like Chat GPT4o? Of course. Does that mean it's output is going to suck and it's going to drain your battery like crazy? Also no.\n\nIt will have limitations, but the key is in what they sacrifice in order to perform on-device. What you need to recognize is that they likely aren't just running your queries through an llm. There is likely an application layer sitting on top of the model, orchestrating your request, using more traditional logic to determine the category of request as well as necessary OS interactions in order to trim down the query into a variety of smaller, specialized models, including, but not limited to, an llm designed to respond in specific formats that can then be interpreted by the application layer to present more complex answers and queue up actions. \n\nTo top it off, they have all of this running on specialized, dedicated hardware designed specifically to do these operations efficiently. \n\nI don't take issue with your assertion these models will be more limited than something like ChatGPT because, well, no shit. That's why they have optional offloading to cloud compute, or even to OpenAI, for more complex queries. \n\nThe part I take issue with is your assertion that the results will be \"ass\" and the implication that they won't be useful. \n\nThey've designed this workflow specifically to target a wide range (but still much narrower than the scope of something like ChatGPT) of content and activities on your device. Nothing they've shown is particularly novel. Most of these things are being done effectively already. The thing they've done that IS novel, is waiting to release it as a fully realized ecosystem of seamless functions throughout the OS, and in a manner that respects your privacy.\n\nI'm no Apple shill. I use a Pixel and a PC. But what they've done, is build a useful, non-gimmick AI ecosystem with practical uses that will massively improve their current digital assistant.",

I will believe it when I see it.\n\nI think that's a fair and healthy dose of skepticism. That said; Apple has been making a lot of investments into AI, and because none of the individual pieces of this solution are particularly novel, I think it's reasonable to take them at mostly face value on these claims. Industry insiders, even generally skeptical ones, have been saying good things about Apple's internal AI push and Apple has been making sizable contributions to the Open Source AI space. Also, for what it's worth, my buddy is a Data Scientist at Apple and while I haven't heard any specifics, he has been very impressed with their internal efforts (and he was one of the more skeptical guys I worked with when we worked together at my last job)\n\n> I don't doubt that Siri will be improved, but that isn't saying very much.\n\nTrue.\n\n> I also wouldn't bet the farm that many people start using Siri significantly more than before, or that it will be a huge selling point for iPhone.\n\nI wouldn't be so sure. It's already drumming up a lot of hype in both technical and non-technical crowds. I definitely think we'll see people starting to use Siri more and more in their day to day workflow.",
