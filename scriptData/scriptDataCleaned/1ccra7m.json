Head to the raw meat area for some BULK MEAT. They have blade cut or non-cut versions. \n\nNot into RAW? Right next to it is the line for hot meats. Women and men always be lining up there for some HOT COCK or RIBBED meat.\n\nThere's also sell bulk sausage raw or cooked in the refrigerated and frozen areas. Some ladies just opt for the bulk milk in the back (in a way it's an inverse Wendy's). And don't forget to pump that trunk before you go. Get that fill while it's still cheap.",
