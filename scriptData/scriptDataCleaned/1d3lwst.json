This stock has been fucked so badly that it hurts to be under $300. \n\nI was at a major mall yesterday and next to LULU store there is an ALO store. Please check the foot traffic and also also see the quality of the products, compare them. LULU was packed and ALO had 5 customers at most.\n\nALO is a trendy street wear brand vs LULU is more athletic, sporty style. They are not much of a competition. \n\nI just can’t justify this kind of massive drop from $470 to $300 because of ALO in just one quarter.\n\nReporting next week. Buying call here.",

Tons of runway internationally that can make up for a slowdown in NA, and the NA slowdown is already priced in via guidance and the suppressed share price.\n\nTrends and catalysts look great. Weight-loss drug craze will draw in new customers. Summer Olympics approaching will have more eyeballs on performance athletic gear and LULU is sponsoring Team Canada. Golf is growing and they are expanding their presence in golf, recently locking down MWL as a new ambassador. \n\nInsider activity shows no selling and a relatively large insider buy at $390 per share.\n\nNot sure what Alo, vuori, athleta, and all the other cheap knockoffs offer that I am not seeing. LULU offers a better all around value proposition and is also a leader in using safe materials.
