Majority of the middle class and below are getting poorer.\n\nFree money from feds are indirectly stealing our purchasing power thru inflation. Government is only helping the companies get bigger. Look at GM/Ford, they cried saying they don't have enough government support so they can't compete against china BYD's ev. So they ended up getting over 20 billion in subsidy/grant /loan and managed to built shitty ev cars whereas, china's byd recieved around 2 billion in government grant, only 10% of what FORD received, and China built ev cars that's infinitely better than what GM/Ford made. \n\nHow does it relate to the stock market? Well, remember how Ford received those subsidy? They are cash rich and initiated I think 10 billion stock repurchase plan when their focal point should be on R&D and catching up/surpassing china ev tech.   But hey! At least their stock price is up, great for investors? Not really, it's really to short term prop up their stock market so they can pull a Elon Musk and the Tesla stock option salary package.  Ex. Ford CEO base salary remains 1.7 million and recieved additional 25 million USD via stock grant. Lol. So obvious, so fucked up and fist bump between whoever signed off on the EV grant. \n\nI expect the economy will remain as is (stock market remains high and prices of houses/food/gas/etc remain at an inflated high level as well.)  until months after election is over.   We have all time high household debt(HELOC/mortgage), student loan, car loan, credit card debt and etc. So people are owing more (accumulating record debt ) and the economy is recovering? Lol\n\nHowever who knows what will happen. Lots of shady not so much under the table shit going on right now. \n\nWarren Buffet holding record cash for a reason. Definitely not just for tax purposes by selling lots of apple stakes.  Look at buffet indicators. \nAt around 50%, stock market is cheap. At 100%, stock market is fairly priced. At 150%, stock market is overvalued. We are sitting at over 200%.  üòâ\n\nSo tldr: no. Give it some time and it'll break.",
