Just a matter of riding it out and banking those premiums. For me, it's all about balancing risk while cashing in on those opportunities. Pretty chill strategy overall.",

Is this because of the market capitalization differences between the two? 35B vs 539B? Sorry maybe I should be asking questions like these in  R/rookie investing? Or something like that.
