Just that corrections usually happen and all you are really asking is whether American bigtech is at the peak.\n\nMy own opinion: It looks to me that the US stock market is hugely imbalanced toward the bigtech, which are now overvalued. We are one or two poor earnings reports away from a run on those firms, and I'm not buying in at this point in the cycle. You can say the fundamentals of companies don't matter for the stock price, future growth will justify share price, etc. I just don't think the fundamentals of Meta or Google (advertising), or even Amazon (increasingly crappy) or Apple (increasingly uncompetitive), are as strong as their P/Es justify. That's just my opinion. That's probably not true for other US companies and sectors it should be said.",
