So if he exercises the option and buys 100 shares x $113 that would be $11,300 and then you add the $1,663 he paid for the contract and that gets him to paying $12,963 for those shares. Divide that by the 100 shares and his total cost to buy the shares was about $129.63 per share. \n\nAnother thing he can do is sell the 3 Call contracts back to the market if the price of NVDA shoots up past $113 (this is when it would be considered “in the money” contracts) and now someone would pay him more than the original $1,663 he paid per contract.",

Pretty easy to lose it all quickly.\n\nTo answer your question tho, not exactly.\n\nHypothetically, let’s say NVDA is $100 per share and you buy a call option with a $101 strike price that expires in a week and you paid $500 as the premium. This would be buying to open the contract. The next day NVDA goes up to $102 and you still have a few days before it expires. The Call contract is now “in the money” and you could sell to close the contract at a higher premium price that you paid for it, let’s say $700. So you sell at $700 and have a profit of $200. The main concern with this method is losing time value and then of course if NVDA price moves the wrong way you can lose a lot of money fast",
