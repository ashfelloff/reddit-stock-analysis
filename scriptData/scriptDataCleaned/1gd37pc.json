  "selftext": "Why is this company trading at almost a 400 P/E. Correct me if I’m wrong but It seems the Bull Case is that CAVA will be the next Chipotle.  The dining experience may be similar to Chipotle but the company execution is far from anything close to Chipotle.  I can’t even eat at CAVA because they only have locations in 26 states and mine isn’t one.  In my Opinion a company that is just bringing another lunch option to the consumer has no business trading at the multiple they trade.  But what do you all think?\n\nI have puts for 2026.",

Most developing chain restaurants aren't aiming to put their first few stores in fly over states and cities of 10k or less. It's a poor approach towards expansion. I can certainly see a retraction, but frankly, most soccer mom appealing fast casual establishments will be a safe bet. I've been in CAVA since 42 so I'm bias, but folks under estimate the power of mediocre \"ethnic\" cuisine on suburbanites. They're a powerful group to tap into. The \"healthy\" image CAVA has makes it appeal to health fanatics, it's easy for parent types to get their kids a \"good\" meal, most locations I've seen, are in areas near schools or concentrated work districts, making it accessible to office types-- it won't be Chipotle, but it will be pretty close to it. Generations are moving away from standard fast food anyway, so I don't necessarily see a saturation point as other establishments start to die off.",

You’ve got your lunch break office workers, moms who kids are at school, gym rats, college students, etc.\n\nMy one complaint, the workers at mine automatically slap a to-go lid on every bowl without first asking if the order is dine in.

They can justify the multiple because they can promise linear growth as they build out the new locations.  \n\nPersonally, I hate the company because it killed off Zoey’s Kitchen which I loved.
