Why would you give a shit about Tesla if you're invested in Uber or Lyft? Tesla wasn't the leader before, isn't the leader today, and won't be the leader any time soon. \n\nTesla was SAYING they will make Robotaxi earlier this year and promising everything including making every tesla/elon dick rider think their model 3  will be picking up your groceries, dropping off your kids, allowing you to sleep to work, taking your wife out for dates with her bf, and making money while you sleep by being a robotaxi.\n\n**MEANWHILE WAYMO** was already fully autonomous. Was already on the streets. Was a platform that isn't only tied to 1 brand like Tesla but is a cross brand platform that can be worked onto Toyotas, Jaguars, or whatever cars you install it into. Was already driving people around for free. *And also started already giving people rides* ***AND HAVING PEOPLE FUCKING PAY FOR THEM.*** Like how Elon promised earlier this year that he'd reveal a robotaxi that MIGHT be in production by 2025/26 and then MAYBE giving people rides sometime further down the line! But Elon dickriders will disregard the facts because they have too much dick in their mouths.",
