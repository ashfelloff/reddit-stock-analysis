  "selftext": "My story\n\nI started trading right when COVID hit. At first I was just buying a few shares of things that were popular at the time and slowly building an account from zero. Maybe $20 at a time. Eventually I got interested in Metamaterial science and discovered a company called Meta Material would be reverse merging with an oil and gas company called torchlight and shares of torchlight were .23ish cents at the time. I started buying them like mad in September 2020.\n\nMy Dad who has always dabble in the market was impressed that I got into investing and informed me I had $16K in a VOYA account and my parents quickly helped me link that to an ETrade account since I had only been using Robinhood at the time (again, pretty inexperienced at this point.) Shortly, those .23¢ shares hit almost a dollar and that’s when I started tracking my investments on the app you see here.\n\nBy June 2021, at the peak my account hit $460K. I was so excited. I really had no idea what I had stumbled upon, what I had done. Shares hit well over $10 at the peak and the merger was hours away from being complete.\n\nMy Dad essentially begged me to sell but I said I couldn’t because the merger hadn’t completed. The merger completed on my birthday and I lost $100K that day. Followed by $100K the next day.\n\nI didn’t sell my shares through the first reverse split. I didn’t sell my shares through all the signs I needed to bail ASAP. I didn’t sell my shares until it eventually hit .16¢ and they had announced a 1:100 RS.\n\nI had the win of a life time brand fucking new to the market. I’ll probably never have anything close to touching the gain I had from September 2020-June 2021.\n\nI pulled everything out of the market last September and now I’m taking a crack at day trading options. I recently posted that I was down 65% (about $4000) on that and got some flack, specifically one guy from here that DM’d me and suggested I quit trading.\n\nBeing brand new to options and being down $4000 is nothing to me. I’d rather learn a lesson in my first month of options trading than get cocky when I’ve had some major wins as I did a few years ago.\n\nAnyway, that’s my regard story. I always kind of passed over WSB but I’m starting to frequent the board more these days now that I’m trading  options.",
