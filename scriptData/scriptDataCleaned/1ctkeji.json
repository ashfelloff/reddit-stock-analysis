  "selftext": "Intro: An average salary of 34k while your rent is 2200 a month makes no sense whatsoever unless you have someone to split the cost. A combined household income of 48k and your rent of 2200 a month still make no sense because you got the rest to pay bills and food. Flats outside central london or poor quality builds. As of February 2024, the average house price in the UK is £280,660, and the index stands at 147.2.\n\n Property prices have risen by 0.4% compared to the previous month, and fallen by 0.2% compared to the previous year. Number of completed house sales per month in the United Kingdom is falling but the price of homes are up 4.2%. Over 180 tech companies have laid off their employees in just the past 8 weeks. Retail is closing, employees are made redundant. Birthrate down 20% over the decade. How can i short this damn market and make enough to buy myself a decent shed? \n\nMore to come in Part 1",

They're also about to come into a change of government who have said that the low wage, high growth UK is over and it's beginning a transition into a mid growth higher wage economy.\n\nWhat you're gonna see I think is a stagnation of house prices, and eventually political pressure to put in rent controls in some form to reign in landlords will be too much to ignore. Wages will go up as they have been, not enough to suddenly make home ownership affordable tomorrow of course, but with house price stagnation over say the next 10 years you might see that affordability ratio drift downwards.\n\nThis isn't 2008, they've not been handing out mortgages to people who can't afford them. Obviously a massive economic crash makes everything unaffordable for everyone, but failing that I don't see a larger reckoning. I wouldn't be investing in rental properties that's for sure, but prices dropping leaves millions in negative equity unable to sell. That's not going to flood the market with affordable properties.\n\nSomeone else said it here, but the US population checks the stock market to get a sense of the overall economy. The UK check house prices. The government would literally print money to pay people's mortgages before they'd let a crash happen.",
