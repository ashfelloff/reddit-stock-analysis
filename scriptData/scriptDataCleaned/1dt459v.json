Sweden, with generous childcare benefits, have the same birthrate as the US. Meanwhile, birthrates tend to be highest in poorer communities which are least able to afford children. The only real exceptions are religious communities like Mormons or Jews in Israel.",

I think culture plays a much larger role in this than people are comfortable with accepting. Religious communities, for example, have higher rates of fertility all over the world, even in affluent areas. Western countries have spent the last 60 years telling women that the most prestigious social aspiration is a high paying career. No one should be surprised that they got the message and have prioritised that over motherhood. Note that I'm not making a moral judgement on that spiration. I'm merely acknowledging it.",

Until shockingly recently, there was no such thing as marital rape.\n* women have alternatives to being a housewife. Plenty of career opportunities or other ways how to live a fulfilling life. Women were not able to work normal jobs - their choice was pretty limited - a nun, prostitute... what next?\n* relaxation of cultural norms. People were steered into family life on autopilot. Resisting it was not completely easy and people often didn't even think about this.\n* opportunity costs. There are now so many ways to enjoy life - video games, huge variety in television, travelling (used to be inaccessible), social media is able to replace some human needs, an infinite amount of hobbies. A hundred years ago, what was your alternative to a family life? There wasn't a lot of fulfilling things easily accessible to masses.\n* the standard of child care has jumped a lot - kids are much more work now than they used to be. A model parent from the 50s would now be a borderline case for social services.\n  * people complain about the monetary cost of children like education etc. But it's not so much that things were cheaper a hundred years ago, instead people didn't invest that much time and money into their children back then.\n* men are now expected to physically contribute to child care, which makes them weary of having (more) children.\n\nI'm pretty sure I'm missing some more.",

In fact, the correlation shows that as a society becomes wealthier, people choose to have less kids, it has very little relation to childcare associated costs.\n\nFact is industrialization, by emphasizing worker productivity and skilled, educated labor (which kids cannot perform) by design deprioritizes children and disincentives them. Unfortunately for the planet, there is a tipping point where all of a sudden it turns out that it went too far and there are no longer enough people to sustain the current system let alone the rapidly aging retiree class. And once you notice its usually too late - people are not like most things, you cant just ramp up production to make up for a shortfall - the last time you could have produced a 20 year old was 20 years ago, anything you start now will be effective only 20 years from now.\n\nFor context, in S Korea birthrate is at 0.7 ish now. Meaning the generation being born now will be less than half the size of their parents who were already only about half their parents. So in the future, the babies born now will be expected to sustain 4 grandparents and two parents, so 6 people total in their retirement. It becomes a vicious cycle that is basically inescapable once you get that low. In 100 years, korean population will fall precipitously if current rates stay as they are. In the range of 90%.

They are taking huge losses on that. \n\nI dont have a clue how bad any of that will end up being, but I would bet that some people with a lot more knowledge of the situation with a department full of mathematicians ran the numbers.

Its likely the other big institutions doing the Japanese carry trade are under pressure as well.\n\nUnwinding that means they have to sell assets they bought elsewhere and then pay back the debts denominated in yen. Many of these assets will be treasuries and bonds in a variety of currencies. The main thing is that the carry trade is roughly $20 trillion USD. IF they sell even a fraction of that its going to move markets. If they sell a lot its going to be something that they write books about.\n\nGo look at the yen exchange and 10 year treasuries today.",
