  "selftext": "Months after Disney and Gov. Ron DeSantis’ appointees agreed to end a protracted legal fight, the two sides are set to approve an agreement that could result in the company investing up to $17 billion into its Florida resort and opens the door to a fifth major theme park at Walt Disney World.\n\nThe five DeSantis-appointed supervisors who oversee the Disney World district voted Wednesday to give initial approval to a new development agreement that both sides had agreed to negotiate after a March settlement ended their state court lawsuits against each other.\n\nA second vote was required for final approval, and that was set for next week.\n\n“We are heading towards a brand new day, and I’m excited about where this is going,” said Charbel Barakat, vice chair of the district’s board. “I only wish we could have gotten here sooner.”\n\nWoody Rodriguez, director of external affairs for the Disney parks, told board members that the agreement will allow the company to make substantial investments in Disney World.\n\nThe agreement between Disney and the Central Florida Tourism and Oversight District would last for the next 15 years. The district provides municipal services such as firefighting, planning and mosquito control, among other things. It was controlled by Disney supporters for most of its five decades until it was taken over by the DeSantis appointees last year.\n\nUnder the deal’s terms, during the next decade or two, Disney would be approved to build a fifth major theme park at Disney World and two more minor parks, such as water parks. The company could raise the number of hotel rooms on its property from almost 40,000 rooms to more than 53,000 rooms and increase the amount of retail and restaurant space by more than 20%. Disney would retain control of building heights due to its need to maintain an immersive environment.\n\nIn exchange, Disney would be required to donate up to 100 acres (40 hectares) of Disney World’s 24,000 acres (9,700 hectares) for the construction of infrastructure projects controlled by the district. The company also would need to award at least half of its construction projects to companies based in Florida and spend at least $10 million on affordable housing for central Florida.\n\nThe settlement in March ended almost two years of litigation that was sparked by DeSantis’ takeover of the district from Disney supporters following the company’s opposition to a Florida law critics dubbed “Don’t Say Gay.”\n\nThe 2022 law bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades and was championed by the Republican governor, who used Disney as a punching bag in speeches until he suspended his presidential campaign this year.\n\nAs punishment for Disney’s opposition to the controversial law, DeSantis took over the governing district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors. Disney sued DeSantis and his appointees, claiming the company’s free speech rights were violated for speaking out against the legislation. A federal judge dismissed that lawsuit in January, but Disney appealed. As part of the March settlement, Disney agreed to put on hold the appeal of the federal lawsuit.\n\nBefore control of the district changed hands from Disney allies to DeSantis appointees early last year, the Disney supporters on its board signed agreements with Disney shifting control over design and construction at Disney World to the company. The new DeSantis appointees claimed the “eleventh-hour deals” neutered their powers and the district sued the company in state court in Orlando to have the contracts voided.\n\nDisney filed counterclaims that included asking the state court to declare the agreements valid and enforceable. Those state court lawsuits were dismissed as part of the March settlement.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/walt-disney-world-set-to-invest-florida-parks-desantis.html",

This was already in the works because of the 60B Disney committed to parks and experiences. With millennials and gen Z all saying they spend more on experiences than on physical products, and the massive base of people Disney can pull from with the parks, I'd say the parks could eventually overtake entertainment as the largest segment of Disney. Disney has hinted towards a potential 5th gate, and Disneyland forward is a big development in Cali.",

Their stock has been hurting mostly due to lack of imagination that you expect from Disney, and their movie/animation arm has been struggling big time from what you expect.\n\nHowever, their theme park arm has always been, and will continue to be their consistent cash cow. Margins are great, and they have no shortage of selling tickets despite the ever increasing ticket prices. The parks are always packed (kids and adults alike love the parks), and they made more money than ever in 2023 from their parks. A new shiny park as opposed to just additions to older parks will only increase that appeal as they haven’t had a brand new park in a LONG time. Gives people a sense of excitement to see something entirely new of that scale rather than a small addition (new ride, or smaller scale land like Pandora or Galaxy’s Edge) where you still have to walk through and around the same stuff that has been there for 20-30+ years to get to those. You can spend an entire day+ in a whole new park whereas you don’t need that to walk through Galaxy’s Edge and hit the couple of rides.\n\nYou would expect people to come in droves for its opening, and it will increase annual pass holders and regional visitors appeal who can go more often to go more again after that initial rush, thus increasing spending inside the parks more too. It’s a cycle that all feeds off of each other. After that initial spike of revenue, revenue should still level off higher than it was previously because it should rejuvenate a lot of people’s interests to go.\n\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly imo in relation to stock/optimism, it gives the sense that Disney is again taking it seriously to improve things and be innovative for their customers, consumers, and stock holders. That they are breaking out of remaining status quo and being stagnant, and again are starting to push boundaries and remain innovative rather than just rely on things of old which has been the gripe in recent years with them.",
