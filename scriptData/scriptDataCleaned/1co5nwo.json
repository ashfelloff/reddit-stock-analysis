That's an eternity and plenty of time to achieve a soft-landing.  \n\nLots of wiggle room to keep credit conditions loose for now.",

They've managed to stay afloat on credit card debt. Prices are still elevated and student loans have resumed for borrowers. Something is going to break. Consumer debt is at an all time high. Buy now pay later usage is up. Consumer savings still on the decline. Bank charge off rates are way up. People can't pay for the shit they acquire, and the party will be over at some point.\n\nThe only thing that's going to fix this mess is significant deflation or a recession/depression. Sadly, it's only a matter of time. I don't think it's coming until something breaks and the Fed is forced to cut rates. My guess is it'll happen under Trump's watch so they can blame him.",
