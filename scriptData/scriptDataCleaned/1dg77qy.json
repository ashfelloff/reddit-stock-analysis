  "score": 40,
  "selftext": "Harry Dent, the outspoken financial author and economist, isn’t reversing course from his bold \"crash of a lifetime\" declaration this past December.\n\nSpeaking in an updated interview with Fox News Digital, Dent cautioned that the \"everything\" bubble has still yet to burst, and it may be a bigger crash than the Great Recession.\n\n\"In 1925 to ‘29, it was a natural bubble. There was no stimulus behind that, artificial stimulus per se. So this is new. This has never happened,\" Dent said on Tuesday. \"What do you do if you want to cure a hangover? You drink more. And that's what they've been doing.\"\n\n\"Flooding the economy with extra money forever might actually enhance the overall economy long-term. But we'll only see when we see this bubble burst,\" he added.  \"And again, this bubble has been going 14 years. Instead of most bubbles \\[going\\] five to six, it's been stretched higher, longer. So you'd have to expect a bigger crash than we got in 2008 to '09.\"\n\n  \nInterested to know what you all think about this. I have also been seeing people go into other financial forums I have been in and saying the same thing. Apparently the signs will start to show themselves in late March 2025. I found it interesting that the CEO of Nvidia is set to cash out 700 million in Nvidia stock right around that time. Maybe it's a coincidence?  Please put politics aside and where the source of the news came from. Let's have an honest discussion.\n\n  \nFull article here: [https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles](https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/economist-harry-dent-predicts-stock-market-crash-worse-2008-crisis-bubble-bubbles)",

After hitting bottom, stocks will experience a mini-rally in 2015–2017 before falling into a final bottom during the 2019–2023 period, when the 45–50 age group troughs because the U.S. birth rate reached its own low in 1973.[6] The Dow Jones ultimately doubled in that timeframe.[1]\n\n* In 2012 the \"Dent Tactical Advantage ETF,\" symbol DENT, was de-listed having consistently under-performed the market for three years.[7]\n\n* In 2013, Dent predicted the market would crash again in the Summer of 2013 and would take a further year and a half to recover.[8]\n\n* In 2014, while promoting his book The Demographic Cliff in Australia, he predicted a major Australian housing market correction beginning in 2014 after an even bigger one in China.[9] He also predicted that the price of gold would fall to USD$700 an ounce, later revising this prediction to 2017.[10]\n\n* On December 10, 2016, Dent predicted that the Dow Jones Industrial average could fall 17,000 points as a result of Donald Trump's election win. Less than two weeks later, Dent reversed his opinion and thinks there is short term growth for the US stock market, but demographic forces will keep the economic growth stagnant in the longer term.[11]",

And if everything is fraudulent and nobody gives a shit, eventually you end up like Boeing with counterfeit parts in your planes and incompetent people in all of the positions. Should I buy puts on Boeing, by the way? It's a hard decision. On the one hand, it's obviously a garbage company. On the other hand, I don't think the American government will ever let them fail.\n\nThis is the other part of reality, though. Even the American government has a point where it becomes insolvent. How many outrageous unilateral sanctions do we have to throw onto random countries until the world collectively goes: \"man, buying US debt seems like a real bad idea, let's stop doing that.\" I guess my thesis here is that it just seems like the game of musical chairs can't go on forever.\n\n>You’re thinking of justice, ethics, karma catching up to us. \n\nNo all of those things can be safely ignored forever by the powers that be. I'm sure they love it when people believe in karma, actually, because it means they're smugly sitting on their asses instead of trying to change the system (which, to be fair, would also be a waste of time).",
