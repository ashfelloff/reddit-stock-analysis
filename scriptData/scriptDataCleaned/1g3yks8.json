      "body": "No DD on sight.\n---------\nThanks for your submission!\n\nr/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.\n\nPolitics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.\n\nStill, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

And when was the last election? 17 years ago... and again...Hamas is the only one fighting against Palestinians' oppressor (yes yes Hamas are themselves oppressors but to a far lesser extent).\n\nBut you know what? Fine. Don't answer the biggest part of my last comment. Let's say Israel does succeed and Hamas is wiped (after killing 40% of Gazans but who cares? Objective achieved!) Imagine a Palestine with no Hamas. But there is still Israel. What would that look like?\n\nDon't have to imagine. Look at the west bank. Look at all the illegal \"settlements\" that Israel is encouraging. Look at how those ~colonizers~ settlers are treating Palestinians there. Not only have Palestinians lost land, but whatever land they still have is shrinking. And they are losing more than land. Right, dignity, self-determination. \n\nIn that case, you'd much prefer devil that for you than an angel that fights against you. Or in this case, the devil that fights for you over the devil that fights against you",

I'm not sure how any warm blooded human on this planet justifies killing children on an industrial scale as we are witnessing.  \n\nBut for one moment let's assume you are correct, all borders beyond 1967 are deemed illegal but we know Israel is simply colonizing as they see fit and no amount of children's blood will stand in their way.  But it's ok because they blood is surrounded by brown skin.\n\nNow you are going to say Hamas blah blah blah but let's not forget Israel has been violating international law, committing war crimes, committing apartheid, and genocide for decades before hamas even existed. This didn't start last year.  This started in 1948 when Zionists started the ethnic cleansing of Palestine and as we are witnessing today Syria and Lebanon too.  Tomorrow Jordan, Egypt, and most of Saudi Arabia and Iraq.  They aren't even hiding it as they don't want peace.  They want land. \n\nhttps://www.jagranjosh.com/general-knowledge/what-is-greater-israel-why-is-the-idea-not-acceptable-to-the-muslim-community-1621507466-1",

No one would consider the British to have any claim to the land so any references to it doesn’t make sense.\n\n I don’t really care much about the past since everyone was terrible. Barely no Jews live in other places since they also got ethnically cleansed. Was a pretty standard thing back then. If you actually want to bring things to the current time instead of obsessing over the past, then I would agree Israel is being egregious in how its treating Palestine right now.",
