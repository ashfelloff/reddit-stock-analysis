That's not a good outlook for them to continue going up, unless if these companies somehow surprise the already high bar set for them and cause analysts to once again revise up their projected future earnings.\n\nThis whole year has been smooth sailing for the mag7. That's not supposed to happen on the second year of the bull market, and certainly not in an election year. I suspect it's gonna continue correcting until around mid Oct-early Nov and then rally towards year end, similar to last year.\n\nIf you still want to invest into mag7, i suggest waiting until Oct to buy in. I frankly don't see much rewards for the risk of the mag7. They look rosy now until the economy weakens, companies pull back on capital expenditure, and their revenue source will decline. I'd rather much invest into sectors that would actually benefit from application of generative AI, which apparently there aren't a lot right now.\n\nI don't know when it'll happen, but semiconductor (nvidia) is a cyclical stock, which follows the up and downs of capex cycle. It has been enjoying the upside or beginning of the cycle, but when the downside comes, it'll correct easily 50% or more (similar to 2022 when companies were forced to cut cost and reduce capex).",
