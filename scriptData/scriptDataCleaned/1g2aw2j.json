Of course, much of that depends on if you‚Äôre married or not. In either case you should have 6 months worth of your income in an emergency fund. Then you need to decide what the purpose of your investing is. Are you planning for your retirement ( highly recommend). If so open a self directed Roth IRA. That way you pay no taxes now, and they are deferred until you begin withdrawing.At your age I think I would put it all in NVDA and go away for a long time and come back after your very rich. Don‚Äôt listen to the people here that are always chasing penny stocks or think they are options players. You will do very well off NVDA. Keep buying each month as much as you can safely afford. My children are 6 and 13 and they put everything they have into NVDA. They make more in a night than most people make in a month. And I have been investing for over 55 years and was a CFP. This is one of those once in a lifetime opportunity . I wish you well.",

Yes, it will go up and down. I would look at its trend in a trend line and as it goes down keep buying. If the trend starts to go up back off and wait for the next downtrend.
