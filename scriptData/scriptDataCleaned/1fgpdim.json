  "selftext": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is cracking down on cheap products sold out of China by companies such as Temu and Shein by saying that companies are no longer exempt from tariffs simply by shipping goods that they claim to be worth less than $800.\nPresident Joe Biden would no longer exclude these “de minimis” imports from tariffs under a proposed rule released Friday to tax all imports if they're covered under Sections 201 or 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, or Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.",

It's difficult to give hard numbers but I can offer my experience as an honest US importer that is regularly in contact with Chinese manufactures, trading companies, and importers.\n\nThose that do report a value often under-report the invoice value and total units which result in lower duties and tariffs being charged. Small shipments typically get reported at less than $800 to avoid the tariffs and duties completely. Small shipments are often just large shipments that are \"split up\" but are still lumped in with their other shipments. (And this doesn't even touch on sales tax or income tax avoidance) Add in other factors like unsafe products (dangerous toys, supplements etc..), black hat or illegal selling techniques, cheaper labor and more direct sourcing and it becomes obvious why they are so successful against domestic companies. This results in unfair \"advantages\" for foreign sellers.\n\nThere are very few consequences for foreign sellers. Domestic sellers have serious consequences and as a result are more honest.",
