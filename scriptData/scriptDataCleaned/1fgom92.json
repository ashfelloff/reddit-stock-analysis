Happy to help (✿◕‿◕)  \nIt's easy to miss the racism on the first pass, because DEI does cloak itself in the veil of plausibility at first, and certainly its claims are very reasonable. But scratch the surface and examine their actual methods and it becomes pretty clear.\n\nThe thing about \"unconscious bias\" is that, well, [it's bunk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNNPXExjx9A) It [doesn't work.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ufw9d8T4oU)  \nThat isn't really surprising, given that [DEI itself is bunk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKLuhY2Q7Rw) - it relies on a definition of 'equity' that refuses to acknowledge that any kind of difference between people could be due to anything except discrimination.  \nThis is because DEI is based on Critical Theory which is about driving wedges through society by whatever means necessary, but in particular focusing on pitting people's immutable characteristics against one another across an oppression hierarchy. DEI isn't actually about fixing problems, so it doesn't really matter if its methods don't do that. It absolutely *works* in that it makes things worse, but that's not what most people think of when they think about it and it's not what it claims to do.\n\nDEI is racist, because DEI is trying to tell people that:\n\n* If your skin is a certain color you are inherently disadvantaged compared to other people\n* If your skin is a certain color, you cannot be discriminated against\n* If your skin is a certain color, you are inherently racist\n\nThese are all racist ideas, because they're applying stereotypes based on skin color to individuals before they have any kind of information about whether that individual's behavior fits that description, or not. Mostly not as it happens.  \nMore than that, it doubles down and insists that the only possible reason a person would deny they fit the stereotype assigned to them by DEI is [because they just don't realize how racist they are.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn3MkydX-8k)",

      "body": "MONTREAL — Brewing company Molson Coors says it is dropping its diversity, equity and inclusion policies and taking a “broader view” in which all employees know they are welcome, but groups representing the LGBTQ+ communitysay the move is a step backward.\n\nIn an internal memo Molson Coors shared with The Canadian Press, the company says its DEI employee training is complete and beginning next year it will stop requiring that its hiring process fulfils specific “representation goals »\n\nAs well, the Canadian-American multinational says it will no longer participate in the ranking program by the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group that scores companies on how inclusive their workplace practices are toward to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\n“Moving forward, we will assess our work to build a strong company culture based on our own internal metrics, your feedback and our success in serving our customers,” the memo reads.\n\nMolson Coors says it will no longer require its suppliers to meet diversity goals. Such metrics, the memo says, “can be complicated and influenced by factors outside our control.”\n\nThe memo also makes reference to social and political tensions: “In the polarized world in which we are living, let’s ensure that we stay united as a team.”\n\nThe company did not make anyone available for an interview.\n\nIn an email, Human Rights Campaign, which had previously given Molson Coors a perfect rating, did not directly acknowledge the change at the brewery but noted that some business leaders are turning their backs on commitments to inclusion.\n\nHowever, Orlando Gonzales, senior vice-president of research, training and programs at HRC, said in a statement on the group’s website, “companies like Molson Coors, Ford, and others that abandon their values and backtrack from commitments to diversity, equity, and inclusion risk losing both top employee talent and consumer dollars.”\n\nThe change in policy at Molson Coors comes amid backlash against companies seen to be supporting the LGBTQ+ community and diversity, equity and inclusion programs. In August, Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Farley sent a memo to all employees explaining the company’s decision to stop taking part in external culture surveys and an annual survey by HRC.\n\nIn January, Chip Wilson, founder of the Vancouver-based Lululemon Athletica Inc., criticized the company’s diversity efforts; in 2023, both Bud Light and Nike came under fire for partnering with and supporting transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.\n\nThe change of policy at Molson Coors is a sign of lost progress for Olivia Baker. As an instructor at Fondation Emergence, which advocates against homophobia and transphobia, Baker visits companies and organizations across Canada to help them implement best practices that support the LGBTQ+ community in the workplace.\n\nBaker said she is “disappointed but not surprised,” and called the company’s move the latest example of “a rise in LGBTQ+ hate.”\n\nShe says Molson Coors is dealing with a backlash against policies of inclusion, with much of the vitriol coming from the United States and taking root in Canada. \n\nHRC says companies that roll back DEI initiatives may end up losing profits. According to a survey it conducted in August, up to 80 per cent of LGBTQ+ adult respondents in Washington, D.C., said they would support a boycott of a company backtracking on DEI policies.\n\nTeamsters Canada, which represents 750 brewery, transportation and customer service workers at Molson in Montreal, says the company is free to implement its own policies.\n\n“If we determine that the company is engaging in discriminatory practices, we will take swift action to rectify the situation,” the union said in a statement.\n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Sept. 6, 2024",
