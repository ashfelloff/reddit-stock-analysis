If you bought then you would have made 46% in a month not bad right?\n\nShort term DD for the simple jacks that didn't read my first post:\n\nMost of what I said was true, market is realizing it, and with GLP1 ruling regarding FDA pushed to later in Nov., HIMS earnings are set up for some fireworks.\n\nThe Play: HIMS is about to announce earnings for their first full quarter of GLP1 sales...and I suspect due to the dearth of advertising and the mention of a Test replacement compounding capability at their latest facility an announcement of Test as yet another product with excellent gross margin to add to their catalogue.\n\nThis is like being in netflix early when it was eating blockbuster for lunch.\n\nLook at Walgreens down 90% from a decade ago.\n\nAnyways, with GLP1 fears pushed back thru end of Nov. I think the next few weeks and earnings will be absolutely fire.\n\nPlay is calls Jan. ATM or short term yolos.\n\nU can obviously lose it all this stock has wild ups and downs, but it hasn't had many positive news catalysts yet and i'd expect them to come for it's run. (Testosterone announcement, any inside buys, CTO hire perhaps?)\n\nGLP1 Revnue will likely pop this thing to moon.\n\nAnyways, i've got 150 calls riding up to and maybe through earnings depending and then ill re-evaluate.\n\nGL HIMS peeps never bet against the ED of the modern soyboys.",
