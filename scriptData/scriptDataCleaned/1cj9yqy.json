  "selftext": "Welp. My account was at its lowest 8 days ago around $770 with like $200 in buying power since the other $570 was in a stock I wanted to hold - started with 3k last month and it‚Äôs been a slow burn since. \n\nHad jury duty the entire week before so I was frequently away from my phone with active trades, which caused me to bag-hold my DJT puts more than usual. I finally got fed up with the recent pump destroying my puts I sold my remaining contracts and went calls. That breathed some new life into my account and gave me extra breathing room for some QQQ and SPY plays in addition to DJT. Timing them well and taking profit at 30-40% to make gradual gains. \n\nFinally, I inversed what I read on this sub about Apple earnings yesterday and bought a couple OTM AAPL 175c as a meme to see if it would work. It did. $2300 gain today between my AAPL and SPY calls. I finally won! So, in a way, thanks y‚Äôall ü§ù I‚Äôm putting my initial investment back and going to try and grow from 1000 again since I know now I can do it (with a little luck and love of course) üòé",
