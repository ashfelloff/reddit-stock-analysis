My understanding is that most of it [is used as livestock feed](https://wwf.panda.org/discover/our_focus/food_practice/sustainable_production/soy/). It's one of the reasons why switching to vegetarian diets reduces environmental damage. I focused on palm oil in my previous post as it was a discussion specifically about Nestle.\n\nAgain, I agree with your comment about palm oil being the most productive vegetable oil. Switching to a different vegetable oil would increase the amount of land turned over to agriculture. I think the issue is that most of it ends up in processed foods like chocolate that we don't really need. In fact, we would be a lot healthier if we avoided these products.",

If Musk resigns or goes to prison or dies the stock price instantly goes to zero. And he's so high risk they can't even buy a D&O policy.\n\n\n\nHe is clearly being protected by the government for some reason (presumably the spaceX DoD contracts), frequent complaints go un-investigated (eg https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html) and egregious law breaking merely punished with a slap on the wrist (and even that isn't enforced).\nBut when the political weather changes (which it might in a couple of weeks) he may well find himself getting the opposite treatment, which also be extremely un-good for the company.\n\n\nOn top of all of this the actual reported figures are very poor, there is no obvious product pipeline or driver of new sales, the company has a terrible public reputation and everything the CEO says is at best a half truth and often an obvious lie. It's clear the cyber truck, taxi and van were all thought up on the hoof and had to be ad hoc fabricated quickly to protect the CEO's reputation. The robot is nothing but a (bad) PR piece and the AI seems to be merely a figment of Musk's imagination.\n\n\nMeanwhile the CEO actually seems to spend all of his time shitposting far right memes and conspiracy theories on his personal ego extender, that he bought for a ridiculous sum of money pawned against his Tesla stock. He's very obviously not spending any time on the company at all and it seems unlikely his half-wit board or itinerant c-suite is adequately filling the gap.\n\n\n\nNo one with an ounce of risk awareness should be within 100 miles of this stock. It's risky even holding an index with it in. There are very very few companies in the S&P500 that could very quickly go to zero but Tesla could and it's one of the largest (by market cap).",

And no offense to people that do, but I think if you are trying to pick stocks based on your morals you are kidding yourself. You are taking on worse returns without actually changing anything in the world. Might as well make the most you can off the fucked up shit going on. Whether you are aware of it or not, we all support horrible institutions in indirect ways every day. I say make as much as you can for yourself, and use that money to help out your local environment. I made a lot of bets on ZIM options back when the Houthis were attacking the red sea. I was essentially rooting for the Houthis to keep stirring up shit lol.\n\nDon’t buy into the whitewashed idea that you can somehow be free of guilt just by carefully buying the right products, picking the right stock, or voting for the right snake. Make the most money you can off of this warped system, be good to the people around you, and focus on making your local environment better.",
