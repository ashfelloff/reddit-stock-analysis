              "body": "True, speed cameras exist and an officer has to review the footage to make that determination. The issue that defense counsel would raise is the proper calibration of whatever instruments detecting speed that Ford builds into these vehicles. Roadside speed cameras, etc, all have to be calibrated on a regular schedule. Proof of that calibration has to be provided if questioned. I don’t see that realistically happening in the case of Ford vehicles.\n\nYou could make the argument that “my Ford vehicle was going 60 miles an hour, and it detected someone driving 70 miles an hour passing me, therefore they were speeding”. Again, calibration is the issue. Can you prove that your speedometer in that Ford vehicle accurately reflected the speed? For example, even discounting the chance of a malfunction, aftermarket tire size could impact whether or not the correct speed was being displayed. I suppose they could use GPS to determine the vehicle speed at the time of the incident, but at this point I just don’t think it’s going to be a viable scenario.\n\nNot to mention the accused has the right to confront their accuser(s) and call witnesses. Can you imagine every time you drive your Ford vehicle, it lets law-enforcement know that it found half a dozen speeders a day? Even if only half of those people go to court to dispute it, that still means that you as the driver of the Ford vehicle could potentially be called to court as a witness **90 times a month.**",

The system then limits the engine’s power and the vehicle’s speed to that limit.\n\n> The speed limiter will send haptic, audio, and visual warnings until you start driving within the speed limits.\n\n> You can override the system by pressing hard on the accelerator, but the system will reactivate every time the car is started.",

What can they offer as new features, how can they give us something exciting that we want to trade up for, is there anyway they can leverage new technologies (can they somehow cash in on a subscription plan).\n\nIn every one of these areas I've seen them struggle to try and change the customers minds, convince them of what they want.\n\nTo me the market is dying for uncomplicated vehicles. Prices are just too high, dial it back to the basic feature set, I'm not saying nuke it all, but at least let me easily turn on and off the extended features like lane keep and preemptive braking / collision avoidance. \n\nLastly let's just get over this standoff with the infotainment, I know it's more than anyone wants to spend, I know automakers want to own it but dudes you lost. We all just want a blank screen there that displays our phone nav and music. Auto is 20 years behind in software, just pay android and apple for an interface already.\n\nNeither of these will happen but if they did I think it would sell incredibly well. For reference I drive a WRX mostly because it has stayed low tech.",
