  "title": "Not sure I understand the value of Reddit as a publicly traded company?",
  "score": 153,
  "selftext": "Reddit has been around for a very longtime, since 2005 as a matter of fact, and yet all this time... it has never been profitable.\n\nI see that Reddit's stock (ticker: RDDT) is up **18.48%** at the time of posting since its initial public offering, and after perusing the internet and this sub-Reddit in particular, I noticed that a lot of people have a lot of hope that for some reason, Reddit is just all of a sudden going to start making a profit soon to justify its kind of wacky current valuation.\n\nI know most of you are living in this current environment like me, and think 20 plus valuation multiples are the norm, but sadly... they are not. Especially for a company like Reddit, that keeps on creating and scrapping different ways to become profitable.\n\nBesides the management of the company being completely greedy and incapable of doing their jobs, I would like to point out a few of their past and current failures to profitability:\n\n* Reddit has and always will be a place for people to express themselves anonymously, the key word there being anonymous, so if they someday decide to take that away from us users in the pursuit of profits, I could see half if not more abandoning the platform entirely.\n\n* Most of us power users still use \"Old Reddit\", because the \"New Reddit\" looks, feels, and operates like total crap. Oh, and the telephone application, assuming it's working, is total crap as well. Without converting us, they have no chance of making money off of us, which makes me sadly think that the board of directors will eventually make the call to end \"Old Reddit\".\n\n* Coins were fun, and we were able to earn them without putting our credit cards into the Reddit system, thanks to other generous Redditors awarding our content, which some awards came attached with the gift of Reddit Coins... which again were awesome! We would use these coins to purchase awards for other users, and the pay it forward effectiveness was second to none, and really made me feel good. Sadly... this all got scrapped.\n\n* Fast forward a little while after awards and coins were gone, and then we get the much hated \"super upvote\" that nobody asked for. These things literally have to be paid for one transaction at a time, and I believe the cheapest \"super upvote\" is $1.99. Besides most Redditors not wanting to give up their anonymity, who is going to make 10's of 100's of transactions a day on their credit cards just to award their favorite content creators?\n\n* Then they created the contributor program, which totally forces Reddit users to give up their anonymity assuming they want to capitalize on this new pay for content model. First though, you have to qualify, and I will let you go look at the requirements for qualification, but I could assure you... most of us will never qualify, and even if we do, we'd make like $4.00 a month, and won't get paid out until we meet a certain threshold no doubt.\n\n* Then recently, Reddit and the team decided to bring back awards... well like 20 of the 1,000's that used to exist anyway and married them into their new created contributor program. So, with this means is that if you're not a contributor, which again you would have to give up your anonymity and pass the gauntlet of qualifying to become a contributor, you get nothing at all for your rewards. Why would anyone pay Reddit for awards that only really help them? At least before some of the rewards came along with free Reddit Premium subscriptions or Reddit Coins, but now... they do nothing for \"non-contributors\", so who cares?\n\nAnyway, that's all I got for now. I really love Reddit, but sadly, whenever companies go public, they tend to go full regard, which makes me sad... because soon we may lose our beloved Reddit due to the pursuit of year over year gains.\n\nAre there any positives to any of this, because I would really like to hear what they are in the comments... thanks!",

Its legit just a money sink. +100m.\n\n146m paying ceo and directors for no benefit is just laughs. \n\n365m on reddit coins is also laughs. Its not just reddit coins, but like you said, many many failures. Stop trying and its a big money save. Reddit is burning money here on the off chance they strike gold because they can afford to burn money like this. \n\nThis is what investors see as the bottom line. Anonymous data doesnt matter because they dont need it to know you want stock ads when you browse wsb and the vast majority already doesnt use oldreddit anyway.

However, unregistered users clearly show that there is a lot of unregistered users who are still watching.\n\nThere was a reason many of the investors at the investor conference were interested in AFK users and the rationale for registered vs. non-registered. It's also why they discussed different strategies, unlike now-traditional click-per-ads.\n\nDays 05/07 AH, 05/13 Pre, 05/14 Pre, 05/17 AH - were likely the big whale investors from firms were a part of the conference cementing the ink on their purchases and thus it drove the price, but it stands to reason the conference was successful as they all scooped a comfortable 49-58 range.\n\nI don't think it's a coincidence the meme rally occurred around the same time either.\n\nJust my take.

Advertising is currently +95% of the revenue and will continue to be a focal point for the business. Reddit historically has not optimized its ads, nor created a great client facing platform for marketers to customize their ads. \n\nThey have been building a much more optimized service for marketers. They have also been advertising a lot themselves lately. Go on Facebook or instagram, Reddit marketing is everywhere. \n\nWith more than 5 billion monthly traffic(3rd highest in US) and the platform with probably the most engagement in the world, Reddit can increase its market share in this significantly.\n\nThere are tons of companies that have build successful products and don’t begin to monetize until much later. \n\n2 is data licensing. While this could grow into a successful, high profit margin business, I think it likely won’t surpass more than 20% of revenue.\n\n3 are the little sprinkles they’re adding. Reddit is trying to build out a marketplace like Facebook or Etsy. There are already tons of people who buy and sell on Reddit. Reddit awards is okay - they are trying to build a “twitch-like” system, but I honestly don’t see this being a small high margin $10-30 million yearly product.",
