          "body": "- Most big tech companies are developing their own in house AI chips to replace Nvidia because they're tired of being gouged on prices. Lots of competitors are also creating products to sell. Nvidia won't be able to enjoy insane margins for long.\n\n- Most AI startups are still losing Billions of dollars, even after launching their products and monetizing them. Unless they find a way to become profitable, it is not sustainable. The value proposition of AI products doesn't exceed the actual cost of the hardware most of the time. Either Nvidia's margins will have to come down, or AI will need to become substantially more computationally efficient for the same price. \n\n- Many large tech companies and AI startups are exploiting an accounting loophole called round tripping to fake growth. Basically, large tech companies agree to invest in these startups on the condition that they buy a ton of their product(AI cloud computing). This circular exchange doesn't create any direct value, but it shows up as revenue and equity method investments on an income statement/balance sheet.\n\n- In the extreme bull case where Nvidia somehow controls the entire economy because they've automated everything with AI, government regulation would probably be brought in to limit or tax their profitability.\n\nYou can't just be right about a bubble to profit, if you are too early, you lose a ton of money to borrowing costs or contract premiums.\n\n The right move is to underweight growth stocks trading at >35x earnings and overweight value stocks.",

China is putting pressure to companies to use domestic AI chips instead of Nvidia\n\n2. Intel doesn't need to produce better chips than Nvidia, they just need to build something that is more cost competitive. Not all AI apps require top of the line performance. Self driving cars? Yeah that will probably require Nvidia. AI customer service chat bots, image generation software? That can easily run on lower end hardware.\n\n>It's literally the same status symbol as Apple.

They're losing money on their services because they charge customers less than the actual costs to lease the hardware. And consumers aren't going to be willing to pay more. The only way these startups will become sustainable is if they find a way to bring costs down- using cheaper hardware is the best way.",
