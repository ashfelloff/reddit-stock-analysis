Ive had auto/home/renters/jewelry policies with them, and use them for banking/loans etc.  they recently sent me a letter regarding a car I’ve owned for a few years that they suspect my coverage should be 15k miles per year.  When I bought the vehicle I listed the usage at 5k because that’s more than what I was driving during Covid days. 3 years of auto-renewals and now I’m driving all across the state for stupid club soccer that my kids insist on playing.  Anyway, the letter states I must check the mileage on the vehicle, fill out a form, sign it, contact a 3rd party company (Veritrust?), and give them the information I recorded. \n\nWhat in the actual fuck? Just call me and say, ‘hey guy that’s given us well into 6 figures over 2 decades, it’s possible you are driving more than you used to and if that’s true will you please update your policy information to reflect, so we can provide the best coverage for your assets.’  Nope.  Some idiot over there thought it would be a good idea to tacitly imply fraud and task me with contacting and sending my personal info to a company I’ve never heard of, with the threat of auto increasing my policy to their estimated mileage if I don’t follow through.  And this is right after they quoted me 33% higher (w less coverage) for a new car than Geico. And that’s just the latest issue I’ve had. Time to part ways.",

When I was younger they were awesome, easy to deal with, great coverage, stand up company. \n\nIt started with them constantly raising their auto rates with no reason or claims. Never had a response as to why the rates were going up when I would call and ask. Still, I stuck with them for a number of years because I knew their service was great and if something happened I knew they'd be there. \n\nBut eventually the premiums just got to be too much.  Then they started fucking around in the banking side as well - limiting the amount I could transfer every day, to the point that I would have to schedule transfers for multiple days to move money around.  I fought them on this, even went up the corporate ladder, and basically no one really cared.  Got no where, and I can transfer 20x more cash daily via Fidelity now than USAA will allow me.\n\nSo I moved my account to Fidelity and never looked back.  I keep $100 in the USAA account because it's a convenient transfer account, but I use them for basically nothing at this point. \n\nCut your losses and move on. It's sad to watch a company you actually liked die, but that's what's happening.",

          "body": "Essentially:\n\n- Banks bought treasury bonds at a low interest rate as a sound investment. You can buy ten dollars worth of treasury bonds with a payback timeline of ten years, and in ten years you’ll get the money back plus whatever the current fed interest rate is.\n- In the last few years, the fed interest rate has increased, meaning the low interest rate bonds are worth less on the open market (why buy a 2% interest rate bond from a bank when you can buy a fresh bond from the treasury department at ~5.5%?).\n- If the banks just hold their bonds to the maturity date, they’re all good and have no losses (which is why they’re referred to as unrealized losses—it’s just potential losses only if they take certain actions which are unlikely because it would be stupid).\n- If interest rates go down in the next few years the bonds become more valuable, increasingly so as the current interest rate gets closer to the rate the banks bought their bonds. If the two rates equalizes then it’s irrelevant. If the current interest rate goes lower than the rate they bought the bonds at originally, than the bonds are more valuable than they were originally, meaning the banks can sell them at a profit.\n\nBasically this article is saying that the banks are fine unless one of them had a banking run occur where enough account holders demanded a withdrawal of all their funds, and the total of that withdrawal exceeds the amount of liquid cash they have on hand. At that point the bank or banks in question would have to liquidate assets (ie sell the bonds discussed above) to cover the liquidity gap to pay out account holders. At that point the unrealized losses would become actual losses and it would hurt the bank. That doesn’t necessarily mean the bank goes belly up, but it’s bad times and the FDIC may step in to cover account holders money (like they did recently for SVB) and the bank itself would be closed or sold to a competitor.\n\nWorth noting that the people running SVB received no special compensation, the bank received no bail out, and the banks assets were sold for essentially pennies on the dollar to First Citizens. You’ll hear a lot of whining about SVB and other banks around that time that closed getting “bailouts” but that’s entirely a lie. Customers deposits were covered (companies and individuals who banked with SVB) but the bank itself was shut canned, taken over, and sold, now operating as a subsidiary of another company.",
