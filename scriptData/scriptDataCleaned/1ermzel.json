That’s also when I went big into the AAPL supplier AVGO, the dividend growth was phenomenal, back then, nice overall capital allocation discipline and still hold it. I don’t day-trade much these days and more a long term guy. I was laughed at in 2003 coaxing clients into AAPL, I was a fresh face college grad and had very little real world experience, other than academia and investing in mutual funds in a custodial account in high school.
