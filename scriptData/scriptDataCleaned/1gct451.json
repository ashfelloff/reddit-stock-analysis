          "body": "Most of it is, yeah. But volume, support residence, and moving averages have some weight, IMO. It's a place people like to buy and a place they want to sell. Moving averages are where your long-term, short-term, and mid-term holders like to buy and sell. When they cross, there's an agreement the price is too low and vice versa. I like riding trend lines and trading with the trend. There's probably more like Vwap, etc. Volume falling and price rising usually indicate that the stock has burnt out and will fall. Long consolidation in a price range usually suggests the stock will break out one way or the other. Patterns like head and shoulders and reverse show where longs couldn't make the price go any higher and can strongly indicate that the stocks will fall. And vice versa, not breaking through strong supports shows the shorts are tired, and it is better to cover now and move to something else. (you want to look at the short interest of a stock). Put call ratio can give you a rough sentiment of how others see the stock. There is value in some of it IMO\n\nI would never enter a trade based on good technicals alone, but I use technicals to time my entries and exits on stocks I like fundamentally all the time . They have their place.",

If a market trend is identified then a bounce off VWAP is often a good entry and stop loss to get into a trade if the market is also bouncing.
