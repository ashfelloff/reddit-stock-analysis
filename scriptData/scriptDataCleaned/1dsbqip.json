These were most likely executed, as volume remains relatively low and stable on the contracts. This implies that on June 25th, an institutions executed ITM calls to re-spark momentum during a downtrend.\n\nIt can be assumed that these options were acquired en masse early in the rally at low prices. It would be more beneficial to the holder of a massive quantity of calls to execute in small orders to drive the price up and continue executing at better prices.",

Aka tighter spreads.\n\nFor example, say JPMorgan executes 100 calls for a $100 stock. Right now, that immediate demand may cause the price to jump anywhere between $2-5 to $102-105 to adjust for uncertainties automatic processing may introduce.\n\nWith regulation, the price would only jump by $1-2 from $100 to $101-102 to account for the increased accuracy of manual processing.",
