(AT ALL TIME HIGHS!)\n\nthen sold [$CEF](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24CEF&src=cashtag_click), [$INOD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24INOD&src=cashtag_click), [$SOFI](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOFI&src=cashtag_click), [$R](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24R&src=cashtag_click), [$MOS](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MOS&src=cashtag_click), [$ETRN](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETRN&src=cashtag_click), [$GLD](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GLD&src=cashtag_click) and [$AAPL](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AAPL&src=cashtag_click). \n\nRemember even though his spouse is the one trading its very obvious his wife trades based on his knowledge. If you think this is false go take a look at Nancy Pelosi's husband. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3rg47be5crc1.png?width=582&format=png&auto=webp&s=d7790d68fb52c3fbb9d5d602b0f0cab657f16da1\n\nI would like to note that last year (5/25/23) carper sold off his Nvidia positions, and up until today did not invest back in. Given that most would say this is the top of Nvidia why would Carper invest back into the stock? Very interesting trading patterns.",

But because of theta decay, if the people who bought those strikes bought it weeks to months ago, they're better off exercising to make a better return vs selling the calls. A call option lets you buy 100 shares of the underlying, people who exercise it will cause the share price to spike as the call option writer are forced to sell their shares to the call option buyer. If it were naked calls, said call option writer has to buy the shares at any price to sell it to call option buyer at the exact strike he exercised, which would jack up the stock price.\n\nBut because of the large amounts of calls bought, market makers and institutional option writers who wrote those calls have more incentive to cause a sell off to lower the price, making those calls worthless. This is especially when put volume is much lower, meaning it's more beneficial to let a few put holders rich vs letting a bunch of call holders make money.",
