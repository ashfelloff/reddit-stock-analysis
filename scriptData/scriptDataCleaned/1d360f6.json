          "body": "It was announced on May 20th, gapped up like almost 30%, then in the following three days it retraced the low on the gap up day, found support, and then yesterday has gapped up again closing higher than the the first gap up day. \n\nThese charts can look funky for small-caps, because there is so much momentum now. The past 10 days Average Volume has been like 10x greater than the whole previous 9 months.\n\nAnyways I think HIMS is a great buy - large potential total addressable market, and a good direct to consumer model for products that will always be in demand.",
