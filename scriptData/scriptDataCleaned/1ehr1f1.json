  "selftext": "Apple reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, with overall revenue rising 5%.  \n\nHere‚Äôs how Apple did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ended June 29: \n\nEPS: $1.40 vs. $1.35 estimated\n \nRevenue: $85.78 billion vs. $84.53 billion estimated \n\niPhone revenue: $39.30 billion vs. $38.81 billion estimated \n\nMac revenue: $7.01 billion vs. $7.02 billion estimated \n\niPad revenue: $7.16 billion vs. $6.61 billion estimated \n\nWearables, Home, and Accessories revenue: $8.10 billion vs. $7.79 billion estimated \n\nServices revenue: $24.21 billion vs. $24.01 billion estimated \n\nGross margin: 46.3% vs. 46.1% estimated \n\nApple did not provide formal guidance, although CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri often share information about the current quarter on a call with analysts.  \n\nApple reported $21.44 billion in net income during the quarter, versus $19.88 billion in the year-ago period.  \n\nApple‚Äôs most important business remains the iPhone, which accounted for about 46% of the company‚Äôs total sales during the quarter. While Apple beat LSEG estimates, the product line still declined about 1% on an annual basis to $39.29 billion in revenue.  \n\n‚ÄúOn a constant currency basis, we grew year on year. And so that‚Äôs sort of how we look at it from an operational point of view,‚Äù Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC‚Äôs Steve Kovach.  \n\nCook said that while Apple doesn‚Äôt know about the positive sales impact from its newly announced Apple Intelligence service until it starts shipping to customers later this fall, he said that Apple had been increasing spending to get the service ready.  \n\n‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve done is we‚Äôve redeployed a lot of people on to AI that were working on other things,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúFrom a data center point of view, as you know, we have a hybrid approach. So we both have our own and we partner with people. And so that capex would be in the partners‚Äô financials, and we would be paying expense.‚Äù \n\n‚ÄúCertainly embedded in our results this quarter is an increase year over year in the amount we‚Äôre spending for AI and Apple intelligence,‚Äù Cook continued.  \n\nApple showed strongest growth in its iPad division, which grew nearly 24% year-over-year to $7.16 billion in sales. Apple released new iPads during the quarter for the first time since 2022, which spurred a wave of upgrades. \n\nCook said that about half of iPad buyers haven‚Äôt owned one before, suggesting the tablet market is not yet saturated. \n\nApple‚Äôs Mac division reported $7 billion in sales, up about 2% from the year-ago quarter.  \n\nApple Watch sales, headphones such as Beats or AirPods, and HomePod home speakers are reported under ‚ÄúWearables, Home, and Accessories.‚Äù Sales in the catch-all category declined 2% to $8.10 billion during the quarter.  \n\n‚ÄúA whopping two thirds of the Apple Watch buyers were new to the product. So, we‚Äôre still growing that base significantly,‚Äù Cook said.  \n\nThe Services business is most important growth category for Apple and includes hardware warranties, revenue from Google, monthly cloud storage subscriptions, and the company‚Äôs content subscriptions, such as Apple TV+. The company reported $24.21 billion in Services sales, up 14% and in-line with Apple‚Äôs forecast and LSEG estimates. \n\nApple said in a statement that it had more active devices in each of its regions than it ever had before, without providing a specific number. Apple‚Äôs active device count is important because it signifies a group of existing Apple customers to which it can sell its profitable services. Apple said in February that it had 2.2 billion active devices.  \n\nApple said it had 1 billion paid subscriptions, which includes subscriptions to iPhone apps through Apple‚Äôs App Store.  \n\nHowever, Apple sales declined 6% to $14.72 billion in greater China, a region that also includes Taiwan and Hong Kong. Apple is under pressure in mainland China as local rivals such as Huawei introduce competing products.  \n\n‚ÄúMainland China and Greater China actually had a record in the iPhone install base,‚Äù Cook said. ‚ÄúKantar tells us we had the top three selling smartphones in urban China and the results in China represent an acceleration from the first half of the year.‚Äù \n\nApple said it spent $32 billion on dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/apple-aapl-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",
