That also ignores the conversation of competition. Back in the day it was pretty much just Microsoft and Apple. Apple almost didn't make it at all, so quite literally zero competition. Now you have a range of chip makers, all doing pretty well and carving out their niche. The market has steep competition, and the leader now isn't necessarily the leader tomorrow.
