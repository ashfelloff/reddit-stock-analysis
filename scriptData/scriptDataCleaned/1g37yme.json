Instead of having to sell euros to buy dollars, and both of us paying taxes on all ends.\n\nI'm still not interested because I want my money to be as stable and reliable as possible, and this shit goes to being worth 70k to 30k back to 50k like it's normal.\n\nUntil it's stable, to my understanding, it's just another thing people buy thinking it will go up, and the only reason it's going up it's because people are buying it.\n\nSounds reasonable, but nothing of value is being created, it just keeps creating bag holders who buy at the top",
