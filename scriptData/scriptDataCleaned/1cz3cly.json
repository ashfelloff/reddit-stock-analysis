I have a couple hundred dollars in calls (sorry it's not tens of thousands, I'm just not that much of a degenerate gambler,) and a significant portion of my portfolio is CHWY. Not going to waste my time having AI write a cringy DD to rally support for this earnings, but the fundamentals are good and I think it's very much a slept on stock. I'm not even saying it's going to do well this earnings, but not going long on it at this price is a massive missed opportunity. Not to mention my anecdotal experience of every pet owner I know using the service while also being a rabid fan of it-- something becoming more and more rare with tech and retail. I expect it to start picking up steam from here on out. The company is also perfect buyout material if the price makes steady gains in the next year or two.\n\n\nI like the stock.",
