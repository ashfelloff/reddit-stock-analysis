Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality it’s stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.\n\nThis is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that don’t exist.\n\nIs it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, it’s true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports: \n\n- Trading: +10.7% y/y and +43.5% for 2Q24, and for 1H24 +11.6% y/y and +44.2% for two years (further in the sequence shown).\n\n- Medical: +38.9% and -22.2% / -19.5% and -44.9% (!)\n\n- Consumer Discretionary: -23.6% and -2.1% due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss / -8.7% and +0.7%.\n\n- Industrials: +4.4% and +4.7% / -9.3% and +10.3%.\n\n- Commodities and utilities: -13% and -52.1% / -21.1% and -33.9% (!)\n\n- Transportation and communications: +37.5% and +0.1% / +10% and -5.8%.\n\n- Technology: +22.8% and +38.9% / +30.7% and +24%.\n\nThese data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative (medical, raw materials and transportation, communications), two are in the zero (consumer discretionary and industrials) and only two sectors are in the plus (technology and trade due to Amazon).\n\nThere are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai (look it up).",
