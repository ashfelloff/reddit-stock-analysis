Based on the other commenter, a bagger is a break even then $10 -> $10 based on multiplication (1bagger = 1x and 10bagger = 10x), which aligns with a 10bagger going from $10->$100.\n\nPeople literally change the language on this all the time because no one is consistent in what they mean.\n\nEdit: I realized why no one is consistent.
