With that kind of setup unless you know the person is entirely on the up and up you shouldn't invest there because any real problems you find out about will have been going on for awhile and your concerns will likely be brushed aside. Other investors in the company are effectively poor guests looking for table scraps after this guy has done whatever he wants. If he was a saint that wouldn't be a problem. He isn't a saint though. The people with shares right now are likely wanting out, but are stuck with taking a big loss or they have to ride it out. That has to suck. \n\nWith all that in mind who wants to buy those shares? Thats why the price is so low and will remain low. This fine wont change that. they could have charge him a couple hundred million or nothing at all and it wouldn't make that share price move a huge amount at this point. \n\nThe only thing that would save that stock is if he fully retired and let someone buy the company out. then the price would spike up based upon the terms he got for the sale.
