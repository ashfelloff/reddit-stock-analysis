This will be especially true on inflation adjusted basis (and it will be trivially true on quality-adjusted basis) but given how quickly we are improving battery tech - it will also be true on nominal basis for the next 2-3 years. ",

Ice and EV ownership is very much dependent on how you charge your car. And your power prices. Whatever cost differences in EV favor will surely be eaten up by insurance costs. It's almost always a wash or an insignificant amount of savings.",

EV prices are dropping because they are not selling and piling up in holding lots. Also lithium fires are incredibly dangerous and impossible to extinguish with water.",
