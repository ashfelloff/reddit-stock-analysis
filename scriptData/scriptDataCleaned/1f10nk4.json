When a company doesn't have money then they start giving stocks to employees (I got over $200K worth RSUs this year). Company buys these stocks under *buy back* plan only to give to employees to save their cash pile.       \n\n#####Overall this is even a higher cause of concern that company is trying hard to save cash as much as possible.     \n\nMaybe you might never see so much insider buying of stocks for Apple or Nvidia.

If they go down a bit more it might be worth the gamble on with a couple thousands, in a few years it might come back. \n\nLet‚Äôs also consider that data centers and contracts don‚Äôt change chips or expire in 4 months. We need years before we see AMD actually substituting Intel in a real way. \n\nAll I see is a lottery ticket, that in my opinion can have higher chances due to the market share and history. Too big to fail doesn‚Äôt apply, but it also slows it down a bit, maybe enough to keep it alive. \n\nIn this sub, I assume your ‚Äúinvesting‚Äù translates to short term positions, like couple years max and not actual investing. \n\nSo it‚Äôs kind of what I look for, a big company gone to shit that can make it back, red means buy, when it goes back to green I will sell. \n\nSo I ask, why shouldn‚Äôt I gamble in Intel right now?",
