              "body": "I don't have a position, but I'd guess a lot of profit taking premarket. Right now it's at 239 overnight, up 12% from close. Interestingly that's about what it was at the Robotaxi event.\n\nDoesn't mean it will fall, just wondering how many people want to buy in at 240 that weren't already in? I'd guess it settles somewhere in the middle, maybe 230ish as a floor? That's still like 8% up from the close tonight and I think would be attractive.\n\nFor those that have options, that means selling at real market open or after. So IV drop, plus possibly a quick dip on \"sell the news\" at open, and I'm not sure if you'd want to put in an overnight limit order or wait for the rebound. We've been running these 260 to 270 peaks and then back down under 200 for over 18 months now. Maybe this is another.\n\nIf these were mine, I'd put a reasonable limit order I was happy with to sell at open (maybe $18?), if I don't get it, I'd wait for the rebound.\n\nHonestly if I knew what was going to happen though, I would have made a lot of money tonight.\n\nTSLA be crazy.",
