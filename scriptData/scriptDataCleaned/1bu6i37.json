There also seems to be a bit of confusion from a few of the comments. I am only up 18k as of now. Gain/Loss is equal to Total Profit/Loss on Schwab.\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nA few months ago I became convinced TSLA  was heading into the toilet not because of TSLA itself, but because I had been invested in the trainwreck dividend ETF TSLY. After my experience in TSLY, I knew TSLA   was doomed.\n\nSince the beginning of March I have thrown everything I have into TSLA puts. There have definitely been some ass-clenching nervous moments where I have been tens of thousands of dollars in the red, such as Jpow's rate cut announcement and Elon's cringey price hike stunt.\n\nBut with the utterly horrid/wonderful Q1 delivery report, it seems I am finally seeing the light and my thesis that TSLA is an overvalued dogshit car company is finally being validated\n\nI have dabbled  with covered calls and cash secured puts before, but this is actually my very first pure put play, and a very big boy one at that.\n\nLooking for any any and all advice on how to proceed with this play.\n\nIdeally I think Id hold until what will be a guaranteed earnings disaster and sell the day after, but I am worried about IV Crush, theta decay, etc.\n\nAny thoughts, input, advice is welcome.\n\nUPDATE: i sold Friday 4/5 for $30k profit. Essentially when the price was $164\n\nA bit sad bc if i had sold at the floor of $160 i would have made $100k profit. \n\nBut, I was thinking the price would go even lower and of course wasnt expecting Elons tweet pumps to raise the price up so quickly",

I bought some puts on it last summer, unfortunately I didn't throw a lot of $ at the position so they were wayyyy out of the money so I'm just now breaking even.
