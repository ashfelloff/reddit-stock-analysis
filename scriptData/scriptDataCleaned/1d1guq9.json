It is an extraordinary investment of engr manpower, supplier coordination, and raw capital firepower to pursue such a thing and right now it just isn't a wise decision to pursue full bore for Boeing.\n\nGet the ship back upright before moving it anywhere.\n\nAs for market share, it is what it is - I don't see Boeing for the next few decades reclaiming lost market share both due to majority legacy product offering capabilities vs Airbus newer offerings, as well as Airbus' buoyed war chest being able to be deployed towards their own new airplane mod programs should Boeing telegraph an intent. Boeing should not aim for clawback/increases in market share as a prime directive - Boeing has always been very good on delivery rates in the past years pre-debacle, and their factory intake / production systems are mature - get the delivery rates back on quality and to a decent output and let the cash flow.\n\nIf they can get the delivery rate and thus the cash flow back to some level appreciable positive / above break even, then they can start entertaining at some future point a private investment case/hunt for preferred funding for the next big thing (not too much unlike the successful 747 program backstory of more).\n\nAnd yes, agreed with what I think is majority opinion that significant introspection needs to be done with respect to the current company leadership and board.",
