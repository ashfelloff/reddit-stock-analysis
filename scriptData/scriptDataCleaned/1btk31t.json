  "selftext": "In November of 2021, I lost over 20k in a week not knowing what I was doing. Stopped trading after that. Until the itch came back. I happened to stumble over a DD of DJT and thought he’s right. So I bought calls before merger and closed them the day after IPO =30k profit. Bought puts on Thursday, and closed today trying not to get greedy which resulted in 8k profit. However making these kind of gains kind of spoils me. And I’m scared to have this much trading power. Maybe I just go on vacation or something. Any advice for an amateur trader who is truly regarded would be much appreciated.\n I needed $100k to close on an investment property but became not liquid after a few things went south so tried to trade my way to the down payment. But I was allowed an extension on property and we close Friday. What a wild ride. It was fun, I think im done.",

Given many trials and them all being random, the value will tend towards the average. \n\nFor example, if we represent 0 as tails and 1 as heads, the expected value of a series of coin tosses is 0.5 (average between the two). Now, if I only toss the coin a few times, the average of my tosses might be different from 0.5 assuming each coin is fair. But if I toss it millions of times, the average of my coin tosses will **almost certainly** be 0.5. \n\nSame thing here. When you randomly trade, your expected value is 0. Every time you lose 5%, you need to make more than 5% to break even. But losing 5% is just as likely as making 5% resulting in losses over time, which is why the expected value is 0. \n\nWith a few trades, you might make a lot. But over time, if each trade is a complete guess and random, over time you are bound to make 0 dollars and lose everything. This is the real reason why almost all traders lose over time, and when they do win, it’s ultimately because of direct insider trading or identifying a pattern or time that other people follow to buy or sell (which is making your trades not guesses anymore).",
