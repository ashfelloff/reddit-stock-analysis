They do not say \"they're too volatile to track\", they track them all the same. Also, neither healthcare nor housing is excluded from either of the two main numbers they report. There are even more exclusive numbers, but core and headline, the ones that get all the attention, absolutely contain both of those things.\n\nNow onto the other thing I want to yell at you about: THE HEADLINE INFLATION NUMBERS ARE LOWER THAN THE CORE NUMBERS.\n\nThose core numbers you're complaining about? Yeah, those are the worse inflation picture. The all-inclusive numbers are lower. Food and energy, the things actually excluded from the core numbers, are rising slower than the average.\n\nQuit getting your information from conservative TikTok or whichever equally idiotic source you've been getting it from.
