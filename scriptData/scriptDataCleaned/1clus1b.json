I'm not checking this regularly, I'm not emotionally attached to whatever it does...\n\nI'm playing for it to sharply drop <<50 within the next 1.5 years. Why would I take profits if it's hovering at 100 for reasons unrelated to the fundamentals? That is a whole different play, which would've required a different entry and sizing.\n\n\nLook at your comment, your point is that if you time the market right in the time-frame of weeks/months you can be a profitable 'investor'.
