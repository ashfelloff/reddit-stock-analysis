The main concern is that let's assume for a second the most bullish case we can for AI - that it indeed did create so much better recommendations that it was the cause for more growth, betters ads, and better returns and there were no other factors like business cycles or any consumer behavioral changes. Even then it would still be suspect if spending billions more would create better ads or recommendations after that, ie can it keep scaling indefinitely... and is it worth spending billions of dollars for brand new chips, or is what you bought last year still fine AND do you in fact need to buy even more chips than you did last year. Nvida IS a great company, but blindly believing it will DEFINITELY accelerate growth and continue accelerating growth when most of it's customers are the extremely large cap tech companies (ie they can't find new large customers like that every day), is delusionally optimistic.",
