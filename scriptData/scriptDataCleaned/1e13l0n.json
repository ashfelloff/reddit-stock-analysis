  "selftext": "hello everyone today i will be showing you my options experience. walk with me...\n\nmy theory was that if i found a way to trade the market open, reliably, from my phone, at work, i could quit this dogshit and do something i really wanna do. like, if i started with $2k, and got ~5% a day, it would take me roughly 80 trading days to get to $100k \n\nstarted with 25k to avoid PDT, solved that by losing 22k within 2 weeks because i had no risk management and no fucking brain lol. switched to cash account. then just kept trading the open, scalping, 10-20% on $1k type shit, for months. only SPY, 0DTE, btwn 930-1030am. eventually i started to become one with the market. my monthly chart was lookin like STAIRCASE DOMAIN EXPANSION [in comments]. u can see i almost kinda made a comeback there.\n\nunfortunately overconfidence hit, along with the second plane, rage trading. emotional gamer, emotional trader. also two car accidents. after everything, ended up giving all my bread and then some back to the market. sadly, i have not been able to return to my peak form. i feel like its possible though. im just limited by being a human with emotions, and also trading robinhood on the phone FUCKING SUCKS.\n\nanyway since then i have quit robinhood options on mobile and moved on to tradestation futures on pc üôÇ profitable by like $200 so far - its a better experience. i realize now that trading on robinhood mobile is a troll move, and if i want to learn the infinite wealth glitch then i have to move differently. smarter. with more aura.\n\ni will return wsb. once i have mastered the staircase jutsu .",
