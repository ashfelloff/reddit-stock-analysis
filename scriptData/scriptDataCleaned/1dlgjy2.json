          "body": "Building and launching rockets successfully is a phenomenally profitable industry. Currently for private companies there are exactly three options, ULA (joint-Boeing/lockheed venture), spacex (not public) and RKLB. If you’re looking for a space play that’s without Boeing’s issues or not mostly defense contracting it’s your only option. Plus they have an intriguing pipeline for their neutron rocket and plans for man-rating. Every other space launch play is basically embryonic at this point ; rklb has us govt contracts and a track record",

              "body": "Pretty much what he said, especially with Boeing and ULA.  I believe Rocket Lab has incredible potential because the space industry is on the brink of a massive boom. With future possibilities like asteroid mining, moon bases, and hotel space stations, the opportunities are immense, even if they're a long way off. Rocket Lab has launched 50 rockets, the majority in the last two years—an impressive feat matched only by SpaceX. While other small players like Firefly, Blue Origin, Relativity Space, Astra, and Stoke Space are either still in development or struggling financially, or just like to ride the Carmen line (bezos) Rocket Lab stands out with its proven track record and innovative approach. This makes it a compelling choice for my investment. I also believe it's incredibly undervalued right now.  Relativity 3d printed rockets have launched one rocket, and their valuation is like 4.5b. Blue Orgin 3.4b SpaceX 180b. If RKLB does even half that, in 10 years, it's a 3650% gain.",
