Your wins with META and XOM were completely different and I think many would agree even when they bottomed. This INTC play is pure regarded. You might make some money with a bounce back to 30s but I don‚Äôt think INTC even have a remote chance to tripling or more. List a few things that fundamentally against this play:\n- INTC has lost a lot of market to AMD in their traditionally dominant space and they are unlikely to catch up as the company is slow at its core to bring products to market\n- INTC is losing the nm chip race, they promise to catch up by 2027 with the 1.4nm, but their competitors are already ahead of them and more likely deliver faster\n- General compute arch is moving towards ARM architecture, AMD making more strides here. All the tech giants developing their own chips, and the demand for ARM will increase with more IoT device demand, apart from the smart phone and tablets today.\n- PC sales decline and windows now supports ARM architecture. The need for intel chip x86 is slowing and they know this. You‚Äôre betting now that intel will change course, which I don‚Äôt think can materialize in two years to set up the supply chain for its rebrand. Not to mention, the ARM space already is hyper competitive, the growth potential for INTC to copy is just not reasonable.\n\nAll in all, perhaps you‚Äôll make money on a bounce. But the company is a huge laggard in the tech lifecycle. You will need to place a big bet that INTC completely invents something new in order for this company to turn itself around",

Not sure what‚Äôs up with their fans but they have had a product advantage for like 5 years and their market share is trash. When Intel regains process leadership next year, it‚Äôs over for them.\n\n2. Intel regains process leadership with 18A which goes into production in 1H of 2025\n\n3. ARM threat is wildly overblown. Only thing arm dominates are phones driven by Apple. Intel will be making arm chips in their fabs anyway\n\n4. Again ARM has little to no market share in client outside of Apple (and Apple has a tiny market share). If non Apple ARM cpus have more than 10% market share in client by 2030 I would be blown away\n\nI don‚Äôt think you realize how dominant Intel is in many of these spaces. The only reason arm exists is because Intel turned down Steve Jobs for the iPhone. They are a beast of a company with incredible IP.",

Maybe Microsoft have improved the emulation as well, not so sure about that.\n\nWhat I know is that app was basically unusable on a Surface Pro X with the old QC chip that I test drove back in 2020. \n\nThis is the first windows ARM laptop that I feel I would be able to daily drive. The battery life leaves the Elitebook in the dust. \n\nIntel may indeed have an answer with 18A but there have been so many promises and delays over the years, I'm basically at the \"I'll believe it when I see it\" stage with them.
