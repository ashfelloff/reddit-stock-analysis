It's not just about money (although of course, it certainly helps to have money - but remember, you can always get more). The thing that truly matters friend, is our relationships with each other.  Our loved ones and our friends. Even the rest of us idiots in this sub. It's about fellowship. Let's party it up while we can! And to be clear, \"party\" in this context doesn't mean cocaine and hookers. It just means finding the little things in life you enjoy. It's all about the small stuff. So you lost a chunk of money. Ok. But you can still walk out into the woods and feel the wind and sun on your face. Go hike up a mountain and look out over the world. Watch the cloud shadows chase each other across the land. Better yet, do it with a friend. Or just hang out. Visit family.  Everyone has their thing; you just need to find yours. \n\nJust so you know, we've all had our low moments. Nobody escapes them. I have sat in hospice holding the little body of my first son. That event led to me falling into depression so deep that my wife left me. More devastation. I only mention this to let you know I came out on the other side and now live a happy life. The way you get through hard times is you focus on what you still have. For me it was the little things I mentioned before. I wish you luck and genuinely hope you can find your way through your current struggle.
