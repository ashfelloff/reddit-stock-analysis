It makes good money.  And sometimes, John himself will hand deliver the socks - he’s an absolute electric factory!\n\nThey do great work, it’s a real business and the socks are pretty sick.  The Dad does a lot of public speaking at both business and not-for-profits events\n\nIt’s one of the highest regarded (actually regarded, not slang) companies on Long Island.  I’d encourage you all to check them out.",
