Thanks to the compound interest Google has now racked up a fine which the Russian judge on Monday called ‚Äòa case in which there are many, many zeroes‚Äô. There are so many zeroes, in fact that the total fine amount completely dwarfs global GDP, which the World Bank estimates at about $100trillion.\n\nIn its most recent earnings statement, it said: ‚ÄòWe have ongoing legal matters relating to Russia. ‚ÄòFor example, civil judgments that include compounding penalties have been imposed upon us in connection with disputes regarding the termination of accounts, including those of sanctioned parties. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material adverse effect.\n\n",

In the U.S. military, pilots make up approximately 4-5% of active-duty personnel in the Air Force. If we estimate that around 5% of veteran employees at Google might be former pilots, we could end up with a range of about 240-320 former military pilots. In the U.S., only around 1,500‚Äì2,000 pilots are qualified to fly the F-35. This estimate suggests that about 2-6 Google employees might have the qualifications to fly an F-35.",
