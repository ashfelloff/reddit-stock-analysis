  "selftext": "Currently, the stock is down 36% from ATH. It's already turned around, though, at a support level of $72, as it did a few times in the past.\n\nIMO, Starbucks is simply an established household name. There may be some competitors in the US and elsewhere, but everywhere I've ever been, Starbucks is immensely popular. The lone fact that so many people are willing to spend $5-6 on a daily cup of coffee makes me optimistic on the brand, given that quality homemade coffee comes in at mere cents per cup.\n\nMy thoughts are that it doesn't have much downside at the moment. It yields a 2.84% dividend, and on another note, they recently announced a boba drink. Personally, I'm bullish on boba after visiting Cambodia.'\n\nEdit: I'm not buying it because of boba (hence the other reasons mentioned) but I do like me some balls in my drink",

Was happy to get long there but I was surprised and wasn‚Äôt expecting such a punishment after ER last month. I‚Äôm almost even in P&Ls and am comfortable with the position currently. What I do worry about, however, is employee satisfaction. From what I can tell, admin *thinks* they treat employees well. They do have good pay and other comp IMO. Baristas start at 18-19$/hour and they have an excellent 401k match that is managed by Fidelity, and all employees have option to purchase SBUX at discount from payroll deduction. That being said, they seem to be unhappy. Every time I‚Äôm in a shop they are super friendly, but looking a r/Starbucks they seem to be pretty overwhelmed, understaffed, and stressed. (Some of this has to do with customers being complete assholes).  I think SBUX needs to fix that.  But otherwise I don‚Äôt see the drop off in customers and ‚Äúempty‚Äù cafes that other commenters are mentioning. All my local cafes (I commonly patronize three in my city) are pretty busy.  I hope you‚Äôre right that various new drink options will spark increased numbers. But I hope it doesn‚Äôt lead to attrition of stressed employees.  Edit: I have some BROS in retirement accounts that is a long term hold. And I like that company too, however  personally disagree that you should get long BROS at these prices in place of SBUX. BROS coffee quality is pretty bad IMO, and a PE ratio of ~200 is kind of absurd for a drive through coffee shop. It‚Äôs true though that they are growing substantially and they are always busy as well, and I‚Äôm sure overhead is way lower than SBUX. It‚Äôs not a bad idea but I personally wouldn‚Äôt jump ship on SBUX for BROS. Maybe split the difference ü§∑",

          "body": "I'd like to propose an idea to you, which I heard about awhile back. A few years ago, I was deciding a restaurant to go to, and was looking at reviews. I was confused why I couldn't seem to find one with a solidly high rating. So I started thinking, did some research, and realized a general rule of that kind of stuff. Essentially, people who are dissatisfied with something are FAR more likely to post a review or say something on reddit (or elsewhere) than people who are happy. I also learned this when I worked for DoorDash. Maintaining ratings was difficult because I constantly had to remind those who were happy to leave a review, while those who were not would leave one of their own accord. I see what you're saying about dissatisfied employees, based on what you've seen on the Reddit. However, I'd suggest you balance that with the fact that you regularly see workers who appear happy in the store. The appearance doesn't necessarily mean they are, but in the fast food and drink business, I've found that many workers don't bother putting on airs. Anyways, TL;DR: complainers will complain online more often than happy people will say happy things, esp about work. I would be hesitant to say Starbucks employees are generally unhappy, based on social media.",

Starbucks adding more traditional boba drinks will certainly give them sales, but its like getting a breakfast sandwich there. Feels prepackaged (because it is), tastes ok, and youre just getting it because theres no other better option on your way to your class lol (though I do F with their double smoked breakfast sandiwch and bakery items). Edit: Either way starbucks wont die, they have their controversies, they have their bad drinks, lets not talk about their overseas eastern strategy which at worse will stay how it is now lol. Its a company you know will always be there for when you need your 100g of sugar in a 10oz drink.",
