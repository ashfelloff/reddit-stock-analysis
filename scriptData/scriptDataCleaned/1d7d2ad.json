              "body": ">iv crush\n\nMore volatility = bigger moves on the price of contracts. \n\nIf you buy an option on a day when volatility is very high and you hold it  overnight and the next day volatility is very low then your option will automatically lose value even if the stock moves in the direction you predicted.\n\nBest example is buying an option the day before earnings and holding until the day after. It almost always will lose value no matter what the stock does.\n\n\n>low volume\n\nYou can buy a call option and the stock price goes up. Great so you made money right? Well someone still has to buy that call from you. If there is no one to buy it then you'll have to sell it for less. If demand is super low then you won't be able to sell it for a profit.",
