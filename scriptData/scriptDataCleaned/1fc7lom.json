  "selftext": "Hey yall - wanted to run this by you...\n\nBeen investing for a few years now, not nearly enough of an expert but know my way around.\n\nI have a few positions (Tesla, Spotify, etc) that I have gains of about 20-30% on. Iâ€™ve been thinking about cashing them out and putting them in VOO to lock them in while giving them the opportunity to grow as well.\n\nDoes this make sense? I still would invest regularly into these individual stocks as I pretty much do recurring buys weekly but is this a good way to lock in gains? Any other recommendations?",

But they aren't even the highest-level autonomous brand anymore.\n\n\nI wish I could believe him about their robots; that is truly the next world-changing revolution.
