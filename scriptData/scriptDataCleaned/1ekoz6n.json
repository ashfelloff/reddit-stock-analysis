Combined with the free trades above, and now timing the market doesn't matter, you're just taking the average, and on average the market goes up. Take profits no more than a couple times a year, and use them to buy up Treasury bills on treasurydirect.com. Once the combination of the above two matches about 6 months of your salary, and you're more familiar with the movement of the market as a whole, you can start developing your own trading strategy to supplement the above, or just feed more into it and keep the cycle going.\n\nWhatever you do though, never bet more than 10% of your ready cash on anything you see in here, ever.
