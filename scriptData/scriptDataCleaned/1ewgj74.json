  "selftext": "To begin with, Nubank offers free transfer and maintenance fees. It provides digital banking for areas that has potential to grow ( Mexico, Brazil, and Latin America) and has the same digital presence as Bank of America.\n\nThe whole point of Nubank is to provide services for lower socioeconomic demographics ( poor to common people).\n\nCEO: David Velez : excaped from violence from drug cartels in Columbia. He went to Stanford university to study and then return to South America. In the following years, he saw that five big banks in Brazil dominated the market which resulted in radically high fees and developed Nubank.\n\nGood customer services, beat earning, revenue for quarter 2, 2024.\n\nGood analyst raiting current price $14.450, JP morgan raised target to $15, Barclays set price expectation to $17.\n\nOverall, I can see a consistent growth in this firm. Not gonna make you 4X overnight but it can make you 4x over 1 week consistently.\n\nPosition:\n\nNew call: 29 options at $14.5 due date 30/08/2024 bought at $0.29 per option\n\nTest call 23/08/2024 bought 1 call options on 14/08/2024 last week at $0.22 an then it rose to $1.07\n\nI would also want to add that daddy Warren Buffet invested in this firm so the confidence of big boy financial institutions in America in Nubank is incredibly high.",

They also were the first to offer high yield savings account paying 100% of the CDI of Brazil (\\~10% fixed income) and by MONTH (yes, they pay interest by month and not yearly).\n\nThis has shaken the industry and made several traditional banks pursue digital products and better fees/interfaces in their apps. This also attracted other competitors like Revolut, Mercado Pago (from MELI), etc.\n\nWhat I like about NU and think they do right is the HEAVY investment in AI and technological INFRA. What they do as a company is miles and miles above Revolut, they also pay a way better salary for their developers and don't over strech then, making NU quite attractive for top talents.\n\nCompared to Itaú, their salaries are match (Itaú salaries are amazingly high) but Nubank has a team nearly Sillicon Valley equivalent. They also have a youtube channel where they share knowledge about IA, Infra and technological decisions: [https://www.youtube.com/@building.nubank/videos](https://www.youtube.com/@building.nubank/videos)\n\nSince they don't have expenses with agencies (being entirely digital), they can offer quite attractive TC packages to held the top talents even from fleeing to US Remote high paying positions.\n\nNow, even saying all that and also being a costumer, I'd not invest in NU (not at this point at least). Their PE is quite high and I highly doubt they can reach the market cap of Itaú anytime soon (336B) trading at PE 10 with NU having a mkt cap of \\~69 trading at PE 46. Pretty much they have reached anyone they could at this point and only chance of growing further is going beyond Latin America.",

But IMO this train has already departed in terms of stock value.\nIf you want to invest in them long term, I can see them expanding outside Latin America to perhaps Africa in 5-10y, but I'd advise to wait for a better entry point. Because they have less operational expenses even if you believe at one point they can reach the market cap of Itaú it's possible they will have a more attractive PE. You just need to take into consideration the big banks are catching up (slowly but surely) and customers are coming to understand the trap Nu sets them for when it comes to credit. Also the overduers are a huge risk since most of them ends up never paying as the debt explodes so quickly, it's also drawing attention from media while some users are raising awareness of the sick practice Nu and other digital banks are doing and I foresee soon a legislation to limit this practice, which would for sure hit hard NU revenue.\n\nWait this and it might be a good entry point. Company has some solid fundamentals and invest heavily into being a better and better product, if they can fix their abusive credit fees and grow slowly into other publics (companies, medium and higher class individuals) while continue expanding to other countries they can grow a lot still, even perhaps surpassing Itaú.",
