We are now at the end of the low season\n3. the uranium spotmarket is an iliquid market without a futures market, so it doesn't react in the same way as investors are used to with gold, silver, copper, oil, ... market.\n\nBut investors are focused on that iliquide uranium spotprice. So in the low season, when activity in the spotmarket is reduced to a minimum, investors become impatient and sell their shares. But the uranium LT price has been increasing month over month without interruption\n\nNow we are about to enter the high season where activity in the uranium market, so in the uranium spotmarket too, will pick up again.\n\nAnd Kazakhstan's announcement just gave the starting shot (uranium spotprice is already increasing today)\n\nCheers",

So when the gas price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to 170... That's what happened in 2022-2023!\n\nThe uranium price only represents \\~5% of total production cost of electricity coming from a nuclear power plant. So when the uranium price goes from 75 to 150, your production cost of electricity goes from 100 to only 105\n\nThat's 1 of the reasons why uranium demand is price INelastic\n\nUtilities don't care if they have to buy uranium at 80 or 150 USD/lb, as long as they get enough uranium and ON TIME\n\nCheers",
