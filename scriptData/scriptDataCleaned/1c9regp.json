  "selftext": "Been thinking about picking up some SMCI and NVDA puts tomorrow at open. I doubt we’ll see the same drop we did on Friday but with market sentiment, it seems highly probable things will continue to drop this week. \n\nHowever, we do have major tech earnings this upcoming week but judging how NFLX beat and still dropped, I think we got a preview of what’s to come. \n\nBut what do I know 🤷‍♂️ those 4/29 SMCI $500p and 4/29 NVDA $550p do look tasty though. I’m sure it’ll be priced in by market open. ",

I've heard puts should be within 30 days because market tendency to move up but here I feel differently. For NVDA I would eye the 6/21 puts (the IV on them is also half). Here's my reason:\n\n- Tech companies really need to deliver and imo other than PLTR, most have a weak AI game. Co-pilot is a disappointment in it current form and other don't have a realistic offering. A lot of them are over valued.\n\n- NVDA is closely tied with everything-AI, you can see how ASML, TSM, SMCI affect it day to day\n\n- SMCI reports a bad earning on 4/30. The non release of pre-earnings already gave a glimpse.\n\n- NVDA reports 5/22 and expectations are massive, so even with good they might under-perform and I feel that would be a miss as well.\n\n- Then comes the economic factors in this time frame up till 6/21. GDP/PCE (Apr 25/26). Fed Interest rate decision May 1. PPI MoM May 14. Inflation MoM May 15. Same indicators in June.\n\n- The middle east war news reports that come have not helped as well\n\n- We are also approaching in that price range vicinity where profit takers would like to pull out (\\~$675, \\~615, $475)\n\nIn all this time-frame there is only one thing that could course correct, that would be the Fed Interest rate decision on May 1. Even with a good tech ER week, market direction will hinge on that.\n\nThe narrative for now still seems to be 2 rate cuts. However, the GDP data forecast for next week is already low at 2.9%. Based on this months inflation data, I dont think the rate cuts can be announced. At best they would postpone and keep them steady which the market is not gonna like.",

When this happens, it usually falls to or around the low of the first leg (bottom of the first shoulder) of the H&S. This would complete the sell off at around 710 to 720. This is where experienced traders will buy. However, there is a random chance it could reverse around 750’s or the over all market recover tomorrow and I reverse back up from here\n\nBe aware of the overall market \n\nIf it continues to the downside, watch for it to complete the H&S while keeping in mind other psychological levels on the way \n\nIf it recovers, watch key levels to the upside, letting it breakout, retest and follow through to the upside buying on the first candle to make the high off that level\n\nLast thing - WEAR A DIAPER AT OPEN ….. peace out",
