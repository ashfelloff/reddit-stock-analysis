  "score": 54,
  "selftext": "**This is not a financial advise.**\n\nAfter hitting CRM and MDB put a couple weeks ago, I promise to myself that I won't play earning anymore because market give, market take. I want to open a long and low risk position to park all my gain. I came across $SHOP last week and stared at their chart for 20 seconds. Shopify's recent earnings report showed a net loss due to the sale of its logistics business, causing a decline in share price. Stock was in oversold territory. IT'S A BUY.\n\n**Balance sheet:** Shopify has more than $5 billion of cash on its balance sheet ($4 billion in net cash, after subtracting out debt), giving it plenty of financial firepower to pursue growth initiatives.\n\n**Business ideas:** Shopify operates a pure software platform that collects fees from merchants. The company is growing its subscription revenue base through Shopify Plus, and as attach rates on add-on services improves, the company will continue to expand its profitability.\n\n**Should you concern about the recent net lose?** While revenues of $1.86 billion surpassed analyst expectations, the company reported a net loss compared to a profit in the same period last year. However, this loss stemmed from a charge associated with the sale of Shopify's logistics business. Additionally, the company anticipates operating expenses to rise at a rate exceeding analysts' predictions. Gross margin is also expected to decrease slightly due to the divestiture of the logistics business. The company also gave a conservative guidance for Q2 2024. We're also in a challenging economy (as a consumer's perspective).\n\n**Technical analysis:** Big support at $55 to $58 that was formed a year ago. Expect the stock to gap up to 75$ price range **slowly.** IV for option is low compare to their historic volatility.\n\n**Position:** August 16 call $75, 14 contracts. I wanted to buy last week, but still a lot of room to run up\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a16bisuvnj6d1.png?width=1344&format=png&auto=webp&s=c40fb6c10511b70aeff55b78d981574821c3c847\n\n",
