  "selftext": "Shares of Tesla popped in premarket trading, after Elon Musk said shareholders are set to approve his controversial $56 billion pay package and a resolution to move the electric carmaker‚Äôs incorporation to Texas.\n\nAt 08:12 a.m. ET on Thursday, Tesla shares were 6.39% higher in premarket trading.\n\nTesla shareholders have been voting on two resolutions and can have their say up to the company‚Äôs annual meeting on Thursday. The first measure under consideration is whether to green light a $56 billion pay package that shareholders originally approved in 2018, before being voided by a Delaware judge in January.\n\nThe second resolution is whether Tesla should transfer its state of incorporation from Delaware to Texas. That proposal was put forward after Musk asked his followers on social media platform X earlier this year whether Tesla should carry out such a move ‚Äî to a resounding yes.\n\nMusk now said that both of these resolutions are currently passing by ‚Äúwide margins,‚Äù without disclosing specifics or his sourcing.\n\nCNBC has reached out to Tesla for comment.\n\nThe initial pay package had aggressive targets for Tesla‚Äôs financial performance and market value ‚Äî and, while the company has turned into one of the world‚Äôs largest electric automakers, a lot has changed since 2018.\n\nTesla is facing slowing growth and increased competition, especially from Chinese players. In that time, Musk also bought Twitter, now called X, and has ramped up focus on other projects, including in his brain computer interface firm Neuralink and artificial intelligence company xAI.\n\nCritics of the pay deal argue that Musk is distracted by his other endeavors, and that the package, the largest in U.S. corporate history, is excessive. More recently, they say that Tesla‚Äôs financial performance has not been up to scratch.\n\nSome notable shareholders have said they planned to vote against the deal, and top proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also recommended this step. The California State Teachers‚Äô Retirement System, a massive pension fund, likewise objected to the package, claiming the sum was too high. Norway‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund has similarly come out in opposition.\n\nShareholders in favor of the compensation argue that Musk is integral to Tesla‚Äôs future success and that the billionaire will take his efforts elsewhere if he is not reimbursed adequately. They claim that the pay package has incentivized Musk.\n\nBillionaire investor and long-time Tesla shareholder Ron Baron said he is voting in favor of the pay package, suggesting that Musk is key to the EV maker‚Äôs future.\n\n‚ÄúAt Baron Capital, our answer is clear, loud, and unequivocal: Tesla is better with Elon. Tesla is Elon,‚Äù he said this month.\n\nSome major investors, such as Vanguard and Blackrock, have meanwhile not said how they will cast their votes.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/elon-musk-says-tesla-shareholders-likely-approved-his-56-billion-pay-deal.html",

We have two possible outcomes here, and it wasn't clear which outcome it was going to be, and one is more bearish than the other. However, depending on how ppl assess it, you are going to get a different answer which one it is. Which means people on both sides of the fence would have been avoiding it when it was **uncertain**. The **uncertainty** of it is a factor in and of itself.",

Tesla is highly unconventional, which requires a CEO with a strong personality and a lot of political capital in the company to enforce.\n\nIf you instituted a new CEO for Tesla, you would have to completely change how its run. Likely, you would have to restructure it to run like a regular car company and so it would be valued like a regular car company(about 75% below its current valuation). You would also have a lot of turnover from people who joined Tesla because its not run like Ford or Toyota.",

No dilution for shareholders.\n\nAlso, nothing of this payment package is paid out from Tesla's balance sheet - even when the shares were created, Tesla effectively paid $0 for those shares as the company is free to create or buy back shares at any time (just as the market is free to price them).\n\nOne more thing - when Elon does exercise his options, that just means he has an OPTION to buy shares at a certain price. He still has to buy them. So if he exercises, he will actually pay $7.1B to Tesla, instead Tesla paying $55B to Elon.
