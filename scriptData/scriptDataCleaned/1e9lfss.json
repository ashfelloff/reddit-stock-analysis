New business is going to take a hit and who knows what their liability will be but I don’t see them going bankrupt over this. The core product is solid and there will be plenty of IT directors who will jump on the discounts the salespeople are going to be throwing around. What I’m saying is, it’s actually smart money to bet on Crowdstrike rebounding from this. I might buy some myself if I feel the bottom or see a steady increase.",
