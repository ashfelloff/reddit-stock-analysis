The zfold is pretty long and sometimes akward to carry, but I like to have the big screen to work on. Some of the apps don't format well. Like insta, sometimes doesn't like the big screen and will stretch awkwardly or stick to one side, leaving the other black. Ultimately, I'd say the Zfold is worth it because it works really well for what I need it to (trading, Word doc, etc.) and idc about social media that much, lol. How do you like the flip?",
