Their credit rating is oscillating between CCC and B, that shit is deep in the junk category, which means they're too risky for most banks and that they're borrowing money at super high interest rates.\n\nSince they try and keep low coupon rates, they're banking on the high implied volatility of the stock by issuing close to the money convertibles.\n\nHere's a recent example : \n\n>September 18, 2024 — MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR) (“MicroStrategy”) today announced the pricing of its offering of $875 million aggregate principal amount of 0.625% convertible senior notes due 2028 (the “notes”).\n\n>The conversion rate for the notes will initially be 5.4589 shares of MicroStrategy class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $183.19 per share.\n\nThis is bad for shareholders because the stock will be diluted at a below market price since these are essentially call options written by the company that are now deep in the money.",

If Bitcoin goes down or sideways, you get a little interest, and their software business can / could service the debt. \n\nBut now their software business is… failing?  They have -$40M cash from operations in the last 9 months.  That includes a boost from $60M of stock compensation Their cash generation is *really* bad.  You can even see this in the issuances their newest notes are convertible PIKs. The only way they could pay cash interest is by raising capital. \n\nHence their convertibles are *just bitcoin exposure* now.  I don’t see how they’re going to sell $20B of them. MSTR is basically a Bitcoin structured product in a c corp instead of an actual investment vehicle. \n\nBut it seems to be working so far, for some reason.",

      "body": "Interestingly, what MSTR is not new. It's just done a little differently. Kinda similar to an older, now bankrupt crypto broker. The crypto broker Voyager once had a sweet platform - Users can earn a ton of interest on your bitcoin and other alt coin holdings. Many probably know this story. They do this by lending your cryto to \"only the most sophisticated and established\" investors at insanely high interest rates. That investor was some rando bank ran out of someones shed in asia somewhere. Voyager lent basically most of it's creditors crypto to this exrtremely risky investor. What did this asian investor do? Bought some shitty alt coin (forget which one actually) that went tits up in a day. Voyager went bankrupt. And all the creditor (including myself) spent the next year trying to get some dinky ass percentage of our money back. Yea, no way in hell this could end badly for MSTR!",
