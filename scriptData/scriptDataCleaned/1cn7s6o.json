More attention -> more buyers -> more volume = stock up. Another reason is people don't want to buy a shell company(spacs) and want to invest in the real company once the merger happens. There are many more different reasons, but what we've seen from dwac was that once it became DJT, news spread about it and it opened up about +30% on the day of the merger.\n\n:Sorry meant to say mutualfunds, not hedge:",
