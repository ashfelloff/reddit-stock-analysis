Your goal is to stay at the table as long as possible without shooting yourself in the face. \n\nThe hard work begins now: you need to start doing serious backtesting on your ideas and be willing to admit when you are wrong instead of being attached to your ideas. \n\n\n“Frankly, I don’t see markets; I see risks, rewards and money”. This is a game of probability. You want to be taking trades that offer you the highest probability of success and reward. \n\nTo be consistent you need a strict set of rules that you ALWAYS follow. No improvising, no deviating. It needs to be tested thoroughly for statistical significance. If you can’t bring yourself to do that then stop trading now. Your money will eventually evaporate as your “system” proves to the null hypothesis over time and your above average returns revert to zero. ",
