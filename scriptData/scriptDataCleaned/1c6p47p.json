Look at last month's non farm payroll if u can't find it here I will copy paste it for u.\n\n\"In March, employment in government increased by 71,000, higher than the average monthly gain of 54,000 over the prior 12 months. Over the month, employment increased in local government (+49,000) and federal government (+9,000).\" \n\nThis is from March alone, what kind of gov hires 71k new workers a month increasing every month. U can look back on the data from Jan it's the same \n\nFederal + gov jobs\n\nJan: 47k\n\nFeb:52k\n\nMarch: 71k\n\nThis is just gov jobs, healthcare jobs are also increasing by 70+k a month which suprise is also highly connected to the federal government.  But u can try to use ur smooth monkey brain to process this as being good for the market, if u think everyone working in gov and gov backed healthcare is good. Then surely u forgot how Greece collapsed in 2006, it's the same with US now Greece overhire on their gov positions in 2006 to prop up its economy everything was perfect. GDP was booming up to 5.7%,  unemployment was moderate, but deficit were high then all their shit came out a few years later and they went bankrupt. \n\nHere are the report for each month go suck on it before u try to correct others, before u try saying oh these are all turn over, promotions or whatever reasoning u have no it's not it's an increase in payroll. Someone new is getting a new federal paycheck and I can assure u this month's gov jobs would most likely increase too, We will see it next month. \n\nThe Employment Situation - January 2024 - Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2024/total-payroll-employment-up-353000-professional-and-business-services-up-74000-in-january-2024.htm%23:~:text%3DTotal%2520nonfarm%2520payroll%2520employment%2520rose,retail%2520trade%252C%2520and%2520social%2520assistance.&ved=2ahUKEwidoqCXhcyFAxUXZ2wGHWQmBX0QFnoECBMQBQ&usg=AOvVaw1xDy6U1R_n6VASMLp86lZH\n\nThe Employment Situation - Febuary 2024 - Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2024/payroll-employment-up-275000-in-february-2024.htm%23:~:text%3DNonfarm%2520payroll%2520employment%2520rose%2520by,ranged%2520from%2520146%252C000%2520to%2520303%252C000.&ved=2ahUKEwjw8LK3hcyFAxWIbmwGHeFcB9AQFnoECA8QBQ&usg=AOvVaw0_f7dDGIdK7aRx-rzWVd8J\n\nThe Employment Situation - March 2024 - Bureau of Labor Statistics\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwie--KjhMyFAxUXZ2wGHWQmBX0QFnoECBIQBg&usg=AOvVaw0El9HPDNwCkjhZ_HvoSxIU\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics (.gov)\nhttps://www.bls.gov › news.release\nEmployment Situation Summary - 2024 Q01 Results\n\nhttps://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm&ved=2ahUKEwi23PfMhcyFAxX8TGwGHc-WDWoQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2j_geF2c5QQJ4zI-QKB5g2",
