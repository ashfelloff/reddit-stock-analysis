  "selftext": "We recently saw an increase of 12,000 jobs, but according to data from The Wall Street Journal, some of these numbers include people counted as employed even though they weren‚Äôt working due to weather-related issues or strikes. After a hurricane, it‚Äôs likely that many people couldn‚Äôt get to work and might soon be filing for unemployment.\n\nAdditionally, WSJ reported that this month saw the lowest survey participation rate in 50 years, suggesting that the data may not be fully accurate and could actually indicate a weaker job market than reported.\n\nWsj article: https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/jobs-report-october-unemployment-economy-f771b682?st=fSBhLW\n\nOn a lighter note, my local bar in New Jersey recently added this deal to its offerings! üòÖ\n\n",
