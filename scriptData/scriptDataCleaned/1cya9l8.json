I had to sell about 70 shares between 2022 and 2023 to make rent a few times, got between 150 (lowest I sold) and 300ish a share, sold maybe 3 batches total in that period. Haven't sold a single share since it rebounded in '23, still holding 120. I had a deathgrip on those shares and was so annoyed that I had to sell the ones that I did when I did.\n\nI'm so SO fucking glad I held my ground when wife was telling me to dump all of it around the 150-175 mark so that we could \"have money to live.\" LMAO\n\nImagine how short-sighted they can be sometimes. 120 shares before the 10:1 is gonna be enough for us to retire on in 20 years.",
