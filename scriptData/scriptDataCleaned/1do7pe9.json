  "selftext": "\n\nAs most people know, taking a loan and gambling with it is super risky. \nThat's why I thought this would be the best place to get some ideas of how you could take advantage of it. \n\n\nI was looking for ideas on how to capitalize on this.\nIf I got a loan of 18k to pay over 18 months (minimum duration) you could invest it all on companies that pay higher dividends than the fees and use your wage to pay the monthly fee of around 1050€. (Around 6.3%)\nWhat other idea do you have, besides calls, or if your only idea was calls how would you go about it?\nAlso open to discussion of other moves with loan money you might have done or plan on doing?",

So you're either looking for a dividend or bond yield above 10%, or you're going to gamble on some stock going up 10%.\n\nYou can buy a CCC rated junk bond that yields 13.7% right now. That would both pay for your loan and give you roughly a 4% skim. \n\nHistorically, there's about a 10% to 15% chance that your bond would default within 12 months. That would end your remaining interest payments, and you probably wouldn't get more than half of your principle back. So then you'd be screwed on your loan. It's literally financial Russian roulette. The probability of default is pretty close to the odds that a revolver would give you.\n\nYou could also buy a diversified turbo-junk bond fund with high yield, so you are not just exposed to one company, but the ones I looked up had yields of like 12% after management fees. So your skim would drop closer to 2% on $30k, with wipeout downside potential if the broad economy struggles.\n\nMoney markets are yielding 5% right now, so about 3.5% after taxes, with zero risk. Just taking your $1000/mo and dropping it into those would be more profitable than running a personal-loan-to-junk-bond arbitrage scheme.",

There's theoretically no fraud going on so nobody will be persecuted, account frozen or anything. The bank doesn't even know that the BMA is operated by someone other than the name on the account.\n\n  \nOnce you purchased your own BMA, you can use it for anything tbh - take loans, scam someone, etc. Obviously doing shit like scams would get your BMA caught and frozen pretty quick, and if you send the scammed funds to your OWN account from the BMA, you will be implicated as well.\n\n  \nI am not going to tell you how to actually launder fraudulent proceeds out of BMAs of course, considering those are actual crimes.",
