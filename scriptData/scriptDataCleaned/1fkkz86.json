You‚Äôre clearly in TOS paper money by the yellow tile in the lower left and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with that (don‚Äôt let anyone ever tell you paper money is a waste of time, pilots use simulators so they don‚Äôt crash the plane). Try to make it feel real. If you have an account that size then simulating a trade like that makes sense. The risk still is pretty high. A 100k gain in a 200k account means the size of that trade to begin with was pretty big. If you‚Äôre uncomfortable in a trade, it‚Äôs probably too much size.",
