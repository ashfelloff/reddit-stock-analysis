  "selftext": "What are your thoughts on Robinhood Legend? I think the move upmarket is the right direction. Advanced trading features, index options etc for the browser is a very different user experience from the app.\n\nI'm only familiar with Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation/Desktop at an enterprise level. But there are a dozen competitors here (TradingView etc). The multi-screen, dynamic linking features look good.\n\nCombined with crypto, the Gold Card etc, Robinhood has definitely diversified its customer + product base. Very impressive and now it has room to go beyond its $25b market cap.",
