          "body": "False.\n\nHe sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo for $5.7 billion in Yahoo stock (not cash) and he owned about 25% of the company. He received 14.6 million shares of Yahoo trading at $95, thus his concentrated position had a market value of $1.4 billion. In order to protect the value of the 14.6 million stocks he decided to set up a costless Options Collar, which allowed him to protect his billions without paying any insurance premium because there was a lock-in period for him to sell the Yahoo shares - often 6 months to 4 years when you hear companies getting acquired - he used these Yahoo shares as collateral for a bank loan, he didn't want to miss the opportunity if Yahoo continued to rally, he chose to enter a collar to lock in his share value without selling the shares. Here is the detail of the option trade:\n\nFor each 100 shares of Yahoo stock, 1 contract of put (strike 85) was bought and 1 contract of call (strike 205) was sold. In total there were 146,000 contracts of calls and 146,000 contracts of puts traded.\n\nThe premium of the put exactly offset the premium of the call, thus there was zero cost for this trade (Mark probably had to pay a commission but it is likely the commission cost was rolled into the premium as part of the total deal between Mark and brokers or counterparts).\n\nAll options expired in 3 years.\n\nSuch option structure is called a Collar and it consists of two legs: buying a downside put and selling an upside call. A costless collar has the premium of the put offsetting the call's exactly so that there is no cost to enter the collar trade.\n\nAfter Cuban's collar trade was entered, Yahoo's share price reached the stratosphere of $237 in January 2000, making his trade look like a mistake. Then the internet bubble burst, and Yahoo reached the abysmal price of $13 (in late 2002), making his trade a stroke of genius, a great risk management trade without out of pocket costs. Cuban was able to pin down the value of the share (or close to 90% of it), no matter the subsequent movement of the stocks, and preserve most of the initial value he received for Broadcast.com.",
