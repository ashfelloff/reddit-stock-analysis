  "selftext": "Mouse Ears Puts FTW ($DIS)\n\nHappy Sunday!\n\nNot terribly long ago I was ridiculed for suggesting $SNAP calls could make you money even though my approach was to exit prior to ER. I can’t be right twice, so here goes nothing….\n\nSecuring $DIS puts first thing Monday to me is an absolute low risk effort to not only scalp some nice gains but also achieve those baggers y’all like instead of being bagholders.\n\nI already missed out on scoring these on the cheap early April as I was too busy being a regard elsewhere. Luckily the IV on contracts expiring 5/10 (after ER mind you) are still quite low and I expect IV to throttle up to 150% or more by this time next week. \n\nWhile the mouse ears is great at screwing bears over, my sound bullet proof reasoning is below:\n\n- they just secured a proxy “victory” which is anything but to me. It shows blood in the water and hostility, not to mention doubt that their current leadership can actually power through and make them the blue chip they once were.\n\n- they have had an awful run at the box office lately. While I think the FUTURE releases of movies bodes well for them longer term, I see this as a very reasonable and logical place for Wall Street to knock them down a rung without giving too much value into forward movie guidance.\n\n- Bob Iger is a gap filler IMO. I don’t know how any long term shareholder of this company for the last 5 years could be excited compared to the rest of the market.\n\n- they throttled way up last earnings. In line with other stocks it seems like a balance of once blessed and once cursed, which will happen when they enter ER. \n\n- IV will continue to increase leading up to earnings, which will help all contracts in value.\n\n- I expect this week to be a red week and not pushing 52W H, so I would like to see DIS move to $105 by EOW ideally. Oh yeah FOMC this week too!\n\nThe play:\n\n$105p 5/10 exp. Available for a cool $1 or so with great opportunity to not only be ITM prior to earnings but also along with the kick in IV to see a nice 60-200% increase in value without even playing the ER call.\n\nMy position: will comment Monday AM when I secure position.\n\nMy exit: if I double by EOW I will sell at least half and let the rest ride.\n\nPrediction: $DIS to $93 by 5/10, probably 5/9. If my prediction is correct, it will make those $105 puts be worth well more than 10x what they are now.\n\nBest of luck!",

But Chapek sucks worse and yeah the devil you know was brought back. Shit was going south before Iger left. He gave those people the freedom to fuck up stuff and then left. Chapek IMO came in without a plan and already was dealing with a room of people who didn’t want to get in line and let their “creativity” flow.\n\nI think Disney+ was a great addition and I’m still perplexed as to why Netflix is somehow worth more than Disney but it’s just a stupid market valuation anyway. Disney has done a poor job managing their ever expanding portfolio and seems to be doing 180s left and right to try and say they aren’t making the same mistakes.",
