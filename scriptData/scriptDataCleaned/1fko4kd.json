  "selftext": "[Full Article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-19/walmart-plans-instant-bank-payments-cutting-out-card-networks?srnd=phx-economics-v2)\n\nWalmart Inc. customers will soon have the option to pay directly from their bank accounts with instant transfers for online purchases. The enhanced feature is a flash point in the escalating tensions between merchants and the card networks setting the fees for payment processing.\n\nThe world’s largest retailer has offered pay-by-bank through Walmart Pay since earlier this year. Until now, the transactions were akin to digital checks and took roughly three days to finalize when being processed through The Automated Clearing House, the same network often used for bill payments or paycheck deposits. Soon, customers opting for pay-by-bank transactions will see the purchase reflected in their bank account balance instantly – and Walmart will receive the funds immediately.\n\nThe consumer advantage of instant pay-by-bank over debit cards is avoiding stacked pending transactions. For customers carrying low balances, pending transactions can open them up to the risk of overdraft or non-sufficient funds fees from their bank, according to Jamie Henry, vice president of emerging payments at Walmart.\n\nIn the US, most consumers carry credit or debit cards which offer convenience, fraud protections and, in the case of credit products, rewards programs. However, frustration has mounted among merchants over fees they pay for card processing to banks and networks like Visa and Mastercard.\n\n  \nTLDR/ \n\n* Retailer partners with Fiserv for upgraded pay-by-bank option\n* Aims at reducing consumer risk of NSF or overdraft fees",

Then if you can find an employee to give you what you need, you then have to endure standing in line for 10 min because there is only 2 open checkout lanes.\n\nThe fact that they are cheaper for some things is the only reason I tolerate going there on occasion.

It isn't super wealthy like if I were to drive 20 min away, but I didn't think it was that ghetto either haha.\n\nSpeaking from experience of what I can recall of what I've seen that is now behind glass  Basically everything in the electronic sections, some stuff in the automotive sections like headlight bulbs, some of the tools, baby formula, spray paint (makes sense), cremes/lotions and other toiletries (but not all), razors, electronic toothbrushes, cologne/perfume/makeup, some medicine. I don't know recall if my local store does it, but I have seen like the packs of hanes underwear and socks locked up in other stores.  Obviously guns/ammo and liquor/tobacco were locked up as well.  Probably were more things, but I don't go there that often to keep tabs on it. It's been in the last 6 months they did this.\n\nI get why they do it..  But its not having anybody around that is the insufferable part.  I've spent time walking around looking for an associate to get a freaking headlight bulb and its was a ghost town.  That's when I gave up.  My time is more valuable to me than saving a couple dollars.  I'd think the loss is sales due to the seemingly insurmountable difficulty in buying something is arguably just as significant as the money loss due to theft.",
