  "title": "Counter-Rally ( likely ) Coming, Then a Lower Low to Fill NVDA Earnings Gap at $497",
  "score": 46,
  "selftext": "A counter-rally is likely coming after today's huge down move then a continuation sell off down to $497.   \nThe objective target for the counter-move is around $510. ( This is a previous level of demand that will now be supply as trapped buyers look to exit )  \nMy (custom) stochastic & RSI indicators have triggered counter-rally signals. ( outlined with the vertical blue lines )  \nBear in mind the market just broke the 50-day moving average. This nearly always means more pain is ahead. So expect the counter-rally to fail quickly ( very likely on a touch of the 50-day moving average from below)  \nAfter the counter-rally is over the sell off is expected to continue to fill the gap at $497, left there after NVDA reported earnings.  \n\n\nIf we simply open with a gap up tomorrow at $510, then the counter-rally will likely have already concluded.  \nIt is extremely risky to trade against the trend. I'm not recommending a trade here. Just sharing my work.\n\nI have further out projections for what I expect to happen after $497. Will share in due time.  \nGood luck everyone and stay safe.  \n\n\n[$SPY 1-hour chart](https://preview.redd.it/8no2y1es5puc1.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a2fda85e0d306807880fe2a9aef07a41aefe2d7)",
