Here's my regarded opinion: \n\nChina is just getting started!\n\nYes, it's an artificial pump, but it's the one they need desperately! \n\nSSE (Shanghai Stock Exchange) is Closed For A Week Long Holiday (Oct 01 - 07) - CHINA NATIONAL DAY \n\nWatch it skyrocket again once it opens on Tuesday!\n\nXi/CCP are desperate and they will do whatever it takes to pump up the Chinese Market. \n\nThey're pumping $1 TRILLION as a stimulus package. \n\nYou regards should know by now, Never Fight The Stimulus anywhere, especially in the US and China.\n\nI personally don't care about China/CCP/Xi or whatever the fuck you regards masturbate to! \n\nI care about making money and I'm gambling on 10/18 calls Positions: 10/18 Calls\n\n\n....... \n\n\nTLDR; \n\nLong China and bought 10/18 calls. \n\n\nTHIS IS A DEGENERATE GAMBLE, AND CAN VERY WELL GO TO BELOW ZERO REAL QUICK",
