  "selftext": "* **The new data from positive GDP and fewer jobless claims are both pointing to a Soft Landing with the aid of the upcoming expected Fed interest rate cut.**\n* **Real gross domestic product** (GDP) **increased annually by 3.0 percent** in the second quarter of 2024.  In the first quarter, real GDP increased 1.4 percent.\n* The real GDP increase primarily **reflected consumer spending, private inventory investment, and nonresidential fixed investment. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased**\n* **US initial jobless claims inch lower by 2,000 to 231,000 in the week ending on August 24** below the expectation of 234,000. \n* The **four-week moving average of initial claims fell 5,000 to 232,000**\n* U.S. central bank is **expected to begin its easing cycle next month with a 25 basis points reduction with a chance of 50 basis points on the table**.  The Fed has maintained its policy rate for more than a year in the current 5.25%-5.50% range after raising it by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-second-estimate-corporate-profits-preliminary-estimate-second](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/gross-domestic-product-second-estimate-corporate-profits-preliminary-estimate-second)[](https://www.actionforex.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/afc2024082906.gif)",
