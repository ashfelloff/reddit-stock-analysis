He has a record. You know what you get and despite what the media and Washington establishment tried to tell you it wasnt bad. It was actually pretty damn decent for americans and the world if you look at the outcomes ( peace agreement in the middle east, exit from irak and syria, avoided a war with iran nuking the revolutionary guard guy when they became uppity but avoiding stupid retaliation when they exploded a firecracker on a navy ship resulting in a quiet stalemate with Iran scaling back their fuckery ... ) . He is also a sleazy motherfucker who most likely groped anything close enough to come to his mushroom dick.\n\n Kamala has NOTHING apart from absolutely tanking multiple election campaigns, ending people's life for petty offenses she wouldn't have needed to persecute amd apparently treating her staffers like shit. Her career as a junior senator must be one of the most unremarkable careers in history. Nobody wants to see how she would do as president \n\n( also his closet corpses seem to be quite modest if after 6 years of INTENSE trying the only thing the establishment could stick on him was a fake russia dossier, a conviction for an accounting crime NOBODY EVER has been convicted of and for keeping copies of documents he legally owned as the president and could have made public while being president. Not saying ne smells of roses but he seems much cleaner than i imagined he even paid his taxes lol ).",

This is entirely speculation, but I think Dems are energized not having to vote for Meltbrain Joe, and I think the polls are going to swing even harder for Harris, especially after Trump picked an absolute snoozefelt of a VP. Vance is about as uncharismatic as it gets. If Kamala picks a VP that Dems are excited about and is an interesting person and campaigner, I don't see Trump winning the election.",
