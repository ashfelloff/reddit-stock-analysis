And technically it was owned by CrowdStrike and we have millions of dollars for impact liability cap in such contracts for loss if business- so clients will either directly get paid by Crowdstrike a negotiated dollar amount which most likely is easier to match the months payment and have a credit memo sent and balance it in their P & L( Done this atleast half a dozen times for other outages from other technical firms and is the easiest thing for both parties). \n\nNow a more pessimistic thought - If there was lawsuit kind of impact (hospitals, emergency services and their customers for life impacting services and if there were uncapped liability in contracts) then insurances exist for such incidents and their claim adjusters will all coordinate and sue the shit out of Crowdstrike in a mass tort and bring them to their knees. So crowdstrike also has liability insurance and has to pass on compliance and process info to these insurance companies and the insurance companies will not pay if they scrutinize the process and find a gap and it all will fall on Crowdstrike to settle. And even if these insurance companies are changing monies among themselves, they will collectively increase premiums for all involved.",
