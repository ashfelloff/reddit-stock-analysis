  "selftext": "On Monday, NVIDIA surpassed last week's intraday high of $140.89, closing up 4.14% to set a new closing all-time high of $143.71, and closed with a market capitalization of $3.53 trillion, closing in on Apple's $3.6 trillion market cap.\nDespite last Tuesday's dip in NVIDIA's stock price after ASML's earnings blowout, and the market's concerns about slowing AI spending remain, NVIDIA's stock price still recorded a 2% gain last week, a cumulative increase of more than 50% over the bottom at the time of the market's collapse in early August.\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be firmly bullish on NVIDIA ahead of its November earnings report. According to Bloomberg survey statistics, analysts expect NVIDIA shares to rise to $ 148.37 in the next 12 months, including a number of highly bullish analysts on NVIDIA, for example:\n\nOn Friday, Bank of America raised its Nvidia price target from $165 to $190. Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya, among others, said buying Nvidia is a “once-in-a-generation opportunity.”\nLast week, investment research firm CFRA raised its price target on NVIDIA from $139 to $160.\nIn the view of Bank of America analysts, the overall AI market demand is growing strongly, in addition to this is also worth noting that NVIDIA's strong performance in the field of enterprise AI, such as partnerships with Microsoft and Accenture and other companies, Bank of America to raise its target price of the other factor, NVIDIA is the preferred partner for enterprise AI hardware and software.\n\nWedbush analyst and NVIDIA majority owner Dan Ives expressed a similar sentiment in a report sent to investors on Sunday. He claimed that enterprise spending is growing in giant waves as AI adoption scenarios explode, and NVIDIA is leading the way.\n\nIves predicts that the AI infrastructure market will grow tenfold between now and 2027, with companies investing $1 trillion in AI capital expenditures during that time. “In short, we think tech stocks are poised for another 20% rally in 2025, and this tech bull market driven by the AI revolution is just entering its next phase. We believe that the Fed and Powell have initiated an aggressive rate-cutting cycle, that a soft macroeconomic landing is still the way forward, and that tech spending on AI is a crossover spending wave that is just getting off the ground in the tech sector.”",

I understand that the contracts could have swapped hands prior to that date (since it has doubled). What is the norm for the contracts to be exercised, in terms of the stock price vs strike price (with the premium)? Thanks in advance!",
