Unless you believe that there’s a catalyst event that will somehow or other push MSFT to the fair value you calculated within this week, this is confirmation bias.  Not trying to bash you but this is a really loosely justified trade. \n\nNothing wrong with buying short term options, but don’t justify it with undervaluation because intrinsic value realization is notoriously impossible to time\n\nEdit: I just looked up these contracts.  You’re currently in the green by $4030 as the pic shows, based on the $36 time decay, this weekend you will lose over $2k.  Half your profit.",

My first impression is that the price action is below the 8, and the 21 EMAs. Honestly, I would be concerned if I see a chart like this considering the recent rally and the price rebounding from the lows of August 5th. \nTake a look at the following \nMETA it has cleared and price is above , area of consolidation it could break the 540 channel soonish\nNVDA , it has cleared above the 8, and the 21ema \nNFLX , it cleared above , same \nTSLA , same thing \nEven DELL is in a 6 day time period of consolidation but above the 8, and the 21 EMA \nAAPL , same story \nAMZN , same , etc \nSo, unless you think that MSFT is due to take off and clear above those EMA to catch up with the other tech stocks , I have a minor concern here.
