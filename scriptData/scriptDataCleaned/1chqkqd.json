  "title": "Northeastern US Yogurt Price Index Predicts Market Crash ",
  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "Highly regarded analysis that shows causation, not correlation (trust me), between the average price of yogurt and cataclysmic market crashes. \n\nIf, using the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data, average price index change of an 8oz cup of Yogurt in the Northeastern US stays within .007 of 0 by month, then you see VIX spikes to 30 or more the next month and the market takes a hit. \n\nAttached is a chart showing VIX since 2019 and a table downloaded from the BLS using their CPI data with the value change by month that I calculated myself. \n\nYou’ll see the months preceding a VIX spike are the same months when the Yogurt price change falls within the evil omen range. Thus market crashes due to all the implications of volatility and fear radiating from yogurt eaters. \n\nNow why yogurt? Who eats yogurt? Those with enough coin to weather a market dip eat yogurt.. so when prices remain, it means yogurt eaters are not increasing yogurt consumption due to lack of confidence in the market but they’re not decreasing yogurt intake due to their arrogance of disillusioned belief that they can afford yogurt forever. \n\nSo when the northeastern yogurt eaters habits mean their market stays TOO similar month over month, all hell breaks loose shortly after and the market suffers due to extreme volatility coming from amongst the most import demographic (northeastern yogurt eaters). \n\nSince 2019, no month where the price index change of an 8oz cup of Yogurt in the Northeastern US stayed within .007 of zero did VIX not spike within 30 days.\n\nWatch the yogurt prices if you value mountain climbing and money. \n\nWill average price change of an 8oz cup of Yogurt in the Northeastern US stay within .007 of 0 for April and indicate the market crashing hard in May? Will it be for May and June? We’ll see.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xk7f97v7euxc1.png?width=2542&format=png&auto=webp&s=085637ccac05be75e7e4a96a6c782a7f4567bcb6\n\nWatch for the culture. ",
