But some definitely moreso than others.\n\nCCJ - Cameco is an established and respected business that does produce and sell Yellowcake.\n\nUEC - Uranium Energy Corp. - Far more risky and volatile company, severe share dilution, never actually mined, processed, and sold uranium despite claiming that's the nature of their business. \"Any day now\" narrative. High risk, high reward.\n\nLSE:YCA - Yellowcake PLC is an example (UK) company that buys and holds uranium on it books, as such, it more or less tracks the spot/LT price of uranium.\n\nURNM - Sprott Uranium Miners Fund  - Your uranium based ETF packed full of companies with exposure to the price of uranium.",

              "body": "UEC started production in Wyoming at the beginning of last month. Agree that they carry risk, they have a large book of fully-permitted ISR projects that can be started quickly and cheaply compared to traditional mining operations, but they have outright stated that further equity raises are likely to be necessary to progress them. The CEO wants full exposure to the increasing uranium price so they're not locking down long term contracts yet, which would make financing easier. \n\nAs a direct comparison I like Encore Energy more as a conservative/value investor who has been burned by dilution before. Similar book of ISR projects in the US, generally smaller deposits and earlier stage for permitting but seem more likely to meet required capital costs from existing revenues. They have two sites in production (Nov 23 and June 24 starts iirc), one in partnership with Boss Energy. Experienced teams of operators. They lack that big marquee project like UEC has Roughrider or Denison's Phoenix that could get investors dreaming, but that's reflected in their market cap.",
