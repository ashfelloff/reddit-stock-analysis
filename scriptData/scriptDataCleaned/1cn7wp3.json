  "selftext": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares were in focus on Tuesday as Goldman Sachs raised its earnings estimates and price target on the semiconductor giant amid \"robust\" AI server demand and better supply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari raised his price target to $1,100 from $1,000 and reiterated his Buy rating on Nvidia, raising his earnings estimates for fiscal years 2025 to 2027 on average by 8%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDespite Nvidia's near 85% gain year-to-date, positive earnings per share estimate revisions are likely coming, which should help drive the stock higher, Hari said.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd with shares trading at roughly 35 times earnings (or roughly a 36% premium compared to other semiconductor stocks in Hari's coverage universe), there may be more room for upside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNvidia is slated to report fiscal first-quarter results on May 22. A consensus of analysts expects the Jensen Huang-led company to earn $5.22 per share on $24.39B in revenue.\n\n&#x200B;",

If their earnings are this volatile, their price target can easily have a margin of error on a <1mo frame >10%. Just look at all the variation in their earnings estimates, or look at the IV of the options chain. \n\nThe real non-solicitation advice is to do the targets yourself and model their earnings as a Brownian Motion or other similar stochastic model, factor in your own portfolio allocation and risk, and make capital allocation decisions then, using proven sizing techniques similar to the Kelly criterion for binary outcomes/gambling",
