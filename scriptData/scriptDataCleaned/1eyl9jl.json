After all, the field of AI is >50 years old and it could easily be another 10+ years to see it produce enough value add to justify NVDA's market cap.\n\nNow, we can say that the development of more advanced AI is completely guaranteed, but that still doesn't justify NVDA's current valuation because it needs to satisfy the *when*.
