Ahead of schedule for opening new stores. \n\nAnyone arguing about CAVA's high current PE (709.41) with a future PE (323.26) that is more than half of what it is currently don't understand that this may indicate investors are potentially flocking to this asset because they find it a safe long term investment and willing to overpay now with the expectation that earnings will eventually meet more closely with price. Other companies like AMZN, AMD, CVNA, CMG, FSLR, and many others with previously extreme valuations have brought earnings more in line with price while still increasing shareholder value at the same time. People are excited for this because healthy food trends are on the rise, Mediterranean food is not easy and expensive to make on your own & is niche - it's not another burger, sub, and fries joint. \n\nAnyone betting against this is going to get a huge burn.",
