      "body": "They’re just very mismanaged with a massive cost and employee base. Last year they missed an incredible launch window for COD-competitor XDefiant (which was delayed by a year, instead of launching right before the disappointing launch of MWIII launch, which would have been a great window for it), then both Star Wars and the latest AC Japan were postponed, and the Avatar game didn’t sell well last Christmas (it was barely marketed, and also delayed for way too long after the latest Avatar movie). Skull & Bones was released but got a lot of Youtube hate, while Prince of Persia flopped massively despite great reviews. Now Star Wars is selling below expectations, while the outlook for the lates AC game isn’t good due to social media controversy. \n\nEvery recent release has thus more or less flopped and sold far below expectations. Management doesn’t seem to be able to make any good decisions whatsoever or communicate a plan for how to improve things. \n\nIt’s also simply extremely popular to hate the company and its games on YouTube and Reddit. A few popular YouTubers make an excellent living and are getting wealthy posting Ubisoft hate videos on a regular basis. So it’s very unclear how they could turn it around.",
