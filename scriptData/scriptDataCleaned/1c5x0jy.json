So how do you profit off this fact?\n\nRates aren’t going back to where they were in March 2020, but they can’t stay here either without the economy running into a wall.\n\nOtherwise, imagine all the jobs that’ll have to be cut to pay the extra interest.\n\n**Update:** For the fun of it, I made a chart tracking interest rates and how they differed from 5 years prior. If rates stay where they are today for the next two years, there would only be 4 other years where rates this much higher 5 years earlier, 1969 and 1980-82 ([link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CnJLC8SftnmHqpgOsLaNeQYHJBGSaBLvpQ5U7uyA90I/edit?usp=sharing)).   \n  \nNow I'm starting to understand why so many folks feel like interest rates have no choice but to go lower, or the economy will be forced into a recession to prevent inflation.

Not matter how long you wait you'll never be able to say that about a stock like Enron. \n\n18 months ago I felt really concerned that America post-COVID was on a path to becoming Japan. But I don't feel that way any more. There is just no other economic power to take our place in the near term. China post-lockdown hasn't exactly been what folks expected it to be and their population is both aging and becoming more middle-class. (that's not to say America doesn't have many many many other problems on the horizon, don't get me wrong).",
