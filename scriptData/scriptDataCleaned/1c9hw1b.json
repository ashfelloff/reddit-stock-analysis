I used it when it first came out and it was awesome, then it started to do all this extra stuff and I got sick of it, the simplicity of disappearing pics was cool, but now you can post non disappearing stuff apparently and so that just seems like it killed the whole thing.

This means that we can expect a decent amount of RHM fatigue, and the German institutional investors are cheapskates. My money on BAE systems because not only it is a major contractor for the US, it is the pappa of B. \"Anti-Russian\" Radley.\n\nRHM have the advantage of purchasing and selling a autonomous land platform (to Japan). The Ukraninan-Russian war shows that anything without an operator is worth gold. But we want to look for companies that can stamp drones for zerg-rush attack and, of course, anything that can weaponize space will drown itself with hookers and blow after the feds cut rates (and they will cut rates if the EU stops loving stagnations so much and cut rates first).\n\nAlso, nuclear energy and hydrogen are the post-war game (Westinhouse had plans to make Ukraine a nuclear+hydrogen cow which are still on the table).",

But with their focus on land systems they might become one of the big players in drone countermeasures.\n\nTo add to this: Their KF51 MBT might sell well after it beeing pushed from showcase vehicle to become prodution ready by hungary, who have a joint venture with RHM through hungarys biggest arms factory, which already produced the RHM Lynx for the hungarian army.\n\nPlus Rheinmetall is researching and pushing for a 130mm smooth bore gun, which might get adopted in many future NATO MBTs.\n\nTL;DR: Short term nobody knows; as long term investment Rheinmetall might have a good chance to climb above the latest high",
