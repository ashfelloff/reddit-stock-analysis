      "body": "$LUV is the only stock I bought somewhat near peak covid crash, back in May/June 2020, that is worth less now than it was then without doing any type of split in between. At the time I bought, they had one of the largest open orders for, and had already taken delivery of, significant number of Boeing 737 Max series aircraft. That was one of only 2 or 3 models in Southwest's entire fleet, and was grounded for some of 2019 until Christmas travel season of 2020, 6+ months after I bought shares. In fact, I bought because I thought gosh, any airline that doesnt go bankrupt from this, can only go up! And it did for quite a while, but now its reversed all gains, and I'm down a little over 18%. My cost basis, 100% of which was purchased between May 1, 2020 and June 1, 2020, was $33.85, and that's down $6.10 per share as of a few minutes ago.\n\n\nSo, I bought when international travel to US was completely closed, domestic travel was severely restricted and in low demand, and a large portion of their fleet was grounded for safety reasons. And the share price is currently down nearly 20% between then and today without any of those obstacles still in play, for the most part (some specific Max series are grounded again now based on specific interior options and doors blowing off, but I don't think any of theirs are still grounded because they either didnt have that interior option or complied with the ADs quickly). I'm not sure what to make of that other than to say they are either stupidly undervalued right now, or they're in super bad shape and heading in the wrong direction as a company to have fallen so much between June 1, 2020 and now. I'm not sure which it is, but I strongly suspect the latter is far more likely. \n\n\nThey're still having worldwide meltdowns and cancellations due to their outdated IT systems that manage scheduling and ticketing, and I've yet to hear any scuttlebutt about them doing a thing to replace or upgrade them, in any reasonable effort to prevent or even mitigate the mass catastrophic failures that have happened 2 or 3 times now in the last 18 months that grounded most of their fleet for 1 to 3 days at a time, stranding thousands of passengers each time.\n\n\nThey're also progressively abandoning their niche market and the advantage they once had. They devalued their miles and frequent flyer programs 2 or 3 times each in the last few years, now are spit balling fee-added reserved seating. All 3 legacy domestics have done away with change fees since covid, which was formerly a big advantage of Southwest, and they're really about one baggage fee away from becoming the same as the legacy domestic carriers, but with an older, all Boeing fleet which are becoming irrationally but widely feared by a lot of the consumer market,  a lower level of service compared to the domestics, and no first class or real food options. Oh, and it's extremely notable that whereas I used to regularly see their airfare at 35-50% of the price of legacy carriers, I now see them frequently at 100-125% of a legacy carrier price, so another huge jump in the wrong direction there. Can't see any of that working out real well for them long term, so I'll be holding my very tiny bag just to see if I can get out at less of a loss, and get out if or when the getting is good. In fact now that this post made me type this all out loud, I'll probably buy a couple NTM long puts, too, if the premiums are reasonable.\n\n\nSouthwest was a good company because they ran more efficiently than other airlines, and offered the consumer a different, slightly reduced experience for a way better ticket price, with significantly more flexibility, all without nickel and diming folks to death, but almost nothing that made them standout and or appeal to that enormous target demographic still exists today, or is shared with the legacy domestics. I think they're also forgetting their main demographic, and have lost their identity for the most part, in terms of who is Southwest Airlines and who is the intended Southwest Airlines customer. I see no reason they won't do significantly worse than legacy carriers going forward, unless they make drastic changes in the opposite direction of the last several, back to what made them successful. Right now, they've devolved to operating similarly to the legacy carriers, at the same or similar price points, but with a reduced level of customer service and amenities, and they seem to be moving farther in that direction. That said, they are creating a bit of a vacuum in the budget air travel market by abandoning what once made them great.\n\n\nThey might accidentally fall back into that vacuum once their increasingly common price increases fail gloriously and they're forced to roll back some of these changes to prevent bankruptcy, and they might also swap to an all Airbus fleet, but either and or both scenarios trend toward medium to long term bearish movement, with possible very short term rips once or twice as they spin reports on revenue from fee increases, but the king term hit to demand and business hasn't hit the reports yet, that type of thing. I'm just waiting for a short upswing to close out my very small position, probably still at a loss. Right now, they are offering a slightly worse experience than legacy carriers, at a similar or higher price in most US markets outside some specific high volume, high demand routes. That just has zero chance of long term sustainability, much less growth, in my humble opinion.\n\n\nTLDR: I bought in 2020 when half their fleet was grounded, international travel was mostly prohibited, and domestic air travel was extremely restricted and in very low demand, and it's down just over 18% since then, with all those obstacles cleared.

      "body": "The biggest problem for Southwest is their fleet badly needs a replacement for its aging lower capacity 737-700s. They currently run a fleet of older 737-700s and larger 737-800s and their replacement 737-8 Maxes, with plans for the smaller 737-7 Max to replace the 737-700.\n\nUnfortunately, the 737-7 Max is delayed by the FAA and Southwest dropped its plans on the 737-7 Max joining the fleet in 2024. Southwest uses a mix of low and medium capacity 737s. This fleet mix used to be at a 4:1 ratio in favor of low capacity planes but is now more like 1:1 due to 737-7 Max delays. Their 737-700 continue to age and now over half their fleet is composed of the larger capacity 737-800 and 737-8 Max because they have to use the larger 737-8 Max to replace small 737-700s. Now larger 737-8 Maxes are used on routes that were serviced by smaller 737-700s and Southwest's passenger load factor fell in 2023. I think the cabin idea Southwest is piloting in customer focus groups is patchwork solution to their fleet mix problem of having too much airplane capacity for their routes, rather than an innovative way to transform their business model. They still operate on lean point-to-point routes with a low turnaround time on a single aircraft type.\n\nI wouldn't personally buy Southwest unless I believe they will figure out their fleet mix problem in the near term, through either 737-7 Max certification soon enough for 2025 deliveries or the acquisition of another airline with smaller, newer jets. The latter would represent a partial change in its business model if it means acquiring and adopting another aircraft type like a small Airbus or Embraer.",

And pretending that United has a better hard or soft product than Southwest is a joke. United is literal trash domestically and internationally is even worse. Pretending that Polaris was a hybrid J/F was a farce that they've thankfully abandoned in marketing, but even ignoring that it barely qualifies as J, especially when comparing to Middle Eastern and Asian competitors.",
