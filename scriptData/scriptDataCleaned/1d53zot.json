You are confusing 'risk tolerance' with 'appetite for *edit:* high risk plays' - being able to cope with risky moves is separate from a hunger to make risky moves. Am I making sense here? \n\nFurthermore, you clearly don't have high risk tolerance because of how you reacted to the risk you put on. You explain your decisions as if they are methodical, yet you admit your last move was driven by an unsatisfaction with how you traded which led to you going all in. \n\nYou, like many here (*edit: including me*), absolutely don't have the stomach for this type of risk tolerance - a willingness to take risks is different from the ability to stomach them. Also, and here I eat my earlier words,  does gambling on daily, nay, hourly movements really have anything to do with risk tolerance? I'm not so sure.",

STOP GAMBLING. Sit down and reflect on the things you did wrong, and ask yourself, ‚Äòhow can I do better next time‚Äô ‚ÄòHow can I minimize these mistakes‚Äô and so on. If you actually want to see consistency with trading, start journaling and reflecting on your trading day etc; treated like a business. Stick to 2-3 ticker symbols with high volume/liquidity - keep it simple. For ex: I only trade spy. And most importantly, when buying options contracts, buy ITM or at the money or it can 1 dollar or 2 out, nothing more than that. Seriously, if you really want it bad enough, you will take the right steps to get you to have that consistency. I‚Äôm only 21 and have been ‚Äútrading‚Äù for the past 4 years and I finally started making money consistently a year ago once I started applying these rules. Trading is a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the ones that are patient. With that being said, once you find a strategy that you understand and works for you, simple strategy, not complex, you have to learn how to control your emotions. Get better at decision making and coupled that with discipline and emotional control, and you‚Äôll start seeing improvements. Good luck.",

I‚Äôm in my 40‚Äôs and have 8 years of trading experience, and even I lost money on the exact same play as you, thinking that the SPY bounce was gonna reverse and go back down üòÜ But unlike you, I saw the trend reversal and longed SPY into the close, instead of shorting it again like you.\n\nDid you realize that yesterday was a Friday, end of the month, with data release, and already dumped past the monthly VWAP? How will this affect the intraday price action? Do you see how you will lose money to me, who has an informational edge on you? You‚Äôll need years to catch up to me, not to mention all the other Wall Street pro traders with PhD‚Äôs in math, physics, and statistics, as well as AI-created computer algorithms that know you better than you know yourself.\n\nStay in school, study hard, get a real job that adds value to society, and then after 10 to 20 years, with more education, life experience, and wisdom, then maybe you can start thinking about trading again.",

Follow that strategy except you could pick what ETFs to invest in long term. \n\nYou‚Äôre going to want to focus on steadily increasing your earning potential over the next 20 years, while investing aggressively in index funds and vanguard ETFs. When you reach your first 100k in savings, give yourself about the next 20k to set up a ‚Äúplay‚Äù account that you can gamble options with. Then go back to the buy and hold strategy. Good luck.
