  "selftext": "I have my retirement accounts with Fidelity and my general account with Schwab and want to consolidate into one brokerage.  Curious as to what any of you say if you have experience with both?\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n- Fidelity automatically pays you good interest on cash balance, Schwab requires you to manually move money.  This is my #1 reason I’m considering Fidelity. \n\n- Fidelity offers some free and reduced rate trades where Schwab does not on some options and otc. Not a major plus but a nice fringe benefit might save me $50-$100 year.\n\n- Schwab UI/UX is superior on iOS app.  Website is also a little better IMO.  This is my #1 reason I’m considering Schwab.\n\n- Schwab iOS app is glitchy and Fidelity appears stable.  More annoying than anything but concerned the app might not work when I really need it to.\n\n- TOS vs active trader pro don’t appear to have any major differences?  I haven’t used Fidelity’s yet but it seems to offer the same service as TOS.. NEUTRAL imo but interested to hear any thoughts.",

I only trade on PC because Schwab's app will just freeze up every time I try to do a trade on my phone.  Also Schwab has locked people out of their accounts twice this year already which never happened to me before on any other brokerage.\n\nThe only reason I am using Schwab is because I really liked TD Ameritrade and they were purchased by Schwab this year so I didn't really have a choice.  I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and you can still use the ThinkorSwim platform with Schwab so that is something that I don't want to give up.  I am crossing my fingers hoping they will get better because I would really rather avoid switching brokerages and having to learn a new skill set for trading.\n\nIf I were to move I might choose Chase, but I have heard that Fidelity is also a good choice.  Good luck with whatever you decide!\n\nEdit:  I wanted to add that another thing I do like about Schwab is that you can trade in afterhours / premarket, set up as many automatic orders as you want with no fees (for equity trades-not options), and I can spend twice as much money as I actually have if I want to (not sure if that is a good thing or not...lol).",

Here are the things I did not like versus Fidelity:  \n\n1) Fidelity auto sweeps my cash to a money market account paying ~5%. Schwab does not and pays a paltry 0.35% on this cash. \n\n2) Fidelity pays out dividends to customers the same day companies pay out. Schwab holds this cash for an extra day and pays out a day later. \n\n3) Schwab’s site experienced 3 crashes at the open when I was looking to trade. Never had a problem with Fidelity in the 10+ years I have had an account with them. \n\n4) My account contacts at Fidelity are great and take care of things within days of requesting. My account rep at TD Ameritrade was awesome and moved over to Schwab. He is super frustrated by them due to their poor performance and inability to compete with other brokerage firms as they are not competitive. \n\n5) Schwab only allows a single phone number for two factor authentication. Fidelity allows two phone numbers to be set up to access an account via two factor authentication. I want both my wife and myself to be able to access accounts in case something happens to the other spouse. \n\nI ended up moving a multimillion account from Schwab to Fidelity due to Schwab’s poor performance. Fidelity paid me an incentive bonus of several thousand dollars to move the money to them. I am much happier.",

It took me over a year for the move, and my local Schwab guy helped a lot. \n\nIf you’re high net worth, be aware that even if you have private client services that their phone menu still sucks. It wastes over fifteen minutes waiting for timeout for various phone menus. ",
