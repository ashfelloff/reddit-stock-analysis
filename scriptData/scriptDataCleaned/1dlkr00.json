Stay away from them. Imo you should buy the stock in the next max 5 weeks, when you feel it has dropped enough. In August 22th ish there will be earninggs and the stock will go up, then will go down for 1 month or so (but still above end of august) and then at the end of november again eith the last earnings this year it will go up.\n\nI expect 200 by the end of the year.
