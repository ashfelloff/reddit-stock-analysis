The cost of goods due to inflation =/= the rate of inflation. \n\nThe pandemic caused a huge surge in inflation that caused the costs of goods to rise. Unfortunately, those prices will remain at those levels going forward because if those prices ever reverted back to the costs from 4 years ago, that would be deflation, which means our economy is currently in serious trouble. \n\nThe key now is to reduce the RATE of inflation as much as possible. When people say inflation is lowering, they are **NOT** saying that price of goods are lowering, they are saying the RATE in which goods increase due to the inflation is lowering to a healthy level. \n\nHate to break it to ya bud, even before covid, YOY increases due to inflation were still a thing, you may just have never paid attention to it before inflation became a big buzzword during covid.",
