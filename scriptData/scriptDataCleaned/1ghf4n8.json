Have had option trades swing from +20% or more to break even or negative in the span of an hour.

Even if it goes to $0 Ive made enough money on the first 2 sales to be pretty much break even.\n\nSelling off the last 25% really depends on the specific position but I might set a percentage gain or a date well enough ahead of the option expiration that I dont get destroyed by the decreasing theta or I might hold it and let it convert and continue to hold the underlying stock‚Ä¶\n\nI let 4 options of NVDA convert since June though Ive since sold off 150 shares and intend to possibly sell 100-200 more by years end.\n\nIve sold CRM options 2 weeks before expiration as CRM isnt usually a highly volatile stock and theta was already declining and Ive held pre-split MSTR until expiration because it is a highly volatility stock but I was deep in the money on the option. Probably would have let it convert but it was pre-split and I didnt have $130k to convert it.",

Without the LCGE, you would have to pay taxes on half of this amount, i.e., $750,000. However, seeing as the LCGE allows you to subtract $1,016,836 from your profits in 2024, you only pay taxes on ($1,500,000 - $1,016,836) x 50% = $241,582 rather than on $750,000.",

Any gains you have in your non-registered account is fully taxable at an inclusion rate of 50% on the first 500K of gain. So 250K (50%) is included as income. Once you get over 500K, the inclusion rate on amounts above that increase to 60%. So if you had 750K of capital gains, the amount included as income on your tax return is 250K (50% of 500K) + 150K (60% of 750K-500K) - resulting in 400K of income. This calculation is done annually.\n\nLifetime gains exemption is on \"qualifying\" property, either qualifying farming property or qualifying private small business shares (usually a CCPC). It's an incentive for people to run their own small corporations. which allows them to realize investment gains tax free up to 1M.
