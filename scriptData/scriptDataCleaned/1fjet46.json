  "selftext": "'Twas the night before rate cuts, and all through the street,  \nThe regards all restless, in anticipation of heat.  \n\nThe bulls were all hopeful, their calls stacked with care,  \nIn hopes that ol' JPow would soon ease the scare.  \n\nThe bears held their breath, not trusting the game,  \nThey’d seen it before and knew who to blame.  \n\nAnd I in my hoodie, the wife’s boyfriend on Zoom,  \nWere glued to the charts as we sat in one room.  \n\nWhen out on the web there arose such a flash,  \nI closed my meme stocks, fearing a crash.  \n\nI glanced at my screen, feeling jittery and raw,  \nAnd there on the timeline—what I feared—I saw.  \n\nIt was Powell and gang, in a frenzy no less,  \nDiscussing rate cuts, the markets a mess.  \n\n“Cut by 25? Or maybe by 50?”  \nWhispered the bulls, feeling quite nifty.  \n\nBut JPow just smirked as he held up hand,  \n“You think you’re in charge? You misunderstand.”  \n\n“The cuts are coming, sure as you bet,  \nBut inflation’s a beast we haven’t tamed yet.”  \n\nAnd I groaned as I watched, knowing what he would say,  \n“You’ll buy the dip, but your gains fade away.”  \n\nI stood by my screen, my face filled with doubt,  \n\"How can I win if he bails markets out?”  \n\nHe laughed as he left, and I knew in that flash,  \nThat even with rate cuts, I'd still lose my cash.  \n\nSo I sat down again, hand on my head,  \nI’m just a regard, and Powell’s in our bed.
