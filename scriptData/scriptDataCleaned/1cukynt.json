  "selftext": "I started learning trading during the beginning of the pandemic back in 2020. I tried so many things initially, but then I sort of found my niche in options scalp trading.\n\nI mostly scalp 1-4 DTE options (and lately 8 DTE options on Fridays) on individual mid-cap and large-cap stocks and occasionally monthly options on penny stocks.\n\nMy average trade time is under 10 minutes, and I almost never hold my options positions overnight.\n\nMy usual times to trade are from the market open till around 11 am and then for a brief period after 2 pm.\n\nI try to take advantage of the short bounces / pullbacks that follow overreactions in the 1-minute chart and keep track of the price actions.\n\nThe only indicator I use now is the VWAP.",
