  "selftext": "What happens when there is a 50:1 stock split? Fundamentally, more people have the ability to buy puts/calls because they become cheaper. Yes the options themselves are smaller, but there are so many regards that it doesn‚Äôt matter. Therefore, I‚Äôm pretty confident we will be able to swing it pretty heavily.\n\nMy first anti-chipotle ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù got a surprising amount of support, so, it seems like this is actually a pretty divisive issue. Thats a case for the volatility, \n\nAnd now, we come to the question.. should we try to make it go up or go down?\n\nWell, let me ask you my fellow ape, does chipotle deserve more of our money? Or do we want to teach them a lesson? To me the answer is clear. We must destroy chipotle as they are becoming too cocky with their endgame corporate power over us plebs trying to get a well-portioned burrito. Fuck em. Simple as that. We don't need any other reason. \n\nEither way, I think straddles are the best play coming up. But if you got big balls and want to stick to your ideals, its puts only.\n\nThe stock splits on June 25th. Do with that information what you will. Personally I have some puts expiring July 19th.
