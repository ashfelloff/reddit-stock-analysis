      "body": "You can try rolling up and out. See if you can get credit or be even on buying these back and selling new ones at a later expiration at a few strikes higher. Might still be covered but those extra strikes give you more profit on your underlying when it gets called. \n\nAnother idea (if you have margin) is to sell puts ATM to be assigned shares at the current price but you'll also collect a fat premium for this. You're effectively turning your short calls into a short strangle. If ASTS stays where it is or goes up, you'll lose the shares to the calls but will replace at the current price. If it keeps climbing, you'll keep harvesting short put premium which will be good money but less than what you'd make holding the shares. \n\nIf your personal risk profile allows, you could sell puts and use that premium to offset buying calls above your covered strike to turn it into a spread. You'd have to see how you can make enough from selling puts to cover the cost of the new calls. I always have enough buying power so if I wanted to do this, I could increase my position by selling more puts than I have shares now to get more premium to buy the spread calls at zero cost. \n\nStay on top of managing your positions early, the best time to adjust is when those options become ATM, you'll have more choices. If you only have a cash account, you are very limited on your choices. More money gives you better accounts like portfolio margin which makes you more money at the same or less risk *if you have experience*. \n\nIn the future, try selling covered calls on only part of the position so while you get premium, you also have some shares that can run to the moon . \n\nTldr, get gud, make more money, profit more.",
