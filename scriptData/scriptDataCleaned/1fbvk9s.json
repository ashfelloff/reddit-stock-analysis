They have a duopoly in amoled screens used in phones(Only LG can only make ones in TVs but not smaller ones like in phones )with the other company being BOE Techbology which is chinese and kinda state sponsored. They also are one of the few companies that can make 5g modems with the others being Qualcomm, mediatek, Huwaei and Unisoc but since Huwaei and Unisoc are banned in the USA they have a triopoly there. They also make 5g equipment for telcos but they have low market share but there are rumours they are planning to buy Nokias mobile networks division which would make them  the second biggest one behind Huwaei.\n\nSamsung also has a triopoly in RAM along with SK Hynix(which you also get if you buy EWY or FLKR) and Micron. In flash memory they are in the top 5 along woth SK Hynix, Micron, Western Digital and Kioxia.",

I suspect part of the reason why they just keep pumping more voltage and power through their processors (to the point that they started breaking them) is because they couldn't get a proper sub-10nm node process working with good enough yields for full-rate production, so they had to compensate with essentially trying to squeeze as much as they possibly could out of their existing node.
