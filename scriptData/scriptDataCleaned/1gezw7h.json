But he said hundreds of billions of dollars in investment will be needed to make this a reality. Softbank itself has already made some big bets on AI-powered services, contributing $500 million to an OpenAI funding round that [valued](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-02/openai-has-closed-new-funding-round-raising-over-6-5-billion) the ChatGPT maker at $157 billion.\n\nRead More: [SoftBank’s Son Sees AI Running Households in a Few Years](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-03/softbank-s-son-envisions-ai-running-households-in-next-few-years)\n\n“I’m only focused on that,” he said. “That will change mankind’s future forever.”",

I'm just getting into AI myself, but I'll try to explain.\n\nWhile there are some similarities to the product maturity cycle you mentioned, the convergence hypothesis in AI is a bit different. It suggests that as AI research progresses, different model architectures (like GPT, PaLM, Claude, etc.) might start performing similarly well at core tasks (e.g., generating similar output for a given dataset), regardless of their specific design choices.\n\nThink of it less like product differentiation and more like how computer processors evolved - while early CPUs had wildly different architectures, they eventually converged on some common fundamental principles. In AI, this could mean that the 'secret sauce' shifts from having unique model architectures to having better training data and fine-tuning capabilities.\n\nThis could affect NVIDIA because if model architectures become more standardized, the intense demand for specialized GPUs might slow down, as companies focus more on data quality than raw computing power for model innovation.",

Keep an eye on performamce of models trained on the next order of magnitude of compute as an early indicator of future demand, roughly end of this year and start of next year.
