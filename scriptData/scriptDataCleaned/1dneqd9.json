  "selftext": "This is my official month mark when I began my turn around. Every day since the start of this month period I have only had 2 red days…. Very red days though -2000$ each of the 2 days. But EVERY other day has been green or VERY green. Today I just sold up 1500$…60% of my port this morning. (Let the good times rooooooll) \nThe reason this looks so steady is iv been pulling out gains throughout the way and only holding 2-4k at a time. And only losing half my port at a time max each day. \nThis marks a big turn around for me as iv broken even on my 5 year mark by 300$ so FUCK YES this month has been legit. SPY AAPL NVIDIA calls and puts all based on guts zero logic I AM REGARDED. \nAnyone who says math doesn’t add up is dumb as shit, please read when I say I have been withdrawing gains as I go. Example this morning I started with 4.5k. Deposited 2k and gambled with the other 2.5k. Now I have 4… do it again tomorrow? Let’s try!! ",
