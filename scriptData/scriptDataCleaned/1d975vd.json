Bought various expiration dates for calls. 1 year call strike 650 worth 60k. I have bought and sold various calls along the way and still have other call positions open. So glad to have got in as early as I did, and those that weren't able to I believe you can still ride the train!! All aboard!!\n\nAt any time I've been on 30%-50% margin to squeeze as much profit as i can.",

So at the beginning of the year I bought a bunch of $600 call options Jan 22, 2024 expiring March + the $600 call option exp Jan 2025. Then in Feb I bought $700 call options expiring march.
