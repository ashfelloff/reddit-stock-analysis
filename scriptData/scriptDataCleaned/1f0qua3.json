We‚Äôve had barter systems for thousands of years, they‚Äôre very inefficient. Because you need to find two consenting parties that want to swap assets at a ‚Äúfair price‚Äù. Already, I could try to find somebody willing to swap a stock certificate for an ice cream cone. However, I need to find somebody that has an ice cream cone that I want, who is also is willing to accept a stock certificate at a fair valuation. \n\nIt‚Äôs much easier for me to just sell the stock certificate to a willing buyer for money. And then use that money to buy whatever ice cream cone I want. That is the whole value of mediums of exchange and stores of value. It‚Äôs just too inefficient to find willing trade partners versus settling transactions for money .",
