I sold in the dip... It seems I have some really deep sabotaging mechanisms.\n\n Probably this could lead to gambling addiction .... So I definitely need to stop. I just lost 1000 today and I don't know how to tell my wife. Ok, never again. \n\nIs these kind of contraproductive habits typical for inexperienced investors? There's a whole carrousel of emotions between expectations and reality. \n\n\nEdit 1: The stock is not Nvidia it's Novo Nordisk. I spoke with my wife about the blunder and she's very supportive even in given this thing. On the positive side, I got an offer for a full time position and I decided I will leave the stock market do it's thing while I will passively invest. \n\nThank you for the ones of you supportive and giving advice. Just needed a place to vent it out, it helped a bit",

      "body": "Legend has it that many mutual fund managers have historically 'bought the S&P' and then just sprinkle whatever 'idea' they are working with on top; because they get graded against the S&P for bonuses/promotions and it cuts their job risk, even if the S&P itself goes down they beat it they win. The fund companies have dozens of such traders trying dozens of different ideas because eventually a few will be successful by random chance so they market those to the public. Like the lottery or Vegas, they keep playing the same game long enough, they give all the winnings back to the house. \n\nGeneral best practice: invest in a diversified portfolio and play any hair brained idea using no more than 5% of the portfolio. That allows you to survive through twenty bad ideas. Your pain threshold will be \"what will I tell my wife if this idea takes its value to zero?\"\n\nYou also need to do something about taking emotion out of the trading game. Like set a personal stop-loss level and when any investment hits that level you get out. Do not rely on hope; a stock that goes down 50% takes 100% increase to get you back to even and how many stocks can actually lift that far? Or a stock hits some price plateau suggested by 'experts' and you sell where you watch from the sidelines as a stock continues to go up up up. Let good stocks run and sell before they turn into bad stocks but figure that out ahead of time. \n\nYou'll never catch the top or the bottom but if you can identify turns and get in/out you can succeed. FOMO will obliterate your savings.\n\nAt certain times in boom-bust cycles the general market risks escalate so even the safe wins become loss traps. These are times the trading companies and wealthy individuals are dumping investments to go to cash or assets that are protected in the bad times leaving the general public holding the bag. Think 1929.\n\n.",

      "body": "Losing a thousand is not necessarily a major thing.  It's a matter of the total size of your portfolio.  You lose a thousand of a $5,000 portfolio?  You may have some 'splainin' to do.  You lose a thousand of a $500,000 portfolio?  Probably just market fluctuation.\n\nMy advice as a long-time investor--Start with mutual funds or ETFs.  Build a solid base.  Ignore your friends who claim expertise as they go big win-big loss-big win-big loss and wind up nowhere.  Branch into individual stocks as you learn and as your total portfolio grows.  Never ever buy anything you don't understand, nor any company whose business or product you don't understand (this is why I don't mess with crypto--I just don't get it).\n\nP.S.  I own a little of both NVDA and Novo Nordisk.  I have a big enough portfolio to be able to handle the fluctuations.   NVDA has been berry, berry good to me.",

You need to stop buying high, and then selling when it dips to just rebuy when it's high again. You buy stocks near their averages or after a steep drop, like meta 15% last week, and hold them...",

The next step that normally comes when you're feeling like this is trying to win it all back. That's another way to lose another thousand. I wouldn't say stop trading. Don't be a quitter but just take a step back and let this be a learning experience.",
