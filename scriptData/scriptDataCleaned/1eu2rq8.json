However the real estate market where I live has gone absolutely bonkers over the last decade or so. Rent has also exploded upward. But too much of a good thing becomes less good. Renters feeling the squeeze of cost of living and inflation have started going on \" rent strike\" just not paying, and they can game the system because now it takes a year to get a tribunal hearing for eviction. Interest rates on mortgages have been high so return is  dwindling (here we renegotiate mortgages every 1-5years) lastly the government where I live has changed a number of rules further penalizing landlords, no Air BnB, much higher capital gains tax on non primary residence, 5 months notice of eviction. Too much red tape and hassle in my opinion now to be a landlord.",

          "body": "There are all kinds of wild valuations being tossed around, personally I can see another $10ish spike after launch and unfurling of the satellites. All price models are based on carrier revenue and profit spits and haven't accounted for any military or DOD contracts. \n\n\nThe below post is not my own, but from another user in the AST sub:\n\n\n\"How could we get to $1000 a share…\n\nLet’s say there are 300 million shares, so we need a market cap of $300B. Thats a big company. \n\nTo be valued at a $300B company, let’s assume our P/E. ATT is about an 11, Verizon is a 15, but American Tower is a 40x P/E. Let’s pick an arbitrary 20xP/E since it’s conservative and favoring the carriers and not the growth of AMT. \n\nThat means we need earnings of $15B. AST assumes they will have higher than 95% margins, let’s assume 90%. So we need revenues of $16.6B. Roughly $1.4B a month. \n\nAssuming we are getting $2 a month per customer, we need 700 million subscribers. Our current MNO list with MOUs covers 2.7B cell users. So we need 26% of them to utilize the service. ATT market research says 30-40% of people would be willing to pay for this additional coverage, so there could be potential upside. \n\nDont say that $1000 is impossible without understanding the opportunity. This doesn’t even include what the US government is going to pay for us to be able to track stealth aircraft anywhere in the world…\"\n\n\nConversely, the SP may not fly, but consider that American Tower pays an annual divided of almost $7 a share. If the free cash flow estimates are correct for AST, should they choose to offer dividends it could go brrrrrrrrrrr",
