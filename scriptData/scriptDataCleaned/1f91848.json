      "body": "The “first time entering the top x market cap” logic is a great objective measure to catch rising large caps.  But then you added in a subjective condition that makes the whole thing squishy.  Like, “OF COURSE I wouldn’t but that shitty product from this company that blipped into the top 10 but I’ve never heard of!”  So it’s no surprise that you don’t have any losers.\n\nI’m interested in testing a version that doesn’t need to consumer filter.  It’s not a bad concept at all.  It’s possible you could add a legit backtestable data filter to push it to be more consumer focused as well, but it seems like an unnecessary complication until the simpler strategy is understood to compare to.",
