We were waiting in line to get into a West Hollywood club at 2am (some of us were under 21 and they opened clubs for the under 21 crowd at that time). Two women come up to my friend and me and were like \"can we walk in with you?\" Very clearly a little tipsy but friendly. My gay friend is tall and built,  clearly they were looking for someone to watch out for them or use us to get in lol.\n\nAfter we all get in and disburse, we commented to ourselves \"I think that's the actress from Big Daddy.\" This was probably less than a year before 40 Year Old Virgin came out.\n\nSo, Leslie Mann did get in the club because of us.",
