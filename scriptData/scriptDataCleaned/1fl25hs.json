  "selftext": "PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) (‚ÄúChewy‚Äù), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today the pricing of an underwritten offering of 16,666,667 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, by Buddy Chester Sub LLC (the ‚ÄúSelling Stockholder‚Äù), which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (‚ÄúBC Partners‚Äù), Chewy‚Äôs largest shareholder, at a price to the public of $30.00 per share (the ‚ÄúOffering‚Äù). The Selling Stockholder granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,500,000 shares of Class A common stock. Chewy will not sell any shares of its Class A common stock in the Offering and will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of Class A common stock being offered by the Selling Stockholder.\n\nIn addition, as previously announced, concurrent with the closing of the Offering, Chewy has agreed to purchase from the Selling Stockholder $300 million of Chewy‚Äôs Class A common stock at a price per share equal to the per share purchase price to be paid by the underwriter in the Offering specified above (the ‚ÄúConcurrent Repurchase‚Äù). The Concurrent Repurchase was approved by a special committee of Chewy‚Äôs Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent and disinterested directors not affiliated with BC Partners. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Concurrent Repurchase. The Concurrent Repurchase is being executed separately from the Company‚Äôs existing $500 million share repurchase program authorized on May 24, 2024, which will be unaffected by this transaction. The Concurrent Repurchase is expected to be consummated concurrently with the Offering. The Offering is not conditioned upon the closing of the Concurrent Repurchase, but the Concurrent Repurchase is conditioned upon the closing of the Offering.\n\nPrior to the Offering and Concurrent Repurchase, Chewy had approximately 143 million shares of Class A common stock and 275 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding. If the Offering and the Concurrent Repurchase are completed (assuming no exercise of the underwriter‚Äôs option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock), Chewy will have approximately 160 million shares of Class A common stock and approximately 248 million shares of Class B common stock outstanding. The Offering and Concurrent Repurchase are expected to close by September 23, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nMorgan Stanley is acting as the sole underwriter for the Offering. Chewy has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) for the Offering. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents Chewy has filed with the SEC for more complete information about Chewy and the Offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, Chewy, any underwriter or dealer participating in the Offering will arrange to send you the prospectus supplement and accompanying prospectus relating to the Offering if you contact Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Attention: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014, by email: prospectus@morganstanley.com, or by telephone: (866) 718-1649.\n\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, a solicitation to buy or an offer to purchase or sell any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.",
