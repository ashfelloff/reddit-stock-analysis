                                      "body": "Looking at the daily chart, if we see some sort of short term retracement to the 21D EMA, I’m thinking Aug 16 135C looks good, especially at 9-10.00 per contract, whereas the July 5 150C if bought now are 6.55 per contract.\n\nSure, they’re cheaper and you get the benefit of more upside for less, but you put yourself in a riskier position if the stock trades sideways or has a slight drawdown leading into earnings. The report might be good, but the move you want may not happen, or it may not go up enough in time to compensate for how short dated your contracts are. You can be right and still lose. \n\nLet’s say MU does move as much as we want it in the next 10 days, around 25-30 dollars. A position is taken in the 150Cs tomorrow, and the stock has no drawdown (in theory). Those contracts will move from 6.55 to 22.80. In comparison, a position is taken in the August 135Cs, projecting a slight drawdown of 6% to around the 21D EMA. The entry position would be around 10.57, and again, if the stock moves 25-30 dollars like we want it to, those contracts will be worth around 25-27.00 per contract, in addition to having 50 days to continue holding if you’d like to capture more upside if the earnings report blows out expectations, versus having 9 days. \n\nI think the August calls are better, at least for me. The cost is a bit higher, and the gains may be slightly less or comparable, but the odds of retaining capital is greater if the report isn’t as good since you have more time for the stock to recover.\n\nI think I’ll definitely be playing earnings on this now after doing a bit of research — thanks for the post.",

I like OTM calendars better than butterflies, cheaper to open and more time to sell again if things don't go as planned.\n\nEDIT: Wow $165 strike costs $41 per contract and if expires on 6/28 at $165 strike pays $700.
