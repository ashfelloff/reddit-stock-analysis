Furthermore, sp500 gains like 10% a year, so it's no surprise the average return post fed cut should be positive. Furthermore, corrections and selloffs are swift, so it's entirely possible market could have sold off 10-20%, and then have positive 6-12 month performance \n\nFor example, why did the market sell off when we got a 115k job report and 250k initial claims. Those numbers are good in a normal period. But in this case, it was a deceleration that could overshoot into the recession territory, so market priced in a slight increase in recession odds (not even a lot by the way).The job numbers have stabilized, but if it starts decelerating again(even in a soft landing scenario), the market will sell off again",
