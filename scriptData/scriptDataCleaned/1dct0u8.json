      "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nWe love new and original content here on WSB.\n\nWe have no tolerance for basic templated memes, reposts from the front page, or boomer memes.\n\nYes, this can be a little subjective at times, but we want to show you the best WSB has to offer!\n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to reach out to modmail and we'll give you some pointers!\n\nA few tips though!\n\n• Don't just submit a chart of the current price. Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)\n\n• Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.\n\n• Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",

      "body": "Tesla is definitely one of the most oversold stocks in the market rn. Its latest FSD is insanely good. Considering that they don’t rely on any lidar/radar in their system and only using RGB cameras back in 2019, this is really impressive. Most people doesn’t realize how good fsd is but if you just watch some YouTube testing video, its performance is nothing short of mind-blowing. However, they still relied heavily on car manufacture for their profit rn and Elon is the single point of failure for Tesla. So until they show significantly improvement in fsd revenue and Elon start learning how to behave like a responsible adult instead of acting like a baby in X everyday crying for others attention, I won’t touch Tesla.",
