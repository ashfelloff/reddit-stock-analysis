  "title": "$GOOG Deal and Lina Khan",
  "score": 72,
  "selftext": "Everyone on here has been posting about how to play $GOOG given the news of the Wiz acquisition. \n\nI think that is the wrong approach. We do not know how this deal will be received by the market tomorrow morning. I would wager that the stock will open down, but it is hard to say. \n\nHowever, there is one thing we do know with 100% certainty: Lina Khan is going to investigate the hell out of this deal. It has all the hallmarks of a deal she hates: big tech and potentially anticompetitive \"bundling\". They will 100% try to make a case that trying to tie Google Cloud services to Wiz cybersecurity is anticompetitive. Given the way the polls have been trending, she has to do it soon, too. She may only have three months or so left to make her mark. \n\nI think the play is to wait until the market reacts to the deal announcement tomorrow and then take the opposite side (calls if it opens red, puts if it opens green) in a short term swing trade. We will get valuable intelligence about how the market perceives the deal in the open tomorrow. And, given that information AND the knowledge that an FTC/DOJ \"investigation\" is basically a 100% certainty, we will know how the stock will react when that announcement arrives. Given the magnitude of this deal, the size of the moves will likely be fairly large.",

Khan was nominated and confirmed by Biden\n3. Khan's magnum opus is \"Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\", and feels the world would be better if US big tech is constrained\n4. Alas, that argument fails when constraining US big tech just allows China to fill the void. TikTok, Temu, etc. After the EU crushed its iRobot acquisition, Amazon accurately replied to the effect, \"Congratulations, so now you have made it easier for Chinese cameras to wander through your citizens' houses\"\n5. Trump rhetoric is to try to strengthen USA companies to beat China. Tariffs, reshoring, deregulation, tax cuts, etc\n6. I reckon part of that strategy includes sacking Lina Khan to replace her with someone more industry-friendly who understands it's not USA companies against each other, it's the USA against the world\n7. I feel Google/Wiz will still be progressing through the approval stages by the time Khan gets turfed. In fact, I would reckon that is the reason for why announcing it now. I predict that this acquisition announcement won't be the last coming from big tech either, as Khan sunsets her tenure",
