  "score": 54,
  "selftext": "I'm not going into the whole background of SOFI, but it's a fintech that's at 52 week lows. It's been destroyed since its IPO, struggling in this high-rate environment. Their CEO, Anthony Noto, is a former Goldman bro, who went on CNBC yesterday and was pumping the stock saying that he's disappointed in how the stock has performed given their performance yada, yada, but then stated that under a Trump administration and in a low-rate environment he expects the company to be re-rated by Wall Street. \n\nThe company has been punished by shorts since its IPO with a nearly 19% short float. I believe that Noto will punish the shorts and we'll see a large move in SOFI incoming with CPI numbers coming in cool again. \n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/IrxdJwk\n\nOptions are very cheap. I'm looking at 7 C for 7/19 and 7/26; I also got a few expiring tomorrow that are only 2 cents.\n\nCalled last DD: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dz8haj/event_for_chinese_stocks_third_plenum_july_1518/",
