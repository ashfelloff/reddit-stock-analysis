Now depending on the likelyhood of rain lets say the value of that bet is $10. \n\nYou take that bet and monday goes by and it didn't rain at all. On tuesday the value of the bet goes down to $8 because there are only 4 days left in the week now. So the chances are even smaller. At this point you can accept your losses and sell it for $8 and move on (losing 20% of whatever amount you bet). But you dont do that\n\nTuesday goes by and it didnt rain. So the value of the bet goes down to $6.\n\nWednseday goes by and it didnt rain again so we are at $4 now. You have lost 60% of whatever you bet on\n\nThursday goes by and the same thing. The bet is worth $2 now\n\nNow comes the last day. This is the point most degens like me will come in and say that it will rain today and we yolo our money to it. And some people will wait until the last hour and buy the best for $1 and say it will definitely rain in the last hour.  And it finally rains. The value of the bet skyrockets to $8. If you bought it at the last hour your money just 8xed. The one who bought the bet in the morning for $2 just 4xed his money. And the one who bought it initially for $10 lost 20%\n\nNow this is the scenario where it actually rained which was unlikely and that too in the last hour even more unlikely\n\nWhat happens in most cases is it doesnt rain at all and the bet value goes to $0. Everyone loses whatever they put in. The one who was providing the bet takes all the money \n\nNow in stocks instead of betting whether it will rain or not we are betting on if the stock is going to go up (calls) or down (puts)",

                          "body": "Yes thats where the analogy breaks apart. Everyday it doesn't rain the value of the bet keeps going down. Because there are less days left. The same $10 bet is inherently worth less now. This is called theta decay in options. So the $10 bet is already at $2 by friday. And even if it does end up raining. The value rises from $2 to $8. But the guy who bet on monday still loses money. So to make money you dont just guess if it will rain. You also have to be right when it will rain. Or as close tonit as possible. Which is why most of us lose money\n\nThe bet is more like if it will rain, when it will rain and how much it rains. The more right you are about these the more money you can make. If it rains but much later than you anticipated then you still lose money. If it rains but a few days later and it only rains a little you still lose money. If it rains the moment you bet on and it rains very heavily congrats you just 10xed or even 100xed your money.\n\nThere's a lot more to it and the analogy is far from perfect. \n\nNow if you just want to bet on the direction of the stock you can buy futures instead. There's no theta decay there. So the value of the bet doesnt keep going down with time",

It was worth if for them as today the shares closed at $18.89! So come monday, my avg price for the 100 shares I own will be $19.50. I was willing to take the bet as it looks like we've kind of hit a bottom, but we went a little lower than I expected, that's why I'm on here üêí",
