  "selftext": "Okay so Nvidia did a 10 for 1 split and dropped. CMG did a 10 for 1 split and guess what... Dropped. Both had a pretty good run up to the split taking effect.\n\nAVGO will start trading at a 10 for 1 split on Monday and also had a pretty good run up lately. \n\nNow I'm no 🌈🐻 but what is this group's regarded thoughts on poots on AVGO? I'm thinking a 10/15 percent drop post split. \n\nEDIT: I'm an idiot and miss the 100-ish dump it took end of week 😂",

Several studies have analyzed the impact of stock splits on stock prices and found trends that indicate a typical pattern:\n\n1. **Short-term increase**: On average, stocks tend to see a price increase in the short term following a split announcement and the actual split. This increase is often attributed to the factors mentioned earlier, such as perceived affordability and increased liquidity.\n   \n2. **Long-term performance**: The long-term performance of stocks after a split can vary. Some studies suggest that stocks continue to outperform the market for a period after the split, while others indicate that the effect diminishes over time.\n\nFor instance, a study published in the “Journal of Finance” by Fama, Fisher, Jensen, and Roll in 1969 found that stock splits were followed by positive abnormal returns. More recent studies have generally confirmed these findings, though the magnitude and duration of the post-split performance can vary based on market conditions and the specific company.\n\nIt’s important to note that while historical trends can provide insights, they do not guarantee future performance, and each stock’s reaction to a split can be influenced by a variety of factors.",

Long story short, all their solutions are sold as subscriptions now. No more perpetual licensing. It’s basically a money-printing machine aka predictable revenue stream that they haven’t optimized yet. They also do crazy semi numbers too. Look at a ten year chart and see for yourself. Buy some shares/calls and HODL or find a different ticker, but bet against AVGO at your own risk.",
