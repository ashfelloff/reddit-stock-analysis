  "selftext": "This week could set expectations in the market till the end of the year.  We have five of the Magnificent Seven reporting and big economic news:   \n\nMonday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks & commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.\n\nTuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It’ll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!\n\nWednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!\n\nThursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. \n \nFriday:  The Fed’s favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  \n\nIf your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA’s robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I’m staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.  Opinion only.",
