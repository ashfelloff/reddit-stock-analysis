Which scanners are used does not really determine capability at the moment, it is mainly about economics and throughput in the short term.\n\nIt is mainly a question about already having a lot of older EUV capacity and wanting it all to be interchangeably. That way they can shift capacity between nodes. That is more valuable to TSMC than any savings High-NA potentially offers.\n\nMeanwhile Intel still has to build out considerable EUV capacity. Meaning they are going for High-NA as the target. Since being a late comer to large scale EUV deployment, it makes little sense to build out capacity with older equipment.

      "body": "For those of you who don't know, the foundry business is low-cost, low power, low performance chips that go in things that are not a PC. The market rate for these chips is a few dollars each compared to the $900 you're paying for your i9 unlocked.\n\nThe way you make money and a foundry business is by using old fully depreciated tools so you don't have to expense your depreciation when calculating profit. The raw inputs are basically free, it's sand and water, so you have (made up numbers) $7 of silicon, $3 of electricity, and $40 of depreciation on a chip you can sell for $20 for an operating loss of $30 even though you're making $10 on your raw inputs. TSMC uses old tools so that $40 of depreciation is $0.\n\nWhat I imagine is happening is that Intel is so far behind in the foundry business that they don't want to wait 5 years for old tools, and they have decommissioned all of their unused tools, so they are using new tools and just eating the depreciation expense. The reason 2027 will be profitable is because the tools have a 5-year depreciation schedule and they were purchased in 2022.\n\nThe real test for Intel foundry will be if they can keep their revenue up. If they can't convince enough customers to leave TSMC, the foundry will fail.\n\nEDIT: silicon not silicone. To the multiple people who pointed it out FFS, it's a typo.",
