Sometimes, before something big happens, like a fun event or a surprise, everyone wants to borrow your toy because they think it will be worth a lot during the event.Now, let's say the event passes, and nothing too exciting happens. Suddenly, nobody wants to borrow your toy anymore because the special event is over, and they don't think it's worth as much. \n\nThat's like what happens with \"IV crush\" when you're trading stocks. Before something big, like a company's earnings report, people think the stock's price might change a lot, so they're willing to pay more for options to buy or sell the stock. But after the event, when things calm down, the options aren't as valuable because the chance of big changes has passed. That's the \"IV crush\" ‚Äì the value of those options drops quickly.",
