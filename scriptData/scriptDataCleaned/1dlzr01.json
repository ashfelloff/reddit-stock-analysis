So, U trade on Euronext? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)\n\n**Ubisoft Stock Plummets 15% After ‘Assassin’s Creed Shadows Trailer Debut, And Company Failed To Meet Forecasted Sales Figures**\n\nOn May 15th, Ubisoft’s stock price hit $23.35. By May 16th, the price plummeted $20.02. It went as low as $19.74. As of writing, the price is currently at $21.28.\n\nThe stock price dropped in the wake of Ubisoft predicting the company will only bring in net bookings of $299 million for the first quarter. The company shared its outlook, “Net bookings for the first quarter of 2024-25 are expected to come in at around €275 million ($299 million).”\n\nBloomberg’s Daniel Zuidijk claims this is significantly down from what a number of analysts were predicting. Zuidijk reported, “That compares with an average estimate of €376 million among analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.” €376 million is about $408.7 million.\n\nWhile Ubisoft predicted first quarter bookings would come in lower than expected the company did try to be optimistic about its future outlook with Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Star Wars Outlaws.\n\n\\*\n\nUbisoft Entertainment SA is a French video game publisher headquartered in Saint-Mandé with development studios across the world.
