I am thinking around 50.\n\nMy reasoning is 50 a share is a really good price it has only been higher once or twice. And over the last week the stock can’t seam to break 50. My plan is to buy puts at 48-49 sell them when the stock drops to 44-42. \n\nTheta is expensive for this stock so this is a risky strategy. ",
