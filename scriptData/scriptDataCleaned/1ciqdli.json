They want to crowd source the “killer app” for the device and developers are going to need some time to come up with an idea, and have access to the hardware to actually create and test said app.\n\nNot all that different from the first iPhone which really didn’t do very much other then demonstrate what the future was going to be and let app developers get the app economy started.",

Not terrible but it speaks to a lack of good projects worth investment.\n\nThey are a poor way of returning revenues to investors - just give it through a dividend \n\nThey are done mostly for the short term benefit of management - either to increase the value of their shares or to make them look good by increasing share price\n\nIf a company has no good use for your cash that’s totally fine. Successful companies will by definition generate more cash than is needed for operations. But they should then return that cash to you via dividend rather than buying shares of the company at inflated values in large excess to the intrinsic value.\n\nI’ll add here that companies that buy other stocks or investments - also bad, why would I give a company my money to invest for me. Give the revenues back to the owners and let them invest it themselves.\n\nYet both these practices are rampant these days. And some to very bad ends, like Amazon’s investment in rivian at ATH.",
