This is why, for example, the SEC can regulate crypto despite there being no clear-cut legislation. After this ruling, federal judges now have all the power, the regulators are cucked.\n\nThis feels like uncharted territory. Definitely going to have long lasting and far reaching implications for markets. Our entire legal system just changed overnight.\n\nSmells bullish to me. Less regulation means more innovation. It also means your breakfast cereal will probably give you cancer. Exciting times ahead.\n\nExpect to see more headlines like this one 👇\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o07fkp5snh9d1.jpg?width=1056&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d9963eb1b4ac185203be11c5728324c2bb006a0",

Under the *Chevron* doctrine, the courts would have to defer to the ATF on that decision, despite it being completely ridiculous.\n\n*Chevron* was blatantly unconstitutional when it was decided, even though the *Looper* case did not overturn it for that reason. The Judiciary is vested with the sole authority to resolve any ambiguity in laws passed by Congress.\n\nArticle III, Section 2 of the US Constitution:\n\n>The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States\n\nFederal agencies can continue to rely on experts to create rules and regulations, but those rules must fall under the purview of the laws that granted them the authority to issue them.\n\nAnd boy, if you think a Judge is easy to bribe? The head of a government agency is at least as cheap. Have you seen the revolving door between the FDA and the board of Pfizer? Boeing and the FAA? \n\nThat problem has existed since way before *Chevron* was decided.",

There had to be a certain level of ambiguity to a Congressional-created law in question for their interpretation to be deferred to.\n\nThe aftermath of this means that Congress is going to have to be way more detailed and specific in writing bills, and they're going to probably have to lean on the agencies to help in crafting the wording to maintain accuracy with any original intent.  Seeing how paranoid and skeptical some lawmakers are of anyone who works for a government agency though, I have a feeling we're instead going to see lawmakers be narcissistic and believe they know best (or blindly buy into whatever the lobbyists sell them on).",

My understanding of the ruling is that it takes away authority from federal agencies and gives that authority to federal judges. I work in a field with a good amount of federal regulation and it is very common for a judge to over ride an agency’s “pro business” administrative decision with “environmentalist” justification so it’s difficult for me to see how this is specifically a move that weakens environmentalist protections.\n\nChevron itself was seen as a conservative victory when it passed but obviously the old standard favors whoever controls the federal government and the new framework favors whoever controls the judiciary. I suppose the judiciary is a little troubling now for those that think a stable operating environment favors business since their preferred method of juris prudence is to bust out the ouijia board and divine what was in the hearts and minds of people in the 70s through the lens of the hearts and minds of the founding fathers.",

That is literally why the decision was put into effect in the first place.\n\nWith the help of their congressional aides, they are generally far more educated on these topics than random federal judges, how the fuck of the latter a better solution in your eyes? They also consult government SMEs on draft legislation all the time (both sides). Scientists won't be making any decisions, partisan judges will in unilateral fashion which is incredibly undemocratic and legit legislating from the bench on steroids.\n\nClear judicial overreach with no one well positioned to contest it.",

Saying \"there's no experts now! Nobody is allowed to know anything! Is a wild take. There will be experts, who will argue in court, as it's been done for centuries now.\n\n\nWhat doesn't get to happen anymore is a bunch of open-ended ambiguous nonsense passing legislation to give agencies sweeping powers who then get to run around unchecked doing whatever they want.\n\n\nIs it good to go back on 40 years of precedent? No, it's a mess, but I don't disagree with the premise for why it was done. Agencies never had that power, it's not theirs to have. \n\n\nPeople shrieking about the 1800s when there's \"no regulations!!!!!!!\" As if this ruling didn't happen in the 1980s are just flying off the handle.\n\n\nAs is the idea that corporations can now just run around buying the judiciary, as if government agencies are incorruptible and held to a higher standard than the judiciary.
