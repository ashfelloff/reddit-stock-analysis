That's why US kept increasing restrictions on US tech to prevent it from being exported to China. SMIC is a CHINESE company btw, and they have already successfully become the 3rd biggest global foundry in the world.\n\nWhat you said would have been true before 2022, but now it's been an active concern to US for the past 2 yrs. They aren't even playing catch up anymore, they are aiming to surpass. INTC is a fucking embarrassment compared to SMIC, that's why US is throwing everything in to protect TSMC.",

Biden getting elected would mean reasonable support for Taiwan, which means the Chinese will very likely not attack. On the other hand, with the current state of things, seems Trump is coming again for round 2, which means he'll do a lot of anti-China talking once elected, but barely lift a finger once the invasion actually begins.\n\nSame with the UK - the current Conservatives will provide some kind of support against China, but Labour is loathe to support a war many timezones away. Labour will provide no support to Taiwan, and might even continue business as usual with China, with no sanctions.\n\nThe EU will waggle its penguin flaps and talk some big moral talk, but Scholz and Macron will do jack for Taiwan, except for sanctions on some meaningless goods like Chinese gutter oil or something.\n\nIndia will stand by and watch on as they always do, taking notes as Taiwan falls to ruins. They're definitely not going to start a second front against China.\n\nThe staunchest supporters of Taiwan will be Japan and South Korea, both of which will provide ample kinds of resources for the Taiwanese. Possibly even restart their wartime production to supply the Taiwanese.\n\nThe rest of South East Asia will watch on, as they plan on what positions they would like to get ass-fucked by China.",
