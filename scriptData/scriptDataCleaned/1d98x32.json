I don't know if any company has ever seen such rapid profit expansion like NVDA ever before.\n\nI road AAPL and TSLA up.  Should have diversified them sooner than I did, but similar growth over a really short period for TSLA.  Bought TSLA when the Roadster was released.  When car review sites rated the S as a perfect car, it went up, split, went up, and then split again.  But they didn't grow as quickly and as much as NVDA.  I expect NVDA will probably split again in the next two years as its profits keep going up.  I imagine they will finally have little to no growth or even retraction after two years when either companies aren't purchasing their GPUs like crazy and/or their are lots of other options.\n\nI obviously don't know the future, but nothing yet says it is slowing soon to me.  Hedge that growth bet by selling some of NVDA shares and buy shares in AMD, TSMC, AVGO, and even ARM as those companies begin to capture growth.  Can almost buy one share of AVGO with one share of NVDA...\n\nI tried to play the COVID reopening with some airlines and cruise ships, but they never really went anywhere.  I ducked out of them and then they saw some gains soon after I sold, but for two years my money went sideways.  I feel like this is the most obvious trend and closest sector (and then company) for a sure thing to those of us paying attention to the financial world.  When others start to pay attention, they will push our shares higher.  Again, similar experience with AAPL and TSLA for me.  NVDA is  not a household name to 80% of Americans.  I have CNBC on all the time and my wife doesn't know what NVDA is about or why anyone cares to talk about them.",
