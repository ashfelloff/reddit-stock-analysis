  "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/12/sony-pictures-buys-alamo-drafthouse.html\n\n> For the first time in more than 75 years, a major Hollywood studio will own a movie theater chain. Sony Pictures has acquired Alamo Drafthouse, the seventh-largest movie theater chain in North America, the company announced Wednesday. The cinema company was purchased from owners Altamont Capital Partners, Fortress Investment Group and founder Tim League. Between 1948 and 2020, film distributors were prohibited from owning an exhibition company under what was known as the Paramount Consent Decrees. While studios were permitted to own individual theater locations — Disney owns the El Capitan Theatre and Netflix owns The Egyptian Theatre and New York’s Paris Theater, for example — the U.S. Department of Justice disallowed ownership of a chain of cinemas.\n\n> The decrees were abolished in 2020. Now, some four years later, Sony is the first to invest in a theatrical company. Alamo Drafthouse CEO Michael Kustermann will remain at the helm of the dine-in movie theater chain and will report to Ravi Ahuja, president and CEO of the newly formed Sony Pictures Experiences division. The company’s 35 cinemas will continue to be operated by Alamo Drafthouse and its headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas. “We look forward to building upon the innovations that have made Alamo Drafthouse successful and will, of course, continue to welcome content from all studios and distributors,” Ahuja said in a statement.\n\n> The acquisition comes after Alamo Drafthouse filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2021 due to Covid-19 pandemic disruptions. It was rescued by a private equity firm. However, just last week, five North Texas locations closed after a franchisee filed for bankruptcy.",

Big movies like Marvel or Star Wars the distributor takes more like 90% of the ticket sales. Smaller films with less negotiating power can take closer to only 50%. It also gives them the ability to release smaller films that otherwise couldn't get wide releases. Sony doesn't have a streaming service. They can show classic Sony films as well, which has been a growing part of movie theaters strategy. They also get a bigger data set on movie goers habits. There is a lot of potential strategic advantages to vertical integration for Sony.",
