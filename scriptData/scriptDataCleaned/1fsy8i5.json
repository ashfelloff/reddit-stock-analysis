They can't give out stimmy checks cause there are way too many people in China and Chinese are notorious for saving. They can't subsidise e-commerce purchase as it will create an even bigger oligopoly.\n\nHowever, Chinese people can't resist spending with money that they have won, it can be an upgrade on furniture at home or treating family and friends to a meal. This is Xi's last roll of the dice and he can't afford to fail. No funds will dare to short Chinese stocks. SOE and pension funds are instructed to buyback shares and invest in Chinese companies.
