      "body": ">Sept 11 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Raphael Bostic's trading and investing broke central bank rules, the Fed's in-house watchdog said on Wednesday.\n\n>Bostic created the appearance he acted on confidential information and the appearance of a conflict of interest, in violation of the Atlanta Fed's code of conduct, according to aÂ report by the Office of Inspector General for the central bank.\n\n>However, the report said investigators found no evidence that Bostic in reality used inside information about Fed deliberations or had financial conflicts of interest.\n\n>The Fed official relied on investment managers and did not have the ability to direct specific trades, the report said.\n\n>Bostic \"was nonetheless responsible for ensuring that all trades and investments made on his behalf complied with all applicable rules, including the provisions addressing appearance standards.\"\n\nOk, so this is a \"Caeser's wife must be above suspicion\" type situation, fair enough.\n\n>Trades on Bostic's behalf took place during prohibited \"blackout\" periods around Federal Open Market Committee meetings 154 times between March 2018 and March 2023, investigators found.\n\n154 times?!\n\n>He also filed inaccurate disclosure forms, held more Treasury securities than allowed and twice executed trades that were different than those that he sought central bank clearance for.\n\nUh, yeah, fire his ass. Honestly, you shouldn't even be allow to have actively managed investments in his role, even if they're managed by someone else. Index funds only please.\n\nAlso why are they allowed to hold any Treasuries? That's a direct conflict of interest.",
