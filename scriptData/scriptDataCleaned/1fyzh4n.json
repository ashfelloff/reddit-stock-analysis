Why is he dumping stocks like mad and putting them into short term money market/government treasuries? Doesn't he know it will be inflated away over time. What a regard, if he just put that money into 0dts, he could be the world's first trillionaire. /s",

This doesnt necessarily mean he is waiting for a crash and knows that something is gonna happen. Its just harder to rationalize investment decissions.\n\n2) he has also said that investing becomes harder due to the size of the company - sometimes there just arent that many great investing opportunities and you might end up at a point where you have \"too much\" money to invest it all. If you have 100k to invest its relatively easy, but it becomes a totally different story when you are talking about billions to invest.",

If the building itself appreciates over time you know the market is upside down, that's like a car appreciating.\n\nSo if your average property (= building + land) appreciation is 3%, that's way too much.

                          "body": "You're talking like the returns in real estate aren't good. Your points are valid if you are comparing stocks to REITs. Many many people have made insane amounts of money in real estate for good reason. Here are some other points i would add comparing them to stocks:\n\n- cash flow isnt how most people make money in real estate. They even typically get as big of a loan as possible and the cash flow barely covers it by maybe just 20% (debt coverage ratio). Money is made on appreciation of the asset which is where the money is made\n\n- 1031 exchanges and tax deferral mean you can buy/sell property without taking huge tax hits like for stocks\n\n- Increasing cash flow just a little bit has huge consequences on the value of the property. Every increase in $1k/month in cash flow corresponds to a ~$200k increase in property value (for a 5 cap property)\n\n- after increasing the value of a property, you can refinance it, getting as big a loan as possible, and use that money to buy additional property\n\n- you have a lot more power in your own hands to make money on your asset (e.g. you can turn a property around). Cant really do that with stocks",

The methods for gaining wealth are different in each and each has validity dependent on many different requisite factors.\n\nHowever I should point out that $1,000 increase in cash flow only represents a $20,000 increase in property value for a 5 cap property. And 20:1 is not a bad return. However it should be noted that the one does not drive the other. What is the driver is the cap rate or the ratio between the income and property value. Cash flow can quite conceivably increase by $1,000 on a maximum valued property without any increase in property value at all. In this case the cap rate would increase versus the cited and unlikely case that the cap rate would remain consistent with the value increasing when the income increases.  Although cap rate can be calculated the resultant calculation is a rough estimate, or maybe a goal, for where income is, or should be, related to value and not really the other way round.",

Cap rate is basically the first thing you see when browsing properties on loopnet/redfin/etc and a key selling point. It corresponds to return on investment which is very important for most people. Also people compare cap rates to interest rates at the time to see how big of a loan they can get given a debt coverage service ratio. \n\nAlso, maybe you thought i said $1k/yr, that would be roughly equal to $20k. But $1k/month is $12k/yr. And $12k/.05=$240k, but then i rounded down to $200k to account for that they're not exactly linked 1:1. That being said, increasing cash flow by $1k/month may not exactly be easy with the size of a building, tenant laws in the area, etc.",

If an insurance has like a million houses insured in cyclone-prone areas like Florida, it risks having to shell lots of tens of billions of dollars in damages if things go south and going bankrupt.  So what does insurances do is that they insure themselves for such things. This is a very profitable business for Berkshire because Berkshire can charge premiums others can't. Why is that? Because Berkshire is the only company in the world with enough cash to pay if things turn bad. Those companies that look for reinsurance need to sleep knowing that their own insurance will pay no matter what. And the pool of companies that can give you those guarantees in the world is extremely limited. In fact, if you look at their balance sheets in detail, you'll notice that the actual amount of money available is a small fraction of their cash and short-term investments (few tens of billions), while the large majority is indeed locked as collateral. Berkshire does this with any kind of insurer out there, not just home insurers and such.\n* Buffett is bearish and doesn't find current valuations anywhere near fair.\n\nIf I had to give my 2 cents, I just don't find Buffett's stock portfolio movements in the last 5 years to be very well managed. The overwhelming majority of things didn't perform anywhere near the sp500 average. Some others good cows have been sold way prematurely (Apple is the latest example, he's missed a 40B+ capital gain in the last year), but that's a pattern of bad choices he started long ago (such as selling McDonald's which outperformed the market for decades to come in total returns (so reinvesting the dividends)). He keeps buying and buying oil during a switch to electric vehicles and when production capacity is at all times high (there's at least another 15 to 20M barrels capacity per day right now, untapped) and predicted to further increase in non-OPEC countries, but it doesn't look like crude has that many chances to stabilize at 100$+ to make those investments really pay off imho.",

There’s literally no evidence that there’s going to be a better substitute global reserve currency anytime soon. Zero. People have been speculating about this for ages and made no progress.

      "body": ">Doesn't he know he should just put it into an S&P500 and hold it long term to get 8% or put some of it into NVDA, or SMH or something? \n\nThis is not true because the market is overvalued. The NVDA company is not worth $3 trillion, that's an artifact of stocks priced at the margin. For individual retail traders this doesn't matter, they can always close their positions at a profit. If you sell a NVDA stock then there will always be a buyer available for that stock at the current market price.\n\nBut this is different when you have $100 billion worth of NVDA stock and want to cash in on your paper profits. The situation is analogous to having a savings account at an insolvent bank.  As a small account holder, you can get out before the run on the bank starts. But if you are holding a huge amount of money then you cannot withdraw your money if the bank is insolvent, because the bank simply doesn't have the money that your account statement says belongs to you.\n\nIn case of NVDA, the $3 trillion market cap is unrealizable fiction. If Buffett were to buy into that, he would effectively be bailing out many investors who would otherwise have had to deal with the stock correcting by 50% or more later. Once Buffett has bought NVDA, the paper value of his investment could be increasing for a while, but he would never be able to get back more than, say, 50% of that investment.",
