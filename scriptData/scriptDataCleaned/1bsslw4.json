I am US based, and the only thing I’ve been able to find is UK based index’s. \n\nAnyways looks like a potential 10 bagger loading up on put leaps \n\n\nThe play would be shorting cocoa because of these extreme factors \n\nEl Niño-induced heavy rains, crop damage, and the spread of black pod disease.",

They will grow or buy other crops that can feed their bellies. That's the entire point of the argument you are missing.\n\nWest Africans nations are pivoting away from the concept of cash crops because inflation is fucking them sideways if it comes to normal consumer goods. High grain prices caused by the Ukraine war is speeding things up. They are forced to drop the Cash Crop business in order to stabilise domestic food inflation. \n\nHigh price lower demand yada yada...prices stabilise. We get it. You can't lower the price of goods if said product isn't produced or isn't available. There is a reason why it spiked so high in the first place. Developed countries love chocolate too much.\n\nHonestly It will just turn into a luxury product in the end if there's still sizable demand for it. You can't outright delete Chocolate out of the western consciousness. It's pretty popular and will remain so.\n\nI can tell you what will happen. Candy makers will raise their prices 20-30% so that it won't piss of the high income markets too much....and take a hit on their already high profit margins.\n\nOnly hope for lowered prices is the South American market but their output is even lower than usual till late 2026/early 2027. \n\nThe Cocoa price will remain high and get into maximum overdrive starting in the next decade. Will most turn into a luxury good in the end.",
