But maybe you're on Medicare and you're just old and you have multiple aliments and can't navigate another bureaucratic mess.\n\nAnd I guarantee drug costs would be a lot lower if Uncle Sam was negotiating on behalf of all of Medicare. Sure BCBS could tell Bayer to piss off, they're going with Pfizer for a drug (if an alternative exists). But the individual insurers will never have the negotiating power the US Government would if they were negotiating a drug formulary for all Medicare recipients.\n\nAnother waste that comes to mind is sober homes.

Rolling Stone had a good article on it but I can't find the link for it.  \n\nThere are other messed up aspects to US healthcare, but those two examples come to mind.",

Yet the boomers had a higher turnout because the % of Millennials who voted were lower. This was during 2020 when most people got their info via internet/tech which boomers weren't good with, social services like free transportation was much more limited due to covid, and boomers had to go out at the risk of getting covid which could end a boomer but was mostly amounted to some coofs for Millennials. And boomers still voted more. \n\nSo when Dems and Reps shoot down student loan forgiveness so they can fund more medicare/socialsecurity for boomers, when hiking rates hurts millennials who need to borrow but lowering inflation helps boomers who don't work anymore the most, when old men decide tiktok is not good for the young even as they bankrupt the fucking country while passing the bill to those young, etcetc. Am I supposed to feel bad for my fellow Millennials?

I GUARANTEE you if even 50% of the GOP cunts and the 3 dems who voted against student loan forgiveness got fucked by losing their jobs?!?!?!

And entitlement spending is like the second largest portion of the pie or something.\n\nThe real point is that interest expense on debt (not even principal repayment) is becoming a larger and larger portion of the budget. \n\nMeaning that just to maintain current levels of federal spending on healthcare and social security - you’re going to need tax increases. And then….you could try to only cut from defense spending, but….at some point you can’t cut defense spending and you still haven’t resolved the main issue which is the growing portion of the budget related to debt. \n\nIMO we are getting close to the point where you can’t do tax increases OR spending cuts….you need to do tax increases AND spending cuts.\n\nAnd even then - that might only be enough to balance the budget.\n\nWhat the US really needs is some sort of magic trick where there is material GDP growth while there’s increased taxes and reduced spending to get anything under control.\n\nEdit: looks like social security, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare….etc are 50% of the federal budget. National defense is 13%. Interest is 11% (and growing)\n\nSource: https://www.federalbudgetinpictures.com/where-does-all-the-money-go/#:~:text=In%202023%2C%20major%20entitlement%20programs,such%20as%20national%20defense)%20combined.&text=What%20Funds%20the%20Federal%20Budget%3F",
