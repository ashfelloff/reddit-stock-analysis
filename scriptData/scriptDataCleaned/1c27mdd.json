I asked if he was closing his trade and moving on and he said he wasn‚Äôt taking profits and was riding the swing trade with a price target of 45-55‚Ä¶(27% over the analysis average and 22% over the highest analyst target).\n\nYesterday he started plugging his weird channel again so I asked him which part of his TA led him to believe that SPR shares would pop 10%+ in a day off of Boeing acquisition news, and this goon absolutely had no idea what I was talking about.

Meanwhile anyone that has a single ridge in their brain can check a chart and see that SPR is up \\~23% since December. It‚Äôs worth mentioning that being up since December is not even noteworthy because the entire market has been running hard since November so it‚Äôs literally expected. Also basically every airline stock has been performing well in the same time frame‚Ä¶\n\nThis goober was up a whole 4% before news broke that he wasn‚Äôt even paying attention to that even made the trade worth anything.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4hj8z0wnj2uc1.jpeg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d027785c87c3d3102d1b8ebd3126cc98dc23b6ed",
