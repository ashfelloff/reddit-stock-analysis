  "selftext": "So after NVDA tanked massively in After Hours, when earnings were released, on laughable volume of about $50m, I wonder if what we‚Äòve seen yesterday is just a whole lot of unjustified FUD and if NVDA is oversold. Yeah the earnings didn‚Äôt blow everything away, but it was a beat on par with the last ones. \n\nI mean you‚Äôve seen the massive amount of call options that have been held before earnings. Could it all just have been a massive coup by big institutions to dump the stock price after hours on minimal volumes kicking off a sell off, so that they don‚Äôt have to cover all the long positions they sold? \nProbably I‚Äòm completely regarded for thinking this, but if that‚Äôs the case, it would mean the big players still believe in NVDA and could start pumping the stock as soon as the big hump of options has expired worthless. \n\nWhat do you think?",
