          "body": "I'm sorry your first attempt went in the red so quickly. But it had to happen, eventually. This is one of the basic lessons in investing - being able to stay calm while in red (not panic sell). You just need to have a rough idea, whether the red is a permanent trend (bubble finally popping for good or company going out of business) or just a temporary excursion from a long-term upside trend. (I honestly have no idea in case of Nvidia, it's just human psychology/sentiment analysis at this point)\n\nSelling when in red (or via stop-loss triggers) is how people with low conviction get shaken out of their positions, leaving whatever money they lost for others to pick up.\n\nIn case you have high conviction, but the company is going downhill (and/or the bubble is definitely over), you become a so called \"bag holder\" (hoping for it to break even further down the road, possibly having your money stuck there for years).\n\nYou may get more comfortable as you sprawl into more tickers, provided they are not highly correlated and don't move together. Seeing a mixture of red and green tends to be less depressing.",
