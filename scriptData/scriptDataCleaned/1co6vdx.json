      "body": "I just finished listening to reminisces of a stock operator the semi fictional biography of famous stock speculator Jesse Livermore. \n\nTowards the end he talks about stock manipulation. He says that manipulation that is aimed at selling in bulk has gotten a bad wrap, that by default the seller is looking for speculators to sell to, men who will run a higher risk on their capital for a high return. \n\nHe had little sympathy for the man who, knowing that was the game, played anyways then blamed someone else when he lost. They are clever as the devil when they win but when they lose it‚Äôs always someone else‚Äôs fault. It was manipulated.\n\nNow Jesse himself did manipulate stocks in ways that are now illegal, like running the tape where he would buy big end of day so people would just see the large ending close and buy then he would offload to them. \n\nBut regardless I find it interesting that even 100 years ago highly thought of traders would have basically called you a little bitch for complaining that your losses were the fault of hedge funds propping up markets for exit liquidity. \n\nIf you know that‚Äôs the case and you play anyways your losses are your own.",
