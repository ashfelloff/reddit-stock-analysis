No. I have no idea which way it will go. I have not looked into the company's fundamentals or \"word on the street\" so I have no idea. Good luck with your earnings play.",

Discretionary spending reductions are not linear.\n\nWhen times are good and the money is pouring in, a lot of people just aren't careful with money. They don't think \"why am I buying a ¬£5K Omega when a ¬£20 Casio keeps time as well as it?\", they just know there's plenty of money come in, so they buy the Omega. Or, they buy ¬£70 Lululemon yoga pants instead of ¬£20 Sports Direct ones. Is there any intrinsic difference as far as doing yoga between the two? Do those Lululemon ones include some mithril that means they last 4 times as long? No, You're just paying for a logo, for a fancier shop.\n\nBut there are cheaper luxuries, or things that offer a real benefit to people. Still luxuries, but people are going to cut the stupid stuff out before they cut that stuff. Like a family that does a flight at Thanksgiving to see Grandma is going to really try and retain that. They could not do it, but it's at the least discretionary spending.",
