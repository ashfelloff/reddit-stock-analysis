Some people fly for family or work even during a pullback but tourism may slow down.\n\n>The Boeing blowouts were given extensive media coverage\n\nPeople are still flying, they're just avoiding certain Max jets.\n\n>Oil prices are pissing through the rooftops.\n\nJet fuel prices are high but still lower than they were in 2022. They're about the levels of 2011-2014.\n\n>DAL is near the price it was the last time it went back into the shit hole.\n\npast results are no guarantee of future returns.\n\nDoes any of this mean DAL share price will go up or down? No. I have no idea which way it will go. I have not looked into the company's fundamentals or \"word on the street\" so I have no idea. Good luck with your earnings play.",

Discretionary spending reductions are not linear.\n\nWhen times are good and the money is pouring in, a lot of people just aren't careful with money. They don't think \"why am I buying a £5K Omega when a £20 Casio keeps time as well as it?\", they just know there's plenty of money come in, so they buy the Omega. Or, they buy £70 Lululemon yoga pants instead of £20 Sports Direct ones. Is there any intrinsic difference as far as doing yoga between the two? Do those Lululemon ones include some mithril that means they last 4 times as long? No, You're just paying for a logo, for a fancier shop.\n\nBut there are cheaper luxuries, or things that offer a real benefit to people. Still luxuries, but people are going to cut the stupid stuff out before they cut that stuff. Like a family that does a flight at Thanksgiving to see Grandma is going to really try and retain that. They could not do it, but it's at the least discretionary spending.",
