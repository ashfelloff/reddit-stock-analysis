  "selftext": "The market was overly bearish for stupid reasons. Nvda hit 90 pre market, AMD $115, and SPY $508. The regards were already pricing in a recession and those who were overleveraged on Japan loans liquidated. Easy dip buying opportunity. The manipulators were successful today, pumping out so much FUD it caused a dominos effect of negative news across all media platforms scaring the regards to panic sell. Congrats on those who saw through the bullshit and bought these lows, as of now its much higher. Remember, what drives stocks up is good earning, if they are still growing and printing money a stupid overreaction sell off is a buying opportunity.",
