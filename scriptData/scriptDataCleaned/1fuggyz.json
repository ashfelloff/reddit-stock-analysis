          "body": "Think about the goal you're trying to achieve. To make money day trading, you want to take advantage of the movement of a stock. The larger the movement, the more of a chance to make money. This is known as volatility. Stocks that have recently had good days are likely to have more if you catch it soon enough. These are top daily performers. Cheap volatile stocks that have performed well recently, will give you a chance to buy a large amount of shares, so if they go up a dollar or so you make at least $300. Some of the stocks that performed well the day before will continue for two more days. Some will spike in the morning and drop off immediately. Some may even drop as soon as the market opens. Selling during the morning spike ensures you get small profits, but try to give it a little bit of time if you can to see if it looks like the day will keep trending upward. If it starts sinking as soon as you buy, get out ASAP. Unless you see the price rising more than sinking. After watching the market from the start of the day to the end a few times, it'll be pretty obvious if it's going to go your way or not. You'll see stocks going up past the morning spike tend to keep going up. Stocks going down at the beginning of the day tend to keep going down. I think it's a safer strategy to bet on obvious trending movements rather than trying to think you'll predict a reversal. That's some people's entire strategy. I'm a gamer, I'm just trying to farm easy cash within the rules of the game. It doesn't have to be sophisticated or pretty. Experiment with the simplest strategy you can find. It'll be nerve racking at first but if you really pay attention and learn from your mistakes, and your wins, you can end up winning more than you lose. There will most likely never be a day in which all the top performing stocks one day, tank the next day. Some of them will, but I notice that if I pick a few from that list and the first one doesn't work, usually the next choices do. Don't look for a stock that has just spiked for a second during the day. Find one that has a strong consistent upward trend throughout the day. Your instincts will be that you're buying too high. Like Tom Hougaard says, the market isn't a grocery store, you're not trying to find a bargain. Just because it's more expensive today than it was yesterday doesn't mean your chance to capitalize on its performance is over.",

Yes Robinhood, no Fidelity.\n\nFidelity: Short selling, uncovered option writing, option spreads, and pattern day-trading strategies all require extension of credit under the terms of a margin account and such transactions are¬†not permitted in a cash account.\n\nRobinhood: Your account will be flagged for pattern day trading if you make 4 or more day trades within 5 trading days, and the number of day trades represents more than 6% of your total trades in that same 5 trading day period. This rule only applies to margin accounts and IRA limited margin accounts.\n\nCash accounts aren't subject to pattern day trading regulations. No trading with unsettled funds from stock and options sales. Stocks and options take 1 trading day to settle.\n\nSo as long as you wait for the cash to settle you're good. Try to use only 1/2 your cash each trade if you want to trade every day. If you want to do two trades per day, use 1/4.",
