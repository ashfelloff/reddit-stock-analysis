Every claim is going to result in a rate increase and bird flu outbreaks are not some act of god, the farms should have strict programs in place to mitigate the chances of an outbreak and if the insurance finds evidence these policies weren’t followed to a T they no doubt have it in the policy that they can increase rates more, lower their payout, or outright reject the claim on the grounds of policy violation. \n\nI’m so fucking sick and tired of redditors pretending insurance is some magical pot of free money even in finance subs of all places 🤡",
