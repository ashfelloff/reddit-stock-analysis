Modern games have a ton of acting, hell, load up Cyberpunk or any AAA action RPG that came out in the past decade and it’s loaded with acting.\n\nThis is just another self serving executive trying to destroy the art in gaming to maximize profits.  When this AI stuff kicks off full force in gaming every quest or mission is going to be like a low quality Skyrim radiant quest, nothing but bare bones “go here, kill X, grab y, return to z” mechanics.",

If devs did it then it would have taken insanely more effort cause they dubbed it to over 10 languages and all dialoguesa are first person.\n\nThey also recently used AI to reuse voice of a dead character. I'm convinced that AI has been used to write lines for NPCs. I think CCDPR/Larian devs also said AI is really bad for writing actual stories but could be useful as tools for various things. And whole DLSS frame gen uses AI to create frames.\n\nSo AI is really powerful if used correctly and used for non-cost cutting reasons. Hopefully that is how it is used.",
