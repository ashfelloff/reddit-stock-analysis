This week my stoplosses hit and I lost 6% of my portfolio. It's unfortunate, but 1 good trade and I've made back more than that.\nWhy 2%? Because 2% is a small enough number to not have an exponential impact, if you lose 2% and gain 2% you're still in the sale place. If you lose 6%, you need to gain 6.4% to break even.
