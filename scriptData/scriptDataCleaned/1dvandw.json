Around the same time it was released, John Foley (then CEO) made the decision to offer full refunds for any Tread+ that had been purchased. So people who had bought one in the years before could get money back and the warehouses were full of them waiting to get scrapped. Not even a year later almost all of the main warehouse hubs had been shut down or taken over by third parties and most of the employees laid off. All in all I think over 70 animals and 5+ kids were killed by the tread+ so not having a solid rear guard was a massive oversight and basically the main reason the company is where it is now. This boy got really lucky the ball provided a way for the tread to come off the ground and give him a way to escape. Last I heard he had some pretty serious injuries. I hope he’s doing alright now.",

There was an absolutely incredible set of projects under warp speed during the pandemic.\n\nThis was split between a few things:\n\nOne group was working on knowledge transfer and discovery.  Trying to understand everything possible about the pathogen.  Corporations supplemented any lack of equipment with academia, who had equipment but no students.\n\nAnother focused on diagnostic testing.  First trying to find a test that would work, then finding some that worked at scale, then finding some that were economical and didn’t have supply chain issues.\n\nA third group focused on vaccine science.  This leveraged the knowledge cohort on top of other scientists that used their experience in matching vaccines with viruses to find technologies that would work as well as longevity (lasting thru mutations) and supply chain friendliness.\n\nYet another group focused on treatment; drugs that could actually be used to shorten the duration of or offset Covid’s effects all together.  This was largely regeneron and a couple others.\n\nOne final group focused on long covid/after effects.  Focusing on how to prevent future occurrences / side effects of covid or to stop the mutations. \n\nThere was a sister program in Europe called light speed (they developed the BioNTech / Pfizer vaccine.) and it was a true private public consortium.  You had meetings weekly with heads of governments, government agencies, research organizations, corporations, supply chain and regulatory agencies.  All working together. \n\nThis died when warp speed was replaced with an “advisory board” which basically only existed to take credit for everything while making deals to enrich the members.  All of a sudden, everyone stopped working together and every ounce of motivation to keep going was vaporized.  That’s why there isn’t a cure for covid, why practically nobody is looking into long covid or studying the side effects, and why innovations (like convalescent plasma) are collecting dust on shelves.\n\nMy time with warp speed was amazing.  I saw things I thought were impossible.  Then these assholes came in and ruined everything.",

Skype for Business was a completely separate product & not great as Microsoft did so little to improve it in the 10 years since purchasing it. It was slow & buggy with lots of limitations that Zoom didn’t have like the caps on people in a call. In the private sector lots of companies adopted the more modern Zoom during COVID when Skype was right there, a literal verb. Why?\n\nMicrosoft made the TERRIBLE decision of discontinuing Skype when they rolled out Teams, but Teams wasn’t ready or feature rich yet. My org was forced to adopt beta Teams & it was a nightmare in the beginning. \n\nSkype is the answer. Microsoft dragged their feet on development of Skype due to their plans on integrating the technology, the market share opportunity of a lifetime fell into their laps & they were caught with their pants down, forced to rollout Teams before the video call app was ready.",
