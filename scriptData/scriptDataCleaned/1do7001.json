      "body": "The novelty of Gilead's new PrEP option appears to be that it is twice yearly instead of monthly or daily. That will help considerably with adherence. Existing PrEP options already had a 99.9% prevention rate (if taken as prescribed).\n\nStill, I wonder if their new drug is susceptible to loss of efficacy in the same way that tenofovir is in the presence of inflammation. It is also likely susceptible to the same social stigma that affects individuals seeking access to Truvada. Long-acting injectables are also objectionable to some individuals who prefer on-demand pharmacologic solutions rather than having a drug in them (and any side effects) for half a year - I was at a conference in the past couple of years where all of the scientists were thrilled at the possibility of monthly injectable drugs, but community advocates advised the need for more options to fit varying lifestyles and needs.\n\nFinally, it is not a cure. It's a new form of preventative drug. (just in case anyone's not memeing)\n\nOverall a great development and many people will surely be helped. If scientists can jump to the conclusion that long-acting injectable PrEP will change the game, the general public will too. PrEP was and is THE tool that I believe will lead to the eradication of HIV, and Gilead's findings will help since it's another powerful tool, but this is NOT a cure or the end of HIV.\n\nAlso FYI, finding a vaccine or cure to HIV is going to be the greatest challenge known to man in terms of curing viral infections. If we find a way to do that, we'll have the tools to eradicate every virus that afflicts us. Buy buy buy any company that actually figures that out.",
