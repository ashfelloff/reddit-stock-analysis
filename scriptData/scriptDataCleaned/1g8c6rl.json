If you compare the expenses, reach, and revenue potential, choosing Netflix to distribute your film is unmatched. Right now, they don’t have any real competition. The film industry is driven by volume, and with more subscribers, Netflix can offer more money to secure top-tier films. This makes it increasingly difficult for new streaming services to compete. While there are many streaming platforms, most rely on older films; eventually, they’ll have to sell their rights and risk becoming irrelevant.",

I mean there’s whole cottage market of VPNs that solely advertise themselves as a way to get international Netflix content. A lot of the shows we have to subscribe to 12 different services to watch are still on Netflix internationally and those services aren’t outside the US. \n\nPeople complain about the price but if you look at the same options across the big platforms, it’s right in line. Netflix ad free is $15.99. Hulu ad free is $18.99, Disney+ ad free is $15.99. HBO Max $16.99. Prime Video ad free is $12 although I’m sure most just have full Prime at $15/month. Netflix is also old enough that I bet there’s a ton of folks out there who have simply forgot they have an account still or it falls into the *might as well* category.",
