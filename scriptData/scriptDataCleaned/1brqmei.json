The only useful thing is total average return, you don't get to pick just the days you like from among the thousands and thousands of individual days.\n\nSure, if you managed to keep your on the money in the market but just exit just before the 10 best days of all time, you'd miss out on all these gains.  Like no shit, if I played roulette for ten hours but managed to miss all of the spins where it landed on my number I'd have shitty results too.

Trying to time the market is a fool‚Äôs errand, because you have to be right twice; when to get out, and when to get back in. The odds are you will miss some of the best days by being on the sidelines to wait for the perfect time to get back in. I‚Äôve had to relearn this lesson a couple of times. I correctly called the dot com bubble, but waited too long to get back in and sucked hind tit with too many bonds when it eventually ground  higher. Experience is what teaches you to recognize you‚Äôve made the same damn mistake again.",
