  "selftext": "Half of the Fortune 500 companies - [80% of financial and tech firms, 60% of healthcare providers, and most major airlines](https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/crowdstrike-outage-hits-us-hospitals/721887/) - are CrowdStrike clients.  They pay CrowdStrike handsomely to prevent disruptions. Instead **CrowdStrike caused the most critical IT disruption in history.**\n\nVarious [hospitals](https://archive.ph/GT2Q2), banks, and [911 emergency services](https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/global-outage-intl-hnk#h_174295b0a06aa40a529725b3bc807825) are processing everything without computers. Worldwide IT teams are looking at [days or weeks manually fixing each computer](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/statement-on-falcon-content-update-for-windows-hosts/\n). \n\n**This is a trillion dollar fuckup that likely killed people.**\n\nThey will be sued. \n\nIT admins everywhere will reject their product moving forward and switch to SentinelOne, Carbon Black, or other competitors. (if you don't believe me, check /r/sysadmin) \n\n**Yet their stock is only down 10%.**\n\nWith a staggering [PE ratio of 609](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/crwd/price-earnings-peg-ratios). \n\nWhat is going on?!",

Retailers quickly buy calls and the instituions just massively sell off the stock instead and fuck all the TSM boys in their butthole.\n\nTesla going down from bad sales and robotaxi delay? Nah, stock goes right back up and only ones who profit are those who sold beforehand 1 minute before the news.\n\nBoeing getting criminal charges? Nah, they buy the stock instead and fuck dem retail put holders.\n\nCrowdstrike going down? Nah, they again quickly buy the stock at market open to fuck over all the retailers buying puts.

The stock market is purely speculative, if you, as a casual investor, are thinking about investing in a safe bet, you must assume that many other professionals have already acted accordingly and it is too late. Only an idiot or rather a gambler would buy options considering fundamental logics like record profits of the companies, good or bad news about the products or the company,etc. If it were that easy, all traders would be millionaires based on things that don't affect stock prices, like stock fundamentals.",

Other tools just don't come anywhere close to what crowd strike does.  It's pretty integral to what cyber security teams do.

Yeah, they are over valued and people will be looking at future revenue losses due to losing potential new customers. But - \n\n\n1: They probably will not lose as many existing customers as you might think, especially large companies. Making infrastructure changes is expensive as fuck and while it seems like the obvious thing to do would be to find a different security *cough cough ^spyware cough* company regardless of the cost, companies are often short sighted and most execs simply just won‚Äôt want to spend the money. \n\n\n2: this is going to be a one time error on the part of Crowdstrike. No way will they not be implementing preventative measures‚Ä¶ or at least they will probably successfully sell that idea to existing customers. \n\n\nHonestly, as someone that works in IT myself, I cannot even fathom how the FUCK this error was even possible to begin with. Not testing the update on all OS platforms prior to launching the update affecting so many major companies - to say it is insanely reckless doesn‚Äôt even come close. \n\n\n3: The stock did drop ~10% and then stayed pretty flat the rest of the day.  I‚Äôm very surprised it didn‚Äôt take a much bigger hit.  If more investors didn‚Äôt sell on Friday, why would they sell this coming week?   To be clear, I think more investors WILL sell this coming week but just not as many as one would think. \n\n\nJust to note, I have no position in CRWD. In fact, if I had the money I would be looking at PUTS expiring a few months out although I would also probably wait a bit to see if a little bull trap is coming just to make PUTS less expensive.  On the other hand, IV isn‚Äôt too terribly high now given what‚Äôs happened so‚Ä¶ who knows?\n\nIf this fuck up results in a major slow down or reversal in revenue growth then we‚Äôll really see the stock take a hit but we may not know that until earnings. \n\n\nFinally, I am only bearish on this company, I‚Äôm only saying that it may not be wise to buy far OTM PUTS expiring in a week or two.",

HUGE fuckup. But no cyber company that is old and established and has any credibility is free from fuckups. Literally zero companies. If they say they don't fuck up, they are either brand new, no one uses them, they're lying, or a combination of those three. AWS. Microsoft. McAfee (at the height of their powers too). They've all had huge institutional fuckups. This is not new and will continue. Impossible to avoid this 100% of the time. \n\n‚Ä¢ Respectfully, the decisions to carry a cyber vendor aren't made at the IT admin level. CrowdStrike is an expensive product, and contracts could well be into the millions. CTOs care about efficiency, effectiveness, and headcount needed to monitor threats, both things CrowdStrike has been able to attach to their business case and where they generally beat the competition. While this is (again) a HUGE fuckup, companies can't just terminate contracts and switch over to a new vendor like an Uber ride. Imagine how difficult it is to say, switch your cable provider. Multiply that by a factor of several million and you have cyber vendors. \n\n‚Ä¢ There's a lot of people calling for blood out there, and while I'm no lawyer, contracts in the cyber and software space generally indemnify for this type of thing. Sure, there may be an enterprising law firm who takes a class action and execs are likely to be dragged before Congress to be scolded, but the actual money paid by the company to affected users will likely be little to nothing.\n\n‚Ä¢ The news cycle these days is fast, fast, fast. Sure people are pissed, but one of the former Presidents was almost assassinated less than 10 days ago and that's borderline out of the news cycle. While this will be an interesting case study and be news in the immediate cyber space for a time, I don't know how much the public will care about kernel files and null code updates 6 weeks from now.\n\nIf anyone says for sure they know where the stock is going they're nuts. They're floated by a lot of institutional investors given they just joined the S&P, and the next quarter or two might be rough, particularly if they miss out on earnings, but I see them humming along business as usual 6-12 months from now.",
