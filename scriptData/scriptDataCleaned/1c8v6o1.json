  "title": "Elon Musk’s succession at Tesla, who might be next?",
  "score": 469,
  "selftext": "Hello everyone,\nIn the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.\n\nElon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:\n\n- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs\n- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)\n- prices have been lowered again in the 🇺🇸, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon\n- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/\n- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)\n\nZhu in November 2022\nThe first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/\n\nHere a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/\n\nThe CFO in May 2023\nThe name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7\n\nBoth the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)\n\nSince then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict \n- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1\n- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason\n\nOf course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:\n- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?\n- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?\n- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? \n- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?\n\nSeveral articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:\n- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html\n- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570\n- ‘At what point do you decide Tesla is bigger than Musk?’ The time may be right for Elon Musk to step down as CEO, suggest experts  \nhttps://fortune.com/2024/02/03/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-board-directors-corporate-governance/\n\nWhat do you think? 🤔 \n",

Everyone here hates Elon just as everyone on Twitter/X licks his balls.  But the truth is that they have some significant advantages in FSD, Manufacturing and other car software. To date no one has even come close to the self driving capabilities of Tesla which tells me it is a pretty hard thing to achieve. This advantage is going to have huge benefits for Tesla in the long run.  Is Elon’s relentless ranting on Twitter driving core customer base away? Maybe. But by how much remains to be seen. I would argue outside of Reddit and Twitter bubble the general public doesn’t really care about Musk and would buy a tesla if they are in the market. The current downturn in demand may just be a global thing rather than being solely induced by Musk. In short tesla has some real potential and is not guaranteed to go bankrupt and sold to Ford or GM like people here are saying.",

That's mind boggling- Surely no one expected them to 10x again and start selling 20,000,000 cars a year.\n\nIt's a mature business now and should expected to grow \\~ 5 to 10% a year. And I agree, it should be valued as such. But people thinking because sales slumped, the company is collapsing. That's silly.\n\nThe fact is governments all over the world were subsidizing EVs - including literally giving people 1,000s of $s to actually buy one - and lots of sales were front-loaded. Not to mention there was an excitement bubble - EVs were hip and new.\n\nBut EVs aren't going anywhere. And TSLA will end up being one of the world's most dominant EV manufacturer. Will a Chinese EV maker sell more - probably. But all industries end up like that - oligopolies. Nascent industries attract numerous players, everyone moons, and then the wash-out begins.\n\nAnyone bored enough to search could learn that the US used to have over 200 car manufacturers. Now it's basically down to 3. Drug companies, Airlines, Internet browsers, Steel manufacturers, etc. It's always the same.\n\nHell, China used to have over 500 EV makers just a few years ago. Now they are down to \"only\" about 100. In a few years, that number will be double digits. And some years after that, they will likely have a handful of dominant players.
