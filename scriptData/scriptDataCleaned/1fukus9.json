Although the sector rebounded with a 1% rally on Friday, driven by hopes of more Federal Reserve rate cuts following a soft inflation report, hedge funds had already ramped up their bearish bets.\n\nGoldman Sachs noted that hedge funds targeted a variety of US energy companies, including oil and gas firms, consumable fuel providers, and equipment suppliers. The proportion of short bets outpaced long positions by a ratio of nearly six to one, signalling significant bearish sentiment in the sector.\n\nThe surge in short selling last week continued a broader trend of sustained divestment, with hedge funds having been selling off energy stocks for five consecutive weeks.\n\nThe selloff comes amid a gloomy outlook for oil prices. A recent Reuters poll of 41 analysts and economists projected that Brent crude would average $81.52 per barrel in 2024‚Äîits lowest forecast since February and down from August‚Äôs estimate of $82.86.",

      "body": "China's financial data is a black box. Nothing their government says about their economy can be independently verified in any way. The wars in the middle east have been going on for literal thousands of years, and through all that time, you can almost say that western actions have *never once* had a desired result. On top of all of that, energy is an inherently volatile sector. It bounces all over the place like a fuckin hippity hop toy from the 90s any time there is news... any news, at all, about anything.\n\nThese are dumb categories to target for additional exposure. A targeted Defense and Aerospace position of some kind doesn't hurt to buy and hold, but you should already have enough China exposure through your previously established Emerging Market coverage. Anyone who doesn't already have some exposure to energy: this is what people mean when they tell you to diversify. You wouldn't be chasing performance and trying to add something if you already had exposure to energy because you bought it for diversification before any of this news.",

Do we appear to be one to them? Or are they uniquely shut off, moreso than, say, Bureau of Labor & Statistics stuff is in the US (couldn't they make up numbers too? or is ours more reproducible/documented?) Is it that they've been proven untrustworthy, or they're truly just private?\n2. I'm 80% VOO ATM. was considering 60/20/20 VOO/AVUV/VXUS, but then heard some people shitting on ex-US. How do I actually decide for myself what diversification matters? I'm willing to do the work and research, just wondering how you even decide whether to add VXUS",
