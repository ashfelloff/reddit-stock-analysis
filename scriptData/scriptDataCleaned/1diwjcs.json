  "selftext": "Sup weather boys. I have room IQ (not temperature). so, I was debating whether to buy AMD or NVDA. Then it hit me, what does AMD do thats close to what NVDA is doing? their PE is high asf too. So, just wondering if someone could explain the point of buying AMD over NVDA as I have 2 related parents. thanks :)",

Literally every model used by any company smaller than a local startup is relying on cuda functionalities. Companies already don't like to switch frameworks unless there's a VERY good reason - in fact, companies will usually continue working with years old version of software unless they are forced to upgrade to a newer version (*of the same software, let alone a different one all together*).\n\nBut sure, let's assume AMD magically improved zluda to be better than cuda in some way, AND companies decided it's worth switching to it permanently. Even then, AMD simply doesn't have the funds to outbuy chip manufacturing space (Nvidia owns a significant share of 3/4 nm space). The only way AMD can beat out nvidia hardware wise is if 1) a group of companies come together and dump money on AMD to outbid nvidia on space or 2) AMD gets funding to create their own manufacturing plants.\n\nWith that being said, I never said anything about nvidia's *stock* continuously going up forever. Stock is something different and not 1-to-1 correlated to the likelihood that amd is unlikely to ever beat nvidia. Obviously, the stock would peak at some point once it is confirmed that \"infinite\" growth is priced in. However, I fail to see how that makes AMD a buy over some other company.",

AMD will never become the market leader probably, but NVDA currently owns 92% of the market from what I have read. AMD has 3%. AMD has much more to gain & NVDA much more to lose. probably more upside to AMD than NVDA at this point at time as well, considering the run NVDA has been on.
