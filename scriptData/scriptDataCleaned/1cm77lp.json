          "body": "CFD is Contract for Difference. It's sort of like options in that options and CFDs are both contracts. With options you're buying/selling contracts with other traders, with CFDs you're buying/selling them from your broker.\n\nBut there are no greeks or IV. CFDs are soley based on share price, and theres no option to acquire the underlying asset.\n\nSo if you *bought* a CFD, your aim is to sell it back to the broker for higher than you bought it for. You can trade them the other way too, so you *sell* the broker a contract and then buy it back from them for a lower cost than you bought it for. Natrually if you're wrong around the direction you get fucked and the broker takes your money...this is basically what happens like 90% of the time.\n\nWe also have something called Spread Betting here, which is even worse. It's tax free becuase the government classes is as gambling (like sports betting). Spread betting is basically betting in either direction and then you gain x amount of £ for each point it moves in your favor.\n\nBoth CFDs and Spread Betting are illegal in the US.",
