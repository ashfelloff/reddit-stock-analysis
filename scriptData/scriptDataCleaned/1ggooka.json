              "body": "Let's say it opens at $23 tomorrow. With earnings out of the way volatility will drop. If volume on the stock is high tomorrow it won't drop as low but it will drop. \n\nOP paid $81 for each contract. The contract will lose $5 from theta, a measure of value decrease per day. The theta is 0.051.\n\nThe implied volatility on this contract is 96.5%. Vega is a measure of value increase or decrease of a contract per 1% move. The vega is 0.015. Low volatility is around 20% to 30%. If implied volatility drops to 46.5%, that's a decrease of 50. So .50(% volatility decrease)x.015(vega) is .75. The contract will lose $75 from vega.\n\nNow the good news since ops contract is now at $0. Delta measures the increase or decrease of each contract per $1 move of the stock. The delta is 0.3263. At $23, INTC moved around $1.50. So 1x.32 gives op $32 on the contract. I'll account for the move past the first dollar next.\n\nNow gamma is measure of the affect on delta per $1 increase or decrease of the stock. The gamma on the contract is  0.0862. So for the next dollar increase the stock will gain 0.3263(delta)+0.0862(gamma) or $41. So for the next $.50 increase, the contract will gain $20.50 (delta+gamma) x .5. \n\nNot 100% sure on the math and explanation but it's the best I could do. If INTC opens at $23 with an implied volatility of 45% then ops contracts will be worth about $53 which will be a $28 loss.",
