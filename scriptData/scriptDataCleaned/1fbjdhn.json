  "selftext": "The good side to options is its worst side! You can make tons or loose tons. I find micro trading the options is a far less risky strategy i usually buy 10-20 contracts and sell at $100-$300 profit. Controlling the urge to do 1 more trade is the biggest challenge! Making small profits consistently is a better strat than 100% ROI on 1 trade then loosing 50% on 10 trades. ",

          "body": "I got the impression it was the opposite.  Buying and selling several times a day, on momentum, and cashing out at small increases rather than watching for it to pay big.\n\nBuying 10-20 contracts, as OP says, the contract price would only have to go up by like $0.10 in order for him to cash out a $100 profit.  But it also means having several thousand dollars invested just to gain that $100.\n\nAnd if you look at the screenshot, he's had at least $28k in play for a whole year, only to have $7300 profit to show for it. I hate to think of how many hours have been spent over the past year buying and selling, just to have a profit that is lower than the salary of a part-time Wendy's employee.",

If buy SPX options and SPX moves 1% still make whatever is equivalent to 1% price change for SPX.\n\nNeither one moves in a way that is special vs the other. Your post makes it seem like SPX options move in some way that is special from what the underlying does. \n\nClear benefit to SPX is tax treatment though, but it's also not equivalent to QQQ since SPX is all of S&P 500 where as QQQ is nasdaq 100",
