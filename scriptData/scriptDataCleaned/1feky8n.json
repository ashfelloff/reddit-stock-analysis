We just got to get back to engineering and not accounting. Most people have no idea how important Boeing is to our country and its economy as we are the largest exporter by a large margin and extremely important to national security. We just want a decent contract as we have been stagnant for 16 years in our current contract. McDonald‚Äôs in Seattle pay more than some of our machinists. This strike will affect every state in the nation as we have about 1.6 million people in our supply chain that will have little to no work if our lines stop at 11:59PM tomorrow. Our last CEO just walked out with about 78 million after salary, bonuses and stock options and they cry poor. We did not put them in this position and we are the only ones that can get them out of it. They need to pay fair, get management in check and start focusing on engineering and our product and customers. Do that and then we will deliver a world class product to our customers and earn the trust of the country and the world again. France is already spanking us with a backlog of 8600 plane to our 6500 and China has there C919 operational and delivering to Chinese customers that were once ours. 108 years and counting I know we can get back on track.",
