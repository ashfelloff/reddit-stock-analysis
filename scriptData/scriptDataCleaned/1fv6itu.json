You can't be green and be as wasteful as SpaceX is. \"Elon bad\" for more reasons than I want to spend time on.\n\nBut, you were making a very basic point about Computer Science, about which you are completely correct. Nobody who has taken a highschool freshman level of Computer Science would disagree with your point. The only genuinely big free software would be things so simplistic as to lack any meaningful application.\n\nThat doesn't excuse poor quality control on a safety critical component, but you didn't say it did. If anything, it's that ubiquitous nature of programming errors that should mean that Tesla was exhaustively testing such components.",

A mechanical recall means I need to schedule an appointment with my service center and may need to stop driving the vehicle. An OTA update is already done by the time I’m reading this headline.\n\nFrom a stock/fundamental perspective there’s also a massive difference. Mechanical recalls cost Ford ~30% of their entire profit margin every year. It’s a huge expense that also tarnishes their reputation. An OTA update costs Tesla almost nothing. It’s a few hours for a handful of employees to troubleshoot, validate, and push through to production, which is normally done as part of standard quality review anyway. \n\nMost of the tech industry avoids “recall” in OTA updates and calls them “patches” for this very reason. iPhones are patched almost every month. I don’t think any less of Apple because of their software updates. Both consumers and investors benefit from knowing the difference.",

But it’s still a real problem that needs fixing, and the time and effort to fix it is unlikely as trivial as you suggest. It takes more than a handful of employees and a couple of hours to push out any software update at this kind of scale.

                      "body": "Both investors and consumers care more about context than who’s technically correct on what it’s called. And the easiest way to convey that is by telling people whether it’s a mechanical fault or an OTA update. The only people on earth who actually care whether you strictly call it a “recall” vs an “ota update” are NHTSA workers. For everyone else, the context is more important. The average investor and consumer doesn’t work at the NHTSA and prefers to know it’s an ota update. Automakers themselves don’t even call it a recall unless it’s in an official document. GM’s software page refers to mandatory OTA changes as “refinements.” VW calls them “bug fixes or security patches.” It’s literally just the NHTSA and Reddit grammar police who feel the need to make sure everyone says it’s a recall.\n\nNo investor or Tesla owner thinks less of the brand because of this software update. Literally no one. You can read the actual NHTSA report to see the bug was found and fixed through a routine internal quality review. From the start of the investigation to pushing out a production fix it only took 6 days and zero additional review teams or manpower. It’s a negligible recall in every way possible and the easiest way to summarize that for people online is to say it’s an OTA update. The whole grammar police “Redditor’s must only refer to this as a recall to follow NHTSA protocol and CAN’T say it’s an OTA update” just baffles me.",
