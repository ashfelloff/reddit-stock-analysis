Most people, especially those with some sort of knowledge or education in the equity market, are invested in indexes like the S&P 500 or global index fund.  \nYou're gravely, gravely mistaken if you think everyone is doing what the people in this sub and the vocal communities on social media do. It's just a lot easier to be vocal and produce regular content if you go \"I bought this stock!\" \"This stock is about to blow up!\" \"Have you heard about this insane stock?\" rather than \"I put another 500 bucks into SPY. Just like I do every month. Neat.\"\n\nAs for why some people go for stocks over the index - because they're greedy, because they think highly of themselves and because they think if they can just get that 100-bagger, their life will change immediately - which it would, of course, but they keep chasing and missing it time and time again. Eventually they reach a point where just going with the index would have put them ahead and then some stay in stocks because they feel like they have to play catch-up rather than concede that their approach was suboptimal.\n\nFor 95-99% of retail investors, being heavily into VOO/VTI/VT is the right thing to do. You can do other stuff besides that (as do I), but the majority of your money should realistically be in these ETFs if you want an optimal (realistic) gain. \n\nIf you live for the gamble and the adrenaline, so be it.",
