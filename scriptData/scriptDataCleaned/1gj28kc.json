Separately, GBM is an orphan disease and therefore there's not a huge financial opportunity here.\n\nSee the graphic - that tiny little bump in the plot over the last year is from the Ph2/3 data they released back in July. This is the data they want to discuss with FDA to see if there's a path for approval. If it gets approved (at the earliest in Q3 of next year) I expect the stock may increase to $15-20/share, and likely an acquisition. Solid gain from where it currently is but important to keep the big picture in mind. Company is dead if they don't get FDA approval, and frankly could be dead based on the Type C meeting feedback they receive.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0pk6orrnsyd1.jpeg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74ba14d3967b13f00068f7ff6ec350d98ff49a50",
