  "selftext": "🚨 **$COST September Earnings Are Gonna Be Huge!** 🚨\n\nHere’s why Costco is about to explode:\n\n- **$250M-$400M in Monthly Gold/Silver Sales**: Costco is making serious bank with their gold bars, selling out faster than anyone expected. 💰\n\n- **GLP-1 Drugs Are a Sales Rocket**: GLP-1s, the same drugs Walmart hyped in their earnings call, are driving Costco’s sales through the roof. Anecdotally, Costco has much better availability and sales than Sam’s Club. 🚀\n\n- **First Membership Hike in 7 Years**: Costco just raised membership fees for the first time in almost a decade. Plus, they’re enforcing membership scans, locking in more subs and boosting long-term revenue.\n\nCostco is set to crush the 5.2% comp sales growth that Walmart just announced.\n\n**TL;DR: September earnings are coming, and $COST is about to deliver a blowout. With gold, GLP-1 drugs, membership enforcement, and hot dog combos still at $1.50, this stock is ready to take off!** 🚀💰\n",

                  "body": "This guy knows. I for example have the 2% exec. Some folks have some cards that give around 2% but if you have the BoA customized cash back then you get 3%. If you also have like $50K in the checking/savings/brokerage/IRA with BoA/Merrill then that 3% gets bumped up to 5.25%. This is capped to $2500 per 3month billing cycle but that fits right under the gold bar price (so far).\n\nDepending on which day you buy you *could* buy below or well below spot. Honestly it doesn't matter if you're not buying at or below spot imo since what you're really getting with Costco bars is convenience and security (from fakes). Plus gold prices have been going up these last few years. If you had extra cash laying around that you aren't using anyways then you can throw some into gold if you fancy it (certainly is better imo than pokemon cards, jordans, INTC stock, or gucci bags). Real question folks should be asking though is WHY they are buying the gold bars and what's their exit strategy (not everyone has a good way to sell their gold).",
