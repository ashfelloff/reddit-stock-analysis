  "selftext": "Update 07.16:\nFrom now on INTERESTING STOCK INVESTING IDEAS (in my personal opinion) will be shared in the first column of the watchlist. \n\nOnce again I share my stock watchlist. \n\nThe list includes ~2300 companies from the whole world grouped into 11 sectors. \n\nAll companies from the 11 sectors are put into 6 columns:\n\nColumn number 1: Financials\nColumn number 2: Consumer Discretionary \nColumn number 3: Consumer Staples & Materials \nColumn number 4: Healthcare, Real Estate & Utilities \nColumn number 5: IT & Communication Services\nColumn number 6: Energy & Industrials\n\nThe work on this watchlist is still in progress. As of today I am editing the last part of the Consumer Discretionary sector (80% done). In the end the whole stock watchlist will look like 1st column aka Financial Sector. \n\nSo what are the biggest updates from the last time I shared it? I added AVERAGE revenue and AVERAGE net income for the last few years for each company. It helps me understand at what AVERAGE price/sales and p/e company currently trades. Why average? I believe that valueing company based ONLY on last or next year's earnings is irrational. \n\nEnjoy:\n https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K2Wmqi2evfMWILp3Dxr7j0GH5h-g5WmwYHyAQpndPyw/edit?usp=drivesdk\n\nWill answer all your questions in the comments section. \n\n\n",
