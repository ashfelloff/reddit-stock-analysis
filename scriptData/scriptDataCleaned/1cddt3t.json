Competition will come in unless NVDA is competitive with chip prices competitors will take market share. The NVDA market share could drop to around 25% in 2026. Even with that NVDA is a good investment or trade for the next year. They are so far ahead in a competitive space for AI software that large cap tech has to buy the fastest chips to remain competitive which is NVDA. Eventually once LLM's are trained the computing will move to the edge which can utilize lower performing chips. That is when NVDA will flatten out. NVDA is a great company with years of software build around their GPU's so I wouldn't count them out in the future but eventually these parabolic moves will flatten.\n\nNVDA could see 1300 by the end of the year and hit 1500 at some point in 2025. If that happens profit taking would be wise. What is an untapped revenue stream is handset personal assistant AI. AAPL is looking to have a smaller LLM in the phone with a larger chip that does the AI locally and not in the cloud.

              "body": "Sourcing some of the cloud AI search is probably feasible for AAPL and use the CAPEX somewhere else. AAPL doesn't necessarily need to build out a large AI training model that exists already.  Mostly the path forward for AAPL will be handset refreshes with larger chips that handle a smaller LLM that doesn't need edge compute on the cloud or send private data to the cloud. Everything will take place on the device. This will create a personal AI assistant and make older phones obsolete. Not saying that AAPL will go parabolic but more phone sales will get the stock into the 200's.",
