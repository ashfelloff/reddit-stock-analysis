  "title": "NVIDIA Options Expiry: Max Pain $100 – September 20th",
  "score": 94,
  "selftext": "As the September 20th options expiry for NVIDIA (NVDA) nears, retail investors, especially those heavy on call options, might be in for a reality check. With 19.13% of all open contracts tied to this date, a lot hinges on NVDA's next move.\n\nThe Max Pain Problem:\n\nHere’s the kicker: the \"max pain\" point for these options is sitting at $100, while NVIDIA is currently trading around $119.37. If the max pain theory holds, market makers could push the stock price down towards $100, turning most options into expensive confetti. In short, those betting on a upward trend might instead face a harsh reminder that \"the house always wins.\"\n\nWhat’s Next:\n\nLooking at the next couple of expiration dates, the data isn't too strong. For September 6th, max pain is at $116 with only 4.12% open interest, and for September 13th, it's at $122 with just 1.47% open interest. Both dates show a put/call ratio below 1, indicating more calls than puts. This setup suggests we could see a small decrease over the next two weeks, but the real drop could come around mid-September. Given that September is traditionally one of the worst months for trading, any significant downturn could be conveniently attributed to seasonal trends, rather than market manipulation.\n\nHow to Play It:\n\nConsidering the potential for a shake-up, one strategy could be to buy a put option in two weeks, possibly as early as Friday the 13th. Aim for a delta around 0.3, ensuring a breakeven point at $105. If NVIDIA’s price drops significantly below $100, consider selling before expiration to lock in gains. Otherwise, I would hold until September 20th.\n\nHope you guys like this conspiracy as much as I do :) ",
