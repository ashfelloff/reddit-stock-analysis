Market price comes down to the mid price between bid and ask across the order book. Want to buy some pokemon cards? Price comes down to recent price action. \n\nThe benefit of owners equivalent rent is that it’s forward looking which better represents reality of someone trying to start a new rental right now. Instead of backwards looking at how much a lease agreement was set for 8-12 months ago skewing data. And if someone is already a landlord they aren’t necessarily gonna be renting a new place out.
