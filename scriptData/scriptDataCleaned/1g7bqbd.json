  "selftext": "[Boxed in a seemingly unwinnable position, Boeing apparently conceded several demands of it´s striking workers.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-boeing-strike-presents-resolution-143835071.html) Purely coincidental, the workers are due to vote on Oct. 23rd, the day of a potentially disastrous earnings report, if they accept the new, significantly improved offer.\n\nWhile questions remain, whatfor Boeing went into this battle it simply couldn´t afford to fight, for the deeply troubled planemaker ending it would be desperately needed good news. \n\nWhile the \"b\"-word has started to float in some media, Boeing has recently stepped up financial measures to restore confidence. It remains to be seen, if Boeing can indeed turn around, ending the strike however was not simply a part of that, but a core condition for even starting the process.\n\nWhat´s your plays?",

Do you think the conditions for the next generation get better due to c-suite deciding to give these benefits as handouts?\n\nUnions provide necessary checks and balances to workers' rights and compensation. They are far more effective than governments or individual negotiators at advancing workers' benefits.\n\nIn Denmark for instance, a high minimum wage and great conditions for workers as well as employers (with regard to ease of hiring and firing especially) was all obtained via collective bargaining. There is not even a minimum wage in the laws. In many ways despite being a very \"socialist\" country, it has laws and regulations more ideologically aligned with capitalism than quintessential capitalist countries like the US.\n\nUnions serve an interest that must be represented in a capitalist society. That interest cannot be served by a government and that interest will not be served by an employer.\n\nIf you truly believe in capitalist ideology and believe it is the best engine of wealth growth across all economic classes, you must inherently believe unions are a necessity of the system or at the very least should exist just as much as corporations should. They are a capitalistic enterprise that compete with corporations in the market for a share of the profits.\n\nIf you're a corporatist on the other hand then that is another story, but if your concerns are genuine about wanting wealth growth across generations then I sure hope you're not a corporatist, as that is not really what corporatism seeks to do.",

Now that they have to put more effort into production and costs are naturally climbing over time, not all of which might be covered by clauses, their margin should be even narrower. And they produce even less planes at higher cost this year.\n\nNot saying, they cannot make a profit with the right effort. But as of now those 5000 planes in the backlog don´t look like goldbars,but like a pile of AAA rated subprime mortgage derivates.\n\nBut again: I may very well be wrong on that.",
