Along with US Army and Navy support at sea, ROC forces achieved dominance in the air. On 12 September 1958, ROC pilots flying American-made F-86 Sabres shot down a flight of PLA MiG-17 jets, “splashing four of them into the ocean with the new Sidewinder missile.”59 Nationalist pilots proved adept at destroying CCP airpower, amassing “33 enemy kills in return for the loss of four of their own” in just a few days.60 The CCP’s inability to achieve air superiority ensured that even the Kinmen islands remained under ROC control. By 6 October, US support and ROC airpower had forced Mao to back down, and he announced a cease-fire.61",

People in both Mainland China and Taiwan are both perfectly content with the status quo. Subsuming Taiwan just isn't a very high priority for the CCP. These sorts of statements exist purely to re-affirm that a) the US (and its subsidiary countries - Japan, Aus etc) should be very careful with its interventionism and b) Chinese citizenry should believe in the strength of the CCP (run-of-the-mill political grandstanding essentially).\n\nTaiwan itself polls overwhelmingly in favour of maintaining the status quo. Any drastic shift in Taiwan's position on that would almost certainly be a result of fairly standard US MO for geopolitical skulduggery. Which is to say it'd be pretty obvious to anyone paying attention, even if they aren't caught and it's perfectly portrayed as a \"ground up\" shift in opinion. Which is why it almost certainly won't happen. \n\nSo providing nothing super weird happens, (and I'll say here we did just have a global pandemic - we shouldn't underestimate the chance of some unpredictable nonsense flipping the game board) the edging will continue pretty much indefinitely.\n\nLong term, China would only make a move if it had economically and militarily outpaced the US by an absurd margin. If China sees that much runaway success, Taiwan would probably want to get in on it anyway. Which is to say there's basically no point in China pushing the issue in any case.",

There's a threat to national unity (aka civil unrest). Top play from dictators playbook is to blame outside forces and claim that unless they preemptively attack they will become victims of the enemy's machinations. Thus they unify the country against a common enemy.\n\n2. Xi goes crazy. The problem with consolidating so much power with one person is that if they deteriorate mentally then the military still operates at the nutty dictator's whims and wishes. Having said that, even with all the power consolidated in Xi there remains other power blocs withing China so one or more of those could potentially reign him in or even topple him if need be.",

That would hurt the US economy by weakening the Dollar, making the Chinese economy grow by half a trillion overnight. It also help the Chinese economy surpass the US economy, eventually having the Won as the global reserve currency. \n\nChina being China, what if your country says something about some policy (Muslim concentration camps, censorship, ECT.) and they slow roll semiconductor processing? Or outright refuse to sell chips to rivals (\"The West\")? Think covid semiconductor shortage, on purpose. I would bet every penny I have on that happening. \n\nOhh also, China makes basically everything for the entire western world, goods and fancy chips would allow them to have a level of control over any economy. They aren't even communist, they are closer to fascist nowadays. We just got a glimpse of what happens when dictatorships have too much bearing on western economies (Russian Gas).

The US Navy is so far ahead in every and any metric, the worst thing China could do is knockout a couple American carriers.

The newest Chinese aircraft carrier is 20k tonnes lighter than the US flagship. It can't carry as many aircraft, doesn't have equivalent capabilities, less advanced aircraft, shitty aviators, and Chinese made™.

It's drones: can they warm us with more than we can handle? \n\nTheir industrial capacity is way above ours, with much lower costs. If China can mass-produce cheap stuff to swarm us with and destroy a hundred billion dollars of USN assets that will take 8 years to rebuild, by using 10 billion dollars worth of cheap ordinance that they can replace in a year, how long can/will we keep fighting over an island that might be ruined by then anyway?

Just a quick overview; The Republic of China was one of the Allies that fought in WWII alongside the US and UK etc. they are a founding member of the UN in 1945. They then had a communist uprising and the legitimate Govt of the Republic of China fled to Taiwan. To this day the official name of Taiwan is The Republic of China.

With that said they are heading in the direction of spending towards a military that could more easily take Taiwan, doesn’t mean they have to do it but have the option available. They may also be eyeing what happens in Ukraine because if Ukraine falls soon and it’s a great victory for Russia that will demoralise Taiwan and it’s allies and make them think fighting back will be long, painful and fruitless. They also want a US that is weaker and more isolationist like Trump, with that said I’m not so sure that trump wouldn’t actually fight back only because I think his ego would prefer Taiwan not falling under his watch and while many of his supporters are dumb and don’t understand it I think he has to realise the importance of Taiwan’s chips or maybe someone with brains in the family like Ivanka will have to tell him that. But still it’s probably less likely trump intervenes compared to Biden.\n\nAlso I’m no expert but I do wonder what happens if the US ever gains chip independence or whatever from Taiwan. I know it’s extremely hard to achieve and I assume the US would do it if they could. Would they just leave Taiwan to a Chinese invasion and give them moral/supply support like Ukraine? Maybe China would rather wait for this or something?",
