  "title": "Nvidia's self driving program will crash Tesla tomorrow",
  "score": 766,
  "selftext": "Tesla went down last quarter after Jensen Huang talked about Nvidia's self driving ambitions. Given that self driving cars are a really hot thing right now in the AI space, I think that there's a good chance that Huang will talk about it much more tomorrow and potentially have an impressive showing of progress. If he does, Tesla should go down, potentially erasing all of todays gains on the questionably bullish news. Regardless of how good Nvidia's earnings are, their presentation will likely be bad for Tesla since they will be talking about competing with Tesla. I think that in all cases, Tesla goes down after the Nvidia earnings presentation. The worst (best for puts) case scenario would be bad Nvidia earnings coupled with Huang doubling down on competing with Tesla on self driving and robots. \n\nTLDR: The hottest part of the AI space right now is self driving and robotics. Jensen Huang loves to make grand presentations and will likely talk about Nvidia's ambitions and progress in both of these areas tomorrow. This will be really bad for Tesla.",
