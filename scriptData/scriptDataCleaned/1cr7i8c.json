  "selftext": "Back in early 2021, these following stocks also went NUTS during the meme rally craze. I'm going to be grabbing calls on all the following stocks: \n\n**AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (AMC):**\n\nAMC was another significant beneficiary of the meme stock craze. These guys rose from approximately $2 in early January 2021 to a peak of around $20 by the end of the month, a tenfold increase. AMC‚Äôs high short interest and its popularity among retail investors contributed to this dramatic rise.\n\n**BlackBerry Ltd. (BB):**\n\nBlackBerry, the former smartphone giant turned cybersecurity firm, saw its stock price increase from about $6 at the beginning of January 2021 to over $25 by the end of the month. This represented a more than 300% increase, as wallstreetbet'ers targeted it as another heavily shorted stock.\n\n**Nokia Corporation (NOK):**\n\nNokia, the telecommunications company, also saw significant gains, though less dramatic than some others. Its stock rose from about $4 to a peak of $9 in late January 2021, doubling in value as it became another target for retail traders from WSB.\n\nDisclaimer: These are *not* squeeze candidates. They are just stocks that went up during the last meme stock craze. I'm buying with the expectation that they will do the same this time around as well.",
