          "body": ">Fed in 2021: Powell says Fed has made ‚Äòquite a bit of progress‚Äô on transitory inflation but needs more confidence before hiking\n\nI seriously believe the Fed will literally have a soft landing available because the government, treasury, and fed pumped the system with so much fucking money but the Fed will be too slowpoke and miss the fucking mark. Looking backwards at past data, holding on too long, the negative talk, focusing on shelter inflation using data from literal landline phone calls to ask boomers who much they think they could rent their homes for, etcetc. I don't fear the recession itself. I just hate it when you have bday cake for little Timmy but your old boomer grandpa insists on carrying that huge thing out himself even though he could barely walk, you watch hopelessly as his hands shake, and he trips over something.",

This is about the Fed (who care about inflation) because they have the leash on the economy via monetary policy, the economy because that determines the markets in the long run, and markets because they determine how much I make.\n\nIf you think there will be big differences in how the economy is run between the lying criminal old boomer or the honest dementia-riddled old boomer come Jan 20th, 2025 then you're either naive or in for a surprise.\n\nRegardless of which boomer these things will be the same:\n\n* Boomers will continue to spend like they are going to die while passing on the check to the future generations.\n\n* National debt will increase\n\n* Taxes \"\"\"\"\"won't increase\"\"\"\"\" in the sense that the brackets won't substantially change but inflated wages and costs of living will move folks up the brackets\n\n* Inflation will still be here but not rampant\n\n* Prices will NOT BE DOWN. Regards need to get it through their fucking dumbass peanut brains that prices don't go down in the long run. I had $0.29 McHamburgers, $0.39 McCheeseburgers, and $0.79 McNuggets as a kid in the 90s. I don't expect those prices to coming back. It's fucking gone. Ya'll pussies gotta deal with it.\n\n* Economy will be fine. US GDP growth will continue to outperform Europe.\n\n* US will still be in an antagonistic relationships with China. Don't expect those trade war tariffs to be gone. If anything I'd take the odds of a tiktok ban over the odds of reversal of trade war.\n\n* Stock markets will be up\n\n* üåàüêª will continue to get BTFO\n\nReal differences between Biden/Trump are social/democratic/cultural/legal. If you're betting on them then you get exposure betting on certain sectors of the economy each candidate favors and not being a üåàüêª betting on the economy tanking if they guy you don't like loses.",
