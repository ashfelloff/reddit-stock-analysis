  "selftext": "I know this sounds crazy to most bears and probably bulls as well, but everything I’m charting and gathering from past recessions/bear markets tells me we still have plenty of room to go up before we should all consider buying long dated puts and singing YMCA\n\nFirst from chart perspective, both SPY and QQQ are above their 50 and 100 daily moving averages and they have both support around strong Fibonacci levels. If they both manage to  reclaim August, as in forming either a bullish reversal on the weekly candle or forming a bullish hammer on the month (SPY 550 or QQQ 460) than we are 100% likely to see a strong blow off top before end of the year as we are also in an election year which is very bullish.\n\nSecond, we are all aware of the obvious which is the consumer is weakening (see earnings for most consumer stocks) and that credit debt is rising. But we do know that tech spending is still high. Amazon, microsoft and meta are all raising capex regardless of the consumer. They know the key *now* is to prepare for leveraging AI as a service. They can weather a 12-24 month recession. They have *billions* in cash with very low debt to equity ratios.\n\nSo as such, expect Nvidia earnings to keep rising, and for Amazon/microsofts cloud services and AI systems to grow while their more consumer side of business slows down or goes stagnant for the next year.\n\nThird, I expect layoffs and mass defaulting to occur sooner rather than later. But I do not think this will impact the stock market. Until tech is positioned to stop giving every dollar they can possibly shovel to the mag 7, once all infrastructure is tapped out and exhausted, will we see the market turn over and retrace. The fed will likely raise rates in September and we will see the yield curve potentially uninvert after more than three years. But it will take 6-12 months before this causes a market downturn because we will rally from the news for quite some time.\n\nFor SPY; long to 650, short to 500 level. Don’t do anything else till then. ",

Well, the big loan buyers ( Lehman Brothers amongst many others ) were offering disastrously dangerous loan products. For example, someone with a 580 credit score could borrower up to 95%, cash out, on the value of their home AND state their income!  And the cherry on top was that most were adjustable rate loans. Well, that set the stage for 2008 as they were bundling these risky loans into mortgage backed securities ( MBS ) that were supposed to be lighter risk. They weren’t at all. Then the perfect storm hits with 911. Recession, then comes the defaults. On a MASSIVE scale. Those loans, for the most part, are not prevalent in the market these days. This scenario we are in is also a possible perfect storm. Years of robust growth and cheap money got an entire generation spending like it was going to last forever. Here we are now. 8 trillion in debt heavier, the middle class making generally the same amount but inflation out of this world. And when you hear “CPI 3% YOY” you know better than that. How much did you pay for those groceries in 2019? How about that car? Or services? Now what is actual inflation? Not 3%. And those trusted brands you buy….well, you are still buying them…..but getting less for the same price. Stagflation is the word. The corporations are showing record profits. How??? That’s how. Do some research on how we got out of the 2008 recession. It was actually the middle class ( that didn’t really have the money ) kept spending. THAT group got us out of that one while the big dogs sat on the sideline with huge amounts of cash. They won big then and are winning big now and will win big again if we do slip into an official recession.",

I believe this is a very good take on the us economy at the moment. Something will blow up likely at some point but not until after the election. Most likely trump wins and then we see a market crash…. Just my opinion been trading and investing since I was 16 and I’m in my 30’s now.",
