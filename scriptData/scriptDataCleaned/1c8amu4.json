          "body": "Yeah this 100%. The password crackdown was already basically priced in last quarter, and now they've kinda peaked out how many *\"NEW!\"* accounts they're going to get and want to hide it.\n\nIt was a one-time shot of adrenaline that you can only pull the loaded gun once. You can only crackdown on account sharing once to juice the subscriber numbers. Pretty much everyone who wants a Netflix account would have/had one already now.\n\nSo it's only going to be either stagnant or marginal decline in numbers as they continue to hike prices 2-3x a year. The big challenge for Netflix moving forward is how many times they can keep hiking subscription costs while slowly bleeding (or keeping) the remaining consumers.",

      "body": "I was pretty shocked how far the stock went down despite reporting record earnings. They beat the predictions and it completely tanked. The claim that they were going to stop reporting subscriber metrics was just crazy. That’s why it tanked. These days the investors care about data and metrics. And if you take that away, they take you away. Call options lost 4500 dollars per contract in minutes. I don’t buy them around earnings time for that reason but damn if you had insider knowledge and knew the numbers were that high, you might have lost a a LOT of money",
