Apple's silicon plays are insane. You really think they won't leverage that into servers and AI in a massive way?\n\nThe narrative is AAPL has lost its mojo. That's exactly when they strike. I've been loading the dip under $175. \n\nMark my words:\n\n* $210 by WWDC in June when they flex the new compute/AI roadmap\n* $300 within 12 months as the AI server ramp kicks into higher gear\n\nDon't underestimate Apple when they get lean and refocus on the core markets they dominated for decades. A $3T comeback arc is brewing.\n\nConsensus is they are defending, but I suspect they will make a play for the DC dollars.  \n\nBuying every dip.",

And if Amazon or Microsoft wanted to build a machine with that, they could. Tim Apple isn't a wizard. The reason Macs are done like this is that 99% of people buying Macs don't care about opening them up. They just want the guy at the Genius Bar to tell them how much it will be to fix, before they throw it away and buy a new one.",
