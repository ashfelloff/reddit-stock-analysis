  "score": 3757,
  "selftext": "Hello, everyone! As we all know, $TSLA is having their quarterly earnings, which is a big deal for some bears. But let’s crack down on the bear party just for a second and use *logical* reasoning for why TSLA might not end up in the gutter as many would think. \n\n1. Expectations are low, just like Q1 (will get back to this later).\n2. Their shittiness is priced in already after Robotaxi event.\n3. Elon Musk is a master stock manipulator. \n\nKeeping all of this in mind, this isn’t even the *real* part of this DD. The actual, most integral part is looking at Elon Musk’s Twitter, which I decided to keep a close look on the past couple of earnings reports. \n\nOn the day of Tesla’s Q1, Elon Musk tweeted a total of 5 times, where the stock ended up going up 13% and then an additional 16% the next 2 weeks. \n\nOn the day of Tesla Q2, Elon Musk didn’t tweet **anything**, and the stock ended up falling 14%. \n\nSeems like a pattern has been drawn up, huh? Elon tweets a bit when the Tesla stock is going to moon on earnings while he’s in a cocky mood, and is dead silent when Tesla is going to fall. \n\nNow guess how many times Elon Musk has tweeted *so far* today? \n\n*15 fucking times*. \n\nYou heard that right, folks! 15 GODDAMN times. That’s triple the amount of tweets he had made on Q1, where the stock roared 13 - 15%! Meaning that Elon is much more confidence and cockier than he was in Q1! This man knows when his stock will fall and when it doesn’t, and he’s letting us know right below our own nose! \n\nAll of this is a *clear* indicator that Tesla is going to the moon today and the next week to come, regardless of whether they beat estimates or not. I’m betting that Tesla WILL beat estimates simply because of Elon Musk’s tweets and the fact that everyone has low confidence in the stock as of late. \n\nThis is your DD to buy calls. Whether you want free money or not is up to you. \n\nPositions: 15 minutes before market close, I’ll buy 3 217.5C exp. OCT. 25th. \n\n*note*: This is NOT financial advice. Any losses on $TSLA options deep OOTM is a result of your regardedness, not mine. ",
