  "selftext": "Nikkei reported on 19th August (13:23 JST) that Seven & i Holdings has received a takeover offer from Canadian convenience store giant Alimentation Couche-Tard (*ATD - TSE*).\n\nSeven & i has set up a committee to consider the proposal, following the guidance set out by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade & Industry.\n\nThe news has caused Seven & i Holdings (*3387-TSEJ*) stock price to rise up by 22.7% as of 13:39pm JST. Seven Bank, Ltd. (*8410-TSEJ*) has also gone up by around 11%.\n\nThe Canadian company, which has 17,000 stores worldwide, had approached Seven & i about acquiring it in 2020.\n\nSource: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Japan-7-Eleven-parent-to-mull-takeover-offer-from-Canada-convenience-giant](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Japan-7-Eleven-parent-to-mull-takeover-offer-from-Canada-convenience-giant)\n\n  \nEdit: I just checked the subsidiaries from [this link](https://www.7andi.com/en/group/group_list.html). It includes Seven & i Food Systems which operates Denny's restaurants in Japan. \n\nPia Corporation (*4337-TSEJ*) is also listed as an \"affiliate accounted for using the equity method\". I cannot find how much they hold right now, but they had 20% of Pia Corp. shares back in 2009. For those who are unaware, Pia owns Ticket Pia which is one of the largest ticketing services in Japan.",

That often means building scale and realising \"efficiency improvements and synergies\", the latter of which involves MBAs laughing at how a company spends money on something called \"service\" and \"quality\". So they create further value by \"optimising\" those costs and services. As in, cutting them to raise profit margins.",
