It's actually very simple, let me break it down for you regarded folks.\n\n> Tesla's highest market cap was 1.24 trillion, worth more than every other major automaker combined. Let's say, for simplicity's sake, TSLA at it's peak had an Overvaluement Factor (OF) of 69. Clearly, that was too much, and the stock dwindled down to having a mere OF of 30.\n\n> Now, everybody expected the earnings to be dogshit, and the price kept dropping. However, what we got instead was horseshit, which has considerably more value than dogshit. Thus, people realized that this fresh steaming pile of horse dung at the current price is an insane bargain. So, the people did the most rational thing; they ate it all up. It's all quite simple really.\n\n> TLDR: People thought they were buying dogshit at 145$ a bag, but turns out it was horseshit. Horseshit has more nutritional value than dogshit (maybe, idk), and thus it was a substantial deal of a lifetime which pumped up the price to 165$ a bag.",
