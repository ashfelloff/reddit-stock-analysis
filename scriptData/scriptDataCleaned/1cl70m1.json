Investing isn't evil, hoarding over a hundred billion dollars is. This is what fucksticks like you never seem to understand. Buffett was put into the position to be able to like, bankroll the funding of the engineering of a solution for world hunger, and have it actually be successful. And he didn't do that. And none of them are starting trying to do that. Use their money to fund R&D on actually revolutionary technologies.\n\nThey will never do that because it shrinks the gap between them and us. Even Gates, instead of using his billions to fund the R&D for the true meat substitute, the mass production of 3D printed, lab-grown meat. He used his billions to invest in a dog shit fucking ass tier soybean paste shlock garbage dogshit company to make a quick buck. fuck you and the horse you rode in, and everyone in your family, and all of your friends, you punk ass bitch",

The cash that would be generated for claims is stored in Geico full stop, not Berkshire. The problem with how you are talking is that you don't understand Buffet's investing environment. BH and Buffett are the Large Buyers and Sellers that skew markets and valuation. He can't invest willy nilly. I don't know why you are so caught up on the insurance firm and quoting shit from the 90s like those market rules still apply. In his shareholder meeting he said AI for instance was a bubble, a reason that he has so much cash rather than investing in those firms. BH has no obligation to cover Geico claims. This isn't an Asian Chaebol network where the firms rely on each other, each firm is centered to providing cash to BH specifically.",
