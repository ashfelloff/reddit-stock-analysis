I think each Meta user is worth like 100x what each Reddit user is worth. They have a lot of room for improvement. \n\nOn top of that, getting a user base the size of Reddit’s is extremely difficult. I’m betting that monetizing that user base is an easier problem to solve. \n\nReddit also has excellent gross margins, and a P/S ratio that isn’t all that high considering their gross margin.

It’s great advice when one invests in diversified index funds and has a long time horizon. Once one gets into the business of buying individual stocks, this advice is just not as great. It has significantly more risk involved and one should do more homework instead of simply adhering to “don’t time the market”. Apple is a relatively safe investment but it’s just not as safe as investing in S&P 500. When investing in individual stocks, entry point does matter and timing does too. And one should read the earning reports of the company and do some due diligence. \n\nAnyways, if you’re a defensive investor who invests mostly in index funds, that’s a fantastic advice. If you’re an aggressive investor who takes on more risk to get a better return through investing in individual stocks, timing is important. Confusing the two can be dangerous.",
