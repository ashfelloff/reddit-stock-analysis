It‚Äôs great advice when one invests in diversified index funds and has a long time horizon. Once one gets into the business of buying individual stocks, this advice is just not as great. It has significantly more risk involved and one should do more homework instead of simply adhering to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt time the market‚Äù. Apple is a relatively safe investment but it‚Äôs just not as safe as investing in S&P 500. When investing in individual stocks, entry point does matter and timing does too. And one should read the earning reports of the company and do some due diligence. \n\nAnyways, if you‚Äôre a defensive investor who invests mostly in index funds, that‚Äôs a fantastic advice. If you‚Äôre an aggressive investor who takes on more risk to get a better return through investing in individual stocks, timing is important. Confusing the two can be dangerous.",
