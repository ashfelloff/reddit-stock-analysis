Looking at 18 for a low coming out of this but I think that 23 gets tested once more prob Monday early. \n\nWed is also the only day next week where the SPY put/call ratio is under 1.  It's pretty well established we're looking at a volatility drain Tuesday to Wednesday as certainty mounts. That probably means a rally of some sort later in the week if momentum builds. If anything there's a greater risk of a melt up than flat or down imo.",
