It was 100% an unprovoked act of war, it'd be like if China bombed Anthony Blinken while he was sitting at a park bench in Boston. everyone was screaming WW3 then\n\nanyways Iran talked to US and was like *hey this is fucked yo' we gotta do something, how about you evacuate this airfield and we'll throw some old bombs at it. --* and so they did a performative bombing of an empty airfield and all was forgiven and forgotten.\n\nThe important thing to remember about Iran is they're the most absolute bitchmade cucked country of all time: everything they do is performative and they just keep taking it. You could say that's smart self-preservation. \n\nanyways markets green by wednesday, ez",
