  "selftext": "Seems to be an easy snag without much media presence. Last product launch back on mar 26 they released the credit card and over the next 2 days stock went up 8%. \nFor this product launch seems to be about futures trading, lower fees and some index options stuff. If it‚Äôs futures trading the stock might shoot up a fuck ton, so I got 5 calls expiring in Nov at a strike of $27. \n\nWhat are your guys thoughts , am I gonna get cucked tmr\n\n",
