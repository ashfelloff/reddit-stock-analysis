When vix is low, ie: less than 15, the general idea is there is very little implied price movements.  This study conducted a research from early 2000's to present  and found that as shown in the graph, the odds of a 2% sell off in a <15 vix is only .5% and a normal distribution (68% of the time in this case) of ±.5% daily expected move.",

Think about it. The US relies on the strength of the US dollar to maintain financial hegemony over the world.  Powell waiting to cut until after ECB and BOE and other central banks cut first is that it will keep interest rates on the US dollar higher than other fiat currencies, keeping demand for US dollars high and allowing the US to maintain financial hegemony over the world. Once the other central banks go into crisis and are forced to cut drastically, that will give the fed all the freedom in the world to cut rates.",

However it only takes a couple days to see vix go from 12 to 15 and 15 to 20 in which case, the statistical chance of a larger daily draw down significantly increases.\n\n\nThe Utility, or actionable usage of this data is that it makes no sense to go short with a low vix, or just because vix is low means you should go short. \n\n\nHowever coming out of a low vix environment and into a rising volatility environment does merit short exposure. \n\n\nIts important to remember the leptokurtic nature of the market. Periods of low volatility tend to last a long time and you see clustering of low volatility. As we have seen for the last 300+ days without a 2% draw down. ",
