Yes, they make gay movies and have turned their theme parks into open air hospice centers for fat land whale Americans who shell out a year‚Äôs salary and stand in line for a day to watch their children get hugged by a trans sleeping beauty. So why am I risking it all, my present and future, on way otm calls with zero chance of hitting green? Because I‚Äôm retarted. This is my crucible, my GUH. Off to the moon or a padded cell. Buy calls so I can be an asstronaut and not in an asylum.\n\n(But you should actually buy puts, see my username)\n\nTo Valhalla \n\nWill update\n\n",

Most likely Disney will not go up another 10% in the next 2 days. You have no advantage on this trade but you are betting a lot of money on it. Don't do this... unless you have f-u money already and are totally all about the lawls. But I dont think thats the case.",
