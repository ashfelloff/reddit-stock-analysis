You can buy a $160 call that expires tomorrow for about $150 (the $150 is called premium). That $150 gives you the option tomorrow to buy 100 shares at $160 no matter what the price is.\n\nLet's say it jumps another 16% so now it's trading at $185 tomorrow.\n\nWell you have right to buy 100 shares at $160 and since it's trading at $185 you automatically are up $25 ($185-160) a share or $2500 for the option. \n\nThis is how the gain percentage looks crazy compared to the 16%. You spent $150 and made $2500. You basically are up 1566% on your $150. \n\nNow let's say the opposite happens. It tanks to $145. Well tomorrow you still have the option to buy those shares at $160, but obviously you wouldn't since you can buy it at $145 market rate. So you just let it expire and you lose your $150 you spent to have the option to buy. \n\nPuts are the opposite, but to keep it simple most people start by understanding calls since it seems more intuitive for whatever reason.\n\nThere are legitimate strategies to minimize risk with options, but around here people just use them because of the high reward and relatively low risk (only being able to lose the premium).\n\nWelcome to the casino.",
