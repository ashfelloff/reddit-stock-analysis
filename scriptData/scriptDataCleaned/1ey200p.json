Very easy to find inexpensive contractors who specialize in this type of migration work. Open source solutions are growing. I see this type of shift as a significant impediment to future Snowflake revenue growth.",

It comes off the shelf with everything you need and is easy to monitor, straddle and strangle usage and cost. But the savings isn't the _primary_ reason for the valuation free fall    \n\n\n3. SNOW is tanking not so much bc of \"shifting away\" comput but but because the valuation was based on machine learning and BI products (which would use snowflake compute) that never materialized AND guidance was juiced bc they were based on purchased credits NOT credit usage (sales reps oversell the fuck outta credits,  so much so that most customers will roll over at renewal, purchase less)   \n\n\nIf you think snowflake can figure out and execute on the machine learning product it's an excellent long term play precisely because of #1.  If you think they cannot then its still probably way overvalued ",
