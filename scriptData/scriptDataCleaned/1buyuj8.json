  "selftext": "Gather round and follow me down this regarded trail, I stumbled upon this looking at midstream pipeline companies originally inspired by the PAA trade (and other companies) mentioned in a few posts on this sub recently.  I saw a press release that Diamondback Energy (FANG) had signed a letter of interest (non-binding) in small nuclear reactors to power remote oil/gas rigs in.  Small nuclear reactors would replace large diesel generators.\n\n [U.S. shale producers to reduce Permian drilling emissions, increase reliability with nucle](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/)  \n[ar reactors (worldoil.com)](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2024/4/1/u-s-shale-drillers-to-reduce-permian-drilling-emissions-increase-reliability-with-nuclear-reactors/) \n\nI've been interested in the small nuclear reactor trade for a few months since I learned about Centrus Energy (LEU).  So I looked into OKLO -- which turns out is about to go public via spac with ticker $ALCC it will trade under ticker $OKLO once merger is complete.  Sam Altman CEO of Open AI is Chairman of the board at OKLO and ALCC is his SPAC.\n\nDetails of the merger are here:\n\n [Oklo Inc. - Oklo, an Advanced Fission Technology Company, to Go Public via Merger with AltC Acquisition Corp.](https://oklo.com/newsroom/news-details/2023/Oklo-an-Advanced-Fission-Technology-Company-to-Go-Public-via-Merger-with-AltC-Acquisition-Corp/) \n\nHighlights of merger include a long lock up period and this merger is quoted as \"not being done to give early investors a chance to cash out.\"  Transaction values Oklo at 850M (holds 516M in cash) and this transaction provides another 500M of capital for continued operations.  ALCC market cap today is 580M.  There is immediate value above todays trading price there. Merger is expected to go through in Q2 2024\n\nAmendment to SEC Form S-4 was filed yesterday. Viewable here (maybe).  Multiple filings with SEC posted this week.    \n [XBRL Viewer (sec.gov)](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm) \n\nSam also put up 375M of the 500M recently raised by Helion-- a nuclear FUSION company--for larger scale applications.  They are not direct competitors because OKLO is focused on small FISSION reactors 15-50MW and Helion is focused on FUSION.  For reference, 15MW is enough to power about 3000 Single Family Homes.\n\n [Oklo Inc. - Home](https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx)  \\-- lots of information on their website.\n\n  \n\\--Oklo has been around since 2013.  They are going public to support the buildout of their facilities in Idaho and Ohio.    \n\\--Sam got involved in 2014 when he was president of Y combinator.  This is a bet on Sam, his knowledge, connections, and his belief that we will need nuclear power to support our AI ambitions.    \n\\--Technology used in the proposed Oklo reactor has been around since the 1960s.  This will help with regulatory approvals.   \n\\--Public and political opinions surrounding nuclear power are trending more favorable.  Meaning nuclear is still up for discussion regardless of who wins the election in November.  \n\\--We are continually consuming more and more power.  We will have to scale up our output somehow.  All signs are pointing to that additional power coming from nuclear.  \n\n\nThere is more to this but I am out of time. Discussion can continue later in the comments.  \nPositions:  \n800 shares @ 12.66  \n10 - 15C 4/19/24   \n1 - 15C 5/17/24  \n25 - 20C 6/21/24\n\nThis is not financial advice and I am highly regarded.",
