He owns 7 million shares of OKLO and if they are able to capture a portion of that business, it would be a massive source of recurring revenue. Aside from that, there was an NRC white paper released last week stating that new nuclear site reviews (post-initial) can now take as little as 7 months, which significant towards scaling efforts. Oklo already has an order book of 1.35GW which translates to $1.2B/yr in annual recurring revenue post-deployment.\n\nAs far as other reasons to believe- They have the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, a strong leadership team with PhDs, first mover advantage within the NRC application process and have hired on former regulatory staff, reactor technology that was already proven through decades of testing between 1964-1994, unique expertise within uranium recycling, and probably most importantly, partnership commitments driven by a robust commercialization model that is scalable and profitable overtime. This fits well with the future local energy needs of AI data centers.\n\nIs current valuation too high? Maybe not. They are further ahead of NuScale ($SMR) by as much as 5 years, and are fully funded through their first two builds through 2028, so lower risk of dilution. If they were trading at NuScale’s market cap of $4.7B, that would imply over $40/share, so closing that gap may provide more upside. I’m confident that OKLO will be a 10-bagger in the next 5 years and potentially 100-bagger in the next 15 years when the heavy scaling takes place. I’m not selling until then regardless.",
