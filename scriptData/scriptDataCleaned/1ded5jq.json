Yet, the priority of absurdly overpaid management (was just one, now three) is not to create shareholder value and monetize these assets as best as possible, but to remain absurdly overpaid management for as long as possible. \n\nEveryone in this stock all the way down wanted a good deal, they didn't want some sorta/kinda deal that would see the company remain public - and they couldn't even get that done.\n\nBad company, you have someone who is a majority shareholder who is only looking out for themselves - yes, there will likely be shareholders making a fuss but the losses and eventual result probably won't wind up being worth the time/energy/losses/etc.\n\nBuffett - who I'm surprised was behind the decision to buy PARA, I thought it was Todd or Ted - already dumped and took a huge loss.",
