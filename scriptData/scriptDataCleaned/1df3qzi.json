      "body": "Memes aside, I've had my eye on GRND for a while. Fundamentally speaking; Marketcap is about $1.6bn. Net debt is about 300 million. Monetization is only 7% of monthly active users - if Grindr can increase monetization to Tinder levels, the company will bring in around $500 million a year in profit, yielding a market cap of $10 billion at a 20x multiple. If they can grow the user base by targeting Gen Z and expand internationally they could double or triple active user count resulting in a market cap of $20-30 billion. There's a good case to be made this stock is substantially undervalued, possibly a future 10 bagger.",
