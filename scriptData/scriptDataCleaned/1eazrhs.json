Second, subrogation is a means to stand in the shoes of the insured and sue the entities your insured has claims against (typically, those arising of the loss the insurer has or will indemnify on the insured’s behalf). So, the insurers for crowdstrike won’t attempt subrogation against crowdstrike because that is not what subrogation is by definition. \n\nTo the extent the insurer wants or believes it is entitled to limit or preclude coverage to its insured under its own policies, its remedy is declaratory judgment seeking a court order that certain losses are not covered. It’s called a coverage action, where the insurer sues its insured and asks the court to interpret the contract as applied to the circumstances. That would focus entirely on what the policies say and whether they apply given the facts at hand.",
