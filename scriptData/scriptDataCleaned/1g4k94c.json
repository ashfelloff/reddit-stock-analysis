                          "body": "korea is very democratic, but that means the term \"eat the rich\" is a very real mindset. capital gains taxes aside korea has its own wealth/inheritance tax that is outside of the realm of possibilities for most of the developed world. \n\nthe transfer of wealth from one person to another, spouses and children included, in cash or in other \"gifts\" in assets, are taxed in a stepladder system from 10% up to 50% based on the amount. and no, you cannot take korean assets and just offshore it in the caymans. that is illegal unless you also pay the same tax above AND file with the korean federal reserve equivalent on why you are sending the money, and must file a follow up of asset acquisition with said funds every single year until asset becomes worthless, transferred, or returned to a domestic bank.\n\nthis thicket of rules makes transfer of wealth between the uber-rich very difficult, but making a lot of money from leveraging (crypto, options) is one way to avoid all that as \"new money\" isn't taxed as heavily as korea has very generous income tax brackets. hence insider trading and knowledge is the bread and butter of the elite, and government goes nuclear because the korean gov is your wife that will absolutely pry that money out of your cold, dead hands.",

          "body": "Shorting stocks is unfairly demonized and misunderstood in my opinion.  Shorting stocks doesn't really provide any more or less value than longing a stock.  Essentially, longs are just betting that a stock is under-valued or will go up, while shorts are betting that a stock is over-valued or will go down.\n\nI don't think being able to short really stabilizes the market per se (as speculative markets like the stock market are inherently unstable), but bans or restrictions on short selling can arguably exacerbate the instability.  For example, [a temporary ban on the short-selling of financial stocks in 2008](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci18-5.html) failed to slow the decline in the price of financial stocks when it was in place, and may have made it worse.\n\nGenerally, shorting is not what crashes markets, because:\n\n1. Anyone who sells short a stock, must then BUY the stock back in order to exit their short position.\n2. For the overwhelming majority of stocks (nearly all of them), there are far more shares longed than shorted. Large and mega-cap stocks usually have a short interest of less than 5%, which means 95%+ are long.  Even stocks that are referred to as \"heavily shorted stocks\" usually have a short interest of 5%-25% or thereabouts, which means the vast majority of money is still long.\n3. Following the previous point, when stock prices have big declines, it is usually not because \"greedy shorts decided to attack the stock.\"  That can sometimes play a factor, yes, but it is usually not the main driver.  I would more-so attribute the huge price declines to what I would describe as \"a crowded room of long bag-holders bashing their heads into each other to get out of their losing positions, because they fear that they will lose more if they don't get out.\"  The reasons for the decline can be driven by rational thinking about fundamentals (i.e. - \"the stock at its current price is still over-valued given the current outlook for the company, so it should be lower\"), or it can be driven by sentiment reasons (i.e. - \"This company sucks now and the market hates it\" or \"This stock sucks because it keeps going down, so I want out\"), or often both.  But regardless, the stock price decline is happening more-so from long shareholders wanting out than it is from short sellers wanting in.",
