  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Biden Allies Dismiss Calls to Quit in Frenetic Weekend Blitz](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-29/biden-allies-dismiss-calls-to-quit-in-frenetic-weekend-blitz)\n\nI’ll likely not be posting on Wednesday because the market closes early, and those days are typically pretty slow. Happy early fourth of July everyone!\n\n**[CHWY](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=CHWY)-** SEC filing reveals 6.6% stake by DFV. Watching this closely at open, and at $30/$35/$40 levels. [For everyone who said it wasn’t his tweet that made the stock spike from 28 ->39 or that CHWY spiked before DFV posted.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/783/852/ea1.jpg)\n\n**[GME](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=GME)-** Fell likely due to DFV’s reveal of his stake in CHWY. (WOOF as well)\n\n**[SPR](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=SPR)-** BA agrees to buy SPR in $4.7B deal, SPR makes fuselages (the main body) for planes.\n\n**[NKE](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NKE)-** Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. I’m watching to see if we bounce at the open. Have a small position long but nothing huge in this.\n\n**[AMZN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)-** We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday and the day before, will continue to watch this but will remove from list (or keep as a footnote) tomorrow.\n",
