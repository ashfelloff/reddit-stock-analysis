You do not fight for a pension plan, if you hate the company so much, you would leave next week, if you could. You fight for a pension plan, because you want to stay in that company. Boeing thinks, the pension plan is to expensive? Well, if it´s to expensive for the company, guess, who clearly has less options to generate as much security for their old age? \n\nThese workers have sacrificed for Boeing. They have been badly disappointed by Boeing and yet still they fight for a common future with Boeing. Their demands this year are nothing more than the expectation, that Boeing does it´s part of \"in good times and in bad times\" for once.\n\nThese worker want to rebuild the old Boeing. And they don´t accept a new start, beginning with the idea, that \"not everything was wrong\" in the failed Boeing ideology. I admit it´s counterintuitive, but these striking workers are the biggest asset Boeing currently has.",
