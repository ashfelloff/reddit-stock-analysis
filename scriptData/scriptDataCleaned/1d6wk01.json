You can check them, AMD has more fps in native most of the time, but given the fact that the difference its minuscule, I like to judge it by cost per fps, so just go for the cheaper one.\n\nA 4090 its another story becouse amd dont have such a card, so yeah, If you want to go to the best rig money can buy, this card is the one.",
