  "score": 403,
  "selftext": "Over the long term, the average return for the S&P 500 in September has typically been negative or close to zero. For instance, from 1928 through 2023, the average return in September has been around -0.5% to -1%. However, these figures can vary slightly depending on the specific time period and market conditions being analyzed. It's worth noting that while September is historically weaker, past performance isn't necessarily indicative of future results.",

If they sell it earlier that might work or might not work. Sure maybe if we had a huge selloff in August, we might just recover in Sept. But since we have recovered very quickly to all time high in August, the Sept sell off is more likely.\n\nAnyways the reason why Sept is bad is because it is typically the hurricane season which causes disruptions, also congress starts coming back from summer and debate fiscal policies, and companies and the fed will start to give guidance for next year. All of these are sources of uncertainty, and when you have uncertainty the market tends to price in some probabilities for negative news, which leads to corrections",
