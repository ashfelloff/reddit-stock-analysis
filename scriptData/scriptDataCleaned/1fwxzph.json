Nothing like that is really happening today. The economy is fine. Sure there was inflation and now there’s fears of an economic slowdown but to me it seems to just be normal—just a normal economic cycle. People are productive. People are employed. Wages are growing. Sure, there might be problems like an AI bubble or the dock strike or the Israel conflict or Russia conflict but nothing that really threatens the overall health of the economy.

The debt looks insane from an absolute numbers perspective—but ultimately the way the world’s economy works is that most countries spend money they don’t have, promising to pay more in the future assuming the interest they pay on their debt will be outpaced by their economic growth/growth in taxes. Strikes, economic downturns, crises, wars, and inflation occurred throughout history and will continue to occur. But for the most part the world continues to thrive and by most metrics the world gets better every year. Social media and especially Reddit will make you think the world is about to collapse but that’s just the type of content that rises to the top because it evokes more emotion and therefore gets more engagement.",
