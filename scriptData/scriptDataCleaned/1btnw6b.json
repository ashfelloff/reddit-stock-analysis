  "selftext": "Positions: 30c 4/26 $100, tldr at bottom\n\nPhilip Morris ($PM) is one of the largest tobacco companies worldwide. Most people have experienced PM through the most iconic American cigarette brand - Marlboro.  Besides Marlboro, PM owns some of the most popular cigarettes worldwide - Parliament, Chesterfield, Virginia Slims, and more.  [PM also recently acquired Swedish Match last year](https://www.swedishmatch.com/globalassets/documents/presentations/2023_companypresentation_swedishmatch_en.pdf). \n\nSwedish Match is the largest and most successful company when it comes to oral nicotine pouches. Their biggest brands include General, Göteborgs Rapé, and, most importantly, ZYN.  ZYN has been blowing up in the media over the past year. Most notably Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and many professional baseball players have been walking advertisments for ZYN pouches. \n\nThis word-of-mouth advertising has done wonders for Swedish Match, and therefore Philip Morris as well.   From the [Q4 2023 Earnings Release](https://philipmorrisinternational.gcs-web.com/static-files/33e7f95e-90d2-4883-91d8-df2446d176d0):  \n\n\\> \"ZYN nicotine pouch shipment volume in the U.S. of 116.3 million cans, representing growth of 78.2% versus fourth-quarter 2022 Swedish Match shipments of 65.3 million cans\" \n\n\\> \"Adjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 increased by 11.0%, excluding currency, driven primarily by the organic growth in adjusted operating income, as well as the results of the Swedish Match business and its strong performance led by ZYN in the U.S.\"\n\n \\> \"Nicotine pouch shipment volume increased by 68.6% compared to Swedish Match's fourth-quarter 2022 shipment volume of 73.8 million cans, mainly driven by 78.2% growth for ZYN in the U.S. -- an outstanding performance that reflected continued broad strength across the country. In Scandinavia, shipment volume for nicotine pouches grew by 3.0%\"  \n\nAnyone who has tried ZYN knows that these things are AWESOME, and [the public agrees](https://www.sfchronicle.com/health/article/zyn-nicotine-pouches-18713916.php) \n\nNow, same with Juul back around 2018, we all know the most loyal and dedicated customers for tobacco alternatives: ~~Ex-smokers~~ children. ZYN has blown up all over TikTok in a way that vaping could not. Lately, the news has been spreading about smokeless nicotine appearing on underaged users' social media, but this has been going on for much longer. These pouches have slowly been taking place of vapes for underaged users over the past year, most notably among college students. However, there's been a large recent uptick in use among high-schoolers due to both the fact that it is seen as \"healthier\" than vaping, as well as that it can be done easily without being caught. \n\nFor the past year, ZYN has been set up to be the next Juul - the perfect form of nicotine for those who have to hide their use. I believe this quarter's earnings and next are going to reflect the social media popularity of oral nicotine pouches.  This really is like investing into Juul before it made its way into the schools.\n\nConsider these factors: \n\nPM has been considered a strong-moderate buy YTD \n\nI'm literally just banking on enough teens buying ZYNs that PM made money. I'm assuming everything else will be the same as last quarter \n\n~~I'm in the red overall~~ Went back green today, buying more calls for earnings\n\nThey're also [selling some shares](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68561614) in alcohol companies  \n\nEven when PM beats expectations, their stock drops \n\n[I have Clinodactyly, a condition found in 3% of the regular population, but in 25% of those with down syndrome.](https://www.chop.edu/conditions-diseases/clinodactyly#:~:text=Clinodactyly%20is%20the%20medical%20term,Down%20syndrome%20(trisomy%2021)) Let this one marinate \n\ntdlr; kids love nicotine, ZYN is the new craze, underage use will skyrocket $PM sales\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4/2 edits:\n-This isn’t going to actually hit $100, many people have pointed out why this is true. Sell the hype. $PM has not been over $100 since 2017.\n-ZYN operates under Swedish Match NA, owned by Philip Morris International ($PM)",

Like I've tried a lot of things in my life and nothing else I've ever tried comes close to being as addictive as those zyn pouches. I dont think they should get banned because they are still a better nicotine option than cigarettes or vaping, but they should at least put a limit on how much nicotine they are allowed to put in the pouches.  I was using the 6 MG pouches, and there is only 1-2 MG of nicotine in a cigarette. \n\nShout out to the Kirkland brand nicotine gum, they were the thing that finally worked for me. I tried quitting probably 10 times before this. My nicotine intake is down from about 60 MG/day when I was using zyn to just 4 MG in 2 weeks. I started using regular gum in place of the nicotine gum now and feel like I've almost got my nicotine problem kicked for good.",

Meanwhile PMI did over $35 billion in net revenues last year... so it's like 3% of their revenues right now. In other words: it will take a long long time before this will have a meaningful impact on their sales. It's nice, sure but relatively small potatoes for them. Also, Altria (which owns Philip Morris USA), and Philip Morris International (PM) are two entirely separate companies. Altria is one that's sold some of their position in Anheuser Busch-Inbev recently. PMI has nothing to do with that whatsoever.

Vaping, although lacking tobacco as well, has effects on the lungs. This is compounded by the fact that the ease of use results in users hitting them non stop. Also, there is the unfortunate reality that restrictions on vaping within the US have created a market of Chinese manufactured disposables that are highly questionable. The ease of use of vaping also results in a massive uptake in nicotine consumption compared to other methods, especially cigarettes. Nicotine itself, although not carcinogenic, can be detrimental to the reward system, especially one of a developing mind. \n\nI’d say zyns are arguably safer than vaping because of what I have said, although using them in one spot consistently can really harm your gums. Plus, patches and gum probably have the edge. At least, the gum moves around your mouth, and patches are patches.\n\nI do agree though that a lot of anti-vaping propaganda is simply an effort to protect the tobacco market. That’s why a lot of us are vaping china vapes in the first place.",
