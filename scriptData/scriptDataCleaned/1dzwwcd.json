I saw positive momentum with further upside for NVDA on a week with little “NVDA news” (earnings, conf, product launch). I got that and got out before some Fed or Bank earnings news potentially flubs the week. This aligns w/ my strategy on most trades: take profit/don’t seek a top. Have I left some $ on the table in trades? Absolutely. But I’ve been seriously burned before by trades where I got greedy AF. I have some grit to withstand volatility, recognize the risk, and I’ve come out positive on out-quicker-when-positive trades and I’m ok with that. I’m positive YTD and all-time (trading 4 years). Hoping to keep that up. \n\nCheers",
