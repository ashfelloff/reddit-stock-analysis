  "selftext": "Small caps are more sensitive to macro-economics and so recession fears (whether or not an actual recession occurs) are certainly not great for small caps. Additionally if investors are fearful and not greedy, it’s likely that they’ll prefer putting their money into more defensive investments like utilities.\n\nThen again, if the fed is trying to meet their dual mandate and keep the unemployment rate at a reasonable level, they’ll be much more likely to have more rate cuts between now and the end of the year, perhaps as many as 100 bps. This would obviously benefit small cap companies most, as they rely most heavily on loans; after all, it was the possibility of an impending ding rate cut that initiated this rotation in the first place, so a steeper rate cut would likely bode well for small caps.\n\nThe Russell 2000 etf (IWM) was trading at 201 when it skyrocketed to a peak of 224 when the rotation to small caps occurred, and has since dropped, losing almost all its gains, and closed on Friday at 209.\n\nDo you think small caps still have much steam between now and the end of the year? Or will the great small cap rotation end with a rotation out of small caps in the near term?",

I was buying these after they got battered and now I have some \"forever\" dividend stocks that are all up significantly in terms of principal. They will of course run more when rates decrease. In general small caps are way more rate sensitive since they typically carry more debt (or in the case of banks, its interest premium). So I think it makes sense to increase exposure to small and mid caps, but long term growth, big-tech and associated ETFs (VOO) etc should be the bigger proportion. \n\nI don't trade. I invest, so I don't believe in these \"rotations\" of trades. You buy low and what I am saying is that a lot of interest rate sensitive stocks and bond proxies have been running up for about a year. But they will keep running up some more because, the actual effects of lower rates will kick in.",
