But you have some capital left, more than enough to make back your losses today plus more. You just need to know when to be regarded and when not to. You need to find volatility (earnings, fomc, cpi) and buy calls AND puts either OTM or ATM, same expiry. Ideally with very close delta. You do not need to predict direction, only the volatility. The second derivative will do the rest for you. \n\nObviously not financial advice. Godspeed",
