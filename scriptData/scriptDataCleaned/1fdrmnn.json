If NVDA is $140 or less on Dec. 20th, you just keep the premium from the call contract, which hopefully expires worthless. The premium on the $140 Dec 20 call you’re wanting to sell fluctuates with the stock price so that probably what you’re seeing go up and down. As the stock price goes up, so does the call premium; how much it goes up is based on the option’s delta.",

      "body": "How to cheat the market of 20 trillion?\n\nOver two years (1H24 to 1H22), net income of US public non-financial companies declined by 1.5% at par and fell by 7.9% on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n\nMeanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading (Amazon factor), profits collapsed 18% at par and 23.3% when adjusted for inflation. \n\nAt the same time, the US market was balancing in the 3600-3800 range with a break to 3500 points (1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24).\n\nProfits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success (the difference in capitalization now and then).\n\nMental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality it’s stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.\n\nThis is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that don’t exist.\n\nIs it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, it’s true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports: \n\n- Trading: +10.7% y/y and +43.5% for 2Q24, and for 1H24 +11.6% y/y and +44.2% for two years (further in the sequence shown).\n\n- Medical: +38.9% and -22.2% / -19.5% and -44.9% (!)\n\n- Consumer Discretionary: -23.6% and -2.1% due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss / -8.7% and +0.7%.\n\n- Industrials: +4.4% and +4.7% / -9.3% and +10.3%.\n\n- Commodities and utilities: -13% and -52.1% / -21.1% and -33.9% (!)\n\n- Transportation and communications: +37.5% and +0.1% / +10% and -5.8%.\n\n- Technology: +22.8% and +38.9% / +30.7% and +24%.\n\nThese data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative (medical, raw materials and transportation, communications), two are in the zero (consumer discretionary and industrials) and only two sectors are in the plus (technology and trade due to Amazon).\n\nThere are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai (look it up).",
