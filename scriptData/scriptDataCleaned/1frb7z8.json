It’s held by a solid number of proven companies with tons of upside. Sure, the diversification could certainly be better, but it depends on his investment time horizon and what his own perception on systemic risks in the market might be. I switched to high dividend yielding investments during 2021 and switch to growth in summer 2023, with an extremely high and growing concentration in tech and particularly NVDA.

I did not say financials are no problem, nor did I say anything about them being more profitable than TSMC.\n\nYour argument for AMD is wrong, and that's what I am criticizing.\n\nYou talk about Intel not being a CPU players anymore, even though Intel is currently leading or at least even,in CPU development. Hence my example.\n\nI did not criticize the investment itself. I own AMD, I own Intel, as well as TSMC. \n\nMy Nvidia share is lower because I assume it to be overvalued, and their profits rely too much on their margins, which could be significantly reduced by TSMC or even by a competitor product that offers better price/performance. CUDA, as a monopoly, is currently becoming more and more unimportant as the space progresses, and ROCm is being further developed. MIA300x or Gaudi3 can and will take more market share as they are further developed. Additionally, inference-focused NPUs or TPUs (Alphabet comes to mind) are generating more synthetic data, as well as scaling LLM performance with processing time. AlphaZero  and O1 rely more and more on inference than on pure pre-training. This can be wrong, just too risky in my mind. \n\nNow you say TSMC is the \"ruler.\" I did not say Intel fabs are more profitable than TSMC currently or will be soon. On the technology side, with backside power delivery as well as high-NA EUV on A18, Intel might soon be ahead in pure technological capability. This does not mean they will be more profitable than TSMC. It also has little to do with what you should invest in.\n\nI am just pointing out that your thesis is wrong. You can have the right investment while having a wrong thesis.",
