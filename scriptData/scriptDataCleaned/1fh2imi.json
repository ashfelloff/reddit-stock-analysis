  "selftext": "I'm the degenerate that bought way OTM calls on $DG and $DLTR because $1 stores are trash and the options were cheap lotto tickets. How you find these plays; get a thesis going, then check for lottery tickets, then manage your risk. \n\nThe play? The deepest OTM calls on $COST, at various strikes and dates as follows:  \n\n\n10/4 1040c for $1.67/each  \n10/18 1200c for $0.40/each  \n12/20 1300c for $0.69/each.  \n  \nI started earlier this week with the 980 and 990 calls, but they were up 80% and 33% respectively, so I sold those and loaded up on the above. \n\nI know what you're thinking, \"Dude, you're fucking stupid\". A little, but besides the point. Here's the thesis. \n\n1) Its fucking Costco. Just look at that chart. Speaking of chart?  \n2) $COST is the $NVDA of grocery stores, essentially. Better and better every year, since they both opened. Well run companies, good products and financials, blah blah blah. Why compare to NVDA? The split.   \n3) The strikes on the options chains. DG was a play because the 100p were cheap and was a critical level on the chart. DLTR on the other hand? **Yes, the 65p was also at a key level on the chart. But 65 was the lowest strike on the chain.** \n\nThink about it. If the stock prices goes higher (or lower) than the highest (or lowest) strike on the chain, the people writing those options have **NO** hedge. \n\nHow? Well, not everyone is a degenerate monkey like we all are. They hedge, instead of zero to hero shit. \n\nFor those unfamiliar with options, here's the ELI5 of it. I write (sell to open) an option, I collect the premium (price paid per contract). I get the money; you get the contract. Contract expires, dope, I get 'free' money. Contract goes ITM, I'm boned, now I have to buy or sell 100 shares to fulfill the contract. At a loss. An example. \n\nSay I think WMT will go down by next Friday, to $75. WMT is now $80.60/share. \n\nSo, I write a 75c for WMT (sell to open) that expires 9/20 and collect \\~$6.10 in premium. 1 of 3 things will happen. \n\n1) WMT hits $75, or below by 9/20. Instead of $5 ITM, it is barely ITM and only worth $1.06/contract. So, I buy one of the contracts for $1.06 to \"buy to close\". Sold it for $6.10, bought it back for $1.06, I keep the $5.04 in extra premium in my pocket.\n\n2) Stock price does nothing, pretty much all week. The option is still $5 ITM by Friday, but worth less than the $6.10 I wrote it for on Monday. Price is still the same, but now there is less than 24 hours to expiration instead of 5 days. You buy to close the same option back for $3-4, still collect $1-2 in premium. \n\n3) WMT rips to $85, now the option you wrote is $10 ITM and is worth $10. Either it gets exercised and you lose money, or you buy to open another contract for $10 and still lose money.  \n\nSo, how do you hedge for the possibility of scenario 3? You buy the 80c for $1.06 roughly. If WMT does rip to $85 that week, yes the 75c you wrote is worth $10 instead of $5. But the 80c you bought as a hedge for $1.06 is now $5 ITM and is worth the same $5 you lost on the contract you wrote. That is the hedge\n\n  \nWhy bring all of this up like I have any idea of what I'm talking about? \n\n**Well, what happens when the $75 is the highest strike on the options chain? You can't buy the 80c for a hedge, because it does not exist.** \n\nThat is where the play comes in. If COST posts good ER (usually do because they're COST, and increased membership so money money) **AND** they announce a split on their 9/26 ER? This thing absolutely rips. \n\n**IF** this happens, $1100 is my price target by 10/4. \n\n**This is a BIG IF so position yourself with money you are comfortable seeing go to ZERO.**\n\nBut if this does work? We can all buy our own Wendy's. \n\nLet us assume that this play works as I'm imagining it and COST hits $1050-$1100/share by 10/4.   \n  \n- The 10/4 1040c will be $10-60 ITM, \\~$17.50-$52.50/each up from $1.67/each  \n- The 10/18 1200c will be $100-150 OTM instead of $280 OTM. Hard to estimate from options chain, but definitely worth more than the 0.40/each we buy them for. And, by 10/18, those could possibly even be ITM also.   \n- The 12/20 1300c will also be worth more than we paid for them. \n\nI'll post my positions below in a photo, with some charts. \n\nThis is my next play, and I'm putting up 10% of my capital at risk on it. \n\nIf you only want one option to keep track of, go with the 10/4 1040c for sure. \n\nCurrently, they are $1.67/each. **START a position, don't fucking load up on them all at once! Risk only what you're willing to see go to ZERO.**\n\nSo, whatever 1% of your capital is. Risk that and start the position on Monday. Whether that is 1, 10, or 100 contracts. Fuck it. Only 1-2% of your capital. \n\nAfter that, watch and observe. Options go down and value and are less than $1.67/each? Then add more. This is what I will be doing, until the total of the bet accounts for 10% of my bankroll. 5% if you want to be conservative, but I'm risking 10% on this one. \n\n***tl;dr: I'm regarded and think COST will do a stock split, and will rip past 1060 (to put options writers in an awkward and unhedged position). $COST will rip to $1100 by 10/4, and the 1040c will be $1-$60 ITM. They're only $1.67/each right now, cheap lotto tickets with decent enough odds.***",

Free trade. Come Monday, I'm thinking there is a short term pull back next week. I'll be selling some of the 10/18 1200c on Monday, and look to buy back. I'll leave the 1040c alone. Not selling any of them. If they decrease in value, I buy more of them. I want to have at least 20 of them before ER. Maybe more, depending on what I feel like risking. \n\nI'm wrong, they go to zero. If I'm right? Then I have 20+ $COST options that are ITM by $1-$60 each. Check the options chain yourself and see what a $COST option is worth barely ITM. \n\n***These options go to zero, or they are 10-50 baggers.***",

While there are a lot of speculations that this is on the horizon for Costco due to its current valuation (getting close to $920/share now and has been up 24% ytd) there is no official announcement about this happening. Costco isn't a tech company, explosive growth is not what they are about. It is an incredible and well run company of course and is considered a compounding machine, so it's basically a golden investment vehicle for a long term portfolio to build wealth.\n\nA stock split would be great to see and could drive more investment, but I don't think it would happen as quickly as you are thinking. Lots of these successful compounding machine style companies don't move quickly, generally a 1% - 2% rise or fall is all you see from them most days. Nothing at Costco or other great companies like Mastercard or Moody's or even Texas Roadhouse happen quickly. They make announcements for things months in advance, do their earnings calls and that's about it. They are boring to follow for someone looking to day trade simply because their stock isn't volatile.  But in long term investing they are absolutely top tier. Boring is great!\n\nTl;dr Costco doesn't and probably won't move as fast as you think, even if a stock split is announced Monday. Just two cents from a long term holder of Costco.",

What I would do personally (and did with my 980 and 990 calls) would be to sell them, take some of the profits and throw it into the 10/4 1040c options. \n\nYou're already up big, and the time-decay will be far less worse on the 1040c than your 950c since the 950c is close to ITM, but the 1040 is far OTM. \n\nJust what I'd do.",
