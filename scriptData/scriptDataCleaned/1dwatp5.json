  "selftext": "Thinking back to when I lost it all.\n\nIt‚Äôs been awhile since I had to give up stocks and trading since I pretty much lost everything I had. Not the worst out there but considering I pretty much never had seen that much money before this was a substantial amount for me to bear and pretty much knocked me out of the game for awhile. I made some pretty dumb plays; trying to trade at work or on my 15 minute breaks, invested in bad penny stocks ( an EV stock)  lmfao, and overall I learned a good amount so if the day comes where I can get back into the market I‚Äôll be more focused on investing in indexes and setting a small portion for trading on the side. Hats off to whoever made it successfully day trading. How long did it take for you to become successful and how much did you need to lose before that? I gave about a year of nonstop everyday learning the charts and the market but I just couldn‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm only 23 I‚Äôll be able to get back off the ground. ",

However, I've reached a point where if I wake up at 3.30 to watch the market and see a random penny stock that was up 20% go to 200% I no longer feel like kicking myself for not getting in. Random options trades I entered were up 100% within minutes but didn't get out waiting for more. It's like I make a plan, then when the time comes to execute it I do something entirely different. Anyway, the plan right now is to start again small and take small gains if I can find them, not try to recover all my previous losses in one trade.",

These companies will work their absolute hardest to scam all their workers into the lowest possible wages and return profits to the shareholder, to you. Don't go for cheap, bad companies because of the \"potential to moon\", go for the proven winners. I personally invest in a wide range of individual companies, but Msci world index will likely outperform me.
