Was there a report that was released the same day?  Did Imotep speak?  Find anything that can possibly justify such a big correction. Also ask yourself, was there any good news (that resulted in SPY rallying) that preceded this drop.  Also, was the sell of a Thursday?\n\nIf you can't find any news or find only irrational news, then most likely it was an overreaction to something.  The market will probably recover the next day.\n\n\nKnowing to identify irrational sell offs that most likely will recover the next day (most likely a Friday) is key to making killer returns on 1DTE contracts.  \n\nSo be patient, keep dry gunpowder at the ready, spot a market-wide sell off on a Thursday for no absolute reason.  Then load up on calls for the *following* Friday (because we ain't regarded apes), and set sell orders for +30% gains.  If you want to be regarded, do 0DTE and skip the sell orders and hover on your phone for the entire morning on Friday.  You'll probably can catch the +100% gain if you're degenerate enough.",

But if you can be disciplined and keep cash at the ready, I don't see how you can't make incremental gains.  \n\nI typically wait for the monthly CPI report.  People usually freak out before the report is released (the irrational signal I'm waiting for).  Then there's the FOMC meeting.  Another time the market usually freaks out.  Then a few days later, the minutes are released (again, sometimes triggering an irrational reaction). There is also the unemployment report. \n\nStart jotting down these dates on the calendar.  Pay attention on how the market reacts to the news and make a note of it (was the news positive, neutral or negative and did the market go in up or down in response).  Were there any catalyst happening at the same time?  Any international news (like war)?  What time of the year is it and what financial quarter are we in (hint: Q1 and Q4 are when stupid things tend to happen).  \n\nThere's so many things to keep track of, but at the same time, only a few things that actually matter, that you sort of get a sense of how things are going.",
