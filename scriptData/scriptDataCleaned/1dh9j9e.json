It’s an investment you commit to, not something your paper hands are gonna break when it drops by $10 next week. Because a year from now the price could be doubled. A year from then it could be doubled again, a year from then it could split. Etc.\nThe truth is nobody knows, and everyone has different agendas - the bears saying it’ll crash are praying and hoping it will crash, and the bulls are praying and hoping it will keep rising, and they’re trying to push the market into their agenda hoping others will believe them and invest or divest - the bottom line is neither are right until it happens.

Thought of capturing principal and leave gains in, but too much drag with this decision. Even with a 20-30% correction Im still up 50% with future upside, so why sell at all really? Also I get taxed at 37% if I sell before 1 year. The only decision I can take confidently right now is to not buy more at this point, and wait for a significant correction to do that.

The crash upwards.  The melt up.  \n\nHere's the thing though: The broader market is showing signs of weakness left and right.  For every bit the S&P goes higher the more reason we have to correct.  Having a bearish sentiment is the smart thing to do.  This does not mean you go all in on a crash tomorrow.  This means you play cautiously aware that the top can be any day.\n\nThe markets are psychology.  Those news articles play into that all the time.  When you see large divergences like we are seeing now, expect volatility.  A correction that happens in already high volatility can get pretty extreme.",
