There are a few notable cases where it has happened, but that's usually due to outright fraud.  \n\n\nCompanies like Netflix, Amazon, Meta, etc. don't get killed overnight, and at the time there really weren't any real signs they were going to the wayside.  To be frank, I didn't even think that the Netflix and Meta gains would be as rapid as they have been (I was thinking Meta would settle in the $250 range after tanking, and slowly go up from there).  Still, when FUD happens with megacap stocks, it's really worth delving deeper into if it's based on some metric, or if it's just irrational FUD.",

Apple has the halo factor around their product that helps with rich valuation. Forward P/E for GOOG is around 20 while AAPL is tad above 30. Based on growth it has to be other way around. Cloud I feel has a long run way. Could double in next 4 years with increasing margins as well.",

So if they add a service, then they can add revenue among this big consumer base. \n\nFor Alphabet, they don't have a big consumer base that owns a car already, that they can just add on autonomous driving.
