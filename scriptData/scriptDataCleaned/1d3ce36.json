  "selftext": "Abercrombie & Fitch reported its strongest first quarter in its history on Wednesday, continuing a winning streak that again exceeded expectations.\n\nThe retailer‚Äôs sales jumped 22% compared to last year, while profits were nearly seven times higher and came in well ahead of Wall Street‚Äôs estimates.\n\nShares were up about flat in premarket trading.\n\nHere‚Äôs how the apparel company did in its first fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.14 vs. $1.74 expected\n\nRevenue: $1.02 billion vs. $963.3 million expected\n\nThe company‚Äôs reported net income for the three-month period that ended May 4 was $113.9 million, or $2.14 per share, compared with $16.6 million, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier. \n\nSales rose to $1.02 billion, up about 22% from $836 million a year earlier.\n\n‚ÄúWe successfully navigated seasonal transitions with relevant assortments and compelling marketing, leveraging agile chase capabilities and inventory discipline, driving sales above our expectations,‚Äù CEO Fran Horowitz said in a news release. ‚ÄúGrowth was broad-based across regions and brands with Abercrombie brands registering 31% growth and Hollister brands delivering growth of 12%.‚Äù\n\nAbercrombie has been one of the biggest winners in retail. As it stares down a tough year of comparisons, the company is building on the double-digit sales growth it saw in 2023.\n\nThe retailer‚Äôs comparable sales grew 21%, on top of the 3% growth it saw in the year-ago period. Abercrombie is expecting sales to increase again in the current fiscal year, and increased its revenue guidance.\n\nFor the full year, the retailer now expects sales to grow about 10%, compared to a previous outlook of between 4% and 6%. Analysts had expected growth of about 7%, according to LSEG.\n\nFor the current quarter, Abercrombie anticipates sales will increase by a mid-teens percentage, ahead of estimates of up 9%, according to LSEG.\n\nHorowitz plans to build on the company‚Äôs success by developing its Hollister brand, which accounts for about half of the company‚Äôs overall sales, and bringing more categories to its namesake banner. In March the retailer debuted the ‚ÄúA&F Wedding Shop‚Äù ‚Äì a collection of apparel for brides and attendees that can be used not only for the day of but also for other wedding parties, like bachelorette festivities and rehearsals. \n\nPieces in the collection, which include a range of dresses, bikinis, pajamas, skirts and other items, range between $80 and $150. The mid-tier price point for a day that‚Äôs typically very costly for many couples gives Abercrombie an in with the value-seeking consumer and a foothold in the overall bridal wear market, which is expected to reach $83.5 billion in the U.S. by 2030, according to ResearchAndMarkets.com. \n\nOver the last six years, Abercrombie has been working to transform itself from an exclusionary retailer that used loud branding and shirtless models to drive sales into a company that‚Äôs focused on inclusivity and geared towards working millennials. \n\nThe company‚Äôs transformation is years in the making, but began to bear fruit in 2023 when the retailer posted a 16% annual sales gain at the same time the U.S. apparel market shrunk. Its stock surged 285% in 2023 and is up another 73% so far this year as of Tuesday‚Äôs close, outpacing the S&P 500‚Ä≤s gains of 11%. \n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/abercrombie-fitch-anf-earnings-q1-2024.html",

Following retail trends but also at the same time supplying quality basics at a relatively obtainable price point. It is so many people's \"go-to\" for jeans/polos/jackets/sweatpants as well as the athleisure category that Nike and Lululemon thrive in. If you saw a trend or \"movement\" on Tiktok, that stuff was available at AnF. To me, people are sick of the \"fast fashion\" like H&M and Zara but aren't going to pony up and go high end prices like full priced designer. \n\nThis is something that Banana Republic/GAP and even Jcrew failed to capture over the last 5 years when consumers. No question that while places like Brooks Brothers and Jcrew were shuttering stores and shuffling leadership around - AnF were able to capture attention. \n\nEasy to miss a run-up like this because you hear \"Abercrombie\" and immediately think \"the clothing brand from the 2000s?\" but no, clearly they're innovating in the space.",
