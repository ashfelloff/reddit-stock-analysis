  "selftext": "Listen up regards, Carnival stock has taken a beating after great earnings for what really are not good reasons, and hereâ€™s why itâ€™s a great play at the moment.\n\nEarnings outperformed, and guidance was excellent, I did not expect to get a boner going into a two-hour earnings call, but the figures were just that good. In an industry where guidance is critical to stock valuation, Carnival posted a record quarter in which it upped its yearly estimates for just about every metric.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Performance over the quarter was impressive](https://preview.redd.it/yxifvud04xrc1.png?width=1084&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bf5370671a5ff7609f74362c43443a44fff527a)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Guidance was also increased](https://preview.redd.it/cazkp5i34xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7e2c9169f6c5569d21905b881c4d09461db41a0)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe same thing has occurred before during earnings - On June 26, 2023, Carnival had reported excellent guidance only for stock prices to see a substantial dip on earnings day (See links 1 and 2).\n\nHowever, after an 11% percent dip on June 26 to $14.60, the stock price rallied over 30% by July 5 to $19.10. Considering that Carnival has positioned itself even better as of today, I see this phenomenon repeating itself soon. This is why I purchased OTM calls for this week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Wouldn't be the first time a rebound occurred so quickly after earnings](https://preview.redd.it/0segw61r4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eacc8592e4d9d610a9762f486236e02aea2ecf5)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDebt is large but managed well - Carnival is repaying debt faster than ever on its path to financial health, making roughly 8 billion dollars worth of repayments in the last 15 months, with most of it being ahead of schedule.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Debt repayments have accelerated](https://preview.redd.it/4myl7tuu4xrc1.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3812705e41500a1a072a7ec4db065e9094aefe4)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Company is massive and is finally recovering from COVID-19 :\n\nCarnival received analyst upgrades across the board after its recent earnings call. Analyst forecasts are not incredibly telling. Still, across reports in the last three months, Carnival has received a mean price target of 22.55, signifying a 37.5% increase in price from today. A healthy upward consensus is vital for a company rebounding like CCL (See link 3).\n\nCarnival has the most market share among passengers on any cruise line, so the hit from COVID-19 was unsurprising. Now, however, coronavirus is simply a distant memory for the tourism industry, with cruise demand at record highs.\n\nWhy I think the stock took a beating: If Iâ€™m being honest, I do not understand why the marketâ€™s reaction was so poor; it seems almost artificial. The only reason I can think of was the Baltimore bridge collapse, where a bridge at one of Carnivalâ€™s key ports collapsed. News broke out about this last Wednesday, which is the same as earnings, which could be why there was a 6% dip on Wednesday and Thursday combined. The bridge collapse, however, only constitutes about a $10 million hit to Carnival, which should be pretty insignificant to their bottom line.\n\nAt this point, Carnival shares are highly undervalued, to the extent that I decided to purchase 4dte otm calls, considering I see an imminent acute pickup in stock price.\n\n\\*This is not Financial advice\\*\n\nPosition:\n\n[Position is fairly optimistic, but i think the thesis is sound](https://preview.redd.it/soqd93mk4xrc1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b860ecc709beca6678602924fece0c9af8ee05e6)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR - buy undervalued cruise line stock; it about to go up; if you dumb-dumb and want to gamble like me, purchase short-term OTM calls\n\nWhy won't automod let me post is someone short this. Nvm, let me try removing links. Sources will be in the comments. ",
