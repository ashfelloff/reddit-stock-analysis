Do you just make payments from your additional cash?\n\nHow long have you stayed on max margin? I always thought margin should be used for short term trading because of the constant interest accrual.\n\nHave you been margin called during the big down days? How does that work? Do you just deposit more cash to stay current?\n\nI ask these questions because I have been seriously considering doing the same thing - going all in on NVDA shares using max margin, but I'm still unclear in these areas.\n\nIf you answer these questions based on your experience, I would be greatly appreciative. Thanks, and well done.",

          "body": "Margin interest is added to your margin balance every month automatically. It is not like you get a bill and have to add cash or send a check to pay the interest.\n\nI’ve been doing max margin for over a year. I’ve been selling CC’s, rolling, etc. I got assigned on Crowdstrike sometime in February. I then purchased 1500 shares of NVDA in March using max margin.\n\nI did get margin called when NVDA dropped 10% back around end of April. Please read this part carefully. This is the danger of holding stocks using max margin. Significant price fluctuations mean a great deal when you’re using borrowed money. When I got margin called, I liquidated 68 shares, for roughly $52k. It happens automatically if you do not initiate the trade in the required amount of time, usually like 3 days.\n\nUsing margin is very risky. I sell covered calls to balance out the margin interest and occasional withdrawing I do. I’m sure there are better ways to invest using margin but I was convinced NVDA was a solid play and so here I am. My plan is to hold through the split and see what the stock does, at which time I’ll decide to sell and take gains and switch to cash secured puts.",
