Many, many people have gone through a major financial downturn, including a downturn that resulted in the breakup of a family or a change in immediate prospects, and nevertheless been able to right the ship.  \n\nWe do have done away with debtors' prisons and have mechanisms to dig out from financial ruin, because we, as a society (and a subreddit) don't want peoples' lives to be over because of a financial fuckup.\n\n>A fuckup (financial or otherwise) is an opportunity to take stock, regroup, and hopefully pivot to a new and better way of doing things.\n\n- Mahatma Fucking Gandhi\n\n  \n\n\n\n(*I have passively lost that kind of money and then some by letting cash money sleep for long periods because I was too busy to invest it, or by being ultra-conservative with my investments for long stretches.)",
