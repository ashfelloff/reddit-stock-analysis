The only thing that would really support a catapult case for INTC would be something like a regional Asia-Pacific conflict that threatened the TSMC supply chain. If that were to happen then the INTC fabs sitting in safe little old Ohio start to look pretty lucrative.\n\nTo the other comments about dividend, Intel is one of those stocks that everyone has and don’t know they have it. It’s like the Toyota Camry. Statistically you’ve seen 5 of them already today, but you don’t even notice because they’re so ubiquitous. 401k’s, IRA’s, pension funds, ETF’s, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds—pretty much any long stock investment portfolio has Intel in it somewhere, and they probably didn’t even realize it. I think if there were cuts to the dividend there might be a little bit of a reckoning, but let’s be honest—Intel is trading $8 less than what it was on Jan 2, 2000. It has literally done nothing for the long term investor over the entirety of the 21st century, so if they haven’t sold it by now, they probably never will, regardless of what the dividend does.\n\nI’m waiting for a market event to test that 29.87 area we hit a few weeks ago. If we can test that price and hold it one more time I’ll be buying heavily. My guess is it will be either something with a leadership change or a higher inflation reading that will do it. But I feel pretty confident we can get sub-30 pricing as a long entry.",

No chance the US GOV was going to let them fold, they were basically the corn of the technology sector. With bonds paying literally nothing for all that time, the dividend was actually fairly lucrative from a risk/reward standpoint.\n\nNow, with TSMC moving in and rates jacked up, they actually need to make a case for themselves. I think they have the right management in place and are making the right moves, but it remains to be seen if they can actually make good on their goals. So far it looks promising.\n\nThey've shown they're willing to move away from the \"hoard x86 expertise and milk it for everything\" strategy. If they can even get their foot in the door of the server GPU conversation in the next 5 years, they'll more than double their market cap.\n\nFor reference, I have a 21JUN short put that'll give me a cost basis in the low 29.

And I clearly remember saying 10 years ago on similar forums \"look guys, Intel's 10 nm node is a disaster, they are going to be outcompeted for many years to come, there's lots of problems, Apple's already planning to move away from Intel entirely\", regards where \"hahah look CSGO benchmark Intel the best, look server market share, Intel the best, ARM only good for mobile\".\n\nI most certainly cannot say that Intel's gonna 10x in the next years, nor that it's not gonna go bankrupt or become irrelevant. I just don't pretend to have the crystal ball like some do.\n\nBut I'm absolutely appalled by how markets and people take it as a doomed company because I'm quite informed and I just don't see this writing at the wall.\n\nIn fact, my personal thesis, is that Intel's gonna be a great turnaround company and has still a lot to say in this business, but you fuckin americans see everything in terms of black and white, winners and losers, it's like you have no nuance and sensibility at all when it comes to the intricacies of such complex businesses where one single product or technological breakthrough can reshape the industry for many years to come.\n\nPeople are treating Intel now, the same way they treated AMD 10 years ago \"hahah Bulldozer bad, hahah Hawaii GPU bad, no foundries\", they 4x their revenue, executed greatly on many fronts, are finally making profits after decades of losing money, etc.\n\nAnd if you think Intel can't pull similar turnarounds because \"hahah Nvidia best GPUs for AI now, so it's gonna be the best company forever\", you're just goddamn fools.\n\nSeriously, tech is a cyclic sector where there's just no winners forever. And Intel, while not in the dominant position it was a decade ago, is still hell of a company with many aces up their sleeve.",
