People with no assets get poorer cuz of inflation\n2. Rich are getting richer because of that inflation, making their assets more expensive \n\nThat system would be ok if we had a crisis, where 5-10% of the richest would lose ALL of the assets so that wealth is getting redistributed in a form of DEFLATION.\n\nBUT, fed since 2000 is making sure not a single millionaire lose a penny, saying \"we don't want unemployment to rise\". Yes, you don't want unemployment to rise, so the US gov and richest will not lose a penny. Average American live paycheck to paycheck, he don't care if unemployment will rise to 6%. If he loses a job, he will find another or will be having jobless benefits.\n\nAnd guys in that system are complaining that some random Redditors got gains in the stock market...",
