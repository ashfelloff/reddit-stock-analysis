If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.\n\nThe bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)\n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Compare the recent chart to the rest of the cannabis sector. Note the trend and the volume, both of which are currently going *against* the sector trend.

                  "body": "HITI is solid but so are any of the Canadian weed stocks. Weed companies here make money but can't put it in a bank or they risk federal seizure of assets because it's still Schedule I. Canadian companies can bank, buy property and function like a regular company without fear. As a result the Canadian market is saturated and some (Aurora or Tilray iirc) are even downsizing and selling off some of their industrial grow warehouses to get cash flow positive.\n\nWe don't know exactly how the recent news that the DEA is rescheduling from I to III is going to shake out. A Schedule III drug is a federally protected prescribable medicine which means medical patients will presumably now have their insurance covering their weed. It would presumably also be allowed to be imported from foreign production facilities like any other medicine. If that is the way things go these Canadian companies are some of the only Marijuana producers growing to pharmaceutical standards because of their compliance with Canada's national MMJ program, already have national scale production infrastructure and are primed to start raking in that insurance company money.\n\nSome of the Canadian producers are making inroads into the US market by purchasing adjacent businesses to establish production and distribution infrastructure here. OP's favorite High Tide, as he mentioned, has bought up all the biggest US marijuana lifestyle and accessories retail websites. If memory serves Sundial now owns Blue Moon and Shock Top beers. Hops is a cousin plant to Cannabis so I'm thinking their play is to retrofit any Hops growing facilities they own in the US to Marijuana grows and start buying their hops if legalization carries a requirement that US product must be US produced which is a possibility.\n\nAs soon as the Schedule III guidelines are set in stone things are going to start moving very quickly in this space and there's a lot of potential for growth.",
