It's not like life changing kind of money usually.  It's like 10's or maybe 100k which means the profits are likely less than a car.  \n\nCorruption is corruption, but people act like our politicians are raping the markets of all their worth when at best it looks like maybe they might be making some side hustle money.\n\nWe are talking about a world that has billionaires in it afterall.",
