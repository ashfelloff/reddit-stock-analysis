  "selftext": "I like Monster Energy. I drink it more than I care to admit. And I like investing in things I like and use, so I want to buy $MNST, but I really can't see the business case for buying it. It's already up 50% over the past 5 years. Feels overvalued for their business model at $50b market cap and 31x PE ratio. So I struggle to see a capital gain case. And it doesn't pay any dividend either.\n\nIt is down 10% TTM and 15% YTD, so I guess you could say this is a buy the fkn dip moment, assuming you believe it isn't already overvalued, even at this prices.\n\nDoes anyone think there is a legit case for $MNST so I can buy this stock and convince myself I'm investing in my future every time I drink one?\n",

I know P/E and \\~technicals\\~ is a joke but Celsius's is twice that of Monster + a market cap of a half, yet Monster sells vastly more volume with a ton of subsidiaries (granted, some of them are dying like NOS) under its wing. \n\nBasically *if* the growth that is priced in materializes, then it's about fair for where it is right now (but will probably still go up a bit). If the growth fails to materialize (which could happen), then it's definitely overvalued right now. I think there are gains to be had if you wanted to own shares (albeit, likely wont see the big bull run it had, that boat is gone); however, for options I think it's a bit too future-priced at the moment to make any real guesses.",
