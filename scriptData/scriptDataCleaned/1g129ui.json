It may sound weird, because you would think it would cost more to produce a vehicle without a steering wheel, however almost every factory out there is built to make vehicles with steering wheels.  It's just easier and cheaper to use existing infrastructure than it is to reinvent the wheel.\n\n\n3.  Likely makes it easier for service/maintenance to have the option for manual driving.  If the system is down, you don't have to get a tow truck out.",
