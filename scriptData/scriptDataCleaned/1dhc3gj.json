So their total debt principal doesn't change, but the old interest rate is replaced with the new interest rate available at the time. \n\nFor the question as to why they don't refinance all the debt at low interest rate levels; Government debt is in the form of bonds that gets traded similarly to stocks. If rates go down, price of an existing bond increases in the markets to reflect that. and because the government will need to buy back the old debt from the market, they will have to pay the difference between old rate and new rate when refinancing.
