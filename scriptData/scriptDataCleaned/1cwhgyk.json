Got some high from winning from DJT, then dumped them all to PAA, at some point I was up $8k and took ZERO profits; options value keeps going down so I rode on ALCC/OKLO but yall knew what happened. Do not keep chasing your wins and take some profits my fellow apes I learned my lesson. \n\n(I was trying to gamble and help pay my lil bro‚Äôs tuition but got buttfucked instead)",
