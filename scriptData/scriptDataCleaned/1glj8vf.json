  "score": 1068,
  "selftext": "“Shares of Tesla soared Wednesday as investors bet that the electric vehicle maker and its CEO Elon Musk will benefit from Donald Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nTesla stands to make significant gains under a Trump administration with the threat of diminished subsidies for alternative energy and electric vehicles doing the most harm to smaller competitors. Trump’s plans for extensive tariffs on Chinese imports make it less likely that Chinese EVs will be sold in bulk in the U.S. anytime soon.”\n\nSource: https://apnews.com/article/tesla-stock-trump-election-b54454aaabd4cbe1e1e1c9754649b869",

I am not doubting that you don't feel that way, people are different, but this is not the normal.\n\nFor example, if you're a Cali based lefty who wants an electric vehicle, you're going to be looked down on by your friends for your expensive Tesla, when the CEO just helped a climate change denier get elected who wants to restart coal plants. If car status and value projection didn't exist then we would all be riding around in the cheapest junk we could find.",

Ditto China.\n\nWhats Tesla worth as a US only car company that gets all its raw materials from the US - meanwhile the cost of necessities all goes up due to tariffs? Let me know how much the worlds largest Taxi company is worth?\n\nSame moronic ideas that thought pot legalisation would result in massive farming profits - when in reality anything that allowed broadacre farming of mary jane would cause a 90% price collapse once the brazilians started pumping it out. Check what the last round of Trump farmer subsidies did to US soybean production! He saved the farmer! And yet...... Brazilian production (what China bought) has gone from 100 to 170mmt in the 8 years since (China buys \\~70% of the worlds soybeans and they still only buy \\~\\~100mmt  - not different to a decade ago.\n\nThe time to short Telsa is coming very soon. Same thing goes for John Deere and co. - all the idiots buying these \"made American\" companies not thinking about reciprocity. They rely upon huge spending in Asia & EU to generate cashflows that are then relatively untaxed due to use of transfer pricing that has a large chance of becoming hard to do under either Trump or via EU crackdowns on Bed & Breakfasting & other techniques to ensure IP costs are high in high cost countries.\n\nTrump is a slave to the market - this time he makes these changes with valuations 2x what they were in 2018 with rates much higher. Lets see how well they're received now money isn't free. Also PE is half the equation - the E side is more important - once E starts declining - even for a tiny bit - the PE contraction starts as people only think about growth in short term trends.\n\nAll the good stuff is priced in.",
