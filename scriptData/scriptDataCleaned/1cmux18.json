ERs have been all over the place and I think the beat/miss ratio is right around 50% as well.  So flat is pretty reasonable now for the index as we approach the ATH again.\n\nAlso, SPY in 24 hour market has no market maker necessarily to peg it to the index, that’s only really from 8a-6p. Outside of that people are more trading on speculation. So you get weird pricing until they start pegging the bid/ask spreads.  When SPY has a bid/ask spread over 0.02 there’s not a MM active (and even 0.02 is high - should really only be 0.01 unless it’s highly volatile).\n\n5/22 with the NVDA ER should open up things up again as that will also be the tail end of earnings as well.  Things may get wild depending on the NVDA report and what the bond markets do as we’re right under the danger zone on 10 and 30 year bonds.",
