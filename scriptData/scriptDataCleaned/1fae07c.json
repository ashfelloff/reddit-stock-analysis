I'm being solicited for business by fleet guys for big discounts when just a year ago they were still gouging me on prices. Concerts and music festivals for mid tier musicians are being canceled due to the lack of sales. But, my August 2024 revenue was within .5% of my August 2023 revenue, even though I had about 18% less volume. I don't see how my September revenue comes close to last September based on my booked business, which is quite concerning. Some of my bigger corporate clients are nowhere in sight. This isn't normal.",

      "body": "What to close the U.S. Treasury cash gap with?\n\nThe essence of the problem is very simple: \n\n- A background deficit of at least 2 trillion with the potential for unmanageable expansion. Current fiscal policy is not soft in the context of supporting the population, so any attempt to support consumer demand with a sensitive macro effect will inevitably unwind the deficit to at least 3.5 trillion.\n\n- In US government bonds excluding bills, the marginal funding capacity is estimated at 1.2-1.3 trillion, plus up to another 0.4 trillion in bills, given less than 0.3 trillion in reverse repos with the Fed, and all other available liquidity is already parked in bonds. This creates a hole of at least 0.6 trillion.\n\n- Current household savings in the US is only 0.6 trillion a year, acting as a major buyer of treasuries. The profits of the financial system are not enough to finance the budget deficit, and non-residents can overlap up to 0.5 trillion per year and that is close to the limit. \n\n- Private sector net savings are going into negative territory - there is no free money in the system, and the excess liquidity generated in 2020-2021 has already been distributed. \n\n- The US government’s cache balance is estimated at 771 billion as of September 5 - less than 4 months of deficit financing with zero net placements (red limit of operating cache around 200-250 billion).\n\n- Successful deficit financing since June 2023 (the start of active placements) is due to the use of about 2 trillion of excess liquidity in the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP), parked in bills - this resource is no longer available.\n\n- In August, there were unplanned placements in promissory notes for 200 bln with virtually unchanged RRP balance (there was no demand for medium and long-term securities) and no direct interest of non-residents - this means the use of the «last bastion», apparently, it is partly Buffett’s money after the sale of shares, but this resource is not dimensionless either (probably, it too was chosen to the brim).\n\nIn the current configuration, the system is relatively comfortably able to digest a budget deficit of 1-1.2 trillion per year, but not twice as much, with the potential for expansion to 3-4 trillion on the trajectory of entering recession.\n\nNow (after the excess liquidity is exhausted), anything above 1.2 trillion goes to the detriment of the private capital market (IPOs and corporate bond offerings), creating pockets of overstretch in the system. \n\nAlthough trejeris are a form of quasi-money, acting as the highest liquidity ratio in repo pyramids, this only partially covers the marginal demand for private sector financial instruments, but does not automatically create a perpetual motion machine.\n\nThere are two solutions:\n\n- Creating a critical overstretch in the private capital market by sucking liquidity out of stocks and bonds in favor of trijeris in a no-alternative environment of fear and risk aversion. This is only a temporary measure that may win a year, maybe two, but the further it goes, the more painful it gets.\n\n- Launching QE is something they know how to do, expect and know well. This scenario will create a drug-induced and blacked out mind effect, re-inducing imbalances throughout the system, creating a new wave of inflationary pressures, and undermining the credibility and importance of the Fed. This scenario is short-term effective, but long-term destructive. \n\nOf course, they will choose QE, but before that they will gut everyone to the ground, because in the conditions of the Fed’s failed inflation targeting, an attempt to take this path again is an admission of the system’s bankruptcy, i.e. the inability to conduct a secured policy from its own resources.",

          "body": "Jobs (Current Employment Survey: CES) and labor force (Current Population Survey: CPS or Local Area Unemployment Statistics: LAUS) are two different measures of the labor market that are no directly comparable. The way that I think about is that they are two different lenses and perspectives that we can use to measure economic activity. Sometimes they move in tandem and sometimes they diverge.\n\nThe Nevada Labor Market Information Office has this handy little chart describing the differences. Just keep in mind that LAUS is based on CPS but geared towards smaller geographic areas: [https://www.nevadaworkforce.com/\\_docs/LAUS/CES-vs.-LAUS-Quick-Reference-Table.pdf](https://www.nevadaworkforce.com/_docs/LAUS/CES-vs.-LAUS-Quick-Reference-Table.pdf)\n\nEconomic activity is difficult to measure because it is the aggregation of countless decisions made by millions or billions of individuals each day. For example, we are both here behind the Wendy's dumpster, are you going to pay me three dollars for a handjob or are you just wasting my time? If you pay me the three dollars, then GDP has increased by three dollars by the new service that I have provided. Since I have engaged in work for pay or profit, I would be considered employed under the LAUS or CPS; however, a self-employed crankmaster like myself would be excluded from the jobs count because the self-employed are excluded from CES.",

      "body": "A steady trend of labor market degradation in the United States\n\nThere is little doubt where this is all headed. A year ago at this time of year, the three-month average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now it’s only 116k (142k in August), and the long-term norm is about 190k per month.\n\nAt the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30% or minus 86k (from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed).\n\nIt’s still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3-month average is 0.07% per month, the YTD average is 0.11%, and the 12-month average is 0.12%, while the medium-term rate before COVID (2017-2019) was 0.13% per month and the 10-year long-term rate is 0.16%.\n\nThe visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the long-term trend in job creation. It’s not a crisis (requires at least three months of job contraction) or a recession (a rate of about 0.03% per month averaged over 3-6 months), but the first clear signal.\n\nIt should be taken into account that BLS manipulates data and recently «lost» over 800 thousand employed, yesterday they revised the data for the worse by 30% and it is not excluded that soon we will find out that all this is a complete fake and the economy is in recession since spring 2024.\n\nIt’s important to note the structural degradation: \n\n- Native American workers have lost about 1.5 million jobs since the beginning of 2020, replaced by over 3 million migrants (mostly from Mexico).\n\n- More than 2 million part-time (low-wage) jobs have gained over the past year with nearly 1.5 million full-time jobs lost. \n\nWhere is the job growth concentrated? Over the past year, 85% of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment - mostly low-paying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services (the highest paying) have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008.\n\nAll signs point to a dip into recession soon.",
