  "selftext": "Intuitive machines is literally going to the moon, and if you don‚Äôt think this stock has the same potential as SpaceX then you‚Äôre wrong! \n\nMillions in contracts already with NASA, lots of growth and future potential. Great team and leadership. Competing with multiple other large scale defense contractors and supplies countless valuable technologies for space missions and exploration. Just won a contract to oversee other clear defense contractors while building a lunar rover for NASA. Probably a lot more contract announcements to come. \n\nI may be regarded, but analysts are wayyy below the PT with most estimating $10-$15. This thing is going to hit $40 or higher in the next few months just before they launch another moon mission in Q4 of the calendar year. Their last launch was basically successful, so the next one definitely will be.\n\nThe CEO of LUNR will be speaking on CNBC later today where they may announce some big news. Trust me, this stock is the biggest win for commercial space exploration anyone has ever seen since SpaceX, and backed by a couple billionaires that actually have a brain. If you don‚Äôt believe me, check out their website. \n\nI‚Äôve YOLO‚Äôd about $6k in ridiculous strikes over the next few months because we‚Äôre going to the moon! Let‚Äôs do this!!! ",

It started right after the landing. What I noticed is that once all the hype was gone, the pros moved in. There is a bot that buys several hundred thousand shares every morning and exits every session close day trading the shit out of it. This is why you see a price spike right at open and a price dip first minute into AH trading. They ¬†let it float up and gradually push the price down daily. It‚Äôs an extremely low float stock and can easily be manipulated, which is what this bot is doing.¬† Best of luck my dude. It sucks that someone‚Äôs in there messing with the price action.
