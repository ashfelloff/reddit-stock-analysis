  "selftext": "Various estimates I’ve found suggest that the construction labor force is between 15% and 25% undocumented immigrants.  Given that the incoming administration has threatened mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, do you think that large home builders such as DR Horton and Lennar Corporation will have increased trouble meeting their production targets? Even the threat of this policy could drive workers voluntarily out of the country OR out of the workforce.  Thoughts?  \n\n",

Remains to be seen if this will be long term beneficial either.\n\nOn the flip side, re: worker comp, abuse of legal migration has undermined a good chunk of the US work force. Laying off time served local expertise in favor of cheaper H1B replacements beholden to their employment (cheaper and easier to mistreat). This also places quality of labor, as seen in the trucking industry and the last Trump term cut almost all Trucker tax deductions to zero, leading to driver shortages being made up of cheap, under qualified migrants.\n\nIt’s going to be a fun few years. Ignoring the political rhetoric, the policies proposed appear to be a ‘cut off your nose to spite your face’ scenario.\n\nIt’s broadly known that migrant work forces are crucial to the US economy, there just needs to be balance; not unthought overreaction.\n\nNo one has a plan to address the actual issues.",
