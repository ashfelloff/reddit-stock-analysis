Youtube plays/autoplays with the screen locked. I guess just google how to fix your glitch. I personally use the firefox browser maybe thats your issue if you are using the app. Gotta have adblock so app was always a no go for me. \n\nHow does paid youtube offline work? Surely you have to download the music in the app for it to do that. Just actually download it like i said in the previous post. Have your library downloaded and if there's a new song suggested by a friend just listen to it on yt then download it later. You already have to do this for every song not on spotify anyway. Offline listening isnt a benefit because you need to be online to discover new songs.\n\nAlso you can use spotify free or free apple music or whatever in the car, you dont get ads on your own music playlists. \n\n130 dollars a year to make it slightly easier to download half my playlist aint it. I'm already downloading songs on the high sea and even sometimes ethically, they just arent on any streaming/buying site, might as well add the ones on spotify as well.",

As of right now, the amount of trash music that get's uploaded is getting more and more unbearable. It's clear that artists flood the platform with quantity rather than quality. From what i heard and seen, people rather give up on making music than to rely on spotify payouts, which is hurtful to the whole industry in the long run. Also the algorhitm is fkd and the amount of times i get recommaned a song that i actually like and didn't know before nears 0. \n\nAll in all, while i think the increases in price + the deteriorating quality of new music will drive users to other services in the long run. Also i think they should decouple podcasts as an extra service or branch, same with audiobooks, cause i kinda don't wanna pay for the availabilty of podcasts that i never listen to at all. They obviously will never do this, but i certain that i'm not the only user that thinks this way.",
