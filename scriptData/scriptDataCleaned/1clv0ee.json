              "body": "There's theta decay (measured time), delta (increase or decrease in the option as the price moves up or down), and IV.  There's another Greek but we'll leave that out for now.  Because the IV on a lot of the options neared 200% (think of IV as \"demand\") & because the stock is essentially currently flat from Friday's close to the present, the value of all options will decrease significantly because IV will decrease significantly.  That could change, however, if the stock moves another +/- 4% before the end of the week.  Thus, for now, the winners of the day are the people who sold options rather than the people who bought options.  Even people who bought $25 puts are going to find themselves not really making much of a profit, if anything, since a $25 strike put that costs $180 breaks even at $23.20, so they might just about get their money back or make a 10-20% profit (which is still fine, but you're looking to get more than a 10-20% profit from a -8% downswing on an option that expires in 4 days.  Again, these are at current #s.  If PLTR goes down to like $22 or up to $26, or bounces up and down, all of a sudden there's gonna be bigger winners and losers.\n\nIf you want another, easier example, MSFT earnings from 2 weeks ago was classic IV crush.  The stock did well after earnings, but because $400 strike calls were going for \\~$1000 each at the low end (due to high IV), it meant the breakeven point was $410, and therefore most people who bought $400 strike calls ended up losing most of their money since the stock ended Friday (one day after earnings) at $406 and there was minimal opportunity that day for call-buyers to even break even.",
