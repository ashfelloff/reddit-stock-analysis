This sparked a race in the AI space between the Mag7. \n\nThe way I see it, we are in the infrastructure accumulation stage. If the investment does not result in meaningful profitable earnings, there would be a pullback on AI chips spending.

              "body": "FYI with fractional shares, your ownership of the equity is more complicated than simple flat shares. Transferring the shares between brokerages is much more complicated - because your percentage ownership is actually of an instrument pooling all collective interest (on your brokerage), and not of the underlying itself. The instrument still “tracks” the underlying, but when you decide to move platforms (eg from Robinhood to Fidelity) it’s a more complex process that isn’t as straightforward for them to do and has potential risk that isn’t there (afaik) when simply moving shares from A to B. You’re moving money between two separate brokerage run instruments that track the underlying, not the underlying itself.\n\nYou may experience slippage - when these transfers occur they are between two different instruments on the respective brokerages that, despite tracking the same underlying, may have slight differences in price (due to timing, liquidity, etc). \n\nIf a big move happens during the transfer process, you could potentially lose money. They are executing buy/sell orders of their own respective instruments tracking it, and not transferring actual NVDA share ownership itself.\n\nIf you own the actual shares, they are in your name and ownership. They are simply reassigned from one brokerage as a controller to another, so to speak",
