I did the math and they’re expected to do about $600,000 per location in revenue which comes out to about 12 orders per hour. And when I talk to some employees at local restaurants they have explained that they have seen a great increase in sales this year.",

I feel this is a new phenomenon. I can not remember this being a common occurrence. I have seen this unpredictable and unexplainable occurrence 5 times this week alone.  DUOL  duolingo has largest earnings ever and drops more than any recorded day in 5 years. They literally had 10x the earnings per share  from last q3 or q2 2023 and the stock tanks 20% in a day.",
