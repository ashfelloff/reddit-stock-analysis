Learn signals like head and shoulders, double tops, trends like higher highs (bullish) & lower lows (bearish) to determine the stock direction. Learn about levels of support. Never buy calls or puts too far out of the money or in the money - stay closer to the strike price. Use straddles (buying both puts and calls) - sell as soon as you are green and don‚Äôt look back. Always leave 50% of your account cash to average down if things get bad. Never ever ever ever use all of your account on one trade. NEVER buy options expiring less than 30-40 days. Don‚Äôt hold options over the weekend ever. NEVER use margin. Do not let gains ride more than a few hours.. sell as soon as you‚Äôre green & be happy with it even if it‚Äôs 1-10%. Typically Mondays are red, Fridays are green. Start each week fresh with new plays (but familiar plays). Good luck",
