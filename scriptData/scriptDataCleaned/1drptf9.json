  "selftext": "Hey fellow regards, \n\nI normally don’t interact with this sub but I wanted to get some opinions because I’m a horrible investor and a full stop moron. BUT! I had a notion hit me the other day after watching the congressional hearing with the Boeing CEO. It is very clear that the reputational damage that has been done to Boeing will take a long time to repair. So what about the competition such as Air Bus? From my limited knowledge of the aviation world they are the primary competitor, would they not likely receive a progressive uptick in their sales for the foreseeable future? I would think so but the problem is there stock has taken a substantial dip recently so my theory might not be all that smart. Anyone have any thoughts on this? Since Ive already lost $2k from this sub I figured let’s keep that ball rolling.\n\n",
