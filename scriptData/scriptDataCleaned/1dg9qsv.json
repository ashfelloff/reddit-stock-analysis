  "selftext": "[$SNOW](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SNOW/) **is nearing a major support level at \\~$120-125, a level it has respected for the past 2-3 years.**\n\n**New Leadership: Sridhar Ramaswamy**\n\nSnowflake‚Äôs new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, brings a highly technical background and a strong focus on AI:\n\n* **Education:** PhD in Computer Science from Brown University\n* **Career Highlights:** Played a crucial role in growing Google‚Äôs advertising business from $1.5 billion to over $100 billion in annual revenue during his 15-year tenure\n* **Entrepreneurial Venture:** Co-founded Neeva, an AI-powered, ad-free search engine\n* **Snowflake Integration:** Neeva was acquired by Snowflake in 2023, leading to Ramaswamy‚Äôs appointment as the Senior Vice President of AI\n* Additional background [HERE](https://www.perplexity.ai/page/Can-you-provide-hlYYMtLOS6.hVNE_ZQsv_w)\n\nAlthough Frank Slootman‚Äôs shoes will be tough to fill, Ramaswamy‚Äôs technical expertise in AI makes him a promising fit for the role.\n\n**Strategic Timing for AI Expansion**\n\nIn recent quarters, Snowflake has faced criticism for lagging in AI capabilities and losing market share. However, its healthy financial position and reports of a record number of AI startups going on sale ([LINK](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-13/more-ai-founders-looking-to-sell-startups-hugging-face-ceo-says?embedded-checkout=true)) present a unique opportunity. **This could be a prime time for Snowflake to jumpstart its AI ambitions at a discount, leveraging Ramaswamy‚Äôs expertise.**  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qi0par5xrn6d1.png?width=986&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f66a045c498197e0b95cfa66269f7d724c34e85\n\n",
