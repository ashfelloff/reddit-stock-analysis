  "selftext": "I’m talking long term and even having this in your IRA/Roth, replacing your typical SPY and QQQ. Not day trading or swing trading. Typically, the market goes up, so this would be on your side, plus the longer-term time horizon. Obviously, there is the risk of market crashes like COVID, Financial crisis and 2022 etc. I know its more expensive to hold as well, but that would hopefully offset if you’re in the green.\n\n \n\nI’m contemplating swapping out my QQQ/SPY holdings for the leveraged, but wanted to get some feedback on people’s thoughts.",

      "body": "Leveraged ETFs are a path-dependent process.\n\nMost (all?) leveraged ETFs offer a daily multiplier on the underlying holdings. The key word here is daily. At the end of any given day, you can expect TQQQ to have returned 3x QQQ.\n\nAfter each day, the ETF resets the exposure for the upcoming day (daily rebalancing). In other words, the leveraged ETF is guaranteed to track the underlying ETF for a single day, but over multiple days you’ll start to see drift happening. This causes what is known as volatility decay, and this can really hurt your holdings when you have a volatile ETF in a sideways market. \n\nHere’s an example:\n\n1. Day 1:\n   - Index starts at 100 and rises 10% to 110.\n   - A 3x leveraged ETF would rise 30%, going from 100 to 130.\n\n2. Day 2:\n   - Index falls 10% from 110 to 99.\n   - A 3x leveraged ETF would fall 30%, dropping from 130 to 91.\n\nAs you can see, you’ve lost a significant amount just through the volatility of the index. Now, roughly speaking, a 2X Nasdaq 100 structured as above has historically outperformed the 1X, but 3X has underperformed the 1X. But it’s all about timing and avoiding negative/sideways markets with your exposure.",

          "body": "This doesn’t entirely demonstrate the perils of volatility decay though. You might be led to believe that as long as the underlying ends up above the original price of 100 (instead of 99) you’ll profit, but in reality going even up to 110 and back to 100 is a loss when leveraged:\n\nDay 1:\nUnderlying = 100 * 1.1 = 110\nLeveraged = 100 * (1 + 3 * 0.1) = 130\n\nDay 2:\nUnderlying = 110 / 1.1 = 110 * 0.90909… = 100 (ie a 9.0909…% loss)\nLeveraged = 130 / (1 + 3 * 0.090909…) = 94.545…\n\nor so I believe the math goes, and you end up with less than you started with. So every single time the market goes up and down you lose money. If it just goes up a bit each day there would be no problem. \n\nThe benefit is that if you rebalance daily, you would need a -33% crash in a day to lose everything. You could avoid the decay by leveraging continuously for say, a whole year, but if the price goes to -33% at any point during that year you get margin called and lose everything or add more liquidity and potentially lose more than you put in.",

But you can backtest how such an ETF would have performed using historical returns.\n\nTiming matters a lot more with leveraged ETFs. Had you bought a triple leveraged ETF on S&P500 in january of 2007, you would be more than 90% down at the bottom in 2009. It would then take roughly a decade to catch up with a regular ETF. Today, 17 years after buying, you would have outperformed the S&P500 by about 35%. And that is after one of the strongest bull markets in history.\n\nAs long as the market goes up, leveraged ETFs should do better. But if you buy at an unfortunate time, you may have to wait a decade or two to get back even. And you have to stomach a lot of volatility in the meantime with a lot less than 3x returns compared to the S&P.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/FRP89gb",

Today it’s back to setting all-time highs.\n- The triple-levered version lost more than 3/4 of its value and still isn’t back to where it was at the beginning of ‘22.\n\nThese levered funds are great during strong bull markets (if you can stomach the volatility) but they gradually bleed during sideways periods and they get crushed in downturns. Someone [backtested TQQQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ETFs/comments/tkqhuy/tqqq_backtest/) to the dot-com era and found that a $100 investment would grow to $800 and then drop to less than $1.\n\nAssuming the fund didn’t get liquidated after that loss, someone holding through that whole thing wouldn’t get back to their original $100 until 2019. Of course the flip side is that if they’d been regularly contributing as opposed to a lump sum, they’d have made bank over the last 15 years. We’ve had a great run lately. \n\nIf you go to r/LETFs where people like and use these funds, they’ll talk a lot about hedging strategies.\n\n* Some use signals like the moving average of the (unlevered) index to rotate in and out of leverage, only levering up when we appear to be in an uptrend and experiencing low volatility.\n* Others keep some money in the leveraged fund and others in a less-correlated asset like Treasury bills, rebalancing periodically. That allows them to take profits after good times and replenish after bad times.\n\nWhatever it is there’s a strategy for managing the risk and recovering from downturns. That becomes especially important as the investor gets older, because they have less time and future income with which to correct course. ",

Each of these people started investing in July 1, 2006 and added $500 per month through June 2011 (five years). The only difference is their starting balance:   \n\n* [$1,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=5r0JByGNoY0sDsl4NN4B7w) takes a big hit, $14K to $4K, but their deposits allow them to ride the rebound and they handily beat the S&P.\n* [$10,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=4QAzkJvButyymk7Emvnv6) also beats the S&P over the five years, but spends more time lagging because it takes longer to build back up after losing 80%.\n* [$100,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=jAYSl1ulwXAbczB0JRTmP) lost enough in the downturn that they still lag the S&P after five years.\n* [$1,000,000](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&sl=1BQyR422THnplqARygbfVH) just barely has a positive return, less than 1% annualized.

The market since 2009 has been unusually smooth sailing, so these people all would have done quite well since then. I’d say the takeaway here is that even at this modest-by-today’s-standards degree of leverage you gotta think about how badly it would hurt your future if you lost 80% of what you currently have.",

I personally don't think you can draw any conclusion from its chart, and if you look at its action between 2018 to now its very clearly interest rate related.  It fell in late 2018 due to taper tantrem, it rose in 2021 due to stimulus and free money and fell in 2022 due to inflation and interest fears.  Its rising since 2024 due to hopes of rate cuts.  \n\nYou could say as the general economy falters, it very well could draw back, but thats not for certain at all. \n\nand your play of betting big bigger is just a martindale plan.....if your gonna yolo like that Options are far better pay out.   \nJust do your self a favor and realize that if your plan is to hold a inverse ETF for  years, that's insanity, plain and simple.
