I‚Äôm not saying scalping them in this situation is a bad idea I‚Äôm just saying keep your guard up because a lot of people me included have bet money the fact that they will get there first whenever it happens to come. Just keep that in mind when trying to get a quick scalp in. Kinda like betting against the mouse. Bad idea.",
