  "selftext": "EDIT:  I WAS RIGHT YOU REGARDS!!! LETS FUCKIN GO\n\n\n\n\nOk here’s the deal.  We all remember the hype when Canada legalized.  Everyone thought it was the ultimate infinite money glitch.\n\nAnd for a while, based on the hype, it was.  Canada was the first major first world country to outright legalize (sorry Netherlands your half measures are no good for stonks), and the outlook was looking good for US legalization.  We had a boomer Republican president in the US at the time, but one who was decidedly less hostile to Marijuana than the typical boomer Republican.  Speaking of boomers…their parents who grew up watching reefer madness and blamed all crime on Mexican reefer addicts and always voted 98% no to any loosening of marijuana laws were finally starting to fucking die.  No one under 40 still thought it should be illegal and the national pulse had finally turned in favor of legalizing nationwide in the US.  Everyone saw it coming imminently.\n\nBut Canada is a nation of 38 million.  Barely a single major city in the US.  Not nearly enough to justify the size and scope of the weed market that emerged.  The stonks soared.  I remember ACB at 200 times it’s current price.\n\nBut it slowly dawned that no, in fact, America wasn’t going to reschedule, let alone legalize.  There wasn’t going to be a big enough market to support all the infrastructure the Canadian firms invested in.  The stocks cratered and a lot of degenerates lost a lot of money.\n\nThen Biden, a democrat, gets elected….the democrats being the party who overwhelmingly support legalization, it stood to reason that a liberalization of American marijuana law was imminent and again the stocks popped, though nowhere near the 2019 highs.  This is where I jumped in (MJ ETF, ACB and OGI)…and again, it slowly dawned that US legalization was going nowhere…and again the stocks slowly waned, punctuated occasionally by big pops on irrelevant news like another state legalizing…each time I thought this was it, this time it turns around for good.\n\nI lost like 75% before giving up and selling my shares, and good thing I did, because I’d have lost another 75% had I sat on it.\n\nNow Germany just legalized and again the stocks are popping and a lot of us can’t see past these old painful memories.  I get it.\n\nJust hear me out.\n\nNow keep in mind right off the bat Germany is a much bigger nation and economy than Canada (>2X the population and 2x the GDP, roughly).  It alone can support a much larger market than Canada.  So the pop in weed stocks we’ve seen now is already justified and yet they still have tremendous upside.\n\nBut my fellow regards, this is just the warmup round.\n\nJoe Brandon is in trouble.  He’s behind in the polls, he’s seen as old, stuffy and senile.  His oldness, stuffiness and senility are perfectly encapsulated by his antiquated commitment to continuing marijuana prohibition.  It’s worth noting that he is the leader of a party that abandoned its commitment to marijuana prohibition decades ago and while he’s stubbornly been clinging to it more and more of the old fuddie duddie hardliners have died and almost no one in the country still supports continuing prohibition.  Certainly almost no democrats.  Also, RFK is running as an independent and he has confirmed he will make marijuana legalization a priority.  While RFK will be pulling support from trump too (think Covid hoaxery) I am convinced he’ll be pulling harder from Brandon.\n\nBrandon needs something big to revitalize his campaign, and he’s been dropping hints that marijuana very well could be that thing.  April is “second chance month” and this year he went further than before in his commentary on the topic, suggesting rescheduling and/or hinting at legalization.  Kamala Harris has been pressuring the DEA to take action now.  Things are happening that are unlike anything from 2019 or 2021.  Traditionally 4/20 is associated with marijuana and the bettor in me senses something big may be coming this month, possibly on or around that day.\n\nYes, marijuana stocks are up somewhat on German legalization, but still down well over 90 to 95% or more from the 2019 highs.\n\nI’m not saying YOLO on weed calls.  But picking up some shares right now is a relatively low risk (the stocks are already so so so far downbeaten with residual pessimism) move with tremendous potential upside.\n\nTLDR; buy weed stonks before 4/20\n\nPosition (edited to reflect additions since OP): 5,000 Tilray in at 2.41.  2,000 SNDL at 2.40.  500 ACB at 6.90.  800 CURLF at 5.45.  500 CGC at 9.55.  No options (NB4 ‘if you really believes in your DD you’d YOLO your life savings into calls’, I’m 40 years old and have 4 kids, I can’t afford the risk.  I don’t fuck with options, ever).\n\nI’ve read some DDs on here that convince me Tilray is the strongest play.  Pick whatever suits you.\n\nThis is not financial advice.  I’m a regard\n\n********\n\nSome more edits.\n\n1) German legalization not being true commercial legalization.\n\nTrue and a valid point.  The play here is not on German legalization.  The play is on an anticipation of a forthcoming change in US law.  Apart from being the worlds largest economy, the US has been the stick bearer enforcing marijuana prohibition around the world.  Many nations have wanted to legalize in the past but have been held back by the UN convention on psychtropic drugs from the 70s…the U.S. has been the standard bearer of enforcement of that convention.  Once the US legalizes, I think that this UN convention loses relevancy and the dominoes will start falling in short order and many more nations will legalize.  The smart money knows this and the bulk of the movement in the stock will all happen once the US announces meaningful change.  The play is to get ahead of that announcement.\n\n2) edited GDP ratio of Germany to Canada because yes that data point was off\n\n3) if y’all can’t handle some embellishment I can’t help you.  The NYC metro area is 23M people.  Canada has 38M.  I think it’s fair to say 38M, as the population of one of the world’s top economies, “barely” exceeds that of a single city’s metropolitan area.  Yes you regards, the specific data point  is embellished to emphasize the fact that the US has 10 times the population and 12 times the GDP of its northern neighbor.  It’s a much much bigger deal.  When you consider the likelihood of copycat legalizations in the wake of US moves, now is the time!",

So what you get is what you get. \n\n\nI really think it's something that's overlooked but beer isn't going anywhere so those revenues will help balance this company out while we wait for us government to actually act on reschedule or deschedule. \n\n\nThey anticipate that the US market is going to grow to 40 billion (or something like that) by the end of the decade. if tilray can capture 5%-10%, I think that is a monster win because of their geographic diversification. You'll be capturing 2 billion a year in revenue just from Marijuana. Then you can toss in the booze revenue. They can be a 4 billion revenue in the US easily in a few years. \n\n\nI think this can be the best performer in the industry. Time will tell. ",
