Personal consumption in the first quarter grew at 2%, down from a prior reading of 2.5%.\n\nThe reading came in significantly lower than fourth quarter GDP, which was revised up to 3.4%.\n\nThe slowdown in GDP comes at a time when markets have been sensitive to any readings indicating that the economy may be running too hot for the Federal Reserve's liking, as inflation has proved stickier than expected. The concern is red-hot growth would boost price increases.\n\nMany forecasters don't see the first-quarter economic growth slowdown as the start of a broader trend. Prior to Thursday's reading, Goldman Sachs expected 3.2% annualized growth in the second quarter. Meanwhile, the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow forecaster is currently projecting 3.5% annualized growth in the second quarter.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen, wrote in a note to clients last Friday his team expected a downward revision to first quarter GDP but that didn't serve as a cause for concern for economic growth moving forward.\n\n\"The bottom line is that the economy moderated somewhat in the first quarter, but it remains on a stable footing overall,\" Gapen wrote on Friday.\n\n",

      "body": "It's funny seeing all these headlines about how \"American consumers incorrectly state the economy is in a bad state\", and the whole premise is that data shows strong GDP growth, low unemployment, etc, and people are misinformed. All of these things are lagging indicators, but consumers base their opinion of the economy on their own subjective expectations, a leading indicator.\n\nAmericans are misinformed about the economy, but their opinions don't come from nowhere. It comes from their own anecdotal experiences.\n\nFor example, if you were just laid off last week, you probably don't care that the unemployment rate in April was only 3.9% or that GDP growth was 1.3%. If your employer institutes a salary freeze and paused bonuses, you probably don't care that inflation is \"only\" 3.4%, especially after inflation peaked at 9% not that long ago.\n\nThe fact that so many consumers have a negative view of the economy, much more negative than historically, is a strong leading indicator of what's to come.",
