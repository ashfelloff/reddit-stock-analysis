These however have only affected the eyes of the people, and has not gotten much into the respiratory systems, where things could, and have gotten bad.\n\nThese vaccines too, because many people I know would talk about this if they were needed, would more likely than not be more traditional vaccines and not the same as mRNA vaccines for Covid. We have a greater understanding of this virus, whereas covid was more novel. The problem is that an H5 virus, though known to us, is not known to the human body, and this we aren't sure how it would work if it were to spread human to human, but most predictions aren't pretty.",
