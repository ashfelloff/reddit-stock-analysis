  "selftext": "Am I crazy or just uneducated - but why in the world dont all stock charts (google finance, yahoo, bloomberg, TV, newspapers, etc) show TRUE returns on investments - including dividends?\n\nWouldnt charts that show growth with dividends be a lot more useful for the reader?\n\nFor example, if you look from 1/1/2010 to now..  \nSPY with dividends invested return: 13.66%  \nSPY without dividends invested return: 12.46%\n\nCVX (Chevron) is 7.1% vs 8.6% (thats 21% different!!)\n\nThe whole point is to see how much your money would have grown if you had invested it - and not including dividends makes you miss out on quite a bit of the full story!\n\nNot just that - it makes stocks that give dividends appear less attractive on the charts when you are comparing to other stocks.\n\nAre there websites / resources that show stock returns with dividends reinvested? I feel like I would be picking a lot more stocks with dividends that could be hidden gems as their actual return is far higher than would appear at a glance on traditional charts!!!",
