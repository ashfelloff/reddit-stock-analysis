Yesterday morning , I noticed that the price action drilled down and the move was quite violent but then this did not reflect the auction offering of the premium of the contracts. Basically , the market opened and the premium increased but not much and stayed somewhat flat . I did not sell right away after the bell and just sat on my position waiting on the bid price to go up which eventually took off nicely. But now seeing your position and your play, I realize this must have been the time when I needed to prob buy more contracts still at a very low premium. A buddy of mine actually sold and reentered again.",
