      "body": "You know, whenever you’re feeling down about a situation, all you need to do is remember that there is a Simpsons episode that addresses every life situation. Take for instance when Homer invested his family’s life savings into a motion capture stock. Within 24 hours the motion capture company goes bankrupt along with their life savings. Consequently, Homer gets a job as a test subject for scientific experiments, one of which reveals the true reason behind his stupidity: a crayon that got stuck in his brain when he was a child. When Homer gets the crayon surgically removed, he becomes a more intelligent man — and soon learns that being smart doesn’t equal being happy. Moral of the story is, making sound financial decisions doesn’t mean you’ll be happy. You being you is all your family needs and with you by their side you’ll get through current situation.\n\nP.s. maybe also get an X-ray to rule out any crayons in your brain.",
