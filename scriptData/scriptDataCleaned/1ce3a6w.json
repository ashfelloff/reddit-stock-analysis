While this is true, they are operating differently within the realm of finance, visa has 8bn revenue and close to 5bn cash flow (quarterly, these past few quarters) on 560bn(!!!) market cap. PayPal has 8bn revenue and slightly more than 1bn cash flow on less than 70bn market cap. \n\nIf they can speed up growth and increase cash flow even a little and introduce a shy dividend like visa for example.
