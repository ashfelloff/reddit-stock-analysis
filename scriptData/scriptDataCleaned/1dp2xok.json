I've been trading with these indicators for a long time so I can tell where the buyers and sellers are. \n\nMy trade today was just based on basic Bollinger Band range. The price was sitting at a major support level at the open w/c coincides at the lower Bollinger band. I bought that at the open and took profit at the upper band.",
