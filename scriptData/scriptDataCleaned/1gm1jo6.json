  "score": 67,
  "selftext": "Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.\n\nHere’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:\n\n* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected\n* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected\n\nThe company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.\n\nSales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.\n\nPinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  \n\nThe company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.\n\nPinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.\n\nLast week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.\n\nAlphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.\n\nMicrosoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.\n\nReddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2024.html)",
