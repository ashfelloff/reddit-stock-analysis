No other President in history served more than two (in fact a law was passed afterwards to limit presidents to two terms max). He also placed Japanese-Americans in internment camps, in clear defiance of the U.S. Constitution. Nonetheless, he’s remembered as one of the greatest U.S. presidents, for good reason. It’s just a fact that major wars necessitate greater executive power.",
