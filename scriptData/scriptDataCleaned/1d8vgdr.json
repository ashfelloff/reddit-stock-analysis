  "selftext": "What are the odds that NVDA fails to ever claim the top spot as the #1 most valuable company by market cap in the world? They are currently #3 and gaining fast on MSFT and AAPL. \n\nThere are only two options here. And really only one of them makes sense. I can’t see any scenario where NVDA fails to take the top spot from MSFT. They are in the sweet spot of massive demand, sky high profit margins, and massive media attention combined with rock solid guidance. Will they hold the top spot forever? No, but who cares. This is a rocket ship that is mid flight to its destination. This is not a discussion about what happens when the rocket ship reaches its destination in a year or two. \n\nSo, tell me how I’m wrong here, because I have wracked my brain and I just can’t see any way for them to fail to take the top spot.

At some point it becomes increasingly economical to pursue chips from others or to do your own chip manufacturing. Eventually this should result in a better bank for the buck dollar-wise, unless NVDA can absolutely stay so far ahead that no one can compete.\n\nEnd of the day, I will admit I am not familiar enough with the underlying technology to know why or why not others can or cannot compete with NVDA, but if they can compete, it will force NVDA to reduce their margins... the end result of reducing margins is a downward impact to market cap.\n\nTo put this in other words... If NVDA's revenue goes to 50B a quarter and their costs are 10B, that is 40B a quarter or 160B a year in revenue that NVDA is receiving that companies can opt to spend part of on developing their own chips. Currently that profit is about 60B and a year ago was 8B.\n\nYou can see that a year ago there was not so much profit here to drive companies to consider alternatives, but at current profit margins and especially if the revenue continues to go way up, there is a lot of money on the table for companies to save by seeking alternatives to NVDA. This is why, from an economical perspective I find investing in NVDA unsound. On the other hand, if there is indeed something about the technology that makes it impossible for others to put downward price pressure on NVDA, then sure, they can go way up yet.",

Of course, the very nature of Nvidia business is cyclical where big ticket purchases, esp IT spend is not a yearly occurrence for a company. Of course, this is the elephant in the room. Beyond competition which Nvidia does not need to worry. Their 20+ year of R&D is coming to fruition. A company cannot just mimic this. \n\nAI infrastructure spend will come down but not anytime soon. And of course Jensen knows that not addressing the cyclical nature of his company will only harm the company negatively. \n\nSo how does Nvidia combat this notable risk. They introduce turnkey solutions in software, particularly in AI, subscriptions. Very few expected Apple to have a material subscription stream. Now it’s 25% of the company and continues to grow. The next chapter of Nvidia is the evolution of a software AI company.\n\nCompanies will be so hooked on Nvidia software due to the high spend in their AI infrastructure that they will not use other products. Akin to Windows. This new growth driver will materialize in the years ahead. That’s just one example. Also Nvidia’s intellectual property on the hardware side is so far ahead that even behemoths can’t catch up. Nvidia will be a mix of Apple and Microsoft and be ubiquitous. Sure margins will come down but don’t see it going under 50%. As long as revenue increases, NVDA is cheap",

While AMD has a partnership with Azure to offer AI platforms at a lower cost than NVIDIA, AMD GPUs are more affordable, whereas NVIDIA GPUs are generally more powerful. NVIDIA holds 98% of the data center market share.\n\nNVIDIA's dominance isn't just about market share; it's about innovation and ecosystem. NVIDIA's CUDA platform offers extensive support for developers with comprehensive libraries and tools that simplify the development of AI applications. Their GPUs are optimized for deep learning workloads, providing unmatched performance and efficiency. Moreover, NVIDIA's commitment to advancing AI technology is evident in their continuous investment in research and development, ensuring they stay ahead of the competition.\n\nIn addition, NVIDIA has a robust support and training infrastructure, including the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute, which helps organizations and developers maximize the potential of their AI projects.
