  "score": 409,
  "selftext": "I am loading some puts or maybe a put debit spread somewhere in the 250-260 range.\n\nWhy?  Several reasons.\n\n1. Workday tanked on ER recently. Enterprises are too focused on investing in AI right now instead of modernizing their SaaS stack.\n\n2. AI is starting to eat into Salesforce’s business. Their biggest 2 business lines are for sales management and service cloud - the latter of which is basically selling licenses used by call center employees. Guess what? Call center jobs are the first casualty or AI. That means license count reductions across the industry for Salesforce.\n\n3. Salesforce’s own foray into AI has been and is still crap. Einstein is 100% marketing and 0% substance.\n\n4. We have seen a similar story starting to play out with Adobe already. The head wind from AI is real for these companies.\n\nWith AI either you’re the bug or you’re the windshield. In this case, I am pretty sure CRM is about to go splat.\n\nUpdate: bought 250p for this Friday - 50 contracts.\n",

It's 1-yr RSI already shows it's oversold near the 30s mark.\n\n* CRM downward catalyst from the $300 mark is because they kept talking about more M&A after their last earnings. Guess investors didn't like that as much as they liked solid performance plus dividends/buybacks.\n\n* Their P/E is at a pretty good ratio compared to historical data: https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CRM/salesforce/pe-ratio\n\n* Also software application companies have been mostly beats this quarter. https://finance.yahoo.com/sectors/technology/software-application/\n\n* Even if short, you're OP on wallstreetbets and made the frontpage.

Product doesn’t suck and they are expanding into new markets like unified endpoint management.\n3. Stock price took a big haircut recently so there is room to bounce back.\n4. Zscaler did ok\n5. Everyone still needs good AV/security software, must have solution\n\nThings I don’t like:\n1. Software in general hasn’t been doing great in the aggregate this earning season.\n2. Not really tied to AI trend in any meaningful way\n3. Not sure if there will be a growth story because enterprises are investing in AI and budgets likely flat for security",
