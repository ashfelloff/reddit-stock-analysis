Most CTOs probably don't have a clue. One greybeard on the cyber security team and Sheila in procurement are the only ones who know or care. \n\nWith that in mind, everybody cares a lot right now if they are on Crowdstrike. If there's another ready, fire, aim fuck up like this and my systems go down the first question is going to be \"who made the decision to stick with Crowdstrike after they caused the largest global IT outage in human history?\" The second question is going to be \"can everyone else please step out so I can speak to them\" as HR and security enter the room. No IT leader wants to risk being in that position, whether it's the greybeard in Cybersecurity or the CTO. If anyone's first order of business this morning wasn't kicking off their Crowdstrike End of Life Initiative, they should be fired for lack of political awareness.\n\nI can migrate every piece of infrastructure I have in less than 90 days. But I'll do it in phases, probably 1/4 at a time. They charge per endpoint that's monitored so you can bet they'll see impact to revenue sooner than later. Their other services (antivirus, network sniffing, etc) I could replace in four weeks or less.\n\nContracts you say? I've got a legal department of 300 nasty as fuck lawyers plus outside council that will be chomping at the bit to sit in on that discussion with their legal team. Good luck with that.\n\n\n\n\nGrowth is going to implode.",
