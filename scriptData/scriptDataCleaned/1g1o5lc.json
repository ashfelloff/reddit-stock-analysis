With the recent .5% cut, I noticed it immediately with stocks like PYPL UPST etc. \n\nAFRM however did not follow the trend and actually popped up to $48 a share during rate cut day. Since then it‚Äôs dropped in price while consistently getting analysis upgrades. Last few days it broke the downtrend. 2 days in a row it got upgrades and gapped up. So today when it gapped up this morning pre market I was just watching momentum, saw a bull flag forming and bought some lotto tickets.  I also watched option flow and related stocks. Bank earnings were good too so I figured that might help bring in some buyers. \n\nI‚Äôm still bullish on AFRM and fintech. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",
