The more volume you take up with ice, the better. Baristas who don't follow this order will be disciplined  \n-More whipped cream to hide the lack of everything else in your cup  \n-removing the OZ size of the cups off the menu (if they're even there, I don't know, I make coffee at home), followed by shrinking the size of the cups  \n-No full pumps, half pumps only  \n-No more hospital food offerings to save on overhead",

BROS has the unique position of and ability to accelerate growth, becoming better and bigger than SBUX in due course. Why is this the case, frankly it's better tasting coffee to most I know....remind you of the current coffee king years ago? The other big plus is really friendly people, solid beverage selection and generally pretty fast service, but it's really the great people at the Dutch Bros stores that will make their future very bright. Once Mr Market realizes the true upside of BROS, sentiment builds and growth blossoms. I see the potential of a combined CMG-SBUS revenue stream in BROS as our world moves faster and faster, so will the profits from BROS. Go get um Dutch Bros!",
