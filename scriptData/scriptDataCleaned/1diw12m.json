What about when the secondhand market is also saturated (they see no revenue from that market). Any closure of AI-related startups will result in liquidating a lot of hardware. I know they want to start a cloud platform where hardware is *leased*, but they will be competing directly with the other cloud providers whom they sold hardware to (one time cost). I don't see how they can avoid this sticky situation and enjoy continued growth at the same rate currently.",
