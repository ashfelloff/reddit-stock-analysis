JP Morgan and other firms picked up the assets, got a spread deal from the fed on it, and everyone was made whole while tax payers picked up the bill. The FDIC allegedly back stopped the whole thing, but really that was just a publicity stunt to ensure everyone keeps making deposits and the banking system as a whole gets to normal. A couple of big firms made billions. In a couple years you'll see a documentary come out on Netflix how a couple of hedge funds bet against these banks, sent them into a tailspin and almost crashed the banking system in order to cash out massively on shareholders of those banks. JPmorgan acquired 120b+ in Treasury bonds that were going to mature in the next 2-3 years at a discount and the fed paid them an interest rate spread to do it. JP Morgan literally made a guaranteed profit backed by the federal government at current rates. There couldn't be a more perfect investment ever made. \n\nRoku had 450m in an account. They got made whole. This would have been a huge hit to their stock price as well. So while the FDIC says they paid out everything. The FDIC is funded by banks paying insurance premiums. In reality this was a back room deal that left tax payers paying the spread for JPmorgan.",
