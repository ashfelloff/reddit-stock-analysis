  "selftext": "The key takeaways from earnings/recent highlights:\n\nAchieved 95% yields from the Gen 2 manufacturing equipment during Factory Acceptance Testing.\n\nEnovix announced it has been granted 15-year Pioneer Status from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, MIDA, for manufacturing its batteries in Malaysia. Effectively this is a tax abatement. \n\nSite Acceptance Testing will be complete during 2Q24.\n\nMinimum throughput for Gen 2 is 1350 units per hour is confirmed but they already tested at 1650 units per hour.\n\nSigned a development agreement with a top 5 cellphone OEM.\n\nSampling to 6 of 8 top cellphone OEMS.\n\nEX-1M w/ 18% more energy density vs graphite will ship 2Q24. EX-2M is expected to increase by 30% and will ship before year end 2024.\n\nAnticipate further cost reductions of 35MM per year and Gen 2 cost will go down as more lines are added.\n\nOn the earnings call the Chief Financial Officer commented, they have a long runway before they’d need to raise capital and they wouldn’t do it at the current stock price. Nor would the board allow it.\n\nHe also mentioned they’ve gotten unsolicited interest from governments and Sovereign Wealth Funds indicating a desire to provide funding if Enovix sets up a fab in their country. \n\n* Added info: this is a show me story that continues to de-risk as management continues to deliver. Despite that there is an intransigent short base that is approximately 30% of the float currently.\n\n",

          "body": "IMO this is still early innings. Prior to earnings the stock was heavily shorted because of the short thesis they couldn’t scale production. If you look at the stock price peaks during the last 2yrs it was mid-20s and that’s when there was significantly more business risk.\n\nThere’s still a large short base, the company has laid out the economics, signed a development agreement with a smartphone OEM and is months away from High Volume Manufacturing. By year end they should be shipping several million batteries. Based on the above the revenue funnel should ramp quickly and their Fab-2 in Malaysia has capacity for 4 lines. All of this suggests that if people dig into the story and management continues to execute, this should trade much higher than before.",

As their slide indicates there are 7 Billion smartphones in dire need of a better battery. Only 40 million electric vehicles currently. Even still Enovix is engaged with at least one vehicle OEM. But the potential moat they can conceivably create by being first to mass market is significant when you consider the recent earnings call update.\n\nPeople should read their latest slide deck and shareholder letter:\n\n[Enovix May 2024 Presentation](https://ir.enovix.com/static-files/667425e2-44ef-4ab0-978b-991a2e6be186)\n\n[Enovix May 2024 Shareholder Letter](https://ir.enovix.com/static-files/11272dc9-2cde-4ad2-b2df-dbce0221fe4b)",
