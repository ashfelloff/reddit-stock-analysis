The firm sold 56,425 and 6,442 shares respectively, the transaction was valued at $14.54 million. On Tuesday, Tesla shares closed 10.2% higher at $231.26, driven higher by the second-quarter delivery report of the company. The numbers came ahead of the consensus estimate.*\n\n*This move comes despite Wood’s previous statements, where she referred to the Elon Musk-led automaker as the “biggest AI project” in the world and predicted the stock to reach $2,000 per share in the coming years.*\n\n*As recently as June, Ark Invest set a new price target for Tesla at $2,600 for 2029, heavily revolving around the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARK’s Expected Value For Tesla In 2029: $2,600 Per Share \\[12 June 2024\\]**\n\n[https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/arks-tesla-price-target-2029](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/arks-tesla-price-target-2029)\n\n*ARK’s updated open-source Tesla model yields an expected value of $2,600 per share in 2029. The bull and bear cases, tuned to the 75th and 25th percentile Monte Carlo outcomes, respectively, are approximately $3,100 and $2,000 per share, as shown below. This research update presents ARK’s open-source Tesla model, which incorporates distributions for 45 independent inputs to simulate a range of potential outcomes for the company and its stock.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**ARK’s Price Target for Tesla in 2025 \\[19 March 2021\\]**\n\n[https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/tesla-price-target-2](https://www.ark-invest.com/articles/valuation-models/tesla-price-target-2)\n\n*Last year, ARK estimated that in 2024 Tesla’s share price would hit $7,000 per share, or $1,400 adjusted for its five for one stock split. Based on our updated research, we now estimate that it could approach $3,000 in 2025.*\n\n*# Please note the Valuation Model was published before Tesla executed a 3-for-1 stock split after market close on 24 August 2022, $1,400 should read as $466.66 effectively.*",

If people had listened to those voices and bought when it was hitting its lows, they'd be over 300% up right now.\n\n\nDisclaimer: I hold a few hundred bucks worth of shares and am quite happy that I listened to those people. I was planning to hold til it $30, but Cathie's habit of buying high is making me consider selling. She seems like a touch of death for stocks.",

With the Nasdaq having recovered as well as it did after that nasty bear market (had you told me in October 2022 that it’d take it just 16 months to recover fully with there being no rate cuts involved, I’d have laughed so hard), she’d have been better off not running an active ETF.\n\nHeck, PSCT (which may be a better comparison) is only down 10%ish from a record.",
