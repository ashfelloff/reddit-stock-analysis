Despite a lower market cap than peers like Viking Therapeutics, Altimmune has strong institutional support, substantial cash reserves, and potential strategic partnerships, including a possible collaboration with Pfizer. With upcoming FDA meetings and Phase 3 trials, Altimmune presents a high-risk, high-reward investment opportunity.\n\nSource: ChatGPT\n\nPosition: 50 AAPL $210 calls, 7/19",
