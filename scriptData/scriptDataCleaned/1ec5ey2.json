I actually felt a weird emotional connection- took screenshots of the cost basis and percentage change, haha. And, yes, my remaining AMD is next on the chopping block should I see an opportunity that I can’t otherwise take advantage of. (I’ve actually considered taking it and putting it into NVDA, but it and other shares like it, are like my savings account at this point.)\n\nMaybe it’s my emotional maturity, but, I don’t expect I’ll ever sell my Nvidia shares. I first bought them (literally my first shares,) because every guy and boy I knew loved video games. And added from there. That one for me is a longterm hold, unless something changes drastically - they have just delivered over and over (I read an article like eight years ago that they had a less good earnings because of supply chain/TSM and otherwise neck and neck with AMD - and I seriously thought that was silly - Nvidia was ahead, for sure. Maybe 2018?)",

(After hubbub of launch subsides, assuming all goes well, I will sell covered calls OTM and buy more shares, but beyond that, as stated in my previous posts.) And as the position has grown large and I expect it to grow larger, I’m off on to the next. What’s striking is that no one wants to take the risk on the next (some for that matter don’t want to buy into ASTS because of remaining risk and recent run up, despite the imbalances risk:reward. I’ve shared the position I’m building (in AUR,) also pre revenue, with amazing tech, brilliant CEO, upcoming catalysts but clearly still early, but no one is interested yet, which I find odd given how many comments I’ve seen saying “why didn’t you share this sooner?” about ASTS. I thought it due to risk aversion, but the penchant for gambling 0DTES to near zero and probable and frequent loss, leads me to believe that it’s due to something else. (Obviously I have a high risk tolerance given these choices, but am spreading my bets a bit.)\n\nI agree that ASTS has a great deal of promise and the likelihood that it is a steal at this prices in the long term, is great.",
