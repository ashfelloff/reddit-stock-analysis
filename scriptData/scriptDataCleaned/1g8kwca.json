[Bitcoin has historically mooned 6-8 months *after* a halving.](https://charts.bitbo.io/cycle-repeat/2024-01-01) It's a misconception that Bitcoin rises as soon as the mining reward is halved.\n\nThe reasons for this are pretty simple. Your average mining outfit aren't speculators. They sell the Bitcoin they mine to pay for business expenses and the margins are slim because capitalism. If it costs 0.05BTC/Mo to operate and they're producing 0.075BTC/Mo pre-halving, their 0.0375BTC/Mo post-halving reward won't be enough to pay for their 0.05BTC/Mo expenses. \n\nSo, instead of selling all of that 0.075BTC/Mo pre-halving income, they will set aside 0.015BTC/Mo or so in reserve to sell after the halving. That way they're profitable both pre and post-halving.\n\nIt's when these reserves dry up, 6-8 months after a halving, that BTC starts to rise from supply shock.",

Sending money domestically can be a little cheaper, but there's still usually a flat fee and a percentage fee.\n\nNot to mention it can take 2 days to complete transfers. It's a very slow system. And you can't just access it as a regular person, you need to use a bank.\n\nInternational remittance is like THE use case for crypto and Bitcoin. In America, the average fee paid for remittance is 6.18%, which means Americans spend $12 billion a year on fees. Considering the average spread of BTC pairs is less than 2%, you come out ahead even if both parties are paying it. And it settles in minutes, not days.\n\nStablecoins are also great for this purpose. Tether has a 0.01% spread, so depending on exchange fees it can cost less than 1% to send money overseas using it.",
