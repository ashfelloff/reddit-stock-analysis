  "selftext": "Shares of coffee chain Dutch Bros ($ BROS) jumped as much as 40.3% in the morning session after the company reported a \"beat and raise\" quarter, which suggests that its recent sales optimization efforts are resonating with customers. Dutch Bros delivered strong third-quarter earnings, which blew past analysts' revenue and EBITDA expectations as same-shop transaction growth improved. \n\nItâ€™s at its highest price this year in 2024 and only looking stronger for 2025.

      "body": "Dutch Bros is crushing it right now. Their expansion strategy is working perfectly - they opened 38 new shops last quarter alone and now have 950 locations across 18 states. The mobile ordering rollout to 90% of shops is driving serious growth in transactions.\n\nRevenue jumped [28% year-over-year to $338.2 million](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dutch-bros-stock-skyrockets-33-190139670.html) and they're raising guidance for 2024. Same-store sales up 2.7% and transactions increased 0.8%. Those are solid numbers in this economy.\n\nTheir \"Dutch Luv\" culture and focus on drive-thru efficiency sets them apart from Starbucks. Plus they're smart about site selection - targeting high-traffic locations that'll generate strong returns.\n\nManagement knows what they're doing. They're planning another 160 shops in 2025. The growth story is real. Strong fundamentals, great execution, and they're still in early innings of expansion.",

I currently have 200 shares with an average price of $28.05 that are up +68.2% overall.  \n\nEDIT: I read *One Up on Wall Street* by Peter Lynch a long time ago. One of the things he talked about is paying attention to where you spend money and where other people around you are spending money. That can make you notice successful businesses that you might otherwise overlook. Before the Dutch Bros IPO I had noticed that whenever I drove by a Dutch Bros kiosk there was always a line of cars going to it. Every location. Day or night. So when I heard it was going to go public I bought on the first day and bought the dips after that. I also added BROS to the Roth IRAs of my adult children that I manage for them.",
