It is estimated that the work will be affected for less than 6 hours, and the impact on the Group's 2FQ is forecasted at about US$60 million, with limited impact overall.](https://x.com/Sino_Market/status/1775375861522567637?s=20)\n\n- Update: [Taiwan Earthquake Latest: Hsinchu Science Park, home to leading chipmaker TSMC, evacuated all 170,000+ staff this morning. No damages reported so far, some production lines shut down as a preventative measure.  TSMC says evacuated **employees have already begun returning to work.**](https://x.com/taiwanplusnews/status/1775377652901445898?s=46&t=yTuqWHcxCuGnMzHlm-HdGw)\n\n- [TSMC, UMC, other chip makers have had earthquake trip switches in place for years to ensure machines shut down to keep damage to chips in production to a minimum. We'll know soon. And yes, restarting takes time. Safety checks, damage checks, etc](https://x.com/dnystedt/status/1775361955903181246?s=46&t=yTuqWHcxCuGnMzHlm-HdGw)\n\n- [On map: The small blue star to the right of Taiwan is the epicenter (East Coast). The main semiconductor production areas are to the left, the West, where there are no reports of major damage as of now.](https://x.com/dnystedt/status/1775361258226856114?s=46&t=yTuqWHcxCuGnMzHlm-HdGw)\n\n- [The world‚Äôs biggest maker of advanced semiconductors, TSMC, said it evacuated some of its factories, called fabs. The company said its safety systems were operating normally and that it was still assessing the impact. TSMC‚Äôs fabs are clustered along Taiwan‚Äôs west coast, away from the epicenter of the earthquake. Still, chip production is highly precise and even short shutdowns can cost millions of dollars.](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2024/04/03/world/taiwan-earthquake-japan-tsunami/73ffe2a6-68aa-5704-bb1e-909dff02a9c8?smid=url-share)",
