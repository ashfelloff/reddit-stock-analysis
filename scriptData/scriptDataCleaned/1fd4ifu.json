              "body": "In other news today Apple hosted a major event bringing people from around the world to show off their innovative new products. The tepidness was palpable and the crowd was properly whelmed. \n\nThe event led with ground breaking news such as ear buds complying with European regulations and allowing USB C charging. There were many people who attempted to be as aloof and meaningless as Steve Jobs, and did a far better job at being aloof and worthless. The culmination of the event was proceeded by an epic earth shattering innovation that registered a -1 on the Richter Scale, they added a button to take photos.\n\nApple believes that having a mobile cellular device that can also take pictures may be the next 'big thing' so they had a core team of 500 engineers working for 2 years to develop said button.\n\nThe market reacted as expected, as the article is written after it happened. When no one traded in the night it soared to new daily highs, and dropped shortly after open as industry experts believed this event would follow every other event and lead to a roughly 3-5% decline in the week following. But they jumped the gun and Tim Apple attacked driving the price up in anticipation of gratuitous use of the term 'AI'. The price whipsawed and then the AI onslaught began, except nothing actually changed from the prior model and the stock selloff began.\n\nTo wrap up the day the NASDAQ quickly ran up, and with FOMO AAPL also rapidly climbed ending the day at no meaningful change. Much like the iPhone reveal, a whole bunch of hype and action, with nothing actually happening.",
