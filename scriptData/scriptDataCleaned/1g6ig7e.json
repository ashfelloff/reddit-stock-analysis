  "selftext": "Hey all, just curious if anyone is buying Amazon (AMZN) right now? The stock’s been dipping a bit, and I’m wondering if this is a good entry point for the long term or if there’s more downside coming. Thoughts on where it’s headed or just holding off for now? Would love to hear what you guys think!",

They assemble teams to study their competition so they can undercut them and take over their market share and sell the product themselves. Super cut throat business through and through. They don’t get complacent, they constantly cut fat, and people say it’s a very demanding place to work - not a cush job at all. That makes me like them as a stock and I want them in my portfolio.",

I have to use these LLMs a lot for work and Google is just way behind still.\n\nMaybe they'll eventually be able to conquer that difference with money but they've entered plenty of other fields with more money and more data and ended up exiting a few years later with their tails between their legs.  Granted they've entered this one with a lot more conviction/money, but all I ever hear any time Google turns its sights on something is that no one can compete with all the data Google has to create a better product, but time and time again they struggle to turn that data into an actual better product.\n\nLook at Google Home for instance.  I've had that thing from the beginning and not only has it not gotten any better over the last 3-5 years, it's arguably even worse now than it was then, despite them having all that extra automation data they've collected over that time span.  They compile and collect all that data and have all the expensive engineers, but they often struggle to put those two together to actually create something great.  As a company they are still extremely reliant on their original core business (search), which in and of itself has not really improved in quite some time, with a more common sentiment again being that it's actually gotten worse over time rather than better.",
