Intel still dominates there. AMD’s advantage is less distinct.  Power density and thermal density in a rack environment mean PCI lanes aren’t as big of an advantage. You can only pack so much in anyway.\n\nNot to mention the desktop market in the corporate space is solidly Intel with AMD not even having a competitive offering. Intels low end chips are enough for these applications, very low cost, and very power efficient at idle, which at scale matters. AMD’s chiplet design means idle power consumption is higher.  Thats important because companies upgrade on 4-5 year cycles with many thousands of units. Thats reliable income for Intel AMD can’t touch, and ARM can’t touch until windows for ARM doesn’t suck.\n\nIntel has design issues to fix, and manufacturing issues, but a lot of this thread is pump and dump for AMD.

They were the most dominant because they were the best.\n\nSince then, they have:\n\n* under invested in the next generation of chip/fab stuff for servers (eUV tech)\n* have fallen behind on processor design to AMD for x86 - thereby losing ground the server market. (And hobby enthusiasts market as well - but not revenue significant)\n* have lost a major client in the consumer pc space via apple, and now windows has announced partnerships with Qualcomm for ARM ISA computers instead of x86.\n* They missed the boat on mobile CPUs to Qualcomm and have the boat on specialized compute to Nvidia.\n\n\nThey are fast losing their software moat as well:\n* Apple proved that cross ISA translation is “good enough”\n* in the server space, AMD is x86, same as intel, and so several applications have a lot less work to do to port stuff over (although not none)\n* AMD servers are so much better at Compute/$ that companies are willing to put in RnD costs to save on capex long or even medium term.\n* They made a half hearted attempt to compete with Qualcomm on mobile and lost, while never even really trying in the GPU/TPU space.\n\n\nIf any of the intel original founders were around, they’d be ashamed. Intel used to pride itself on innovating its way out of problems (like breakdown of moore’s law, pre UV lithography) or changes in market conditions (eg death of memory chip manufacturers in the US in light of better and cheaper ships from Japan/Korea).\n\nThey have entirely lost that edge since sometime in late 2000s and early 2010s and the in the last decade or so all of the rewards from past investments have dried up.\n\n\nSo as a value play, Intel is fucked. They have maybe 3-4 years (roughly 2 hardware refresh cycles) to convince people and companies that they have something competitive, otherwise AMD/Qualcomm/Nvidia and even ARM/Samsung will eat their lunch.\n\nIntel is now where IBM probably was 30ish years ago and they will likely decline much faster.",

ARM designs are much more efficient, and are at a point they can do most of what an Intel chip can do.

You've seen the articles about oxidization on their chips causing them to malfunction, and the articles about offloading some manufacturing to TSMC. I don't have high hopes for them lapping TSMC, but the possibility is always there.

It will take time to build up trust in the industry (especially since they failed the first time they attempted foundry a decade ago), and kindling that trust would be seriously set back if Intel doesn’t achieve its high-NA 14A transition smoothly.\n\nAnd the end of the day, Intel’s plan is far too risky imo, and they could still profit and expand without IFS and its associated risks.",

      "body": "> It's unlikely intel actually goes anywhere in the CPU industry.\n\nWell, that's the rub.  Intel is *seriously* taking it on the chin as the silicon of choice for both Windows and Linux.\n\n**Data Centre**\n\n* Crazy failure rates and high pricing on the latest generation chips has caused data centre builders (esp. game and general-purpose VM server vendors)  to flock to AMD for new builds.  One of my contacts that runs a VM shop told me 50% of his new orders are now for AMD-based servers.\n\n* The \"big cloud\" CPU purchases are slowing down, and behemoths like Microsoft, Amazon and Google are pouring more into GPU (AI) racks than CPU now.  Cloud infrastructure buys have slowed significantly as the market hit near-saturation and is now building out organically and not *en masse*.\n\n**Personal Computing**\n\n* Intel has no competitive offering for the phone market.  Desktop and laptop upgrades are typically on a much slower cycle than phones, and PC's have not been a real \"growth\" market for over a decade.\n\n* AMD is making inroads in all PC/Laptop segments (budget, business and performance).  Not long ago, Intel held >90% of the PC/Laptop market, and recent estimates put them [as low as 66%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/735904/worldwide-x86-intel-amd-market-share/).  The [major failure debacle with 13th and 14th gen](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/unreal-engine-supervisor-blasts-50-failure-rate-with-intel-chips-praises-amds-chips-as-company-switches-to-ryzen-9-9950x) appears to be hurting them significantly\n\n* Windows on ARM as of just last month is proving that it is viable and - frankly - pretty amazing.  20-hour battery life with better-than-intel benchmarks on a windows laptop was unheard of, but now is a reality.  Native app support is improving rapidly, and even NVidia has announced they will be releasing ARM-based gaming hardware for Windows.  Windows-on-Arm (WoA) has the potential to take a *large* bite out of Intel's lunch, as it may become the defacto hardware for laptops and tablets.\n\nThe TL;DR here is that Intel has no moat, is not a leader in a growing market, and is facing serious headwinds in the markets it currently dominates.  Both their consumer GPU and AI-focused products have flopped (3% market share), and they have not been able to successfully move into new market segments.  They are definitely *not* Too Big to Fail™.",
