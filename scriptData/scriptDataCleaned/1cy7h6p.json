  "selftext": "Over the past couple of weeks we have seen multiple ATH skims around the same level. What we saw today is very bullish, there is an insane amount of pressure on the market right now. SPY has hit ATH and dropped into some big liquidity pools, if you know anything about trading this is a liquidity grab. Bears, you have bet on NVDA going down for months and how's that been? NVDA earnings will pump this to mars, try going green for once, I'm showing you ez gains. I also have a engulfing candle indicator which has shown to be very good to follow for bullish plays.
