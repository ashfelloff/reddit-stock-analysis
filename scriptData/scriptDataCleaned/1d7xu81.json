But the market is all about trying to beat the odds, so it's understandable that it wouldn't align with natural processes. My opinion is that this is due to algorithmic trading.  Computers don't think like humans, they have no emotions, only formulas.  Play chess against a computer and you'll understand.  The lesson for me is to stick to index investing, since it's self correcting.  If you can't beat the system, join it.  Let others try to explain the mysteries of the universe while you make bank.",
