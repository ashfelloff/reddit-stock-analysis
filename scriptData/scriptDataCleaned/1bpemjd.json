  "selftext": "Below are multiple of Mr. Wallers more important remarks in his speech:\n\n\"In 2023, we made progress on reducing inflation and improving the job market, but recent data has made me unsure about the pace of this progress. February's job gains and inflation measures have been stronger than expected, indicating that we need more time to assess the situation. So, I don't see a need to rush into cutting interest rates just yet.\"\n\n\"Looking at the economic performance, GDP growth is expected to slow this quarter, but it's still solid. Consumer spending is moderating, especially on goods, while services spending is growing moderately. Business surveys show mixed results, with manufacturing activity contracting slightly while nonmanufacturing businesses continue to expand.\"\n\n\"As for the job market, recent data suggests strong job gains, but the unemployment rate rose slightly, mainly due to more young people being counted as unemployed. The number of people quitting their jobs has decreased, indicating less turnover, which means firms aren't competing as much for workers.\"\n\n\"Regarding productivity, recent growth has been fast, but it's uncertain whether it will continue. Factors like large investment projects and resolving supply chain issues may have boosted productivity in the short term, but it's unclear if this will be sustained.\"\n\n\"On inflation, recent data has been disappointing, with both total and core inflation increasing. While there are reasons to believe progress will continue, we need to monitor the situation closely.\"\n\n\"Overall, I believe there's no rush to cut interest rates. The economy is strong, and waiting a little longer to assess the trajectory of inflation is the prudent approach.\"\n\nREAD THE FULL SPEECH HERE: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240327a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240327a.htm)",
