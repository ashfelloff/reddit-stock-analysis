Then bought calls.

If you were leveraged on margin your fucked. Just the way the game is played gents. Never ever bet against that company again. It’s just the start….and as a tech company the robots will come…it’s only a matter of time. I sold my Bitcoin at the Hughes and bought a bunch of Tesla.

They will liquidate your assets in the account and thats all they really can do. Like i said, a guy on reddit owed 1m and he ended up only having to pay a small fraction of it. Im talking less than 1%. And i think that was robinhood just being so mad they got fleeced, they scared him into paying something. You could use 5k of instant deposits and blow the 5k. Im not saying to do that. But they are probably the only company that allows instant deposit option trading.",
