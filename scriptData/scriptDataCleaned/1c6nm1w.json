  "selftext": "I’m going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it’s a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings.\n\n-------------------------------------------  \n**5/15 Market Update -**\n\nThis is probably my last update, but just to be clear, I am still in this trade and have not sold a single contract. I know the market has been ripping. I know that almost every morning, $RL will explode for a 1-2 point gain. Noticably, however, is that it always starts to sell off mid-day and then will settle within the 165-168 range. Despite the rest of the market just completely green, this gives me a TON of confidence.\n\nThere just aren't any real buyers for this stock right now (there's no reason to have any buyers). There's no real bullish analysis on this stock. There's no tailwind for this sector. The only reason it has yet to sell off is because there's no negative catalyst and all the institutional holders (which I see on yahoo is at 101% institutional ownership) generally just hold until there is news or earnings that gives them impetus to sell. \n\nAt the moment, the thesis is this:\n\n1. The stock is OVERVALUED based on 2024 year-end data and partial January sales. Those quarters were astronomically good for RL, but consumer spending has slowed dramatically since the last RL earnings call. The expectations for strong earnings is fatally flawwed. \n\n2. Guidance will also be revised downwards strongly. LULU and PVH (strongest beta values to RL) continue to trade sideways. Both gave terrible guidance. Despite the stock market roaring, those both are still basically trading sideways. \n\n3. Therefore, we're looking for a revenue miss, an earnings miss, and a guidance revision downwards.\n\n4. Lauren Family sold 3 million (MILLION) shares. It also represented an exit filing. They dumped at \\~$180.\n\n\n\nFinally, as a point of reference that also gives me confidence, \n\n$LULU shed 20% within 2 days of their bad earnings report. They lost 30% within 3 weeks.\n\n$PVH shed 25% within 2 days of their bad earnings report.\n\n**Let's say $RL breaks the sideways trend because the market just pulls it up and gets up to $170 the day before earnings.**\n\n**a 20% drop is $136, which puts us in the money (probably double our money).**\n\n**a 25% drop is $127.5, which puts us in the money (5-7 bagger)**\n\n**a 30% drop is $119 (my original price target), which puts us in the money (8-10 bagger).**\n\n**All three scenarios, if you look at our reference points, are within the realm of possibility. Especially if some crazy macro shit actually starts happening as well.** \n\nAnd that's if RL gets up to $170. What if it starts to decline, beforehand?\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n4/26 Market Close Update\n\nSo obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.\n\nAs part of my update, I’m going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.\n\nFundamentals:\n\nThe major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.\n\n-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.\n\n-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html)\n\n-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following:\n\n(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS.\n\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)\n\n(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter.\n\n(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown.\n\n(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)\n\n(5) \"For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024.\" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.\n\n(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as \"long-term strategy for estate planning\". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.\n\n[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rl/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/rl/insider-activity)\n\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171)\n\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html)\n\nThis is a remark in the last report\n\nRemarks:\n\nFollowing the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.\n\nHeadwinds:\n\n-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post \"We are so fucking back\" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.\n\n-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.\n\n-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.\n\nTailwinds:\n\n-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call.\n\n-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed.\n\n-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.\n\nCatalysts:\n\nUnfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.\n\nNOTE ON PRICE ACTION:\n\nSince I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.\n\nStay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.\n\nThat's it for now ---\n\n—-\n\n4/19 Market Close Update -So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn’t do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.\n\nWe see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike.\n\nWe also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech.\n\nThis of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).\n\n-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don’t be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it’s pretty low volume. Today included.\n\n-Speaking of SMCI’s lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that’s when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there’s a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT’S the major catalyst we’re aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets.\n\n-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing \\~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it’s wrong. But of course, market doesn’t dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It’s the analysts’ job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air.\n\nOther catalysts to look towards could be: -god forbid, further war escalation -a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It’s a non-zero chance. -Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel.\n\n4/19 That’s it for now.\n\n—- Original Post:\n\nI'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\\_lauren\\_rl\\_is\\_a\\_10\\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)\n\nI had purchased in total \\~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.\n\nWhen I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \\~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \\~$188 to \\~$159.\n\nAll-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.\n\nAnd then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.\n\nMy DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:\n\n# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot\n\nWage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.\n\n# 2. Consumer debt has exploded\n\nHoliday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.\n\n# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled\n\nYou might think \"but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!\" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)\n\nIt's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.\n\nThis is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)\n\n**Macy's**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)\n\nPlus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.\n\n# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)\n\nThis is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)\n\nAlso included within the article is this statement\n\n*\"Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss* [*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N) *and Ralph Lauren* [*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N) *have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.\"*\n\nWhich is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).\n\nIt's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).\n\n# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)\n\n# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically.\n\nDespite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.\n\n# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8\n\nAs you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.\n\n[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)\n\nFurther, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.\n\n8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff\n\nThe stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.\n\n**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data.\n\nThe guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.\n\nRL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \\~$192.\n\nThe current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.\n\nFinally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \\~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.\n\nI suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.\n\nWithin the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).\n\nThere's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.\n\nTL;DR\n\nRL will gap down, get puts.\n\nPRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.\n\nPOSITIONS: \\~$60k in June 21 2024 140Ps",

According to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures in-store and online retail sales across all forms of payment, total U.S. retail sales (excluding automotive) were up YoY in March 2024, showing showing continued growth for both online (+6.1%) and in-store (+2.6%) retail sales. \n\nNotably, it's not adjusted for inflation (noted at the bottom of the article). Which means, when you factor in CPI inflation, it's actually down in real terms. \n\n2. Home furnishings and furniture is down -8.3% YoY, of which RL has a sizable portfolio of home decor in their portfolio. This is a trend we've seen after COVID, where COVID spurred a lot of home improvement, furniture, furnishings, and now it's declined.\n\n3. The article does note an increase in apparel spending, but my optimism allows me to assume that it could be outside of the RL semi-luxury tier. LULU and PVH re-affirms my thesis that this semi-luxury (below Gucci, Versace, Balenciaga, etc.) is going to face a poor year.\n\nSo it's not enough to really shake me. Plus the reality is it would just reduce the likelihood of a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance down (which I anticipate **could** happen next week, though it's still not super likely), as well as potentially (in the worst case scenario) allow RL to have a great earnings report and guidance. However, in the nearer term, I do think that the low volume exhibited by the stock, the resistance at this current \\~159-162 range, and the gap **will** fill if there's any other bearish catalyst (continued strong inflation data, the April/May FOMC meeting, a retaliatory attack from Israel, or some random black swan like a bank failure due to sustained high interest rates & high treasury yields).",

I did some research into Ashley's work, and frankly, she's always behind the 8 ball. For example, ULTA (the makeup brand) dropped about 15%, from $520 to $440 on April 3rd 2024 due to beauty demand slowing. On April 10th, 2024, she \"maintained\" her PT from $610 to $585. Just 9 days later, she downgraded the PT from $585 to $438.\n\n[https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/623447b902807e000111be29/ashley-helgans](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst/623447b902807e000111be29/ashley-helgans)\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that the newfound coverage of RL and price target of $195 seems.... inorganic. To an extent, it confirms my recently held suspicion that some hedge fund is sponsoring this coverage, through this analyst. Especially considering her ability to get it wrong (ie., mislead the retail shareholders so that the hedge funds can frontrun the trade).\n\nThis is actually good for this thesis, but the caveat is that there's a non-zero chance that this post is  being monitored by our counter-party. Nonetheless, the fundamentals are what they are and this stock should crash when earnings come out.\n\nAs a secondary point, I'll indulge myself after the earnings report (assuming we're all winners) and I'll buy this bear sweater. It's too on-the-nose to not purchase it (after ER of course).

As consumers are feeling the pinch of ongoing inflation and geopolitical concerns, this does not bode well for RL of course. Starbucks and McDonalds also confirmed a weakening consumer base. These macro tailwinds were outlined in the original DD and follow-up notes, nice to see them confirmed. This is why we entered the trade fairly early, to try and catch the downward macro movements. We were of course, too early, but things are starting to look bearish again and that's good for us of course.",

I think he pointed out correctly that Q1 (calendar quarter april through June) may disappoint, and April sales were weak across the industry. A lot of that data will go into the earnings call. What will be understated would be the impact of a big miss on top line and bottom line for fiscal year Q4 (which is calendar quarter Jan through March) we expect to be way low, if following the trend of PVH, HUGO, LULU. I also think this analyst isn't considering macro and greater china issues.\n\nI thinks pump-sell-off intraday holding pattern is there for a reason. Shareholders aren't buying in anticipation of the earnings call. When volume comes, it is to sell (see the technical chart I shared in another post today). Therefore, I think it's fair to assume that a bad miss + bad guidance is exactly what the market is anticipating (hence the existing holding pattern), and on confirmation of a bad earnings, the selloff should occur.\n\nSee below for article.\n\n\n\nRalph Lauren's Transformation Seen Spurring Upside EPS Surprises, UBS Says15:15:33 PM ET, 05/16/2024 - MT Newswires\n\n03:15 PM EDT, 05/16/2024 (MT Newswires) -- Ralph Lauren's (RL) transformation \"will lead to upside EPS surprises and drive stock price appreciation\" in the next 12 months,\n\nUBS Securities said Thursday in an earnings preview.\n\nThe company reduced exposure to weak accounts and brand dilutive channels, spurring prospects to drive more revenue in direct online and store channels, UBS said. Direct-to-consumer business may increase to 75% of the company's total in five years versus 59% before the pandemic, the report said.\n\nUBS raised the price target on Ralph Lauren to $250 from $244 and reiterated its buy rating. Fiscal Q4 results are due May 23.\n\nThe quarterly earnings probably won't be a \"big catalyst,\" while a weaker-than-anticipated fiscal Q1 outlook due to a slow April might hurt investor sentiment, UBS said.\n\n\"Options market pricing implies Ralph Lauren could move 8.3% in either direction over the event compared to its average 6.2% earnings day move,\" UBS said.\n\nSentiment seems bullish because the company is favored by investors and its price-to-earnings ratio is higher than both its five-year average and industry average, UBS said.\n\nRalph Lauren's stock has dropped versus S&P 500 recently amid concerns with prospects for a soft April performance, UBS said.\n\nUBS still raised annual EPS estimates through fiscal year 2027, partly because of web traffic growth in the US and internationally.\n\nRalph Lauren shares fell 0.8% in recent trading Thursday.\n\nPrice: 165.58, Change: -1.41, Percent Change: -0.84",

Five straight days of big green on the indexes. Still, RL is sitting in this range. Continues to give me confidence. Gotta set emotions side, more and more data comes in showing luxury weakness.\n\n  \n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/barclays-reveals-its-top-3-stocks-to-play-the-sector-right-now.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/barclays-reveals-its-top-3-stocks-to-play-the-sector-right-now.html) (not sure if you guys have inside access to CNBC, but here are the important notes).\n\n  \n\"Consumers, particularly those in China, have been tightening their purse strings and cutting their spending on luxury goods in light of macroeconomic uncertainties. But Barclays notes that several companies in the sector make good plays right now.\n\nThe MSCI Europe textiles, apparel and luxury index has fallen nearly 3% in the last month. Year-to-date, the index is up by nearly 5.8%, but has plunged by 8.6% in the last 12 months.\n\nReferencing data from the first-quarter Vogue survey of Chinese customers, Barclays noted that respondents continued to cut their spending on luxury goods, with 56% spending less that 22,500 Chinese yuan ($3,118.85) in the past quarter.\n\nWhile consumers’ spending intentions for the second quarter shows that they plan to spend more money on luxury, the investment bank’s analysts “remain cautious about the possibility of seeing improving trends.”\n\n  \nBTW the brands on that list are Moncler, LVMH, and Richemont. \n\n  \nFurther, Consumer spending for March was just released. Way below expectations, and the clear Q1 trend is decline.\n\n[https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/consumer-credit-52](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/consumer-credit-52)\n\n17 billion (jan) -> 15 billion (feb) -> 6 billion (march); Any of ya'll think April went up? Do you remember all that Israel/Iran shit during April and the bleeding markets?\n\nAs a final tidbid, I had $165P on Ralph Lauren that expired April 19th (this was from my last DD). At one point, it was down 80-85%. I held and closed at a 500% gain, in the money.\n\nDespite the low volume and the clear manipulation, fundamentals will come out. This is an earnings play. Gotta be patient.",

The market is just asleep on RL for now.\n\nI'll copy/paste some lines that'll help my RL bears through these challenging times;\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kering-shares-plunge-as-gucci-slowdown-seen-hitting-profits-by-up-to-45-3ee9d17c](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/kering-shares-plunge-as-gucci-slowdown-seen-hitting-profits-by-up-to-45-3ee9d17c)\n\n\"The Parisian company, which owns fashion brands including Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, said its “performance worsened considerably in the first quarter” due to “sluggish market conditions” which saw Gucci sales fall 21%. \"\n\nJust a reminder, RL gave fantastic guidance on February 8th 2024 (their last earnings call) based on year-end 2023 data and MAYBE a week or so of January 2024. It likely DID NOT account for the \"considerably worsened\" and \"sluggish market conditions\" that have impacted lux apparel spending that came a bit later in Q1.\n\n  \n\"Analysts from Stifel, led by Rogerio Fujimori, blamed a poor performance at Gucci for the slump in first quarter sales, as they said the Italian brand had failed to find a niche, particularly in Asia, as it is “not perceived as high-end enough or entry-price luxury.”\n\nIn a call with investors, Kering’s director of financial communications, Claire Voinnesson-Roblet, said the macroeconomic environment in China had created a situation in which Gucci products are not attractive to either wealthy customers or aspirational looking for “affordable products.” She noted certain high-end customers are looking for luxury goods as investments that will accrue in value.\"\n\nAs mentioned in my original DD, the \"China sales\" story is a big growth driver for RL. However, it's a challenging time right now even for noveau riche in China. If Gucci isn't selling, there's no fucking way RL - a quintessential AMERICAN luxury brand that's a tier or two below the designer houses - is selling.\n\n\"Shares in midmarket fashion house Burberry fell 3% on Wednesday having lost 57% of their value over the past 12 months after the company issued a series of profit warnings driven by slumping sales.\"",

Management said it expects a same-store-sales decline of around 1.6% to 3.6%, whereas the FactSet forecast called for a 0.6% dip in same-store sales.\n\nShares of Boot Barn (BOOT) fell 7% after hours.\n\n\"We expect the consumer to continue to be cautious for the foreseeable future,\" Boot Barn Chief Executive Jim Conroy said in a statement, though he noted that same-store sales at physical stores and online channels improved through April and May.\n\nDemand for clothing has been hurt by higher prices for food and other essentials that have narrowed shoppers' priorities. However, some data show a bump in interest in cowboy hats, cowboy boots and other Western wear, thanks to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Beyonce's new country album, \"Cowboy Carter.\"\n\nBoot Barn has tried to open more stores even as sales fall. It launched 18 new locations during its fiscal fourth quarter, taking it to a total of 400.\n\nDuring that period, Boot Barn's sales declined 8.7% year over year to $388.5 million, above the consensus analyst estimate of $385 million. Same-store sales fell 5.9%, not as bad as the 7.2% decline forecast by analysts.\n\nBoot Barn reported net income of $29.4 million, or 96 cents a share, for its fourth quarter. That was lower than net income of $46.4 million, or $1.53 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.\n\n-Bill Peters\n\nThis content was created by MarketWatch, which is operated by Dow Jones & Co.

I say flawed because it was fatally optimistic as it didn’t include the ensuing apparel turbulence we’ve seen in other apparel manufacturers that have disclosed softness in earnings and guidance since then. \n\nSo when RL specific data finally drops (either through an earnings pre-announcement or at the earnings call), it’ll be doubly bad.",

Still, however, even if the short term is green, the mid and long term will decline heavily. \n\nThis week may be a serious slog and test for everyone, if earnings in tech are still solid. It’ll prop the market up this week, but when more economic data comes in and competitors give poor guidance leading up to RL, we’ll see this thing below $140 for sure.",

It’s all ETF purchases and potentially HFs/MMs trying to shake the building bearish trade (the options I mentioned have exploded since I posted the DD).\n\nStay strong. Wait for bearish news. It will come. It sells off QUICKLY when institutions start paying attention to the new data that will be revealed by earnings misses, bad guidance, and thereafter, analyst downgrades.",
