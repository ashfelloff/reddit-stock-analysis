  "selftext": "I don't know what this sub has against NIO, probably the most guaranteed way to make money right now.\n\nFor the record my calls are 7c 10/18. I plan on rolling those into the future though.\n\nOk, let's start. NIO is still down almost 90% from it's ATH. NIO is not some no name, random company. It's here to stay. Sure it's had problems in the past, but it's trajectory is very similar to Tesla in a way... Where a small company was doubted over mistakes but began to grow rapidly.\n\n1) In 2024, NIO is estimated to deliver approximately 220,000 cars, generating $10 billion in revenue. Assuming no change in monthly deliveries, NIO could reach 240,000 vehicles at 20,000 per month. They are projected to sell 16,000 cars in January and February, then 20,000 per month for the remainder of the year, totaling 232,000 vehicles. FIREFLY, expected to enter the market in January 2025, is assumed to sell 5,000 cars monthly for six months, then 10,000 per month, reaching 90,000 by year-end.\n\nRevenue estimates:\n\nNIOâ€™s average revenue per car is $42,000, based on Q2 data (57,000 vehicles generating $2.4 billion), leading to $10 billion in total revenue for 2024.\nAssuming an average price of $27,000 per car (with a 5% sales promotion), could generate $6 billion on 232,000 vehicles.\nFIREFLY, at $20,000 per vehicle, would contribute $1.8 billion on 90,000 cars.\nTotal estimated revenue is around $18 billion. With improving gross margins and potential profitability, a P/S ratio of 3 would be reasonable for NIO, leading to a fair market valuation of $54 billion, or a target share price of $24.5 (based on 2.2 billion shares). These estimates donâ€™t account for global expansion, improved margins, reduced R&D costs, revenue from battery swap stations, or a potential partnership with a major German carmaker to address EU tariffs.\n\n2) **Citi raised Nio's price target to $8.90 from $7 and maintains a Buy rating, current price is $6.68, so that would be a 27% increase from here**, increasing volume estimates through 2026 based on sector trends. The firm also raised Nioâ€™s multiple due to the upcoming Tesla Robotaxi event and Q4 car sales season. Citi sees a near-term catalyst from Golden Week order intake, which could boost confidence in Nioâ€™s Firefly brand if successful.\n\n3) Nio announced it has secured RMB3.3 billion in investment from strategic investors, including Hefei Jianheng, for NIO. Nio will invest RMB10 billion and retain an 88.3% stake, with the remaining 11.7% held by the investors and other shareholders.\n\n4) Capital injection to boost the economy that everyone's been talking about.\n\nCAN YOU SAY MOON (cake)?",
