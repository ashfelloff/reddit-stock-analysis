  "title": "NVDA's Big Drop in Prices: The True Reason Behind the AI Chip Revolution",
  "score": 169,
  "selftext": "Recently, Anthropic, a small startup with funding 5-6 times smaller than OpenAI, launched their latest model, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with performance surpassing OpenAI's flagship GPT-4. Google also quickly released Gemini-1.5-Pro, which swiftly outperformed GPT-4-Turbo. Sounds interesting, but how is this related to NVIDIA? Simply put, both Google and Anthropic use Google's TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) chips to train both of these models. Shortly after OpenAI announced the \"divine\" GPT-4, Anthropic only began to release their first model, Claude-1, which was like a joke compared to the modern GPT-4. Google was even slower in launching Google Bard, later renamed Gemini 1.0, which became a meme, and everyone thought OpenAI would be unbeatable. OpenAI relied on expensive and power-hungry NVIDIA chips, spending $100 million and several years of training to launch an expensive GPT-4 model that most regular free users couldn't access. In less than a year, Anthropic and Google easily surpassed them, launching models superior to GPT-4 at a cost 10 times cheaper, with training costs also 10 times lower and only taking a few months.\n\nThe situation with general-purpose GPU chips for AI training is similar to using them for Bitcoin mining in 2014 - expensive, energy-consuming, and wastefully space-occupying, until Bitcoin difficulty increased to the point where NVIDIA GPUs became useless and ASIC Bitcoin miners emerged to replace them. Therefore, thinking that NVIDIA will monopolize the AI chip market is just the thinking of Wall Street traders who only know companies through Bloomberg articles and have no expertise in the field.\n\nThanks to NVIDIA's expensive and inefficient GPUs, a basic user paying $20/month can still only access GPT-4 in a limited and expensive way, while Google is providing FREE API access to their FLAGSHIP MODEL, Gemini-1.5-Pro. Remember that Claude 3.5 Sonnet isn't even the flagship model, but just an inexpensive mid-tier model. Claude 3.5 Opus will be released and it will surpass GPT-4.5 or even GPT-5 thanks to NOT USING NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pj8ia6qd5v7d1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=bcd49cc4ebd859cada3333eb678956372cc8484e\n\n",

Yes its true ASML nect gen High NA EUV currently has its problems (baking wafers etc...) But ASML always finds a solution and they also teamed up with Intel under Gelsinger leadership (the guy who basically invented x86)...

I know the topic, so if something is off or wrong, I either correct it or dismiss whatever part is has said incorrectly. The LLM demonstrably knew a series topic pretty well here—with decent, useable feedback:\n\n[Here's an example of the process](https://poe.com/s/cZAFEciT6Ou9MXEUkBcN)\n\nIt helped greatly in developing a comprehensive and insightful response to the given story topic. I was able to quickly respond to a Reddit post about a narrative series topic, and it easily got double the most upvotes of anyone from the thread. A large majority of the people looking at the thread liked the response I had done using extensive LLM assistance.\n\nLLMs demonstrably can analyze given texts, as my example clearly shows. The prompt I provided, and the resulting approval from the niche Subreddit community following that given thread, is a perfect example of how these models can analyze complex narrative contexts, understand intricate character motivations, and generate coherent, nuanced content that resonates with a *knowledgeable audience.*\n\n—It analyzed the given context about Elaine's background and extrapolated how her experiences as Kaiser would have shaped her character. It demonstrated an understanding of the psychological transformation required to go from a failed Princess candidate to a ruthless ruler, all while maintaining consistency with the established lore of the Tower of God universe.\n\nThis isn't just simple text prediction; it's a sophisticated analysis of character development, societal structures, and the long-term consequences of traumatic experiences. The model showed an ability to draw logical conclusions based on given information and expand on themes in a way that was deemed valuable by the community.\n\nYour dismissal of these capabilities as \"bs hype\" is not just misguided; it's again: willfully ignorant. You're either working with severely outdated models or you're fundamentally misunderstanding how to utilize these tools effectively. The fact that you can't see the analytical capabilities demonstrated in this example suggests a serious lack of expertise in the field you claim to work in.",

Based on the linked example from before (its analysis of a series character and series lore)—Elaine's transformation into Kaiser and how it ironically fulfilled the Princess archetype was a novel synthesis of information, not a regurgitation of existing content. \n\nThis type of in-depth character analysis and exploration of the psychological impacts of the Princess system is not something found in Tower of God (series) discussions, for it to be common training set material. The level of detail and nuanced understanding demonstrated in connecting Elaine's failed Princess candidacy to her later ruthless behavior as Kaiser is original thinking, not simply *rehashing existing ideas.*\n\nThe analysis draws connections between distinct elements of the story—the Princess selection process, Elaine's upbringing, her failure in the selection, and her subsequent reign as Kaiser—in a way that provides new insights into the character and the world-building. \n\nAgain, the[ LLM-assisted comment response](https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofGod/comments/18rewfj/comment/kf1qtkb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) based on that sort of topic received strong positive feedback from the series-following community who read through that thread, indicating that the analysis resonated as both accurate to the source material as well as being meaningful. If this were simply **regurgitated content from the training set**, it's unlikely it would have been so well-received by knowledgeable fans. The LLM demonstrated an ability to integrate information, draw original connections, and provide insights that even dedicated followers found valuable and accurate. This level of analysis and creativity goes far beyond simple pattern matching or recitation of training data, or asking it to make a silly, useless list of 8 words that start with the letter \"hoa\".",
