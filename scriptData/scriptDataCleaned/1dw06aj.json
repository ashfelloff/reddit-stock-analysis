              "body": "If you’re asking how the Yen lost so much value, it is because The Bank of Japan (their version of the Fed) has refused to raise interest rates, while the rest of the world has raised rates. Money is leaving Japan to earn higher yields in bonds denominated in other currencies, which strengthens those currencies since it creates a demand for them, and weakens the Yen since those people are selling their Yen to purchase those foreign bonds.\n\nTo simplify, people are selling their Yen bond holdings to purchase bonds overseas to earn a higher return.\n\nThe Yen is actually weaker than the current exchange rate but isn’t reflected because the Bank of Japan is using its foreign currency reserves to buy back Yen, keeping it afloat. Once they run out reserves and assuming global rates stay high, Japan will either experience stagflation or their government will need to cut spending as they service a far higher interest expense on their debt.\n\nRight now the Bank of Japan is gambling that the rest of the world will either cut rates or a global recession will happen to force rates down, before they run out of reserves. If it doesn’t happen, the average Japanese’s standard of living is going to fall - as they import more than they export, and have many internal issues like an aging population, to deal with.",

          "body": "So am I being a daft here but does the article not make a huge amount of sense. It goes on about not gambling on FX and recommending hedging against currency based on it being impossible to know what the movements in FX can be.\n\nHowever hedging against currency is a form of speculation as you are betting that the yen depreciates against the dollar and therefore your hedge protects you. If you don’t hedge then you are betting the dollar depreciates against the yen, so either way you are gambling on FX moves. \n\nThe only known fact is that it’s more expensive to hedge than to not hedge. So if you really believe that FX is impossible to predict as the article suggests then the only logical route to take is not to hedge as it is the only guarantee to save you money via lower fees.

I feel the article is off and that Buffet hedged because he saw that the yen was going to slide vs the dollar as opposed to taking a completely neutral stance on it.\n\nBut I get it that if you purely want to protect against fx both ways then you hedge and take the fees.",
