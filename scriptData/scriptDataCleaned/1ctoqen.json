              "body": "Yes and no, they didn't do it until last year so *all of* the data from 2005 - 2023 was already scrapped and used for training.  That's about 99% of the content already been consumed and hoovered up.  But yes, there's been some new content since 2023 but it's a drop in the bucket compared to past content.\n\nThe formal API is now shut down but you can still scrape it publicly, especially if you're now just frontfilling in the new data from 2023-onward. It's just a little bit more work and bandwidth, but still easy to do. Remember when OpenAI created transcription bots to scrape YouTube videos and transcribe them for training data, so they didn't have to pay Google for their official transaction API? Same thing\n\nBut anyways I think it's kinda moot since they already put a price on it: $60 million is a drop in the bucket for any corporation, like a rounding error. So anyone who wants it can pay what is basically couch pennies for it",
