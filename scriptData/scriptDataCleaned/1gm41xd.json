  "selftext": "Taiwan’s technology protection rules prohibits Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC, 台積電) from producing 2-nanometer chips abroad, so the company must keep its most cutting-edge technology at home, Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo (郭智輝) said yesterday.\n\nTaiwanese law limits domestic chipmakers to producing chips abroad that are at least one generation less advanced than their fabs at home. TSMC told investors in July its next-generation A-16 chip is to enter volume production in the second half of 2026, after ramping up production of 2-nanometer chips next year.\n\nhttps://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/11/08/2003826545",

Watching people think Taiwan will just outsource their silicon shield to AZ is laughable.  \n\nThe future of military advantage is an AI empowered advantage, and if the US wants to keep that edge they need to both go through, and protect Taiwan.

The only news I read is that Broadcom said the Chip is not ready for mass production, and it said that a year before the mass production and at least 1.5 years before the foundry business will start taking clients' designs. AWS and 2 other clients have already partnered with Intel foundry.",

AWS and whoever else is probably just taping out a small test chips to determine Intel’s tech and yield. Intel is most likely letting them do it for free too.\n\nThe 1.5 year number you quoted tells the story. Chips taping out today at TSMC N3 node would have selected N3 at the beginning of their design cycle 1.5-2 years ago. If Intel is not ready today no one is designing chips based on 18A today.  No production chip will gamble on a node that’s not ready. By the time Intel is ready in 1.5 years, if they ever get ready, they will then have to convince costumer to select 18A for their next design which means best case they’ll have some volume another 2 years after that. Reality will be by then TSMC N2 will be online and Intel will again struggle to keep up.",
