  "selftext": "Shares of Nvidia fell 9.5% today as the market frets about slowing progress in AI. The result was a decline of $278 billion, which is the worst ever market cap wipeout from a single stock in a day.\n\nThere were worries last week after earnings but shares of Nvidia steadied after nearly a dozen price target boosts from analysts. But that would only offer a temporary reprieve as a round of profit-taking hit today and snowballed.\n\nhttps://www.forexlive.com/news/the-drop-in-nvidia-shares-today-is-the-largest-ever-destruction-of-market-cap-20240903/amp/\n\n",

I‚Äôve tried to weave them in a way that aligns with the broader theme of commitment and strength in your relationship, while keeping the vows sincere and meaningful.\n\n‚Äî\n\n**[Partner‚Äôs Name],**\n\nFrom the moment we met, I knew my life would never be the same. You brought light, laughter, and a sense of completeness I had never known before. Today, standing here with you, I feel the deepest sense of gratitude and joy for the journey we‚Äôve shared and for the future we are about to embark on together.\n\nAs Stalin once said, ‚ÄúIt is not heroes that make history, but history that makes heroes.‚Äù In you, I have found the hero of my own story, someone who transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, and who stands by my side as we create our own history, together.\n\nI vow to love you with all that I am, to honor and cherish you through all the highs and lows life may bring. I promise to support your dreams and to stand by your side as we build our life together, piece by piece, day by day.\n\nIn the words of Mussolini, ‚ÄúIt is better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep.‚Äù With you, I choose to live boldly, courageously, and with purpose. Together, we will face whatever comes our way, embracing both the challenges and the triumphs with strength and resolve.\n\nI will listen to you with an open heart, speak to you with kindness and respect, and care for you with unwavering devotion. I promise to create a home filled with laughter, love, and warmth, where we can both grow as individuals and as partners.\n\nThrough the joys and challenges, I will be your biggest advocate, your closest friend, and your truest companion. I will hold your hand as we navigate life‚Äôs uncertainties and celebrate our triumphs.\n\nI choose you today and every day, not just as my love, but as my partner, my confidant, and my best friend. I promise to love you fiercely, faithfully, and forever, from this day forward, until the end of our days.\n\n‚Äî\n\nPlease keep in mind that using these quotes can evoke strong reactions due to the historical context surrounding Stalin and Mussolini. If you‚Äôre certain this is the direction you want to take, these vows reflect the strength and commitment you wish to express while incorporating the quotes as requested.",
