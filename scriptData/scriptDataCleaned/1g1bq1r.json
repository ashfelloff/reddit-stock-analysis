Indeed, Tesla's whole event had a 2014 vibe, except that in 2014 there were no automated vehicles actually deployed on public roads. Now there are real AVs carrying real people on real roads, but none of them are Teslas. Tonight did not change this reality; it only made the irony more glaring.\"\n\n\"The big open question about Tesla is just the software is so far behind where the rest of the industry is today.\"\n\n\"The Cybercab demos were conducted on a movie set in a well-controlled environment, and were very similar to a slow & short amusement park ride. Waymo is now hosting 100K rides per week in major cities, so we expected more from Tesla's demo.\"\n\nWith TSLA being down today, looks like no one believes they can deliver this product.",

Stealing someone else's satellite launch business isn't inventing. I know his stans are too low-IQ to understand that, but hopefully if it's repeated enough times it'll sink in.",

He is far from unskillful\n\nHe is not really an engineer nor anything else but its true skill  lie on 2 things\n\n1 - he find and hire people with good and clever idea. And he fund them.\n\n2 - he understand the physics behind ( due to its curriculum in science), so he can make very good decision of the general picture. For example starship is made of stainless steel. we dont make rocket in steel because its heavy.\nBut it s cheap and it can take a plasma without a scratch. So he made the decision to remove the thermal protection to gain in weight. The engineer of spacex found a way to put a cooling system moreover. So basically starship is A super cheap rocket\n\nThere is few people that can do both when they are leading high cost project like that.\n\nYes he is horrible human but credit has to be given.",
