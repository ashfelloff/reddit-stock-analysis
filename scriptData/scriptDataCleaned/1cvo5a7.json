Nvidia has constantly been in the news for being high performing, selling out left right and center.\n\nThe story for most people I know not holding nvidia is because they sold thinking they were at a peak after years of huge runs they thought the luck was out yet its still printing, anyone who didn't buy Nvidia themselves earlier or at that time can only blame themselves for not reading the front page of the news it wasnt some hidden underperforming stock lmao.\n\nThe 1 place they don't seem to be touching yet is quantum so I got some IBM for that, and maybe atom computing if they ever go public as im thinking thats the next wave nvidia might miss out on but who knows",

Gamers bought their cards but I knew full well a company worth their salt will utilize their abilities in whatever market they see they can make a profit in. Nvidia being the go to for their quality and abilities I figured with the world moving more and more tech based that the company would likely at least do well in that area (gaming and niche markets), but I can genuinely say, I didn’t expect them to do this well. \n\nHow I found them: I got into casually playing games through coworkers talking about them. I bought the Xbox 360 and soon after the Xbox one when it released. Didn’t like the idea I was around $1,000 in total between the 2 and accessories and thought about long term always having to spend more to obtain the same result. Functional console that can run the new games. Coworker mentioned I could build a PC and just make upgrades to it as times changed instead of buying a new system. We talked about parts etc and when it came to graphics cards he basically stated nvidia is the only way to go (respectfully I understand there are competitors especially nowadays) so I thought, well if there’s a single major company everyone uses it must be good, and it must be worth it. This is a huge and growing industry… *buys shares bi-weekly* \nStill yet to build a PC… idk. Maybe I’ll take some profits and do that as a commemorative, but then I’m just losing future profits…",

I watched them show up to the GPU party and absolutely dominate.  They got ahead of everyone else on day one and stayed there for many years.

There were plenty of established companies in the computer graphics space (Matrox, ATI, S3, Diamond Multimedia, etc.) and in just a few years Nvidia crushed most of them.\n\nI became so loyal to Nvidia I didn't even consider buying from anyone else.  I was in IT at the time, so I got to see just how crappy everyone else was in comparison.

I thought to myself, what is stopping them from making other types of chips in addition to the gaming chips which I thought would increase as well as games became more and more popular. I was sold when I saw a YouTube video of Jensen talking at a university in the mid 2000s about Ray Tracing and how it’s going to be the next big thing in gaming, 10-12 years before it actually started to show up in games. He would also talk about advanced computing and things like that. I thought to myself if he was way ahead of the curve for ray tracing and practically spoke it into existence, then he might not just be blowing smoke out of his ass when it came to other uses of chips like advanced computing and would probably be prepared for it just like ray tracing. Didn’t think all the advanced computing and AI would come as quick as it did but here we are.
