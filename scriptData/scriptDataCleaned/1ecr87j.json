It's not DD based on fundamentals, it's just technicals. The fundamentals for chip makers ( especially market leaders such as NVDA ) remain the same and remain positive. So I'm only looking at the technical aspect here, because the fundamentals haven't changed, yet.\n\nThis is the daily chart for $SMH, the semiconductors index ( chip makers ) ETF.  \nSemiconductors formed a double top in early July. A bearish technical structure that often indicates more downside is ahead.  \nDouble tops form all the time, but unless they're confirmed they're usually harmless.\n\nA double top is confirmed when price closes below the neckline ( the purple line ). This happened on July 17th. As soon as that happens we can extrapolate a full measured move. It's basically a price target that's equal to the distance between the top and the neckline. ( the vertical blue line you see is the full measured move )  \nIf you take that distance and you place it below the neckline you get the downside target for this technical structure.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have hit this downside target.\n\nA similar but slightly different bearish structure also formed when chip stocks topped in March-April. It wasn't a double top, but a slightly different variation. That looks like a spike, then an inverted cup. The spike represents euphoria and the inverted cup represents buyers trying to get going again to crack through the highs, but failing to get momentum going and eventually they give up and sell and it results in a sharp sell off and a bottom. Chip stocks also bottomed right around the full measured move down from the neckline back then. And it's happening again.\n\nThis will sound a lot like meaningless mumbo jumbo reading tea leaves or astrology.  In reality technical analysis works for two main reasons.  \n1- It's just a representation of investor sentiment and psychology. Just like an ECG is a chart of your heartbeat.  \nThere's no fortune telling, there's no clairvoyance. It's just putting market psychology in defined, measurable numbers on a chart.  \n2- It works because everyone uses the same concepts. Just like I saw this double top and full measured move, every technical analyst at every big bank will have seen the same thing and came to the same conclusion.\n\nI plan to build an aggressive position once an S&P 500 bottom is confirmed. We're getting very close here, probably just days away. I don't want to buy any chip stock until the S&P 500 bottoms. So for now, just waiting patiently.",
