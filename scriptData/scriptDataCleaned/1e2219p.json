  "selftext": "Apples uptrend still remains pretty consistent despite yesterday’s dump and todays EOD sell off. Still managing to hold at the 230 seen on Wednesday while others reset to prices from 1-2 weeks ago. Compare to TSLA, AMZN, NVDA, etc. \n\nHow bullish are you guys feeling on AAPL specifically? Do you think it’s an outlier among the rest with the good news on next gen iPhone orders, along with upcoming earnings on August 1st? Even if the rest see a bit more of a pullback next week is it possible Apple can hold/consistently uptrend?\n\nI’m expecting a bit of a bearish week but remaining optimistically bullish on Apple. ",

I did do just that with TSLA calls when it dropped but sold when it popped (I keep those shares LT, too.) I’m up to my allocation for now, and am going to hold back buying power after I sell the gazillion contracts I hold, going into the fall.

The services revenue is reportedly showing an increase from last quarter revenue. Also reported is an increase from the expected iPhone 16 shipments from 80m to 90m. Also reported is an uptick in new laptop and ipad sales. You can search for these news reports....I have read a few but do not have the links handy. There is a company called Sensor Tower that reports services numbers. Benzinga has an article last week regarging this. \n\n**Overall....THIS IS IMPORTANT:** If you are invested or trading AAPL it is critical you upgrade your phone. The only thing that will make APPL move is...i**ncreased iphone 16 sales** followed by laptops, ipads and wearables. Save up some money and buy a new iphone  16 in September.
