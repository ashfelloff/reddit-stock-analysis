All of a sudden, posts on X for the first time in 3 years and sends the stock 300% in a day. I would not be surprised the Friday before he tweeted. He bought 33 million dollars worth of fd's knowing what would happen, giving gamestop the ability to offer at the top with all the new found retail liquidity. Then, on top of it, gamestop sells a billion dollars in shares. I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't get charged by the sec for this one. Might even take gamestop down with him on the way out.  It was a nice story going 50k to 33 million, but this shit is just greed.",
