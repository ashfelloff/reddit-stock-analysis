  "selftext": "The \"vast majority\" of Federal Reserve officials said the central bank would likely cut interest rates in September—while several saw a case to slash rates last month, according to minutes from the policy meeting in late July released on Wednesday.\n\nWhy it matters: It's the clearest indication yet the Fed is on track to cut interest rates next month for the first time since 2020 as worries about the health of the economy mount.\n\nWhat they're saying: The lion's share of Fed officials \"observed that, if the data continued to come in about as expected, it would likely be appropriate to ease policy at the next meeting,\" the minutes from the policy meeting held July 30-31 read.\n\nThe intrigue: At that meeting, the Fed unanimously voted to hold rates at a range between 5.25% to 5.5%, the highest level in two decades.\n\n",

We dont need lower rates to stimulate the economy atm. the economy is still going strong.\n\nbut looping back around, one of the reasons to lower interest rates is to help the consumers on things like Mortgage, car loans, etc. But as we have seen in the past, lower borrowing rates doesnt mean lower prices on housing, car, etc. these high prices are almost for sure to stay. if anything, it'll just drop a little.\n\ngenerally speaking, lower rates = inflation. we just got out of insane inflation. i dont think lowering the rates right now is good thing to do. and it just feels like the Feds are just trying to sooth the public.\n\nlastly, if we DO get into a recession after lowering rates, we are kinda doubly screwed. lowering rates is one of the best (and almost ONLY) counter measures the feds has against inflation, recession, etc.\n\nso all in all, i just feel like the Feds are lowering rates just to please the public. basically \"we were able to raise the rates for this long. its time to \"give back\" a bit to make them happy\".\n\nyou can already see a bit of this on /r/stocks. everyones happy only because this means their stocks will most likely be going up more now.",

But people are thinking that that once interest rates go down, housing prices will stay what they are currently at. Or maybe even hopefully go down a bit. all in hopes of them being able to buy a home. But i really dont think they will be going down organically. if they DO go down, it'll be due to things like unforeseen oversupply (which i doubt will happen).",

(or both)\n\n1. inflation cools off, prices will drop again. (some of the people think this will be true for the housing market)\n\n2. with interest rates being cut, prices will drop again.
