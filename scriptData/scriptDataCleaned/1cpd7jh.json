It's kind of insane to think we'll rebuild our entire infrastructure to support fully electric cars, the cost would be absolutely insane, nearing on impossible. But people don't seem to want hybrids. Everyone calling the prious gay pretty much killed hybrids, kinda like rollerblading lol.\n\nAs far as motorcycles go, yes they would be a net lower cost but there's a very practical reason motorcycles aren't the main form of transportation. I considered a motorcycle myself for efficiency reasons but I still need a car or truck to do actual activities or to actually move things. A motorcycle is really good at moving one or two people around, but I'd have to make pretty much daily trips to the grocery store etc etc. That combined with the very high likelihood that some old lady is gonna run me over in her full sized suv means I don't want a motorcycle lol.
