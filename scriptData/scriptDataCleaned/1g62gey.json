If you look at Nobody Wants This, for example, easy to mistake it as a show geared at women. But it clearly is a Romcom built to be watched by *couples*, which is why it blew up. When I talk to pretty much any of my couples friends that don’t have a shared interest in some aspect of pop culture, their “couples show” is either the HBO Prestige TV show airing at the time or something on Netflix. Similarly, Netflix is remaking Hallmark movies - but understanding that they are not just women’s programming, they are for *young* women and families as well, to watch together. \n\nNetflix imo really does a better job than anyone else at making 4-quadrant TV shows. If everyone in the house is watching Wednesday as a family, that is what makes it way more indispensable in households than a hit like Peacemaker.",
