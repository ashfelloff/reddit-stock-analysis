Either Trump or Harris will be president for the next 4 years (predicting who is a game for others). Trump isn't going to have someone like Lina Kahn in charge of the FTC. I think that Harris will be swayed by a lot of her CA contacts to not have Kahn in (or at least have the FTC allow mergers in the mega tech space). Either way GOOG will be able to acquire companies that it wants to acquire. \n\nAI and machine learning in general is a kinda fun tool for computer pattern recognition though comes with it's own costs (computationally expensive). But AI isn't going to replace search or anything like that. \n\nContinued relative global stability (hope I don't eat my words on this) is probably good for GOOG. Growth in EM (not China, I more so mean Africa, India, SE Asia, and Lat-AM) means more users and more ad revenue. These markets might also benefit a bit from US, EU, and Chinese decreased direct trade as that trade then goes through some of these economies. \n\nI think that almost all of these same points can be made for the US tech sector in general.\n\nEdit: I should say that I don't really adjust my holdings based on this. I treat financial news as a gauge of expectations. Also it is really easy to see when we are at a big low.",

          "body": "Now down to -1.5% post earnings call. Always drops every time Ruth says they are going to keep investing in the business (read: spend a shitton on CapEx), which she loves to say. Any speculative drop because of that tonight/tomorrow will probably be recouped pretty quickly. Anyway, I don’t see what’s too wrong with spending on CapEx instead of piling up more cash, and if they do overspend, they can use that compute in other ways too. It somewhat just becomes a pull-forward of spend.\n\nOverall, not a super impressive Youtube quarter (compared to expectations about the market) but everything else did wonderfully. I think Google will have another good quarter of returns between now and the next one. I also think the US election craze may help Youtube this next quarter.",
