Execs looked like they were gonna be toast and the company was going to be bankrupt after Covid tanked oil prices\n\nThey went to buffet, to get $10B in cash (in pref stock paying 8%). Buffet made her pay for it tho lol but again- this is before we knew interest rates were gonna skyrocket and an 8% return on cash is still a little pricy but not as bad as originally thought‚Ä¶\n\nThey got really lucky though because the Russia invasion skyrocket oil prices, and now suddenly the permasian basin bet paid off\n\nLike multiple things happened in their favor. I think getting that much control over the basin in the US is ideally a good move, but it is super risky to buy a company that big at an inflated price.
