  "selftext": "Inflows to VOO look set to smash records as observers predict it will soon overtake SPY to become the biggest\n\nVanguard has deposed its rival BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, from its position as manager of the second-largest exchange traded fund in the world.\n\nIn a rare setback for the fund giant, BlackRock’s iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) has been overtaken by Vanguard’s equivalent S&P 500 ETF (VOO), which had assets of $540.76bn at Friday’s close, according to data from Morningstar, marginally ahead of IVV’s $540.66bn.\n\n“I expect VOO to catch SPY and become the largest ETF in the world in 2025, or 2026, at the latest,” Bryan Armour, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar added. “VOO is set to smash the single-year inflows record, having already pulled in $85bn this year. In contrast, SPY has seen $5bn in outflows. The $125bn gap between the two ETFs [VOO and SPY] has shrunk to under $50bn in 2024. Were that pace to continue, VOO would easily be crowned king in 2025.”\n\n[**Financial Times**](https://www.ft.com/content/3067c4ce-8d0e-4307-8b1a-a7edd21639ff)\n",
