A 1-2% allocation does not move the needle too much, especially if its an ETF (Bitcoin is a special case).\n\nAs it stands I just think there's too many holdings, yet many of the holdings are doing very similar things, so it's \"over-diversified\" by definition.",

          "body": "Hey its great to hear your getting into investing. I got my degree in finance and have been a portfolio manager for the last decade at several large US banks. Hopefully I can help with some of the basics. Building wealth and financial security is a lot like getting health. You Get healthy by eating right and getting exercise and doing that simple stuff for a long time. Finance and investing is the same thing. Make a regular monthly contribution, reinvest your dividend, and do that for a long time. \n\n\nGetting started those are the most important habits to build. As for diversification it's very easy these days. Go check out VOO or SPY they are S&P500 index funds. They are in an ETF which means you just buy and sell them like stock. They own the 500 largest companies in the US. It's a very easy way to get a diversified portfolio in just one investment. That will get you the market return and do the heavy lifting for you as far as returns go. A really good start is to set up a monthly contribution to buy one of those funds automatically and reinvest the dividends through a dividend reinvestment plan. Just focus on that for a while and let it grow for the next 5 years. \n\n\nI typically don't encourage individual stock picking for new investors because it usually doesn't help grow long term wealth for new investors. It can be fun for sure but I'd recommend getting the basics down so you have a strong financial foundation. ",

It includes a 2055 target retirement date fund and an S&P 500 index fund. They are both allocated 50% of that portfolio. Basically I want a somewhat slower glide path and to be slightly over allocated to equities because I'm in my 30s and still have lots of time. My other portfolio is a swing trading portfolio. I hold these names for 3 months and then rebalance. This portfolio is a momentum portfolio. It is equally weighted across the following stocks:\nCVLT, FICO, GDDY, HWM, IESC, IRM, NRG, PIPR, QTWO, SFM, SPXC, and VST. \nThe momentum portfolio is where I pick stocks and try and beat the market. I have a set of rules I follow to pick the stocks and I stick to the rules. ",

So if you were doing it today you would take the returns from September 2023 through August 2024. Then you rank them by the highest return. The reason you skip the most recent month is because momentum reverses on the short term and those names will basically pull back before moving higher again. For std deviation I use the daily return and then just use the excel function. \n\n\nMy process is using yahoo finance and a python script to pull down the daily closing prices for all of my stocks (I asked chatgpt to write it and it took 5 minutes). I have my script create a csv file and then I copy and paste that into my excel file that does the grading with formulas and macros. \n\n\nThe portfolio I posted was rebalanced on August 28th and is up 6.7% compare dto the S&P being up about 1.35% over the same time. That's why I do all this extra work. There are some other options that are good like AQR's large cap momentum fund and alpha architect's QMOM etf. Both have strong returns the trade off is higher volatility. In September my portfolio lost 7% before it was up almost the same 7% meaning we moves almost 15% in 4 weeks. ",

So I think we might see some more pain before any relief.  This is a momentum stock which just inherently has more volatility. One of the things with momentum is to remember that it tends to reverse in the short term. In August the stock was up almost 30%. For it to sell off and give some of that back isn't completely unreasonable. You can also see that behavior in the chart where it goes up a couple months and then pulls back then goes up a couple months and pulls back.  The final thing I'm looking at here is just that it's September which is a bad month for stocks generally and the whole market is down (not as bad as IESC but generally everything is down).  The other thing I kind of think back to was owning super micro last year. It's wipsawed all over the place but was the best performer in my portfolio in 2023.  My plan for this name is to watch the retest see if we can hold the 125 to 135 level and then rally back. I think we do get a rate cutting cycle starting this month that will take some of the pressure off of the market and when we see that and the risk on trade I think we will rally back. It's a tough ride though.\n\n\nEdit: I'd also say that the fundamentals are still strong and have been improving which is really what drives values long term. Finally, the sell off is on no news and I think that is telling. ",

Then I sort by 12 month returns (I use the traditional 12-1 return which is just the return over the last 12 months but you exclude the most recent month because short term momentum tends to reverse). I take the top 10% of those stocks and look at the smoothness of the return profile (ratio of days with positive returns compared to days with a negative return) and then standard deviation of the daily returns. I have a scorecard that ranks those top 10% and then I build a diversified portfolio where I try not to have to many stocks in the same sector and to have a beta that is pretty normal. My typically holding period is 3 months and I rebalance in the months ahead of quarter ending months because momentum typically is strongest in quarter ending months. I will look to cut a position early once it is 10% below but that is on a discretionary basis. The last name I cut like that was crowdstrike after it shutdown half the economy because it was clear that their run was over. Generally I don't cut names when the overall market is down at the same time. If you cut a name you rerun the selection process to replace it. ",

Traditionally momentum is determined by looking at the return over the last 12 months excluding the most recent month. So if you were doing a screen today you would look at the return from August 2023 through July 2024. You rank your stocks and look at the top 10% of returns. Those are your stocks to pick from. I throw out anything that has a weird return profile. Sometimes you get a biotechnology or something that jumps 100% overnight because of a drug approval or something like that. Any of those are out. Then I try and make a balanced portfolio. I shoot to hold 15 stocks but at least 10. I've got a couple open slots to fill right now. \n\n\nGenerally I don't like technical analysis because indicators are backwards looking. Additionally, the technicals that you can learn publicly are typically bad and dont work. Momentum is a forward looking indicator. I say that because of the research on momentum (it is a big topic in academic papers) that shows that stocks in the top of all returns tend to continue to do well. It's one of the few ways that accurately predicts future returns. It's not perfect but it does give you an edge. ",

I’m 24 and decided that it is a must and hearing about what’s been going on this week, I decided it was a good time to begin. Other times, I would hear good news especially with this AI bubble but didn’t want to buy high. I want to feel confident, but the truth is my investments are led only by gut feelings, and keeping up vaguely with news and culture. So I have put $820 in stocks. I don’t know if that’s a lot or a little. For me it’s a decent starting point, a little bit out of my comfort zone tbh considering I have never done this before. \n\n\nHere comes the hard part. I’m nervous about sharing my investments because I’m scared all you smart people will yell at me. Well maybe it will be a good thing to get me on the right track. \n\n\nMy main goal is long term growth. \n\n\nI put $300 into intel at $18. I figured it has to stabilize, people will always need CPUs. Their layoffs seem to be those ESG “diversity” hires rather than tech ppl. It seems like they are cutting to be stronger. Anyway, that’s $300 in intel. \n\n\nI put $200 in Microsoft at $403 I think. Everyone’s saying Microsoft is a good long term investment. \n\n\nI put $100 in Nike at around $74. I figured Nike will stabilize, just knowing its reputation and cultural standing. \n\n\nI put $100 in Boeing for $168/share. I figured Boeing is one of 2 major airplane manufacturers and a lot of defense engineering so it should do well. \n\n\nI put $100 in s&p (SPY) I think it’s an ETF. Because that’s a good long term bet right? \n\n\nI also put $500 and started a Roth IRA. \n\n\nSo.. did I do okay?",

          "body": "I agree with everyone on here suggesting that you put almost all of the money in SPY and just make regular contributions. It’s basically impossible to be “good at investing” by consistently picking winners. Just take that steady index-fund return and then—and this is the hard part—be patient. \n\nAlso, there is one fool-proof way to increase your portfolio—one secret method that works 100% of the time without ever failing. Here’s the secret: SAVE MORE MONEY. You’re only 24. That means that as you get older, you’ll almost certainly start earning more money. Make yourself a promise that you won’t let your lifestyle increase as fast as your salary does. So when you get that raise and start making $100 more per month, maybe only increase your lifestyle by $75/mo—then put the additional $25/mo into the market. When you eventually make $1000 more per month, maybe set aside even more and save $400 more per month.\n\nFinally, I’ll say this:  Although trying to pick individual stocks is a BAD investment idea, we can all agree that it’s more fun than passively investing in index funds like SPY. So it’s fine to take 10% or even 20% of your total portfolio and try to pick individual winners. Just be disciplined enough to limit it to that small portion of your portfolio, and rebalance your portfolio each year if you’ve picked successfully enough that your individual stocks are more than 20% of your portfolio. I find that by giving myself a small percentage of my portfolio to gamble with in this way, I end up saving more because I want to have the chance to pick another winner. But keep it to less than 20%!\n\nGood luck! You’re way ahead of most people your age if you’re already saving something.",

I have nothing to say about boeing as i’m not familiar with it, which I should also say: never invest in companies you aren’t familiar with. Since you are young and doing this for the long term just dump more money into s&p. If you have a job and are making income, set a certain amount aside to put into your portfolio.

          "body": "Hey its great that your starting early! Investing for long term growth is the right way to think about it. I'm a Portfolio Manager at a Bank and I manage a little over a billion in assets for the bank. Here is what I tell people about Investing: the most important thing is time. Your 24 this is a great time to start because the money you invest has a whole lifetime to grow. The S&P 500 averages 10 to 12% per year (that's the SPY etf you bought). When you have a small portfolio (less than a few 100k) you don't need to worry about picking stocks. Most of the research says that even professionals don't beat the S&P 500 consistently. As a 24 year old who is just learning I would recommend just sticking with the SPY ETF, making a monthly contribution to buy more, and earning the market return. There is a good youtube channel called the Money Guy Show and they have done the math and basically the dollars you invest in the S&P 500 or the Market will end up being worth 83 dollars when you retire. So you put 1 dollar into SPY now and you get 83 back later. Good places to do this are in a roth or traditional 401k if you have one through work or a ira through like fidelity. You don't need to be a geart investor when you can earn the market average return by just buying SPY every month and getting 83x your investment back. Right now your focus has to be on adding dollars to the account through regular savings. On a 1,000 dollar investment even if you were a great investor and earned 100% per year you would only make 1,000 so focus on building that habit of just putting in some every month for now. Focus on an ETF like SPY (which owns the 500 largest companies in the US including all the names you bought individually so you still get those good investment even if you just own SPY). The next thing I would tell you is that the day to day stuff doesn't matter in long term Investing. 35 years ago the DOW 30 index traded for 2500 bucks today its at 40k. It doesn't matter that there was the 2008 crisis or that there was COVID or that there have been wars or scares. Your buying today to earn that return in 35 years. Another great option is a target date retirement fund which are pretty typical in 401k plans where they manage the portfolio for you. \n\n\nIf your just doing it on your own you can buy SPY every month until you have 100k saved and then go get a financial planner to help you after that. ",

However, how tolerant are you to risk and what's yours future goals, are the questions?\nBeing 24, you can have higher % in growth stocks and chasing higher return (with higher risk) and slowly reducing risk as you grow older.\nAsset allocation is probably one of most important things that you set up at start and then stay with it rebalancing yearly or so if it gets out of proportions (stocks going wild etc).\n\nAll the best and remember, dyor",

Owning SPY to own the 500 best/ biggest stocks is America is not a bubble.

That 10% gain when you have 100k is an extra 10k but when your at 1million it's an extra 100k. It's not a straight line path.

Still the same 5 or 10%. Just something that balances out your exposure to those 3 names. \n\n\nHope that helps.",

RLC would be better, but why have either when you can have oil. Get some XOM or OXY, which is on sale right now. \nIf you haven’t seen my post on DXCM, it’s a fire sale right now with 30% upside.

          "body": "Hey I took a look at your portfolio. I get the whole trying to manage across a couple different accounts but it's good to have both roth and traditional 401k assets. One thing I would point out is that most of your larger holdings have APPL and NVDA as top 5 exposures. You also show that you own them individually. Based on a quick glance you are probably really allocated 20% to APPL and 18% to nvda as far as those single stocks go(estimates you would have to check the math to be exact). That might be to much of those names to have. I might cut some of the single stock exposure and allocate those dollars into some of your diversified etfs where your holdings are less than 5% and up those a little. Going into a rate cutting cycle I like your bond fund as a place to add because bonds go up when rates go down so you will get some extra return over the next 24 month there. \n\n\nHope that helps. ",

If you enjoy stock picking but are unsure if you have the time for it or the expertise, set aside a smaller portion of your portfolio (say 10%) and keep the rest in ETFs.\n\nSomething to keep in mind as well is that companies like NVDA and TSM are already large holdings within your ETFs.

You have a large cap and a mid cap etf in addition to VOO which is sort of owning the same thing a lot of different ways. I would probably keep the emerging markets exposure and international exposure at less than 20% of the total exposure. \n\n\nBeing 21 I wouldn't waste my time with bonds. You can keep what you have but it doesn't have the growing power you want long term when your 21. Wait until your 30s to look at a bond allocation. \n\n\nWith the size of the portfolio your exposure with Apple and NVDA are outsized and they are going to drive the book. Also remember that Apple and NVDA are also big drivers in VOO and In your Large Cap ETF so you have extra helpings of those stocks. \n\n\nI'd recommend saving stock picking until you have a larger portfolio and then keep it to maybe 10% of the total book if you are looking for long term investing. It's fun to pick stocks and staying with it is important. \n\n\nGoing forward I think you focus on a monthly deposit into that account. I'd allocate it all to VOO until you have at least 10k. That will help balance you out.\n\n\nHit me up when you hit that 10k so we can celebrate your progress.",

That's an ETF that invests in the debt of Investment Grade companies. That debt is called a Bond. It's basically a loan to those companies. They pay interest payment and then repay the loan when the loan is over. Bonds pay interest so they don't have the same upside as stocks. A good bond investment is where you get all of your interest and your loan back. Investment grade bonds are going to pay you like 5 or 6% per year right now. Long term stocks like VOO will average 10 to 12% annually (that's average and some years it will be more and some years you will see a loss). So bonds are just less risky.

          "body": "You mentioned withdraw in 8 months. Why are you withdrawaling in 8 months? Stocks might not be appropriate with such a short time frame. If you need the money in 8 months you probably want a high yield saving account or short term treasuries. \nIgnoring the 8 month problem and looking at the portfolio, I would reconsider Intel right now. They had a bad earnings call and are cutting 15% of the work force. That is probably going to be a tough stock to own right now. Your very heavy in tech which means you are probably under diversified. Adding some automotive exposure with your remaining cash could help balance you out. \nYou could also consider an index etf like SPY to grab a peice of the the 500 biggest names in the market and that would help diversify the portfolio too. \n\n\n8 months is a really short time frame to be buying stocks if you need the money for something. I don't want to see you give up on investing because it let you down after 8 months. Typically stocks are appropriate for money you don't need for years. I always give the example that when I was born in 88 the down was 2,500 and today its 39,500ish. That's why you invest the big long term move is the game changer. Hope this helps",
