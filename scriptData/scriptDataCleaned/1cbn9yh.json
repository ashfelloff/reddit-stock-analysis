If Im not sure which direction it will go or I notice a stock reacts weirdly to earnings I will wait.  I usually have a plan ready.  For instance wfc.  They have reversals or no movement after earnings mainly due to sentiment.  If it goes the opposite way I think it should, I'll buy.  Another example is tsm.  Tsla puts next week once excitement wears off might be another decent play.  Note that it only works on certain stocks in certain situations and takes a ton of research and market knowledge.
