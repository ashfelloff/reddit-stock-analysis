  "score": 16,
  "selftext": "Who is asml? I’ll keep this simple. They are a leader in the manufacturing of chip making equipment.  Companies like Intel and TSMC buy their equipment to make chip plants\n\nWhy is ASML so interesting? Cause they are making the world’s first 2 nano meter lithography machines (that’s really fucking small and enables next level AI chips and memory). Per the article below they are already sold out to Intel and others and are expanding their capacity\n\nI’ll keep this straightforward: Nvidia and Micron, Intel , etc all need this tech to make more and more powerful AI chips.  \n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/asml-launch-high-na-lithography-machine-2nm-chip-manufacturing-i9dac?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_ios&utm_campaign=share_via\n\nRisks: this 2 na tech is brand new and very cutting edge.  There maybe delays as it gets production ramped up as TSM and others evaluate and work through kinks\n\nNow let’s look at the stock:\n\nIt’s at all time highs and isn’t cheap with a PE of 44 (vs 75 for NVDIA).  Note it actually have a dividend yield at .68%. So the metrics are a little expensive but not really stretched.  I expect their next earnings call (April 17) to be a huge catalyst as  2na adoption is discussed\n\nTLDR:\nThese guys have the shit every chip mfg is going to have to have to compete for the most advanced AI processors and memory.   This is a “shovels and mortar” play for AI and will be a slower stock rise than others but should see another 50% in the next year as people see 2na chip machines get bought.  Near term catalyst is April 17 earnings call. \n\nNote: there are real risks with chip tech this advanced. I wouldn’t YOLO it but if you want to be more risky i would do some slightly out of the money option plays if your due diligence agrees with mine around April 17. Personally i am doing stock for now.  \n\n",
