Though given that those are agency MBS, I suppose you could argue that a government sponsored entity is already on the hook for the underlying loans. There’s also some other assets on their balance sheet, in smaller amounts, that could theoretically default or lose value.\n\nBut my guess is that most or all of the reported loss is the spread between the interest they’re paying and the interest they’re receiving, which is why I expect the article blames the recent higher interest rates for the Fed’s loss. Assuming a bunch of the assets are older fixed rate debt from lower interest rate periods, the Fed would be losing money on those.\n\nI would think there could also still be a net cost in the end, which is ultimately borne by taxpayers, similar to how TARP [reported](https://home.treasury.gov/data/troubled-asset-relief-program) a net cost of $31.1 billion, after taking into account interest expense of $13.1 billion.",

And getting the policy right is more important than whether there's a paper gain or loss at the moment. \n\nSo in truth what they will really do is just lower those policy rates.

If inflation is only 2%, and you can get 4.9% with your savings sitting in a money market account, there's little reason to take more investment risk if you think you can expect that to continue longer term. \n\nMeanwhile, labor markets have been deteriorating. The [Unemployment Rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) went from 3.4% January 2023 to 4.3% in July 2024. If you look at previous recessions (the grey bars on that graph), this kind of increase in unemployment often happens at the beginning of a recession. And the [hiring rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/JTS1000HIR) has fallen to rates last seen in the last two recessions. \n\nWith inflation under control, it should be clear the Fed has no need or desire to cause a recession here, and they shouldn't mind to see labor markets strengthen here and for that unemployment rate fall back under 4%.\n\nThe other thing is that longer term rates, which see less influence from Fed interventions, are probably a better indication of how private capital markets see longer term expectations. If [10-year inflation expectations](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-expectations) are now around 2.2%, and [10-year treasuries](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/TextView?type=daily_treasury_yield_curve&field_tdr_date_value_month=202410) are paying 4%, that implies 10-year expected real returns over inflation of around 1.8%. \n\nYou only want to push short term real yields above those longer term potential yields when you think you need further short term slowing of the economy. A healthy stable growing economy will normally have a positively sloped yield curve, as longer term investment should normally be more profitable. The [Fed's own projections](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20240918.htm) suggest they currently see the longer term Fed Funds rate consistent with their 2% inflation target as being in the 2.9% range, implying a neutral short term real return of just under 1%.",

That's exactly the kind of investment an inverted yield curve discourages. Additionally, home building is very economically sensitive. So if you cause a recession by keeping those short term rates high, that also makes home affordability worse. \n\nIn the short run, housing is very demand sensitive due to an inelastic supply. But if you are worried about causing another housing bubble like 2021-2022 from over-stimulus of demand, you are better off addressing that by reducing excess fiscal deficits. Keeping the yield curve inverted really isn't going to help you there. And housing certainly isn't expensive because mortgage rates are too low, right now. Short term easing won't necessarily even lower those rates.",
