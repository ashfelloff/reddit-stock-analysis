  "selftext": "I have been involved in stock and crypto markets since 2021. Honestly I love trading but my problem is I always hold too long because I keep thinking the market will always swing back to the way I want it to.  Here‚Äôs a perfect example: \n\nJust last week I was trading an option out for NVDA last Thursday. I got in the trade early at 8:30 central time exactly when the bell rung while I was at work at my retail job.  Within 25 minutes I made $280 (270% return) and I didn‚Äôt pull the trigger and sell because I thought the stock was going to go as low as 109 based on the chart reading and levels I had mapped out on my phone. \n\n30 minutes later it‚Äôs now 9am and I went on my first break of the day at work. I‚Äôm sitting in the break room looking at my phone happy as can be thinking to myself I‚Äôm going to make what I make half of my paycheck in one day. As I‚Äôm watching I see the first sign of trouble and the stock bounces after it caught support around 111.90 range. I debated on selling then but my gut instinct said wait to see how this plays out and sure enough it started moving sideways all day long until about after lunch that day. The theta has already burned my profits from $280 down to $190. Then I see it hit resistance and I‚Äôm thinking to myself there is ZERO chance it breaks resistance it needs to go back down but nope I was wrong and the stock made a $4 dollar jump and I ended up losing everything in that trade because of my own stupidity of being too greedy. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened to me I have had many of these trades play out like this. I think if I wasn‚Äôt such a greedy trader my overall profits would easily be 150-200k by now. My biggest day trade was about $2500. My bar is set so high that I don‚Äôt feel satisfied unless I make $500-1000 in a single trade. I know on Wall St they are more than happy with a 30% return which I can hit easily with no problems only difference is they are trading with larger capital and I‚Äôm trading a few hundreds or thousands at a time. \n\nAny tips to help me solve this?\n",

And I have had massive losses because I was too confident it would reverse, or I would \"Average\" in. Those lows suck. That is EGO and once I learned that, I try to remember it when I am dreaming of the big payout. Trading is gambling. The house always wins and although you might hit a hot streak, the longer you are in the odds are you will end up with $0.\n\nThe best way to do it is to set stop losses and sell/buy price at the time of your trade. That way you take the emotion out of it and trade purely on your technicals. Trade as if you were on the Spectrum...no emotion just pure logic. You will start to realize where/when you are making technical mistakes, if you really understand a stock's trading behavior, or understand if a stock has momentum's etc. Emotions cloud all that and at that point you are trading on instinct and that will lead you to a $0 account. \n\nI admit, I struggle with it still.

If I had 1k shares of AAPL while stock is at $220, I could sell October 230s for $3.5 (making it up) and generate $3.5k while the stock lingers. If it goes above $230, I get the $3.5k and let the stock sell at $230 for another $10k. If the stock does nothing, I keep the premium or a buy it back for next to nothing while Theta did all the work for me. Wash rinse repeat.",

      "body": "when you get uncomfortable that the price is moving in the other direction, try to take a step back and imagine you‚Äôre betting it goes in the direction opposite to your contracts. it helped me pull myself out of the micro managing trauma inducing hypnosis of individual candles. i can see the overall structure better and that tells me if the trend i‚Äôm riding is valid or invalid. if it‚Äôs invalid and i‚Äôve locked up a decent profit i‚Äôll sell all. \nif it looks like it‚Äôs still weak and chance that this is a pull back, i‚Äôll think about adding more or just relax my nerves, let my body go limp. \nalso another trick that helped me was going heavier on my positions. i used to see +10, +100 and not think too much of it. even though percentage wise they were like 20-50%. i found that when i went bigger with my positions(10x), i was much more invested in the trade, obviously cuz i had more capital riding it. but it made me really take the trade seriously. and the profits were way more than i was used to, so it was infinitely easier to take the profit, and tell myself what a great day to make $1000, for the rest of the day. this helped way more than i‚Äôd like, because the stress inducing risk is way bigger. thankfully, with the careful planning required before entering the position, makes it all the more likely for a win instead of a loss.",
