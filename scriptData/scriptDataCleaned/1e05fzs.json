Was wrong on the 2nd and never got a chance to get back in.\n\nLuckily, I'm not a 🌈🐻 and merely diversified my money into SSO/VOO/UWM/TNA/TMF. Even now I feel the pain of not having my UPRO, watching it crash (to the moon), and being unable/unwilling to buy back in. So I can only imagine how bears feel. \n\nI wonder if that's why 🌈🐻 become ever more bearish. They get upset of loss, pain from missing out on gains, they reject reality and double down on their wrong ways, if they thought markets were overpriced before then they would only feel it MORE overpriced after it rallies, etcetc. Truly a downward negative spiral.
