              "body": "Sorry for the wall of text.\n\nAbsolutely.  I bought an EV because at the time I bought a house a ways away from my employer, as the location was too expensive.  I bought it used for about 30K, with 30K miles on it.  \n\nAfter getting in it and test driving it, I was very impressed with the comfort and size of the interior and the perceived quality of the car and the driving experience itself.  At the time I was a heavy machinery mechanic with the experience of restoring a rare ICE vehicle and rode and fixed my own motorcycles, so I’m not unfamiliar with the fun or downsides of ICE vehicles.\n\nI haven’t done a shred of maintenance on the car since I’ve gotten it other than injecting grease into the UCA balljoints, as they had a recall for water incursion, and then resealed them with liquid rubber.  Haven’t spent a penny on gas, I installed my own charger in my garage and the convenience  of not having to worry about gas itself is worth something to me.  \n\nAdditionally I’m mid divorce; I folded the rear seats down flat and have an entire full size mattress laying flat in the back where I can sleep for a day or two comfortably when I’m not traveling for work.  The car also has camp mode that will allow for the AC and main screen entertainment to run, while the rest of the car is in sleep mode to save battery overnight.  The internal cigarette lighter will support enough power to charge laptops.  There’s also a lot of free car charging available across the United States, if you’re so inclined to be that frugal.\n\nI’m out traveling for work now, and the car has been parked at the airport and has lost 5 miles of charge over the course of 3 weeks, allowing me to not worry about it while I’m gone.  The phone app allows me to check on this whenever I’d like, as well as gives me additional features - for example if I need someone to go pick up my car, I can start it and unlock the doors for them from 3,000 miles away.\n\nEven without AI and autonomy, it’s a great fucking car to own - especially since the price point isn’t far off from other competitors.  Maybe I got a good one, but I haven’t noticed any build quality issues, and I’m qualified to be looking for them.  Fits my family, sleeps two for camping, got the roof rack and it hauls mountain bikes and my kayak, sound systems great, supercharging takes about 10 minutes to get 200+ miles from empty.  \n\nI don’t get the hate",

The market will allow Musk to bullshit for another year or so before the stock finally lands somewhere around 15 p/e. \n\nAnd don't get me started on TSLAs board of yesmen including Musk's own brother. Of course they're going to agree with whatever he says or wants, that's how they got the job in the first place. How one dude is supposed to received 56 billion worth of shares for part time dicking around with a fugly truck no one wants while picking fights with everyone on Twitter is just wild.\n\nIn conclusion, dont touch TSLA with a ten foot pole and let's just hope Musk emigrates to Mars before the end of the decade.",

Full autonomous driving will come to Tesla and others, it’s just not fully cooked yet. Marketing it as if it is an autopilot along with watered down alerts is the current issue. A name change and some additional alarm bells will likely buy Tesla a bit more time. Remember…Drive Thor is coming and the completion will catch up very quickly once it hits the streets.",
