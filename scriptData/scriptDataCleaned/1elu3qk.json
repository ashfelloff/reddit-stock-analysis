Federal lawmakers haven't represented Americans on this issue in a long time and that really needs to change, especially in an election year when \"see?  We represent you!  We stopped ignoring voters!\" is kind of an important thing to highlight.\n\n  \nRescheduling is a weak step.  A huge swath of the country has completely descheduled this already because federal agencies dropped the ball hard letting states take full control of the issue.",
