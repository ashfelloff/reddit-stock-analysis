Either that or deposit $50 a week for like a year and a few months (4.5 to be precise) once again into VOO or equivalent. 70 weeks, $50 bucks, that's $3500. By then you might also have over 10% gains, could be 30% or more if it's anything like the last year,  that's another $1,050 bucks if you dropped $3500 in at the beginning instead of $50 a week, anyways.
