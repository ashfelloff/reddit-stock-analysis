Which they are doing.  We have a long way to go before the Fed has reduced their balance sheet to zero and maybe some of you are too young to remember this but the feds not supposed to have a balance sheet at all.  It wasn't until 2008 they came up with that crazy nonsense and they've been trying to unwind it ever since.  Maybe it never happens I don't know I just live in a dumpster behind Wendy's but I think they can sit on rates and keep pressure on the market for the foreseeable future.  If you think interest rates are high now ask Ray Stantz how much his mortgage was when he purchased the fire house for the Ghostbusters team back in the 80s.
