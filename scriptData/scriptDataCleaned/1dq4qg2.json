So, the company might force them to work 70hr weeks or they will get fired and then have to leave the country. Or maybe they don't get any salary increases during their time there. \n\nWhen employment is tied to your immigration status, there's a whole lot of shady garbage companies can and will do to those workers. \n\nFixing the program will require serious oversight. Companies like Meta make their interview process extremely rigorous to prove that hey there's no qualified candidates in the US. Or smaller companies will post jobs that are so low in salary that no qualified candidates will ever apply. These games need to be prevented. Working conditions for the H1B holders also needs to be closely monitored. \n\nThe max fine for a violation is [$65k](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/immigration/h1b). That can easily be less than the amount of money saved so it just becomes a cost of doing business if caught.",
