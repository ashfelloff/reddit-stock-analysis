That's not comparable in any way to Nvidia's situation.\n\nAlso, Carvana sold for around $5 for a little bit due to the same bankruptcy concerns BBBY faced, but they raised money and became a kingmaker of those who held, so there's obviously nuance to holding vs selling borderline penny stocks.\n\nTo OP, hold. Only defensible reason to sell Nvidia is to play hero ball by trying to buy even more of it at a lower price, but that's too hard in practice.",

Because let me remind you that right now everyone is in nvidia with that same exact idea, and the price represents it.
