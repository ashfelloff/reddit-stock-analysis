  "score": 948,
  "selftext": "In just one week, **40 banks have vanished**, and the collapse of Jiangxi Bank has further deepened the sector’s problems. [Experts warn that this situation could have **severe consequences for the global economy**](https://essanews.com/chinas-banking-turmoil-40-banks-vanish-as-crisis-deepens,7047618605385345a)[^(1)](https://essanews.com/chinas-banking-turmoil-40-banks-vanish-as-crisis-deepens,7047618605385345a).\n\nSeveral indicators highlight the potential for a banking crisis in China, particularly related to its ailing property sector. Consumer credit defaults have sharply risen, especially in real estate. Last year, a record high of **8.5 million individuals** were blacklisted for missed payments across various financial obligations, including mortgages and business loans, up from 5.7 million in early 2020. This immense pressure on Chinese lenders has led to the use of special-purpose bonds to support them.\n\nChina’s economic growth has heavily relied on the real estate sector, which has accounted for an average of **13.4% of GDP since 2013**. However, challenges such as record debt levels and a low birth rate have contributed to a slowdown. While the Chinese economy previously grew by more than 8% annually, it slipped to **5.4% last year** and is projected to slow further to **3.5% by 2028**, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nUnlike Western banks, which operate more independently, Chinese banks are predominantly state-owned. The government holds majority ownership of the five largest commercial banks, accounting for over half of the country’s banking system assets. This ownership structure means that Chinese state-owned banks provide loans with the understanding that the government will step in with support if borrowers encounter difficulties in repaying their loans. [However, this reliance on state support creates a systemic risk](https://essanews.com/chinas-banking-turmoil-40-banks-vanish-as-crisis-deepens,7047618605385345a)[^(2)](https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/finance/crisis-looms-the-challenges-facing-chinas-banks-and-their-global-implications/).\n\nThe situation remains critical, and the global implications are significant. As investors withdraw their funds from China, the world watches closely, fearing the beginning of a major financial crisis. The authorities face challenges in legislation, recapitalization, and mechanisms to handle bank failures. The stability of China’s economy hangs in the balance, and the repercussions could extend far beyond its borders. ",

      "body": "To clarify some misconceptions (everything seems to have been viewed from a GFC lens, which isn't quite accurate):\n\n>The government holds majority ownership of the five largest commercial banks\n\nThose aren't the ones in trouble; instead it's the local banks. Akin to the US system, the Chinese government & tax system is split into local (county/state) vs central (federal), but the local governments had to finance far more than their tax revenues. So they ended up selling land, and doing the whole Local Government Financing Vehicles (LGFV) thing. Local governments were also free to set up their own local banks to finance these, issue quasi-local government debt, and structure deals, etc. Those local banks are in trouble (they are also highly decentralized - which was part of the reason for the frothiness)\n\n>Consumer credit defaults have sharply risen, especially in real estate.\n\nMortgages aren't a really big issue - the downpayment was typically 30% (in contrast to the 5% or even lower required prior to the GFC in the US), and even bankruptcies wouldn't absolve individuals of mortgage liabilities, so strategic defaults aren't an attractive option. MBSs and CDOs aren't so widespread, so there's limited contagion risk into other sectors. Instead, NPL rates would be the better metric to watch.\n\nBut overall, consumer credit isn't the major source of problems. Instead, many LGFVs have made numerous investments into non-profitable ventures, and continued funding them even as they continued to lose money. The equity and debt used to fund those is the far bigger issue, and those do hold a **spillover risk** since they've been wrapped up and resold to consumers and businesses.\n\n>However, this reliance on state support creates a systemic risk\n\nIt's actually sort of the other way around. The reason the banks are going down was because the China took the laissez-faire approach and appears reluctant to bail them out. Centralization of the financial system doesn't in general create more risk, just more inefficiencies. Instead, if the state decided to jump in and recapitalize those banks, they'd be fine. The decentralized finance model is inherently more risky and prone to bubbles - but more efficient in the long run.\n\n**Takeaway**: Watch for LGFVs, and how the central government plans to refinance those. Big monetary or fiscal bazookas are highly unlikely; they're much more likely to do smaller easing measures to mitigate the risk of a liquidity crunch. **Investors should look to see which businesses are more exposed to the risk, and which won't be so exposed**. Many consumer-facing businesses should actually emerge relatively OK.\n\nTL;DR: The risk comes from LGFVs, not consumer credit. It also affects local, decentralized banks (associated with local governments) far more than the biggest national-level banks.",
