[“I Can Feel It Coming Back Again”](https://youtu.be/CnZHsTyvMVw?si=YXR5VMENhAwjmb3v). So maybe we are going to have another recession soon. God help us it’s anything like 2008. I saw so many families hurt during that period I don’t think the average person knows how close that came to ruining all of American society.  Like we barely dodged a giant monetary crisis that otherwise could’ve destroyed life the way we know it.",

          "body": "It is impossible to go back to 2008 like conditions. Not only are banks well capitalized, but the US household debt to household net worth ratio is well below the historic average. The federal reserve and the incumbent govt (be it dems or repubs) will carpet bomb the markets with liquidity if they think there will be a serious recession. The mentality was entirely different in 2008, i remember the media and political noise against bills  like ARRA that sent taxpayers an average $140 through checks as \"stimulus\"! I don't think we'll see 2000 or 2008 like recessions until something fundamentally changes with the US economy, like USD losing its global reserve currency status, which i don't think will happen in any of our life times!",
