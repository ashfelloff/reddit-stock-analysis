  "selftext": "If the China export restrictions are the primary cause for ASML’s weakness, then that must mean that TSMC and Intel will have an easier time acquiring ASML machines. \n\nOne of the biggest costs for chip fabs is the machines. It’s the reason TSMC has not invested heavily into high NA EUV machines because they are simply too expensive to make sense economically right now. \n\nWith nearly half of ASML’s market wiped out over night, TSMC and Intel should have a much easier time securing these machines faster and at a lower price due to less competition. \n\nTherefore, the analysts were wrong. They should have saw this and bought up TSMC and Intel instead of selling all semiconductor stocks after ASML’s report. ",

Nothing to do with access to ASML machines.",

Missed for a 3rd straight quarter\n\nIt was the 2nd worst earnings report among semis all year after Intel’s disastrous Q2 report. \n\nThey need to be repriced since they can’t be trusted with their guidance even after guiding lower next year. If they relied on China for half their sales shouldn’t they be priced 50% lower now?\n\nAnyways ASML will eventually recover as it’s a monopoly and too strategically important but the loss of confidence by investors may weigh it down until they prove they can guide accurately again. There is no justification for missing by this much and not giving investors a heads up. I get it if a few projected sales fell through before ER but more than half their projected sales didn’t pan out in the quarter and they decided to wait until ER to announce it. Their CEO had recently said publicly all is well and the business was healthy. I don’t want to invest in a company with a dishonest CEO.",

They negotiated a deal in which Intel and the TMSC US plants, backed by the US Chips act, cover a significant part of the Chinese revenue in the next five years. Since those investments are delayed, it seems that 2024 and 2025 revenue will be below guidance but long-term should not be an issue. The CMD in November will make that perfectly clear.",
