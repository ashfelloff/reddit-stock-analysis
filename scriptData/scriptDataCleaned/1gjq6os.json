  "selftext": "Palantir Technologies raised its annual revenue forecast for the third time, betting on strong spending from governments and rising demand for its software services from businesses looking to adopt generative AI technology.\n\n\n\nPalantir Technologies Inc. announced on Monday its revenue in the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024 saw an annual increase of 30% to reach $726 million, beating estimates. The company's net income grew by 20% compared to the same period in 2023 to hit $143.5 million. Meanwhile, its diluted earnings per share (EPS) soared 100% to land at $0.06.\n\n\n\nThe data analytics company has benefited from a boom in GenAI technology, as more companies turn to its AI platform, which is used to test, debug code and evaluate AI-related scenarios.\n\n\n\nThe company now expects 2024 revenue in a range of $2.805 billion to $2.809 billion, up from its prior expectation of $2.742 billion to $2.750 billion.\n\nThe company is among the largest beneficiaries of a rally in AI-linked stocks, with its shares up more than 140% so far this year. It was added to the S&P 500 in September and has outperformed the index's 20% year-to-date gain.\n\n\n\nIt also raised its annual forecast range for adjusted income from operations to between about $1.05 billion and $1.06 billion. It earlier forecast $966 million to $974 million.",

At the amount of money they were making ($1.9B in revenue annually with $1.5B being gross profits), that meant people expected zero growth and/or significant bankruptcy risk. The company had a perfect balance sheet, so zero bankruptcy risk for at least 5 years or so, so unless you thought their growth was suddenly going to stop for whatever reason after almost double the two years before that, it was at an unreasonable price point.\n\nSame was true for COIN btw. People here were saying it was going bankrupt, while their balance sheet was solid and they had just massively cut costs, so the chance of bankruptcy within 3 years was pretty much 0%. So unless you thought crypto would never recover despite having gone through down periods many times before and always recovering, it was just priced way too low. Even more so that PLTR.",

Look at the debt, the cash position, how many years would they survive at current (at the time) losses? How long would they survive with no revenue?\n\nIf you did all these things, you'd see that the market was expecting very little growth and/or a bankruptcy, while there was 0 chance of bankruptcy and they were growing quite steadily.",
