  "selftext": "It all started when David Tepper said to just buy everything. So, naturally, I bought BABA calls because, hey, what could go wrong?\n\nI’m basically a walking market curse at this point. Want to tank a sector? Tell me to buy calls on it. Need to sink a stock? Just give me a nudge in that direction.\n\nAt this rate, I should probably go buy some calls on my student loans. Maybe I’ll accidentally make them disappear, too!\n\n",
