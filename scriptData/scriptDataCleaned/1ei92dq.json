All three in a controlled manner to counteract inflation while preventing a recession.  The jobs report plays a significant role in determining the terminal rate.\n\nFed may have to cut rates sooner than later to prevent a spiral down of the economy.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm)",

On both sides.. Just like these wars that are going, but we won't talk about that☻️ \"Free Palestine\" even though I'm going to keep voting for the party who's funding both sides of these wars and keeping them going, all bc the company that owns the media stations where I get my information from, who has sent 3 executives to work for the Biden administration, and who is profiting from both sides of these wars; told me to vote for their candidate, all so that they can ensure these wars continue to roll on and more money is made. There's a reason they left 80 billion in US tax payer funded military equipment for our enemy to have when the Biden administration executed the horrendous pullout of the middle east. Guess who owns the companies that get to replace all that gear? You guessed it, Blackrock! You know, the company that owns the world and sent 3 of their executives to work for the Biden administration.. And if Blackrock doesn't own something, Vanguard does & vice versa, but here's the thing, guess who the largest shareholder of Vanguard is.. Thats right, Blackrock! Guess who the largest shareholder of Blackrock is.. Thats right, Vanguard!\n\nWe're facing a possible recession not through any fault of our own as the hard working people of this country but through the greedy, insane spending of our government and not even on our own people.. Tell me how my great grandmother, who will be 95 in October & was born here on US soil in the Appalachians of Franklin County, VA, has worked her butt off her entire life(worked 30-40 years at GE) and yet she only gets $1000/month in social security at which point they take out another $300-$400 for insurance meanwhile an illegal immigrant can freely walk across our borders ILLEGALLY and get roughly $2000/month in free government handouts right off the bat? Please, make that make sense. Maybe if we stopped sending tens of billions overseas to fund foreign wars and started focusing on America and Americans for the first time in four years we wouldn't be in this situation. Hell even the 40 million a week that we're currently sending to the Taliban in Afghanistan would help.. What's that? Oh you don't think some of the things I'm saying are true? Well in that case I genuinely hope you will fact check everything for yourself.. The rabbit hole goes much, much deeper than what I've said so far. As I said, I hate to bring politics into things but at this point they're tied into, and directly affecting our daily life. The democratic party is absolutely destroying this country and at this point I'm not so sure it isn't intentional as I find it hard to believe anyone could mess things up this bar on accident. Biden inherited a completely peaceful world with a booming economy and here we are four years later with two wars raging, prices completely out of control, and society is generally pretty miserable.\n\nI'm always going to vote for a man who gives up his wealth to save his country rather than a man who gives up his country to gain his wealth.",
