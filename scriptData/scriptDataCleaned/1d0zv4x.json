In fact, we need more hikes to get inflation under control. \n\n> Newmark, a real estate advisory and brokerage company, said the estimated $2 trillion of U.S. commercial real estate debt maturing between this year and 2026 would have to be refinanced at much higher interest rates, according to the report.\n\nhttps://www.pymnts.com/debt/2024/banks-up-against-2-trillion-dollar-wall-real-estate-debt/#:~:text=Newmark%2C%20a%20real%20estate%20advisory,rates%2C%20according%20to%20the%20report.\n\n>As of September 30, 2020, 64 percent of the outstanding amount of marketable Treasury securities held by the public (about $13.1 trillion) was scheduled to mature in the next 4 years.
