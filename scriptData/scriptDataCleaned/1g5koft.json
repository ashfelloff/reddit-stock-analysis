This is why the US is trying to have really good relationships with India because they can block China through the Malacca strait to stop Beijing from getting resources qs a counter move. So no, it's not about the tech only.",

However, indonesia, malaysia are not in US pocket yet. Taiwan is obviously one route to do it but they are trying different ways like taking Philippines disputed islands, creating new islands, trying to convince thailand to create a channel through their land and simply moving through Malacca strait. Taiwan wouldnt not help with Malacca strait so it is useful to break Taiwan off but it isnt as vital as making philippines unable to provide blockade assistance to the USA and their US bases. India is semi-hostile with China, they are Brics. India is not much more friendly with USA, India is also turning away from USA with Modi who has ambitions to be its own power players.\n\nSo no, taking Taiwan would help slightly but it doesnt actually solve the problem as Taiwan blockade is not nearly as important as philippines and malacca strait. The industry benefits of taiwan and the diplomatic fallout is not worth it at all.",
