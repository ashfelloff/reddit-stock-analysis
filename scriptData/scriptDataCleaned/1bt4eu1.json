I had a signature required item out for delivery with FedEx, took a day off work to sign for the damn thing, and they never showed, but tracking indicated unable to deliver due to customer unavailable. The same thing happened 2 more days in a row but I wasnt home. Upon reviewing my security cameras, I had FedEx trucks on film stopping in the road in front of my house for 10 to 30 seconds, then driving off without ever getting out of the vehicle or making any attempt whatsoever to deliver my package. But here's the kicker; I tried to redirect to a local store that's a FedEx pickup location, and they tried to CHARGE ME extra for that privilege. So basically, they're charging uber high prices, then refusing to deliver unless you pay more. That's probably great for profit unless or until a class action lawsuit happens!",
