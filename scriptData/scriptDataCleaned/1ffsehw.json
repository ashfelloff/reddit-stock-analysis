It‚Äôs hilarious when people indicate 0% of a 50 cut though, people much smarter and with better data than them are pricing it in for a reason. I think the fed looks substantially worse letting job market deteriorate and are incentivized to avoid that. 50 cut still keeps rates high and is unlikely to spur incremental inflation. I think with recent jobs data they recognize they were slow in starting to cut so 50 would catch them up to where they ideally would want to be - though they likely would‚Äôve preferred 25 and 25 cuts over a 50.

This is a futures product, so you can trade only in a futures account. Also, most brokers will not offer this as a standard product, but some brokers like Interactive Brokers who have a broader offering may offer.\n\nAnother way to trade, also a futures product, is the euro dollar futures, ticker GE.  I would say this is the more common way to trade it, it is essentially a bet on the future structure of the yield curve. See below for more info. Most futures brokers will offer this and it has the advantage of very low margin requirements when traded as a spread, which is how most people trade it, so you can place a large bet with little capital. For those unfamiliar with eurodollar futures, it is not a currency bet despite the name but an interest rate product.\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/stirs/30-day-federal-fund.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/stirs/30-day-federal-fund.html)\n\n[https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/understanding-futures-spreads/eurodollar-intramarket-spreads.html](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/courses/understanding-futures-spreads/eurodollar-intramarket-spreads.html)",
