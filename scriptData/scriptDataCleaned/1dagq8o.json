My positions in descending order of size are META, AAPL, CROX, MSFT, WFC, MO, WSM, VZ, PYPL, GOOGL, CVX, SBUX. But that doesn't tell you anything. Like I haven't bought any AAPL shares in 10 years. I bought WFC at $25. In the last 10 years it maybe spent a couple months in that range, for the other 9+ years of that 10 years WFC has been a mediocre investment at best. But I'm sitting on a 170+% return plus dividends because of price. CROX I first bought at $40, then I added more each time the stock dipped below $100, then $70. I don't think it's a great investment at $150. But my total return is over 100% already in less than 4 years. SBUX, more recently jumped on that when it dropped down to low $70's after earnings. Is it worth more than $82? yeah probably, it's not a bad price, but I wont tell you to go buy it at $82 but I know it was definitely worth more than $72 and that's when you should have bought it. Knowing that it's in my portfolio doesn't tell you shit about the stock, it just means at some point it was a good investment. \n\nI had a friend whose portfolio I help manage now, but when I first looked at her finances in 2023 I mentioned META and she refused. 6 months later she says \"Hey what about META? my friends keep telling me it's a good investment\" and I told her I don't know maybe it's a good investment now or maybe it's not, but what I do know is that when it was half the price 6 months ago it was a much better investment then, than it is now, why didn't you want it then? And I think a lot of people struggle with that. They need the stock price action to reassure them before they buy, and that always chops off 10%, 20%, 50% of their returns on a good company which is the difference between beating the market or losing. I don't need reassurance from other people or the price action. If every investor is telling me a stock sucks, I already know that's the best time to buy. Because I only invest in great business models. Every company I buy makes money, and a lot of it. Investing is a lot easier, when you aren't trying to look for the hidden gems or secret companies that are going to explode. Just look for good business models(Not popular brands, but good business models) and realize that most investors are complete morons so opportunities will happen.",

              "body": ">Except that those 35% are not the same 35% every year. The number of active investors that consistently beat the SP500 over 10 year periods is tiny.\n\nThese statements are missing 4 things.\n\n1. Magnitude: How much are the ones that do beat the SP500 beat it by? How much are the ones that do lose happen to lose by? If real returns are what one cares about a year with 500% often trumps 10 years with 20% YoY presuming that losing to the SP500 does not mean negative returns. \n\n2. Purpose: If the fund isn't built to beat an index it probably won't beat an index. In fact this works against the idea; if a fund beats an index and it was not built to beat an index that means that the index *randomly* loses. This further implies that a sound thesis that plays out successfully may be more valuable than the arbitrary benchmarking behavior.\n\n3. Viability: The claim itself is dubious. First, no one can actually \"trade\" the SP500. It's a dream portfolio that is tracked by ETFs but is not actually traded by anyone. There are no taxes. There are few to no frictions. There is no management fee (because there is no management, because you can't trade it). You have to overcome all of this to beat the SP500 which creates problems in perception; if beating the SP500 is a random endeavor or a product of one's thesis coming to pass this creates the illusion that the index benchmark matters even though a plan set in place 5 years ago with no consideration for the flippant nonsense gets no real praise. This is what happened with ARK funds for a recent example in history but there are many, many funds that have these outcomes.\n\n4. Tractability: The SP500 is a shapeshifting thing that takes on the best and spits out the worst with no costs or such associated problems and no regulatory requirements or fiduciary duty. It's like trying to beat something that, for all rights and purposes, cheats. Almost none of the information required to really assess these things is publicly posted in a popular place; most people just assume that because SP500 got 5% and the chart says that 50% failed that the 50% failed to get 5%, which is often incorrect, it's just that it was less than 5% after fees but what's really cute and ironic is that due to tracking error and fees the SPY can underperform the SP500. \n\n>They used to, I remember when they called passive investing \"unamerican\" because it was low effort and just accepting being average and stuff like that. **But after so many studies showing that active managers can't consistently beat indexes they changed their marketing.**\n\nThis is actually an incorrect statement but it is understandably incorrect. Finance was young then and people misreported what was said all the time but there's no way to explain how most finance professors became hedge fund managers if one truly buys into that. Instead the corrected statement is that active management ***fees*** were unfair. This is where Bogle becomes the grandmaster of the universe in investing; the statement that they couldn't beat the index was shortened from \"active managers can't beat the index *if you include their fees!*\" which is true. The reason why this became such a point was that there were other papers written that emerged which the public also did not understand.\n\nThe statements about monkeys throwing darts randomly for stocks is a misunderstanding of the concept of Noise for example. What was originally meant when talking about this was that in short-term investing, less than 3 years as Fama put it iirc, *everything is noise* so this created a waypoint to begin discussing the value of a thesis. Ironically the public took this backwards, thanks to financial public journalism spinning it wrong (sort of like the 10,000 hours thing with Gladwell, total myth, sounds good) and stated that basically industry analysts and stock picking were totally random and there was no rhyme or reason to it. \n\nI have no idea why the campaigns did what they did other than to try to reach out to the public on a level they could understand which obviously backfired because short selling is also unamerican, but hedging isn't for some reason, but basically what came out of academia at the time was misrepresented in the media. The whole question of \"what happens if everyone becomes an index investor!?\" is goofy for this very reason; if every human coalesced and invested in VOO with an expense ratio of .04% probably a single large (population) American state pension would rival this in size. It's a non-issue that's more marketing nonsense.\n\nBut the point was that young Finance was beginning to be critical of performance and this was good. **Paying your manager a .5% fee for nowhere near that much performance when adjusted against the benchmark** was ridiculous. Note the construction of that statement, specifically the bolded, because this is not the same statement as merely failing to beat the SP500 so much as it is looking at what one is *paying for*.\n\nThey're just very different claims.\n\n>  \nBut at least it has no high commissions. And you can always go for true passive indexes instead.\n\n*Bogle smiles at you.*",

Can you ride the bumpy ride that is the short-term stock market?  \nIf not, you could hold some in the S&P, another part in money markets/short term US Treasuries (which currently pay 5% interest to hold them with no risk). The latter are highly liquid, so you can always access them if you need cash for expenses.\n\nThat's just one example of portfolio composition. There are many others. Some people also say to hold a small % in gold, because they feel the US dollar might devalue (I have no idea if it will, and I suspect no one knows tbh).  \nSo please talk to a professional, before making a decision.  \nBut in general, yes holding for the long run (ie 10 years) the S&P will return 7 to 8% annually on average. And this return beats 99% of active managers out there. This has been proven time and time again.  \nGood luck!",

I recently wrote about one, Sylvia Bloom, late last year.\n\nHere's another secretary, though, who's just as inspiring -- and instructive. Grace Groner teaches us real life lessons from her success that we can draw from, and help us to grow much wealthier.\n\n**Meet Grace Groner**\n\nGrace Groner attended Lake Forest College. That's relevant because upon her death at age 100 in 2010, the college received a rather hefty donation from her -- to the tune of **$7 million**. But, the thing is, Grace never made more than $20,000 a year.\n\nGrace grew up, went to college, got a job as a secretary at Abbott Laboratories, and stayed at Abbott for 43 years. She never married or had children, and lived in a simple one-bedroom apartment, until she bought a small one-bedroom house. She didn't own a car, but did enjoy traveling.\n\nSo how, exactly, did Grace end up a multimillionaire by the time she passed away? Well, she invested in stocks, and as you may know, the stock market is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth. It seems she actually only bought three shares of stock **(for a grand total of $180, that’s about $60 per share)**, in her employer, Abbott Labs. She bought these three shares in 1935 and held on to them -- for decades.\n\nSo, what did she do right, that we too might do, in order to get as wealthy as we can? Here are the smart things she did:\n\n* She invested in stocks.\n* She invested in a company she was quite familiar with, instead of one that was being hyped up in the financial media.\n* She bought shares of a healthy dividend-paying stock, which means she got quarterly payments from the company no matter whether the country was prospering or in the throes of the Great Depression. (Abbott has paid dividends for 385 consecutive quarters -- that's more than 96 years.)\n* She hung on to those (three) shares, through thick and thin.\n* She wasn't swayed by emotions, selling in a panic when the market crashed or getting greedy and looking for more exciting stocks.\n* She reinvested her dividends, which helps investments grow even faster.\n* She let the principle of compounded growth work its magic on her investment -- over 75 years, from 1935 to 2010.\n\nYou get the idea by now. You, too, might find some healthy and growing dividend-paying stocks and invest in them for many decades, reinvesting your dividends.\n\n\\*\n\n**Coca-Cola IPO Lists on the NYSE**\n\nIn 1889, the Coca-Cola formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. In 1919, a group of businessmen led by Ernest Woodruff purchased The Coca-Cola Company from Candler for $25 million. Later that year, Coca-Cola made its initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), for $40 per share.\n\nAs of the 2016 annual report, Coca-Cola shares have risen so that the company’s market capitalization is roughly $180 billion, and has had 53 consecutive dividend increases. At the end of 2015, one single share of KO stock purchased in 1919 (with dividends reinvested and stock splits) would have been worth **$12,748,802**, an annual growth rate of 14.11%.\n\n**Note:** As of 2024, The Coca-Cola Company has a market cap of $267.09 billion",
