A good book can go into far more detail than the best online resources\n\nAlso, I don‚Äôt recommend paper trading as it‚Äôs worse than worthless. It helps people pick up bad habits that blow their accounts later with real money\n\nI think it‚Äôs better to start with real trading with only one share of stock at a time because it has more meaning. Anyone can start with real money on an account of $1000-$5000 to learn how to play orders and get the feel of it. If they don‚Äôt have that much money, they have no business getting involved with stocks",
