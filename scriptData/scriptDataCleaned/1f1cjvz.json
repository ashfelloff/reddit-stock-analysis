If you follow proper statistical procedure you'd find that most of the popular technical indicators will give you a better average than buy and hold.

TA also seems like it should be pretty weak on anything other than stable blue chips.  Indexes/Index ETFs are by far the best bet for it as well.\n\nThat said, fiddling with MACD and a couple of other indicators for very short term 0DTE scalping (during periods of no apparent catalyst intraday) has been interesting.",
