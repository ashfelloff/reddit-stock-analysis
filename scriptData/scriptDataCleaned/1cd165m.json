This means shorting them, because they can't produce cars to sell without overhauling them. It also means living in a city with good public transit would become a huge boon, so real estate there will go up. It would also mean you would want to invest your time into learning a decent bit about car repair, because getting sharked at an untrustworthy mechanic would cost you 2-3x more.",

There's lots of signs pointing towards him believing the world won't intervene because they don't care anymore and he is on a clock. Xi reaches the average mortality rate for males in China in 2027. The last generation not impacted by one child policy hits the average age to stop physical (factory) labor around 2030. The age of rejuvenation is focused around correcting that gap. So it's now or never for Xi.\n\nXi runs China with an iron fist. The politiburo is ran by his top 3 cronies and he's essentially seen as a super human savior of China. Regardless the signs are obvious. In the past year all official mention of peaceful reunification has dropped the word peaceful that was used for the previous decade. China clearly feels no one can challenge their military in the region and have dropped most pretenses because they understand there isn't a country or alliance out there with the ability or will to stop them from forcefully taking Taiwan in under 24 hours. They only have to worry about the rest of the world not being ok with it. Security experts picked 2027 because they believe they will be capable of holding regardless after that.
