Or should that go to somebody else?\n\n>JK: Perhaps one of the uncles. There were a lot of really great people on Zen. There was a methodology team that was worldwide, the SoC team was partly in Austin and partly in India, the floating-point cache was done in Colorado, the core execution front end was in Austin, the Arm front end was in Sunnyvale, and we had good technical leaders. I was in daily communication for a while with Suzanne Plummer and Steve Hale, who kind of built the front end of the Zen core, and the Colorado team. It was really good people. Mike Clark's a great architect, so we had a lot of fun, and success. Success has a lot of authors - failure has one. So that was a success. Then some teams stepped up - we moved Excavator to the Boston team, where they took over finishing the design and the physical stuff, Harry Fair and his guys did a great job on that. So there were some fairly stressful organizational changes that we did, going through that. The team all came together, so I think there was a lot of camaraderie in it. So I won't claim to be the ‚Äòfather‚Äô - I was brought in, you know, as the instigator and the chief nudge, but part architect part transformational leader. That was fun.\n\n___________\n\n>Anybody who knows their shit knows who he is, foh with that bs\n\nThe point was, is he actually levels above (Silicone Jesus) other top tier people that nobody knows like those that HE appreciated during his time at AMD?",
