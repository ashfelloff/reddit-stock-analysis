For sure Intel has screwed up, but the reason why TSMC is such a powerhouse is because their government stepped in to make sure that their foundries were at the center of a supply chain that was critical to the world. China's government is trying to ensure that their tech companies use Chinese manufactured chips whenever possible, and a lot of the lower end microcontroller chips are now manufactured entirely in China using ARM licensed designs. \n\nI mean, free markets are great and all, but no one else is playing fair in this space.

So basically it seems their foundry works ok for digital designs and has major quality and yield issues for analog/mixed-signal designs.  \n\nI work in the industry and to me it’s clear what’s happening. It’s just a consequence of firing highly skilled electrical engineers in the west and outsourcing to countries who do it for 1/5th the price. Throw enough Indians at problem and they will eventually make the digital part work, because 1s and 0s can’t lie. Analog blocks require expert analysis on power integrity,  inductive coupling, impedance calibration, transient spikes, noise, signal reflections, …. Low cost engineers don’t know or care. You get a unreliable product that needs the perfect power and temperature conditions to barely work and when it does it’s not for many years.  \n\nTaiwan has a culture of excellence in semiconductors. The best of the best don’t become doctors, they become electrical engineers. The best ones in TSMC are extremely well paid, even by US standards. In the west it’s not a prestigious job so you may as well do software engineering as it is related, but is much lower difficulty and pays more.",
