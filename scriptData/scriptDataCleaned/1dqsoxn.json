          "body": "Little dd Nikes low section for shoe sales are all discounted shoes there main bred winner the $100-$180 range is being taken over by other brands the only thing keeping them afloat is the discount budget section and the top end high performance and Jordan line, they havenâ€™t released anything special in a while at this point Nike is becoming dull, itâ€™s no longer becoming cool to wear Nike with the youth and the 35+ age range and this has been a topic of discussion for awhile. On top of that Nike tried to do their POS to online only during the pandemic and limited there or stop there distribution to retail stores which worked for a little, but after retail opened up it was a rocky transition back. Ultimately i believe this is a fair yet over exaggerated sell off Nike will always be Nike itâ€™s just stale rn fashion is cyclical but they will turn around bullish here soon!",
