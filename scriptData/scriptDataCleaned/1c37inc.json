All i can say is that the merger has to happen by July 12, 2024 or else ALCC has to redeem all of the publicly held shares for a pro rata portion of the trust account (\\~$10.41 as of 12/31/2023) and also the sponsor shares and private placement shares will become worthless.  ~~To change this, they'd have to amend the certificate of incorporation of ALCC, and i'm sure there would be notice requirements under Delaware corporate law.~~  So i'm sure Klein, Altman, etc. are motivated to close this deal asap, but who knows if it happens by June 21st (and if it reaches your strike).\n\nEdit:  Found this on sec website:  If a SPAC lists its securities on an exchange, it is required to complete an initial business combination within three years of its IPO.Â   So it looks like 7/12/2024 is a firm deadline.",
