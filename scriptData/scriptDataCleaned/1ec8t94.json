The AI hype cycle is winding down:  they will move with the fundamentals and projected real spending on AI, not black magic.  We're finally getting back to where the financial rubber meets the road with NVDA.\n\nJust be aware that YoY changes for NVDA will not be as profound at this upcoming call, given their already spiking financials from 12 months ago.

The real question is not “Is this company going to be successful.” It’s “has the market correctly predicted how successful this company is going to be.”\n\nI very much believe that Nvidia is going to continue being successful and benefit from AI and general tech advancements. But that’s also a *very* popular opinion. It’s entirely possible for a company to be both in a great position with a very bright future *and* for it to be heavily overbought.\n\nIt’s not enough to just pick companies you think are going to be successful. If you think a company is going to be very successful but it’s priced as if the market expects it to be *insanely* successful, that might not be a good buy. Likewise, if you think a company is likely to grow fairly slowly over the next decade but it’s priced as if the market expects the company to go out of business next week, that might be worth looking at if you’re particularly confident in your assessment.",

I feel the market is categorizing all tech as the same because as we saw, two companies earnings not good so tech down across the board. The market is seeing sector and not individual companies.\n\nI feel that Tesla is a tech company currently making cars.  I also question if on device AI will massively reduce google searches, thus devaluing the company.",

If your hardware is be able to answer so many of the questions you currently rely on search engines, where does that leave search engine traffic and profits?  \n\n\nJust as the iphone changed how we work, think and do business (a small portable device with mobile internet connection) , On board AI could be as massive of a revolution as the iphone was.  \n\n\nI'm into NVIDIA for the training phase and working out who to put my money on for the 1st 2nd and 3rd place podium winners ..in the AI race.",
