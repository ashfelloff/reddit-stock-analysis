  "selftext": "Hello everyone. Today I am quitting options. This is a cautionary tale about my experience as well as everything I've observed as part of this and other communities. I primarilly sold puts and sometimes calls. I was on the other side. The \"Safer\" side. I am here to tell you it's all bullshit. My win rate was over 93% and even the losses seemed manageable. I've done at least a few hundred of these trades so I can tell you 93% is pretty good. And yet, as an options seller, you risk a lot to make a little. Unless your win rate is 100% it doesn't matter.\n\nToday I played UiPath. I did my research. While I surmised that growth was stalling, I expected a drop within the implied move so I thought I would buy the stock at a discount. Well, UiPath dropped 35% due to missed guidance and the CEO abruptly quitting. Of course, the premium gained was less than 5% of the loss incurred, and thus I blew up 20% of my 43k account.\n\nI'm here to tell you. It doesn't matter how often you win. Today it was UiPath. Tomorrow it will be another, bigger stock that you believed in. Shopify, Workday, Salesforce, have all seen large drops >20% and double or triple the implied move of options. \n\nDon't believe the lie. Wallstreet dumps whatever it wants to dump or pump whatever it wants to pump. And you may win a few times. But in the end, **Your Losses Will Always Eclipse Your Wins.** The house always wins.\n\nI'm done\n\n[Positions](https://imgur.com/s6qGmMn)",

In this case the seller looses. But if the stock didn’t move or was flat the seller can collect a huge amount of premium. Looking at historical earnings for Dell it either moves a lot or doesn’t move at all. So you either make a lot or loose a lot but that isn’t because selling before earnings is inherently bad.

Guys yolo on an option with multiple contracts with 0DTE. Don’t bet the farm unless you wanna lose the farm. Buy 1 contract deep ITM for a month or so out. Make 15% profit , sell it and move on to the next.  If you get your option 30 days out and in 2weeks or less you’re down 10% sell it !!! Greed kills accounts here on a daily basis. You literally read the same scenario every single day here. 3:58 yesterday I bought 1 put on dell. Anyone with two brain cells knew it would fall after close. It always does. I could have bought 20 puts and made a fortune but again greed destroys accounts. I find when earnings are announced before opening the stock generally does ok. And when earnings are announced after the market closes , they tank. Stop trying to retire on 1 trade. Some get lucky. Majority of the time they don’t get lucky. So this morning I’ll sell my 1 put I bought and take my 1,500-2,000 and put the profit away and move on to the next. For example I’m up 10k this month just by doing that. I don’t go for the whole pie. I take little slices at a time.",

Even though they best earnings they were expecting less revenue while contracts were shifting for the next quarter but still confident they could beat for the year. The problem was that the CEO abruptly resigned and they announced that during earnings. Not only that but multiple hedge fund analysts slashed the target price from $30 to $14, crippling any chance of recovery in the near future.\n\nSo why not hold for a year and possibly wait until they fulfill their promise? I unfortunately cannot hold for that long when institutions have left the stock in the dust over soft guidance. If the analysts had maintained the buy rating and kept a nearby target price i would have held. But it no longer made sense. I’ve noticed most of the time institutions do this, the stock is left crippled until the company can produce well above average earnings. And that’s a huge gamble at that point",

I was a huge Tesla bull when they were close to Bankrupt.  Everyone one of my friends thought I was an idiot but I bought my first long term call on Tesla pre split split split at a strike around 200.  When it hit about 400 I did the \"smart\" move and sold a call, which I rolled forward at 600, 900 and once post split.  Ate away basically the entire 6 figure profit I would have had if I just didn't do shit lol  buying the call defined my risk in a stock I loved but was clearly risky at the time; selling the covered calls was just putting a cap on potential gains; the former was the \"safer\" move as even though I was risking the entire premium as i was risking only what i was comfortable with.",
