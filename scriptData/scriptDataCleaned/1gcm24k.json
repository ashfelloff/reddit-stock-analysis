They are comparing the yields of those test runs directly to their 4nm production runs in Taiwan.           \n       \nFrom the article:     \n     \n> A TSMC spokesperson declined to comment directly on Cassidy's event and referred to remarks from Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei on a call with investors last week. \"Our first fab entered engineering wafer production in April with 4-nanometer process technology, and the result is highly satisfactory, with a very good yield,\" he said at the time. \"This is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC's strong manufacturing capability and execution.\"     \n     \nBut, yeah, the article is obviously for investors, not Engineers. Most people don't generally expect Bloomberg to cater to Engineers considering it's a publication typically oriented toward investors.     \n     \nAlso, I'm not quite sure why you're doubting that TSMC is capable of replicating their own processes using all the exact same tools.

They didn't start out successful, but it was locking in customers that allowed them to reinvest into ~~product~~ process dominance. I am not going to apologize for Intel pre 2021 or even pre August 2024 for it's behavior, but the point of my original comment is that TSMC's American fabs are not going to be their best, while Intel's are.\n\nI also stress cutting edge because hyperscalers want to overspend, so they want the optimal, high performance expensive stuff, so that is what fundamentally matters: where is the best node produced? That's still TSMC in Taiwan. If it was Intel in America that'd lead to a significant dynamic change, but don't expect TSMC American fabs to achieve that, short of Chinese Aggression.\n\nTL;DR: Until TSMC american fabs start producing the most advanced node, this hardly has any impact on the company's finances or on the market.
