This is a fallacy. What you fail to consider is that companies are becoming increasingly more profitable due to technological advancements and especially with interest rates likely to come down in the next few years. So their stock price will continue increasing, maybe even double, while their multiples stay the same or go down. Then you are left holding your bag of cash and wonder when it’s ever going to crash. When it finally crashes/corrects, odds are they are way more expensive than today, and you miss out on huge gains. This is just based on probability.",
