          "body": "Mercedes-Benz's take on Level 3, available through a set of features call Drive Pilot, only works in clear weather, during the day, on some specific freeways in California and Nevada, and only when the car is traveling less than 40 miles per hour. Finally, it's only available in Merc's EQS and S-Class sedans. All of that may not sound terribly exciting, but what makes this different from other, similar systems, is that if all conditions are met, the driver can take their eyes off the road, and let go of the steering wheel without the car nagging. Tesla's Autopilot and FSD systems require the driver to react and take over in all scenarios, meaning they officially fall into the Level 2 category.\n\n\nSource: https://mashable.com/article/mercedes-benz-level-3-autonomy\n\nMy notes:  It only is Level 3 in certain mapped freeways and CA and NV only.  Also it only works at most 40 mph.  I think it’s dangerous to drive 40 mph on the freeway, so it’s only meant for traffic jammed stop and go.  Doesn’t navigate either just goes straight.",

Zero other cars will make a turn at an intersection, let alone Navigate city, to highway, to city again. You're either underestimating the amount of data and compute needed, or are not familiar with current FSD. \n\nYou also don't understand how LIDAR was a handicap and needed to go. Our current model Y will drive to the parking lot and let us touch the spot we want to park in with vision. It's crazy good.",

Also I haven't had any phantom-breaking incidents in at least 6 months.  I think they've got that figured out.  \nHowever, V12 has introduced a new and annoying problem - when the speed limit increases, it usually correctly recognizes that and raises the target speed - and then doesn't bother accelerating to that target speed.  I'm sure there are other things too, but that's the most annoying I've noticed.\n\nI've had FSD for about five years now.  I use it alot (but always while paying attention, hands on wheel) and I think it's very useful - signficantly reduces cognitive workload on long trips; makes very safe lane changes; etc.\n\nAlso it's slowly but steadily gotten much better and much more useful.  The original version didn't even recognize stop signs and stop lights, but now it makes even most left turns without need for intervention.  \n  \nIt's actually good and actually useful, but in no way ready for \"robotaxis\".",
