  "selftext": "Arm is up another 5% so far today. \n\nSince the pullback in April, it has been up 40% since.\n\nHowever, the company is way overvalued based on P/S, P/E and forward P/E. The company hasn’t proved itself yet, and for me is just riding the Nvidia wave.\n\nApple held the conference yesterday + analysts upgraded the stock, and yet it’s only up 6% today. Why is Arm up 5% today? The price now sitting at 145 is also way way way up from consensus price.\n\nWho’s buying that? Momo crowd? ",
