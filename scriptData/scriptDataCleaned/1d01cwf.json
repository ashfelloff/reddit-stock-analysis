Closed near the top today.\n\n+1.6m on NVDA earnings gamble, still holding.\n\nOptions on related stocks with smaller cap can often generate better returns than the company reporting earnings itself. Wish I had swapped those position sizes around tbh.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fezzvd2ach2d1.png?width=1011&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc08c026d51873fec42a4271da81b35fe944c710\n\n  \n",

Since switching to a new broker 2 months ago here's how I've done in my trading account. The violent spike at the beginning was me moving most of the funds to a different dividend account.\n\nNote I'm currently only trading with a working capital of about 2-3m. The dotted line is what I've moved to that account and above/below that is the gain/loss.\n\nOverall up about 25m this year. Most of the gains were on ibkr which I've already posted in previous threads. I've drastically reduced my trading sizes since then and moved most of the funds into longer term investments.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jwks197eem2d1.png?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06c93e0ae12c158363b3e4fc7164f52ee760b887",

I know you prefer to only post the Ws, but that significant drop from $10mil to $3mil is equally interesting. You were pretty deep in the red by late April. It’s also helpful context to see that $8mil of your $12mil portfolio was deposits (to this account), meaning it’s a 50% ROI after all expenses and fees. \n\nThere is a whole journey here.
