  "selftext": "Imagine you’re a hedge fund and your main motivation is profit (an unfamiliar concept in this sub) and you know that Powell is full of shit, but the market hasn’t priced that in yet - it is quite literally a classic game of prisoner’s dilemma. \n\nYou cash out too soon and you miss out on those sweet-sweet tendies. You cash out too late and you’re filling out an application at Wendy’s. \n\nWhat we saw today was a major shift in sentiment among market makers. What should’ve been a rebound off of the good news that neither Iran or Israel actually tried to inflict damage on one another, resulted in a steady crash across the market, with more markets makers net short than long for the first time in months. \n\nIt’s only retail investors left who are net long than short and the MM’s are going to capitalize on this to profit off of us.\n\nGiven that earnings season is coming up (currently there is a black out period for orgs where they cannot participate in stock buy backs), there will be a boost driven by companies buying stock in the coming weeks before a sharp decline driven by market makers selling off to retail investors (as they have historically done during high interest rate environments).\n\nFurthermore we see the elevated VIX indicating high volatility which has resulted in market makers reducing every rally we see, and the stocks continuing to drop.\n\nWith no interest rates coming this year, MM’s will continue to sell and short as most companies will fail to grow in a high interest rate environment due to cutbacks.\n\nOnly then will be see layoffs that will finally trigger the fed to cut rates. It presently won’t happen given that there just isn’t enough capital leaving circulation, and congress quite frankly does not want to do anything about it in the way of taxing it out of the bloated economy.\n\nHedge funds will act rationally and continue to net sell this year, reducing shareholder value, until they see a reason not to. It’s up to us to either sell, hedge, or get slaughtered in the process. The choice is yours.\n\nNo positions at the moment, just my observation of the markets at this time. I personally would hold cash if you’re not trading for the long run atm.",

I think everyone here is trying to be ahead of the crash which is why the talk is so reactive. This sub in general is extremely reactive to the market - so that’s why you hear the recession doomsday talk. \n\nHowever, during every crash there’s always people (like you) saying that it’s just a dip. Sometimes it’s not until the whole crash is practically done crashing that they finally say “okay this is a recession.” \n\nThe last two weeks have been bad, but the market has been falling since at least mid-March. It’s just that everyone was too hyped about AI stocks to notice. The trend down was obviously different than it’s been in the last 3 months though, and the Middle East tensions is kind of like the straw that broke the camels back IMO. \n\nI don’t think this is going to be a recession but I think it’s going to be a correction for sure. We will see continued (potentially increased) crashing until Mid-May with most of that momentum happening in the next two weeks.\n\nEdit: I’ve got 80% of my Portfolio on puts rn FWIW.
