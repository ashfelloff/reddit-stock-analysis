Makes me wonder how many of us here are really balls of steel, üíé‚úä, and real üêÇs? \n\nAnyways, be real with me WSB chads/sissies: \n\n>***Did you buy, hold, or sell yesterday?***\n\nI bought only $5K in stocks. Tried to sell UPRO puts but didn't get any bites. Sold inverse VIX puts. Dumped $10K into PMs. -$15K cash. But from least week's high my account is down around -$120K yesterday and I still bought the dip. No regrets the market is up today. If it dips more going forward then I'll buy even more.",

      "body": ">A bull trap occurs in financial markets when a stock or other asset shows a false signal of reversing from a downtrend to an uptrend, luring in traders and investors who expect the asset's price to continue rising. After these investors enter the market and the price increases slightly, the price then reverses and resumes its downward trend, causing losses for those who bought in expecting a sustained increase.\n\n>Bull traps are often seen during bear markets or periods of general market weakness. They can be triggered by factors such as temporary positive news, technical resistance levels, or short-term buying pressure that doesn't have long-lasting support. Traders who recognize a bull trap may short the asset or sell their positions to avoid losses.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/70ylv2t3f2hd1.png?width=1372&format=png&auto=webp&s=9287546745490c55d9ed97eef078ad3269a32f3d",

There is a small uptick at the end of the chart, where the price increases slightly.\n\n>This could potentially be a bull trap if the small uptick at the end led some traders to believe that the stock had bottomed out and was beginning to recover, only for the price to continue falling afterward. Bull traps often occur in such scenarios where there is a brief rally in a generally declining market, tricking traders into buying before the downward trend resumes.\n\n>To confirm if this is indeed a bull trap, you would need to monitor the stock's performance after this point. If the price falls back down after this minor rally, it could be considered a bull trap.",
