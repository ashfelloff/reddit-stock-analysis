Their business model and supply chain/cost structure makes them lean and mean and ready to offer deals to their shoppers. A shopper who is gripping their coin purse tightly needs to eat, Costco is right there in the evoked set of options. Also the delivery service with Uber eats and online orders moving forward is a new revenue stream which can yield some results. (Ubers CEO is a straight up charlatan, but this is a good move for Costco). I haven’t bought any calls yet, but I suspect a split soon and positive guidance since they’re so resilient to inflationary pressure. I’m likely going to buy a call or two OTM but only by a few bucks away from the stock price.",
