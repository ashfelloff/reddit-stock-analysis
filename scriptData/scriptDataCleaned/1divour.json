(i chose march 2024 so i dont have the recent spikes in the data)\n\nIdk why OP picked this really narrow time span but it makes sense to invest into chewy from end of may to end of august. Chewy and summer times go well together + chewy was overall down pretty bad from 2021 until now\n\nEdit: What i also find interesting is that the volume saw an unprecedented 66 million spike at the 29th may. That's some whale action. Some magic happens around this date with chewy",
