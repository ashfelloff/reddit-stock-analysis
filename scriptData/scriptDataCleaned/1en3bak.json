Life's fucking tough, if somebody can parlay some stupid horseshit into new, better trajectory in life then I'm happy for them.\n\nSomething similar happened to me about 15 years ago. I grew up poor as fuck. The kind of poor that doesn't always get to eat 3 meals every day. Graduated from college in the Great Recession, got a shit job that paid fuck all with a regarded asshole of a boss.\n\nThen some random hiring manager at Amazon called me up and asked me to interview, and now I know what it's like to have more than one comma in your net worth. I ain't got that much now on account of the divorce (*get a fucking prenup*), but I'm at the point where it's inevitable I'll get back there, I just have to not be a regard.\n\nIt still floors me sometimes that I used to joke with my ex-wife about spending money, because we were so poor that the concept of spending money was comedy gold to us. And today I'm shrugging at a \\~$100k drop from my portfolio's peak a month ago. Were it not for that interview, I'd still be dirt poor making jokes about having disposable income.\n\nThe song *Lose Yourself* is exactly right, except I'm not sure the opportunity even comes once in a lifetime for some people.
