Everything chip related and dependent is taking a hammering.  \n\n\n\"In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek on Tuesday, Trump was asked if he would defend Taiwan against China if he wins the US election in November. China’s ruling Communist party claims Taiwan as a province and has vowed to annex it, refusing to rule out the use of military force. The US does not formally recognise Taiwan but is it’s most important security partner.\n\nIn response to the question Trump said Taiwan should be paying the US to defend it, that the US was “no different than an insurance company” and that Taiwan “doesn’t give us anything”.\n\nThe US sells Taiwan billions of dollars in weapons under legislative obligations to provide it with the means to defend itself. These sales markedly increased under Trump’s presidency.\n\nHowever, Trump’s comments on Tuesday suggest his support for Taiwan is not guaranteed. Trump noted China’s increased military aggression towards Taiwan, said he, “wouldn’t feel too secure if I was [Taiwan]”, and questioned why the US was acting as Taiwan’s “insurance” when, he claimed, they had taken American chip business.\"",

Placing a seed of thought on trump potentially making a ‘not so pleasant’ remark about this whole thing. \n\nIf you notice, Intel is absolutely fine. Why?

And trade relation between China and US is horrific. And China takes their first step into Taiwan. \n\nDon’t forget that all these companies could possibly come to Intel to provide them everything. So not only will Intel compete with them and make money using their own products but also make even more money supplying them with the chips.

      "body": "Today, chip stocks fell significantly due to a combination of market reactions to former President Donald Trump's statements and recent disappointing earnings reports from key semiconductor companies. Trump mentioned the potential for implementing a high 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he were re-elected, raising concerns about escalating trade tensions with China. This prospect of new tariffs led to investor fears about increased inflation and higher interest rates, which could negatively impact tech and semiconductor sectors​ ([markets.businessinsider.com](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/donald-trump-second-term-president-stock-market-implications-inflation-rates-2024-2))​​ ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04172024-8634713))​.\n\nAdditionally, ASML Holding, a major player in the semiconductor industry, missed its sales estimates for the first quarter, which further dampened investor confidence. This earnings miss caused a ripple effect, leading to significant drops in other semiconductor stocks such as Lam Research, Applied Materials, Advanced Micro Devices, and Nvidia​ ([Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-04172024-8634713))​.\n\nThese combined factors led to a substantial sell-off in chip stocks, reflecting the market's sensitivity to both geopolitical developments and corporate performance within the tech sector​ ([InvestorPlace](https://investorplace.com/2024/06/why-is-trump-media-djt-stock-down-11-today/))​.",

This basically always leads to an increase in volatility, especially on stocks with lots of open options (this has been big tech lately). Volatility in a bill market means we’re at higher risk of a drop than recent weeks. This should stabilize over the weekend\n\n2) More specific market force: semiconductors are having a ROUGH day after already being shaky. Trump said last night that Taiwan is on their own against China, which is bad for TSM and their pipeline. Then ASML had really weak guidance on their earnings call this morning, which is a bad omen for semis as a whole. THEN it leaked that Dark Brandon is mulling greater taxes on tech sales to China, which is bearish for everyone\n\nSo basically we’re in a period of higher volatility, which means the bad semiconductor news (which drives tech, which drives the whole market) is having an even greater impact than it normally would",

Except it didn't leave, it just sucks because Intel(private company) fucked up and lied while giving away it's advantage to TSMC who didn't make insane gambles and instead relied on realistic innovation time tables. Intel Stock actually shot up because of his remarks... \n\nTrumps mercantilism isn't going to help anyone if he's elected. Shit, he lost over 140k jobs in the steel industry alone from his stupid ass tariffs and he's promised a ton more across various sectors. Of course people clamor at his side and claim \"the steel industry made money though\", but that's just the producer side(and barely) while consumer side and workers get butt fucked. \n\nI really don't get the hard on that people have for such a loser who has no sense about economics or the benefits of globalization and international trade. And no, I didn't lose money today. Only those with options or weak hands will lose.",
