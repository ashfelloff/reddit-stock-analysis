  "selftext": "With the rise of AI on the software side, how far away are the quantum stocks from going big? Quantum is the hardware that powered with AI, can solve equations never thought to be solvable and change the entire world. I understand that it’s still in early stages, but with all the investments going into these stocks, when will investors start to see the growth? Obviously there are the big companies trying to get into the race and then you have a company like IONQ that specializes in building quantum computers that has just been staying flat on share price. Where do people see the customer base coming from at the start, and when do people think it will start to take off? Is this a sector that goes nuclear soon or are we years away?",

              "body": "Yea that’s part of my thinking when I bought in to companies like this and asts and rklb before wsb got to it. \n\nMy philosophy is that the market is a self correcting and self regulating system. Companies are seeking to grow and are forcing each other to grow. Bad companies are eliminated (delist, bankrupt, etc) and good companies are rewarded. My strategy hinges on the fact that I don’t think the market is at its all time high yet. So I buy companies that I think are disrupting a sector(mainly tech cause that’s what I know) and I hold. \n\nBuy and hold, that simple. As long as there is a market it will go up overtime, faster than inflation. Thats what I believe. And I also believe tech will run the world for the foreseeable future more than what the market is predicting currently. \n\nRemember Nvidia was crap for almost 20 years. Buy and hold.",

Really appreciate your insights.\n\nTried to pm/chat you, but wasn't able to as the system kept saying that \"the endpoint doesn't exist\" 🫡\n\nI used to hold RKLB exclusively. Bought in my first 2750 shares in the high 4s, but swing traded it for a profit in low 5s. Then another 2500 shares in mid 4s during the BOJ Fiasco Week, offloaded this week in high 6s.\n\nWhat attracted me to think of initially holding RKLB for long was the value proposition of being an end-to-end space company. It was also during that same time (before I bought my first tranche of RKLB) that I changed upon ASTS. However I paid no attention to it (regretfully) as I couldn't understand their value proposition.\n\nBut thanks to folks (like yourself) back then in the ASTS Subreddit, they helpfully pointed out ASTS value and that's where after I bought my 2nd tranche of RKLB shares, I bought into ASTS too.\n\nCurrently no longer holding RKLB shares, as mentioned I had sold them in the high 6s. I decided to concentrate my investments to IONQ, ASTS, ITA, and Cash. Also mainly due to the same thought as you that ASTS has a much larger potential for growth.",

Let’s assume it remains hard and QC need laboratory conditions to work. I don’t think that would be an issue. What would happen is companies would have server like locations, maybe in space or in isolated locations in oceans or underground, where the machines run and the computing power could be leased as a service through fiber optic or satellites or some other method. \n\nI don’t think we’ll be walking around with QC in our cars or phones, like how we aren’t walking around with AI servers. But we will have links to them. Like how I can access GPT and the whole internet from my fridge. \n\nI think as our computer needs scale, QC will be used like how super computers are used today.

Furthermore, the operational expenditure incurred by building quantum cpus is likey gonig to stay high as you need a near zero kelvin and a near vacuum environment to minimalize entanglement, so from the business side it has a very low probability of being profitable. What MIGHT happen is companies HOSTING quantum computers on the cloud more and more, but even then the charge for using them for extremely basic computing tasks wouldnt be worth it. Just my opinion",

Quantum computers and modern AI algorithms are fundamentally incompatible. In fact, the currently known applications of quantum computing are quite limited, with the vast majority of applications still being better served by traditional computing. \n\nThe reason you hear so much doomsday talk about quantum computers being so powerful is because of an algorithm called Shor's algorithm, which can factor prime numbers in polynomial time. Modern cryptography is all based on the fact that prime numbers cannot be factored in reasonable timeframes, so this would have far reaching implications.",
