  "selftext": "it's been a long time WSB. I figured I'd drop a DD post to help you all have some context around $NVDA's stock split that will go live on Monday & what has historically happened to Tech Co's after executing a stock split.\n\n**NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.**\n\n**TL;DR - The $NVDA stock split is BEARISH given the historical performance of tech co. stock splits.** Scroll to the bottom for positions\n\nLet's start by looking at a list of recent stock splits, how they performed over the next couple sessions:\n\nI. $AAPL 4 for 1 stock split announced on 7/30/20 (w/ earnings), went active on 8/28/20:\n\n* Performance after **announcement** of stock split to stock split actual date:\n   * Opened at $100.48/share on 7/31/20, closed at $122.11/share on 8/28/20 for a gain of +21.5%\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference $122.11/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.3%\n   * 6-day: -9.6%\n   * Got to as low as $107.7/share within 1-month for a drawdown of -11.8% after stock split was announced before bouncing\n\nII. $AMZN 20 for 1 stock split announced 3/9/22, went active on 6/3/22:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 6/3/22 of $122.35/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -1.0%\n   * 6-day: -15.3%\n\nIII. $TSLA 3 for 1 stock split announced on 8/5/22, went active on 8/24/22 at close:\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 8/24/22 of $297.10/share closing price\n   * 3-day: -4.1%\n   * 6-day: -6.7%\n\nIV. $NVDA 4 for 1 stock split announced on 5/21/21, went active on 7/20/21 (a rare bullish stock split):\n\n* AFTER STOCK SPLIT GOES LIVE PERFORMANCE: reference on 7/20/21 of $185.80/share closing price\n   * 3-day: +5.1%\n   * 6-day: +4.8%\n      * $NVDA actually was selling off prior to the stock split date here where it reached as high as $203.37/share before closing at the near-term bottom of $187.47/share (-7.8%) the day RIGHT before the stock split date (7/19/21)\n\nThere are many other examples like Tesla's 5 for 1 stock split on 8/28/20, $GOOG 20 for 1 stock split on 7/15/22, & others. I've compiled a database of tech company stock splits from $CSCO to $MSFT back to 1991 to obtain the following stats:\n\nAverage 3-day performance after a stock split: ***-0.8%***\n\n% of times negative 3-days: ***52.0%***\n\nAverage 6-day performance after a stock split: ***-3.4%***\n\n% of times negative 6-days: ***72.0%***\n\n*\\*\\*days measured as next 3/6 trading days, not calendar days*\n\n*---*\n\nI like my odds here on a bearish play on $NVDA following the stock split on Monday.\n\n**POSITIONS**: July 5 $1140P. If it gets to \\~$1000 (or $100/share split adjusted), my plan is to buy the dip.\n\nHappy tendie hunting you regards",
