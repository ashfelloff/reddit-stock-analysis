But if it's below $150 you're at a total loss.\n\nI bet you could have done a vertical spread at 130 and 131 and gotten 3 to one if it ends up above 131. Breakeven would be 130.3. Doesn't that seem more manageable?\n\nYeah you're missing out on unlimited top end, but your chances of actually getting a win are just sooooo much better.
