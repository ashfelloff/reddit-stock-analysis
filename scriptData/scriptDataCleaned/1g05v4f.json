Solar panels do not require thermal energy for functionality (besides the obvious don't be at ridiculously cold temperatures where material science fucks with you), they are photoelectric. Photo meaning photons, aka light. \n\nBarring any of the numerous mishaps and affects of other sciences, solar panels in space are the most efficient you'll get - hence the idea of a Dyson swarm.",
