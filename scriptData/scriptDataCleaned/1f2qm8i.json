  "selftext": "Long story short, last time my post got rave reviews - see link below - but my trade was meh and I made peanuts on it. This time, I am extending the duration and I am not hedging the bet, so I am going full bull with OTM calls.\n\nTLDR: buy when the stock drops and insiders start buying. Recently, ATEC dropped a ton, and 4 directors plus the COO bought over 1M worth of stock, combined. Significant amounts of money for this stock, so I ~~copied~~ joined them in the bullish play with long October $7.5 calls at 30 cents, so if this stock closes the gap to $10, I am positioned to make 8X my bet.\n\nDo your own research, make your own trades, trade small, and be careful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgj0mis6i9ld1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc77943fa7c89ea6e8f4e136e8f4c9141c3156ee\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed\\_traders\\_can\\_show\\_you\\_how\\_and\\_when\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/)",

Still short the 7.5 Nov puts.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have been long a 5/7.5 Nov call spread or short the same put spread to double my money. If I were really a perfect trader, I should have sold the calls as soon as they went 3X and moved on.\n\nWhat about you?",

Also good on you for rolling house money into other trades, feels like doing a casino heist when you do it ; )\n\nI have been trading this trade off and on and while the general thesis has an edge, the trades are either short term, or longer term, and 1-2 month options never work out at expiration. Trading stock or covered stock might be a better play if you want to exit 1-2 months out. Just sharing this as an FIY.",
