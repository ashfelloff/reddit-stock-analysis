  "selftext": "Long story short, last time my post got rave reviews - see link below - but my trade was meh and I made peanuts on it. This time, I am extending the duration and I am not hedging the bet, so I am going full bull with OTM calls.\n\nTLDR: buy when the stock drops and insiders start buying. Recently, ATEC dropped a ton, and 4 directors plus the COO bought over 1M worth of stock, combined. Significant amounts of money for this stock, so I ~~copied~~ joined them in the bullish play with long October $7.5 calls at 30 cents, so if this stock closes the gap to $10, I am positioned to make 8X my bet.\n\nDo your own research, make your own trades, trade small, and be careful.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fgj0mis6i9ld1.png?width=689&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc77943fa7c89ea6e8f4e136e8f4c9141c3156ee\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed\\_traders\\_can\\_show\\_you\\_how\\_and\\_when\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1coug3v/informed_traders_can_show_you_how_and_when_to/)",

Still short the 7.5 Nov puts.\n\nIn retrospect, I should have been long a 5/7.5 Nov call spread or short the same put spread to double my money. If I were really a perfect trader, I should have sold the calls as soon as they went 3X and moved on.\n\nWhat about you?",

Not as big of a profit as originally planned, but not bad. The stock that money was previously parked in hasn’t moved, so I’m happy.",

Also good on you for rolling house money into other trades, feels like doing a casino heist when you do it ; )\n\nI have been trading this trade off and on and while the general thesis has an edge, the trades are either short term, or longer term, and 1-2 month options never work out at expiration. Trading stock or covered stock might be a better play if you want to exit 1-2 months out. Just sharing this as an FIY.",
