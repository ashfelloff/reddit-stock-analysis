  "selftext": "Our investment philosophy and goals usually depend on our age. You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.\n\nI agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. \n\nI think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).\n\nI’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.\n\nOther candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.\n\nHow about you? What’s the stock you think you’ll never sell?",
