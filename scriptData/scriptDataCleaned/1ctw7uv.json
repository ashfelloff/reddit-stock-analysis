I'd win like $4,000 on a spin and then somehow 4 hours later it was inexplicably gone. Like diff amounts but I sometimes feel like some people never feel satisfied and seek that additional dopamine just like any other drug.\n\nIronically this shit has kept me from gambling and I've just been messing around with the same $1,000 I had left over from the reddit IPO which is much better than stupid slot machines or blackjack. I try to keep to my rule of cashing out when the return is just above absurdity for a normal investor (like 2x in a day or so).",
