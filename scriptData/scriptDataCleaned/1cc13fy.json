  "score": 156,
  "selftext": "There is literally 0% chance META doesn’t crush earnings. Literally 0. What the stock does is fugazi to me. We have no shortage of examples this year of price action going the opposite direction of how well a company performed.\n\nI really don’t like IV, and wouldn’t be surprised if META stayed within a 3% AH movement up or down. The price action today suggests to me that they will move up, but it will be more telling in the afternoon trading. \n\nHere’s the thing on IV crush - it will always beat at least one side to a pulp. META moves 10% up, puts get hammered. 10% down and calls see life savings go to $0. Moves 2-3% BOTH sides suffer.\n\nSo why not play $SNAP instead? \n\nBenefit is you still have high IV leading into their ER, their stock price will follow META’s news and you can close out before you face the subsequent crush of IV on Friday morning.\n\nTL/DR: I think META crushes earnings, SNAP soars in AH before their ER, calls for easy money.",
