  "score": 621,
  "selftext": "Google as the title states has gone down 20 percent from the ATH which is more than other big tech companies have seen. and is now in bear market territory. \n\nFirst let's start with the balance sheet of Google which is pretty good for the most part.  Google revenue has increased at a rate of 18.16 percent a year which is extremely fast top-line growth.  Free cash flow growth has been good but more and more is going towards capx while google tries to improve their LLM.  The free cash flow is also further hurt by their stock-based comp which last year counted for nearly 32 percent of all free cash flow. EPS is going up at a rate of 21 percent in the last 5 years which is being accelerated by google buying back shares.  They have minimal debt and lots of cash. they  have recently issued a dividend which is great because it returns more profits back to shareholders.\n\n***Why is google trading down so much***\n\nGoogle has recently found itself to be a convicted monopoly by the DOJ and is also seeing regulation from the EU as well in other anti monopoly lawsuits.  This has increased the level of uncertainty in the stock because the punishments have yet to be given leaving investors in limbo of how detrimental this could actually be.\n\nGoogle as well as other big tech companies have been spending ungodly amounts of money chasing AI and while I do think AI could prove to be a worthwhile investment in the future in the short term this is causing companies like Google to not be as capital efficient as they once were.\n\n***What will cause google stock to go up***\n\nThe thesis is simple...  Once time passes and we get past these anti-trust lawsuits the future from Google will seem more clear and this will help with investor sentiment and certainty and help contribute to an increase in stock price.  Google is currently spending money on a upgrade cycle which is AI.  Once the boom for AI starts to go down, capex spending should move down, allowing Google to return to a more capital efficient business model.  Also keep in mind that Google owns so many entities (YouTube, Google Cloud, Google Search, -google office suite, and android).\n\nTLDR: Google stock is probably undervalued and its probably gonna go up lmao\n\n",

Their YouTube premium penetration has been terrible compared to something like Spotify premium, and I think that will change big time in the coming years as they make ads more intrusive and annoying. Would you rather have YouTube premium or your fourth netflix copycat streaming service pumping out weak content? I think most will allocate the $15 or whatever to YouTube. Then you also consider YouTube TV, which is by far the best alternative to cable if you need it.\n\nThen you have GCP. They are the third largest cloud provider, and currently growing revenue at 29% YoY. Net margins are currently low, but expanding rapidly every quarter. This is going to be doing current AWS revenue, at a 35% net margin in 3-4 years from now. Not to mention, Google’s TPUs are purpose built AI and machine learning chips that are very capable and a legitimate alternative to GPUs. Apple is already using them for training their own in-house AI and if it’s good enough for Apple it’s probably good enough for 99% of proprietary AI/ML needs.\n\nThen you have Waymo. Google has somewhat quietly dropped the robotaxi that Elon and Tesla have been talking about forever. They’re doing I believe 100,000 paid rides every week? And they’re only in three cities. Waymo at scale could be a huge opportunity. It’s significantly cheaper than uber rides, you don’t have to worry about safety, awkward social interaction, tipping, etc. And I really do think there are certain groups of people who would opt for some kind of $200/mo unlimited waymo rides membership rather than owning a car. Getting kinda speculative here, and moving the needle on an already $1.9T market cap is extremely hard. \n\nThe broader point is that Google has tremendous growth opportunities in front of it, and at it’s current valuation is a nobrainer buy. Even if Search stalls and becomes a zero growth business, Google is still undervalued.\n\nEDIT: I should also mention, even with their enormous AI capex, Google can still grow their dividend and buy back tons of stock.",

I could have made even more money!     \nIt's the tearing between value investing and \"let your runner go, the market might go even stupider\", just look at SBUX at 100$ lol. Or Apple over 30 P/E for 4% growth annually.    \n    \nAnyway, I'll consider sub 140. There are lots of businesses out there growing more with cheaper valuation.
