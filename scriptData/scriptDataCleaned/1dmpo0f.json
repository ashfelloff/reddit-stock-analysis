FDA approval is pending for Aug 10th. \n\nI'm down 24% since purchase on the news that the COO sold her shares.. I think that's the reason... Should I buy more? hold or sell? I really feel this is an easy win but then why did she sell?? Tell me the harsh truth. Past expirience is appreciated ðŸ™Œ\n\n",
