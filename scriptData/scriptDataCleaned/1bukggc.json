But that bad… they already closed some production lines in some fabs. \nThe images are kinda crazy I feel for the people out there. Happy to just be a regard that’s losing some loot. \n\nHow is it going to affect tsmc? And their future outlook ?\nI guess we just have to wait till they release news abt this.",

      "body": "If a wafer is mid process and the tool aborts, it can be an instant scrap or the wafer needs recovery and reprocessed within a certain time frame usually around 12hours at max due to ageing of the layers on the wafer\n\nSo if scrapped those wafers could have been several weeks into production already which would mean several weeks delay for x amount of wafers\n\nI think best case scenario here is several weeks of delays to production. \n\nWorst case is damage to equipment or factory which who knows what delays that could mean, could be years even",
