      "body": "If a wafer is mid process and the tool aborts, it can be an instant scrap or the wafer needs recovery and reprocessed within a certain time frame usually around 12hours at max due to ageing of the layers on the wafer\n\nSo if scrapped those wafers could have been several weeks into production already which would mean several weeks delay for x amount of wafers\n\nI think best case scenario here is several weeks of delays to production. \n\nWorst case is damage to equipment or factory which who knows what delays that could mean, could be years even",
