      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

You think you doubled your money so you'll roll until you lose 1000. \n\nFirst day 200$ profit\n\nSecond day 400$\n\nYou start to feel this is the way and lose 300 next day\n\nYou're still up 100$ \n\nNext day you raise the stakes and lose 500$\n\nYou'll think it's only a 400$ loss and you realize you could have made 1000$ just by holding it for a couple of more hours.\n\nYou're still in position from original investment and decided to stop once you lose that..next day lost 600$ and now back to where you started.\n\nNow you'll think you worked hard for that 1000$ and need to earn it back and stop with options. After all if you can lose 1000$ in a week why can't you earn 2000$.\n\nYou lost again and down to last 200$.you also realize you sold early and missed out..so it's not your mistake it's just that the timing is bad.\n\nYou play with 200$ and got 50% returns next day and back to 300$.\n\nBut you can't recover the money you lost this slow. So put another 1000$ to make a quick 50% and stop options. You lose again and now you are down a lot. \n\nNow either you can put more money or live with this feeling of a failure.",
