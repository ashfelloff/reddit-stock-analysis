Running on electricity is insufficient, especially in 3rd world. \n\nA big issue with conventional nuclear power plants (like the one in the Simpsons) is demographics and the nuclear waste that is produced.

A single SMR can provide enough power for 750k homes. Theres billions of people who still live without efficient energy because of climate,, SMR can change that. And the military bases who can't afford to lose power will greatly benefit from SMR because of nuclear energy's resilience to the elements",

This is true now more than ever with the recent Chevron ruling from the Supreme Court, which basically allows companies to ignore existing laws, and if they happen to get called out for it then it goes to a bogged down court system (which will get more bogged down from the large number of new cases resulting from this ruling), meanwhile the issue persists. \n\nThink of an oil pipe that is found to be faulty and likely to leak. Before the Chevron act, a cease and desist letter could be issued to the company to prevent the potentially environmentally disastrous event from happening while it gets sorted out.  Now, after this ruling, they have to go through the court system for a non-expert interpretation of the law (possibly to a court of republican sided judges who don’t favor regulation), meanwhile a massive oil leak could happen at any point. A case submitted today won’t get seen until 2030, and lord only knows how long it’d take with the new influx of cases.\n\nYou can see the issue of how this could easily go horribly when applied to a nuclear example.",

The company is heavily involved in developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) and is poised to benefit from defense contracts and increasing demand for sustainable energy solutions.\n\n Key Points\n\n1. Institutional Confidence:\n   - 77% institutional ownership indicates strong confidence from large investors, but also potential for volatility.\n\n2. Strategic Opportunities:\n   - Potential contracts, such as with the Italian Air Force, and involvement in the burgeoning SMR market, provide significant growth opportunities.\n\n3. Operational Challenges:\n   - Closure of the Nuclear Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre (AMRC) poses a risk and may affect short-term operational stability.\n\n4. Growth Potential:\n   - Short-term growth of 10-15% is feasible, driven by positive developments in defense and energy sectors. Long-term growth could reach 20-30%, contingent on successful execution of strategic initiatives.\n\n Why Investors Should Research Further\n\n1. Economic Viability of SMRs:\n   - Assess the economic viability and market acceptance of SMR technology, a crucial factor for long-term growth.\n\n2. Institutional Actions:\n   - Monitor the actions of major institutional investors, as their decisions can significantly impact stock price.\n\n3. Market Conditions:\n   - Evaluate the broader market conditions, including geopolitical and economic factors that may influence the aerospace and defense industries.\n\n4. Company Announcements:\n   - Stay updated with the latest company announcements and financial reports to make informed investment decisions.\n\nInvestors are encouraged to conduct their own research to understand the risks and opportunities fully, considering their financial goals and risk tolerance.

And it's not like Huntington Ingall Industries (the company who owns NNSB) doesn't have their own shareholders to keep satisfied like Vogtle 3's construction companies do.",
