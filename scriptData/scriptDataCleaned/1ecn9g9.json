The econsystem is big enough for multiple exchanges to grow and be very profitable. Look at the semiconductor space, we have more than two dozen companies making billions a year in that ecosystem. $COIN has the advantage of being first and holding Bitcoin for institutions, no other exchange has that. Which means they're most likely to lead for years.\n\n2- $COIN's main advantage is not the exchange, it's the fact that it's the custodian holding Bitcoin for all big financial institutions who manage ETF's. \n\n3- Shitcoins are not a gauge of $COIN performance. They only rally during the euphoria phase of any bull cycle. which is the very last stage of the cycle. They're not rallying - as much - now because we're still in the early stages of this new Bitcoin bull cycle.\n\n4- There's still huge investor demand for $COIN because of options. Option trading is not available for spot ETFs, which means you can't hedge, sell covered calls or put in place any other portfolio management strategy with options.\n\nWith all of that being said, none of the reasons provided are sufficient enough to short $COIN. Shorting the largest publicly traded crypto exchange in a bull market is literally throwing money in a shredder.",
