PayPal was priced like a high growth tech stock, and then plummeted back to earth. And when you peak under the hood, it feels more like a bank stock than a tech stock. So a 15 pe for a tech stock is a tremendous value, but for a bank it’s actually kind of expensive. For example JPM is about a 12 pe. Could it break out? Maybe. Could it stagnate where it’s at? Also maybe. And for those reasons I haven’t pulled the trigger",

Hypothetically, if Paypal was able to spend $5 Billion per year on buybacks for 12 years, and the price remained steady between $55 and $60, they could buy back all but your shares, at which point you own the entire company. Obviously, this wouldn't happen, so the price would need to go up due to the increasing earnings per share.\n\nThe catch is it can take a long time for the market to catch up to intrinsic value. Like, 5+ years. They  could hypothetically buy back a third of their shares over the next 5 years, but if fear causes the stock to trade at a P/E of let's say 6-8, then the stock could still be cheaper than it is today.\n\nThe big question with Paypal is if their earnings will keep growing or at least stabilize. If the answer is yes, I think the stock will produce a really good return. If the answer is no, then it could go nowhere.\n\nI recently bought some shares between $58-60 because I like the stock.

This is compounded by retail investors selling mutual funds to buy ones that have performed better.\n\nContrarian/value investing can be really lucrative if you make the right bets, but you need to have a strong stomach, good temperament, and lots of patience.

Once on LUMN, once on PARA. Both times, it was because I based my investment on my assumption that management would operate the company the way I would. They instead found ways to destroy value, such as getting rid of profitable products to \"modernize and streamline\", invested in low/negative ROI projects that burned all their cash flow, sold assets at way too low of an EBITDA multiple, etc.\n\nMy advice is definitely make sure you have faith in the management to do the right thing.

      "body": ">Assuming a company can grow revenue, improve non gaap eps, at least keep their margins similar or the same, and do buybacks, does share price have to eventually go up?\n\nUm....abso-fucking-lutely not?\n\n* Revenue: improving revenue isn't a factor that a single ticker or management team has any control over - it's a function of an industry's TAM. It's not really something a company can \"grow\" at will....\n\n* EPS: if we assume that share count was reduced, earnings could be completely flat (or even down), which is generally \"bad\"\n\n* Reduces shares outstanding: modern valuation theory would counter by saying that capital structure has no bearing on valuation (save for certain distressed situations) - so, again, this one is firmly planted under the \"No\" header\n\nEven **if** - for example - revenue and earnings improved, doesn't necessarily indicate improved valuation. \n\nRevenue we've already addressed, but earnings can be misleading since it's an accrual accounting metric and share price is more dictated by operating cash flow than earnings.\n\nFor example, lets say earnings improved $500mm this quarter. That would seem good, on it's face. \n\nAh, but actually cracking open a filing and looking at the three basic financial statements, it looks like that $500mm net income improvement is purely from depreciation and impairment - two (cashless) hits to income - and EBITDA / cash flow from operations was in fact **down** $1bn (we'll assume from the $500mm adjustment on the SCF + an additional $500mm cash outflow from poorly managed net working capital).\n\nThat would seem like a pretty easy set of circumstances to qualify a shitty quarter for any company, regardless of industry.\n\nLet's do another example\n\nEarnings, revenue, and CFOps / EBITDA are all flat. But share price still goes down - why? \n\nAgain, looking at the SCF, you see a *massive* cash outflow in the CFI section and see that capex has skyrocketed this quarter, depleting cash reserves, and maybe forcing said company to cut their dividend. That would probably be a case of share price going down because, if anything, from the back-of-the-envelope DCF share price math that results from paying a huge slug of cash for capex in a single period (so no help from discounting those cash outflows), which might also drain your cash balance or secured revolver, hindering near term liquidity. Probably why the dividend got cut, and if said ShitCo was paying a divvy before, they are probably being valued (to some extent) on that yield.\n\nMoral of this story is this: if you're trying to beat the market by picking single name securities, there's no real shortcut to dissecting an earnings call by just focusing on two or three line items in the 10-Q. Everything matters.\n\nIf you don't believe me, read earnings call transcripts to see what sort of questions the equity research community is asking (closest thing to a shortcut I can offer up the stock picking brainlords in this thread that will ignore all of the above advice)",
