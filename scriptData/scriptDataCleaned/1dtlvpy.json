  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [US Labor Market Shows Signs of Losing Steam, Putting the Fed on Alert](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-02/fed-on-alert-for-us-labor-market-as-hiring-and-quitting-slow)\n\nOverall market sentiment: Fear (Author’s note: I’m going to try to include a general “good or bad” market sentiment from my opinion and see how it goes every day to gather data. Obviously I might just be doing coinflips but interested in what my opinions match up with market performance day to day.)\n\n \n\nI’ll likely not be posting on Wednesday because the market closes early, and those days are typically pretty slow. Happy early fourth of July everyone!\n\n**TSLA-** Released Q2 TSLA delivery numbers: 15% growth compared to last quarter, 5% year over year. We broke the 220 level premarket after I wrote this so will see where this goes at the open.\n\n**CHWY-** SEC filing reveals 6.6% stake by DFV (yesterday’s news). We saw this sell off at the open, I’m watching the $25 level but selling could return.\n\n**PARA-** Up from news of potential streaming merger talks, potentially with Max.\n\n**NVO-** Government to urge cut prices on Ozempic/Wegovy medications\n\n**NKE-** Earnings last Thursday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. We never bounced at the open yesterday but I have a small position in this, likely going to hold this for a swing trade.   \n\n**AMZN-** I know I said I’d take this off the list yesterday but we’re STILL near that $200 level. Set my price alerts so I’ll be aware when we near that price.  \n\n \n\n ",

I have a question for ya outside of today's watchlist if that's ok with you. \n\nWhat platform do you use for your trading? I just started out with Fidelity this week and have been having trouble getting familiar with its functions. I feel like I've gotten too accustomed with more visually pleasing / intuitive platforms like robinhood. I felt like I needed to get more serious and learn a more professional platform, but its been a struggle to learn it all. Would love to hear what you use and prefer!",
