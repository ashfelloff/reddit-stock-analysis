Had a little bit to play with in the market the last 2 years or so but have been hovering around 3-4k in my portfolio without a lot of movement for a while.\n\n\nAnd now, in the last 4 trading days, I am up 25k. Life changing money for me. Just shy of enough to pay off the debts I have been carrying and stretching out for half a decade. And I have had no discernable emotional reaction to that at all. I'm thinking it's because I haven't cashed out yet and am well aware of the fact that I could lose most of it if I'm not smart. Seeing that money in my checking account is probably going to make me cry but right now it's hard to accept that it's real.",
