Spitballing, I put out SPY at 650, QQQ at 700, and IWM at 250. \n\nThis will all happen before the mother of all crashes...I could not be more serious about this part. The blowoff top is a \"maybe.\" The epic 60%+ crash is a \"definitely.\" Not a matter of if, but when. SPY will 100% be back down to under 200 before the epic collapse finally bottoms out. \n\nReasoning? PE ratios matter. Now and always. Right now, the S&P is at 29, earnings are around 190, and S&P is closing in on 5500 (SPY 550). There will be a serious recession...the only way inflation will be sustainably brought down. The Fed will not react quick enough and monetary policy takes a long time to work (lag of at least a year). In a strong recession, earnings drop by 50% or more. Conservatively, I'm saying they drop to 100 (less than 50%). PE ratios are at BEST 15 during severe recessions (they often have gone into the single digits historically). If we say 15 PE ratio and 100 earnings, this actually translates to an S&P 500 price of 1500 (SPY at 150). And honestly in a huge crash this could be conservative...\n\nThe time of the bear is nearly here! Enjoy it while you can bulls ![img](emote|t5_2th52|8882)![img](emote|t5_2th52|53057)",
