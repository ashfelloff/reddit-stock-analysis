You can constantly research stocks for the rest of your life and not find everything out. \n\nLook at it this way, you know for a fact what doesn't work, what will? I studied analysts, books, free online software years before I even dropped a dime into stocks. Then when I did, I lost almost all of it. \n\nI'm not a millionaire, I'm not a pro, I don't do this for a living. But I have made more money than I have lost at this point. Just cover your bruise and wipe your scratches, get back up and become more powerful.  You know what doesn't work and with a bit of studying you'll learn what does.",
