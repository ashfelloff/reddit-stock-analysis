As a result, your option becomes less valuable.\n\nTheta gang refers to the people selling you the option. Call sellers: “the price will not rise above a certain price”. Put sellers: “the price will not fall below a certain price”\n\nWhen you buy your option, it has a Greek symbol called “theta”. It dictates how much your option loses value every day.
