  "title": "UPDATE: I lost my life savings shorting copper & a naked call was assigned to me + margin called",
  "score": 7377,
  "selftext": "A few weeks ago, I posted on this sub about how I shorted copper because I thought the price of it would crash due to the public backlash of how low quality the bronze metal at the Olympics was. I thought it was an intelligent investment decision and not a gamble (because bronze is composed of about 88% copper) but I got thousands of comments and dms telling me about how dumb my analysis was and that I should sell immediately and quit options.\n\nAt first I didn't really listen to these ppl because I was up a little bit on my positions, but then copper started mooning in price and i was down thousands out of nowhere, so I doubled down on my position thinking there was no way it could go higher and I took out some margin and bought more puts on a different strike price to average down, but it kept going higher. Currently I'm down about -$8.5k on my shorts.\n\nSince I only had about $400 of cash in my account left I decided to play around with 0DTE SPY options, I made a little money back initially, but then I woke up today and checked my account and somehow there was a naked call in my account that I didn't even buy, I was only trading long calls and puts but somehow it was in my portfolio and said that i needed to buy 100 shares of SPY as collateral immediately before it closes. I have no idea how this got there, I tried switching to a cash account but it said I had to close my margin positions first, so as the market closed, it automatically bought 100 shares of SPY and now I owe $56k to my brokerage. Im only 19 and essentially my life is ruined and I have no idea what to do or how I can ever repay this, I haven't even told my mom or dad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn0sfwybjvld1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=44426c7724c4bc2ed8e332dbf1586ed001a20ea2\n\n",

Certainly, but not life-ending ones. Are there things you can do? Absolutely, but none of them will happen over the weekend. Thankfully this is a holiday weekend so you have a whole extra day to not worry about it.\n\nFrom what is sounds like, your broker required you to buy 100 shares of SPY so that you would be able to honor your (previously) naked call in the event it was assigned. Since you sold a 0DTE option, you should already know whether the option was assigned or not because the shares either will or won't be in your account. Assuming they are (meaning the option expired unassigned), when the market opens on Tuesday you need to sell the 100 shares of SPY immediately regardless of the price. You may still end up with a bit of a loss depending on how the price moves, but it won't be anywhere near $56,000 and you can then move on with your life.\n\nFor future reference, when your broker told you that you needed to \"buy shares to cover the position or close the position immediately\", your choice should have been the second option.",
