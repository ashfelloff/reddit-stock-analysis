  "selftext": "Fellow regards,\n\nI’m here to help you understand why the recent 150% run-up in ASTS is not the end. Please see my previous DD here: https://redd.it/1cttca8\n\n\n\n**The tech is great! We’re past that now!**\n\n\n\nAny argument I might have in favour of the technology is essentially irrelevant. No analysis I provide is more valuable than the recognition of this technology through the commercial contracts:\n\nVerizon (29 May):\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240529554741/en/AST-SpaceMobile-and-Verizon-Announce-Plans-to-Target-100-Percent-Geographical-Coverage-of-the-Continental-United-States-from-Space-on-Premium-850-MHz-Cellular-Spectrum\n\nAT&T (15 May)\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240515925684/en/ATT-and-AST-SpaceMobile-Announce-Definitive-Commercial-Agreement\n\n “one deal is a fluke, two deals is a trend”\n\n\n\n**Why is this still going to run?**\n\n\n\nIf the trend continues, expect to see Mobile Network Operator (MNO) deals like this in other countries. Remember that the total addressable market is the entire planet, not just the US. As bankruptcy risk is priced-out of the stock through more deals, this has nowhere to go but up.\n\nDeutsche Bank PT: $22 \n(Note: PT estimate for 2026 and beyond above $120)\n\nB. Riley PT: $15 \n\nIf you really want to look at some insane valuation scenarios: https://transhumanica.com\n\n\n\n**FirstNet**\n\n\n\nBeyond just MNO deals, there is also a very real possibility that FirstNet will provide funding either directly or through AT&T to ASTS. Thus providing a government backstop to ensure the company remains afloat and able to provide what may become an essential emergency service. Have a look around the internet for discussion on FirstNet infrastructure plans.\n\n\n\n**Squeeze!?**\n\n\n\nSigh… there is a real possibility that a number of shorts are brutally underwater after today’s 69% gain. \n\nSome 39 million shares were reported short only a week ago. While it’s possible they’ve covered through the 100 million shares traded today, it’s also possible that some are trapped and some forced buying may yet begin. However, this is a real business and not purely a meme play, so it’s not subject to the same group delusion as some of the other WSB favourites.\n\n\nGod speed. This is obviously not financial advice.\n\nEDIT: premarket share price up 6.5% on 1.5 million in volume suggests that this ride is not over…",
