A brokerage approves options trading at their discretion, but again it's based wholly on the client's self-reported investment experience.  Here are the levels/requirements where I am now, which are less restrictive than any other broker I've been affiliated with.\n\nEach level allows all the levels below it.\n\nLevel 1 - allows writing covered calls and buying puts to hedge.\n\nLevel 2 - allows buying of calls and puts.\n\nLevel 3 - allows spreads (kinda weird since these would generally be safer than single options) - requires margin and $25k min balance.\n\nLevel 4 - adds equity put writing - requires margin and $25k min balance.\n\nLevel 5 - adds index put writing - requires margin and $100k min balance.\n\nOur margin rates are also sky high - something like 12.5% right now unless you have a big account.\n\nI'm not really sure how hard it is to get approval for these levels, I've only ever done levels 1 and 2.\n\nMy guess is if someone did have a fair amount of money and said they has a high level of general investment knowledge/experience, and a lot of prior options experience they would get level 5 easily.  Those aren't the kinds of clients I ever ever want to work with, so I'll never know.\n\nI've seen other B/Ds with much more restrictive access.  So yes, it is quite crazy that robinhood let's people do whatever they want with zero experience.  I imagine it will catch up with them eventually.

Stop looking how how much money you lost and start looking at percentages. \n\nSecondly, stop trading often. The lesser trades you do the better off you will be. You have enough money where you can really purchase long dated options without having to worry if you can afford it or not. For example, we have a big dip right now and maybe it’ll go on for a little bit longer but it’s a good time to start averaging into 510-520 calls for end of year. 3-5 contracts and purchase them over the next couple of weeks. \n\nThird, take your wins at 15-40%. Don’t get greedy and wait for the 1000% return. Options move against you at all times so take your gains off the table and let one contract ride if you want to risk some more. Otherwise take all gains off the table and wait for another time. \n\nFourth, don’t jump into a play fast. Look at daily charts to get an idea of where things are going. Then you can look at the 5 min chart for a good entry price. Someone else here said to not chase the move that has been made. \n\nLastly, if you share more info about your actual trades, people on here might be able to give you a better idea about what you did wrong. You have to first admit that you’re making mistakes, and then you can accept or take an action plan on how to fix them moving forward.",
