The economics of Starship are just absurdly exciting, they have a crazy moat, and Starlink looks like a monster business in the making. They're almost too dominant at what they do, and they're still driving hard to make it harder to compete with them. If they hit their targets with starship, their cost per kilo to orbit will be low enough for much of the US middle class to be able to afford a ticket, which should serve as an enabling technology for whole new industries (not just passenger traffic, but material to orbit in general will be so much cheaper that suddenly a lot of things that seem insane currently will become feasible).\n\nAlso really interested, but much lower conviction, in Anduril, Palmer Luckey's new defense contracting company. Looking over what they're building, I think they're making exactly what the US needs for a conflict with China, when most of the defense industry is still building expensive, low volume weapons that won't be maintainable in a peer conflict with heavy attrition. They massively outclass us in production capacity, especially shipbuilding. We might not have the industrial capacity to keep up on cheap AI-driven drone warfare, either, but it's much higher leverage, so it gives us a shot. Defense is also a bit farther outside my professional experience, though, so I'm less confident that I understand that market well enough to make the right calls there. But I think they could do to the defense contractors what SpaceX did to ULA (who're currently trying to sell themselves for peanuts).",

By that same logic you could go back to the point that Nixon removed gold’s convertibility and gold would be up over 71x in nominal terms which would make it one of the best investments of all-time. The peak in the early 80s was short-lived and was due to an overallocation into gold because of sustained inflation. Like most markets, it corrected downward and actually went too far in correcting after England and Canada drove the price down by selling off their central bank reserves. \n\nOverall gold is not a substitute for equities, but it is not a scam and can act as both a safe-haven for savings (as opposed to pure cash that loses value or bonds with a low fixed rate of return) or as an investment in environments with high inflation, high government debt, and bullish market forces (ex: central bank buying versus selling). Yes it carries risk, but everything does. Even “risk-free” treasury bonds carry risk if they are locked in at a lower rate than the price of inflation which was a major contributor to the regional bank crisis in Spring 2023.",
