Im curious, what's your counter argument to this:\n\n\nIntel likely goes up, but not as fast as its peers, or other options available to traders. Because of this, the trader who wants to make the most money wouldn't short Intel (INTC goes up, but not much) but instead, dump their money into NVDA. Hell, INTCs 5 year trend is worse the fucking T-Bills.\n\n\nJust to illustrate my point, in the last 5 days Intel is up 2.5%, while NVDA is up a comfortable 16%. Intel has historically crabbed its way along, why would this trend have a sharp reversal after GETTING ANNIHILATED a week ago?",

Like, maybe in another couple of years? But in that case, I think I'd rather wait for a while longer still and park my money someplace else for now. What do you see as a short term force for upward movement, besides tiny retail buying the dip?\n\nAny invasion of Taiwan is going to crush stocks across the board.

It's a failure of both geopolitical and historical analysis; people forget that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany had a substantial level of trade with one another for years before the onslaught of Operation Barbarossa in 1941.\n\nAdditionally, there's undoubtedly some hope that the Chinese economy will finally have its prophesied collapse sometime between now and 2049. It's obviously not impossible but in fact it only makes war likelier, as the CPC will want to initiate a military conflict while they still have a localised relative military advantage.",

When you have a captive market and there is no short or medium term replacement, it doesn't matter if you make mistakes.\n\nAs an example, remember the Samsung S7 that exploded? It was a fiasco for Samsung and they took a hit due to having a fierce competition that could replace them in a very short period with similar products (that didn't explode).\n\nTesla is still riding the brand confidence they made, but that margin is closing fast. In the US and abroad there are very competent brands putting good products and the error margins will be much smaller.",

I'm pretty well aware comparatively to the general public about their shortcomings, investments, divestments, roadmaps, performance, and general outlook.\n\nI've made several comments on WSB on pro-Intel posts lately as well. Fact remains, they have been run through the ground, their employees are not competitively paid, they have been riding on old architecture for far too long.\n\nX86 will always print for them as enterprise apps are far too dependent on X86 but AMD also holds the X86 license. So Intel is not immune from capitulation on that front.\n\nFurthermore, r/sysadmin has lately been discussing AMD as viable options more and more and we're seeing critical acceptance for AMD based desktops, laptops, and server based processors. This is Intel's bread and butter.\n\nIntel has also made a series of decisions to acquire or build units and then later divest or shutdown areas with significant potential such as their Optane memory business, MobileEye and other investments like ARM stock. While ARM stock wasn't much in total, the need in desperation to raise captial is extremely bearish news to me.\n\nPat Geisinger's insider buying actions to me also appear to be deeply  bearish in consideration that the stock is at a 20 year low, and that he is making very small purchases of Intel stock relative to his annual salary. It's not a big bet.\n\nOver the last year it has become clear to me that Intel has quickly unraveled and has been covering up greater issues. As an Intel shareholder, I am deeply displeased. I have so much more to say, including their investments in AI with Gaudi chips, reliance on TSMC but I will end with this:\n\nIf 18A on time or is further delayed by over a year or two, Intel will be a $10/share stock.",
