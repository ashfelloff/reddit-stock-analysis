Their next generation — if they beef up their platform — is where the competition starts. But that’s really true of LEO in general right now. We are really in the infancy.\n\nBut with the successful tests of starship and super heavy’s pretty rock solid reusability getting established, the shift to higher capabilities LEOs could happen quickly… like very quickly.\n\nHave to keep an eye on the startups too — astranis, G60, iSpace, Bigblu Broadband, Digiweb, Maxis Communications and Constellation Networks all have viable business models that could take advantage of the launch cost reduction. \n\nIt’s going to be interesting to see how SpaceX operates when they operate the platform of their market and cash flow interrupting competitors.

The market can be fickle and ASTS is probably due a correction after that massive run, but what they will do is go back up again and keep climbing because, my broke friend, I can spot a diamond when it's glaring at me. You'll probably just keep YOLO'ing $50 a month into stocks already hugely over-valued and at their ATH.\n\nThat's why I can make bets of $145K into a penny stock ('lucky' my ass, I've been doing this for years) and you're a broke bitch who thinks $145K is such an astronomically high figure the other person has to be 'lying.'",
