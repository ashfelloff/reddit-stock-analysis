It’s the only place I’ve been in Asia where the food is actually better in America.\n\nIf go grab some Banh Mi or Pho in say Texas or British Columbia it’ll be better than what I could get in say Saigon or Chau Doc. This isn’t true for Thai, Korean, Indonesian or Chinese food. IDK why the food in Vietnam is so bad it doesn’t make since but 90% of the time it is less than okay.
