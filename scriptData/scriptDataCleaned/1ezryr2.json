Find something with the lowest fee possible that tracks the total market. Dump all your money in there and forget about it. It's really that easy.\n\nYou won't get rich quick, but you will get rich slow. Slow and steady wins the race, don't get greedy seeing the lucky ones making risky plays and winning.
