According to historical data, it should probably be a big boom and it should overcome the earnings expactions and so it could or rather should skyrocket, but I'm not sure, since I've lost some money on cfds and am much more cautious about this kind of investing.",

If you have a company like NVDA that has been in the spotlight the whole year and we all know is making a ton of money, whether they beat expectation by 500 million or many billions, it doesn’t really matter, the questions about the company are not gonna be answered in the next or even the next two earnings. Now if you have another company that has POTENTIAL to earn a lot of money but has not yet and they have a lot of questions surrounding their chances of growing revenue enough or becoming profitable and they beat expectations then that stock has a much higher chance of shooting upwards because that earnings answers some of the questions",

The next step in AI is not to continue to purchase more processing power, its to find valuable ways to leverage the massive ML farms they have in house.\n\nNVDA has already sold the gold miners the pickaxes, if those people strike it rich NVDA will only see more profits when they decide to upgrade those farms. Thats the big catch here, if companies can't leverage all this computing power to add significant revenue they will not be going back to NVDA for round 2. Its cyclical by nature and NVDA could very well be at or near the peak right now. There is no guarantee when the next cycle will be or if they will remain as dominant as they are.\n\nAlso you can just look at macrotrends and financials. NVDA revenue is up 200% yoy which is in no way sustainable unless we are heading into double Argentina levels of inflation. NVDA p/e is currently sitting at 66 which, if you subscribe to the Ben Graham school of thought, implies that not only would NVDA maintain the current massive earnings bump but they would also expect to see around 29% additional earnings growth yoy. \n\nI like NVDA as a company, they currently hold a massive advantage over everyone else in their field, but i struggle to see a future where not only does the AI hype train continue to boom, NVDA also has to manage to squeeze even more growth out of this wave for the next 5-10 years every year. It's just completely unreasonable IMHO. \n\nYeah it might not happen this earning call, the numbers are going to look incredible, but it won't hold for long.\n\nI may be early but I'm not wrong.",
