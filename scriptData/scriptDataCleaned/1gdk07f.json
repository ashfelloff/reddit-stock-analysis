They only own seven aircraft outright. 7. Out of 200+ in the fleet. They've essentially pawned and hocked nearly everything they got. \n\nThis past weekend They announced they will save about half a billion dollars by canceling future aircraft orders through 2026, and selling off some of their existing fleet.
