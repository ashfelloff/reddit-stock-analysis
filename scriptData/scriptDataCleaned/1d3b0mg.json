These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade.

          "body": "Sorry for the late reply, been busy today.\n\nI suppose I misworded that slightly- on a normal day, it's better to trade stocks that are volatile. How much do you anticipate a bond ETF to change in a day? Probably +/- 1% max a day!\n\nSo yes, volatility (from catalysts, usually) is what I'm looking for. HOWEVER, sometimes stocks that are good longterm investments are ALSO good candidates for day trading.\n\nFor example, today SMMT was great for trading, but there's 0% chance I'd hold this for the long term because small biotech companies are so fraught with their drug trials failing.\n\nYes, trading AAPL is \"safer\" than trading GME, but there's a line between taking risk and taking unnecessary risk. May was great for trading GME, and gave outsized premium for taking risk (like shorting it when it was anywhere over 50). If I tried day trading AAPL with the same aggression I would likely lose a lot of money doing so.",
