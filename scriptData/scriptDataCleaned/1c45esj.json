  "selftext": "*TL;DR: Just look at the image with the three scenarios.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  \nYou should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.\n\nIran's bold strike—a direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies—has marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.\n\nThis escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).\n\nGiovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:\n\n>Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.\n\nPrices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.\n\n>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.\n\nAccording to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:\n\n>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in — benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran’s diplomatic compound in Syria.\n\nHere's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  \nI should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  \nIt won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.\n\nAs for the closing numbers from Friday:\n\nCL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  \nNG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  \nRB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  \nHO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  \nI can only control what I do.\n\nIf Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers—those who rely on oil prices.\n\nSo far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.\n\nThat's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  \nMy thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  \nThose who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  \nAnd also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.\n\nI will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  \nIf she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.\n\nAnd I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  \nUnless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  \nThere are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHave a good day.\n\nP.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war—or the potential of war—can move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me.",

          "body": "During [Operation Martyr Soleimani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Martyr_Soleimani), the number of missiles launched against the Al-Asad airbase and the Erbil base is disputed, with figures ranging between 13 and 22.\n\nOver the weekend, Iran launched 300 aerial threats against Israel, with approximately 130 of them being ballistic missiles and an estimated 30 cruise missiles.\n\n>If they wanted to start something, they would sent a parade of ballistic missiles (similar to those that hit the US base last year)\n\nSo... I mean, even if you're only considering the ballistic missiles, 130 is more than 22.  \nBut sure, why let facts get in the way of your \"view.\"",
