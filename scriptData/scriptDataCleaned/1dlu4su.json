Add to that an interesting $2B “other” income expected in March 2025 for the divestment of the NAND business, and you’ve got a nice mid to late 2025 ramp. Foundry is how Intel wins whether AMD is or their own chips get preferred; in fact, the CEO is already luring multiple companies away from TSMC with their new EUV process. \n\n[old DD being being to suppress price](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/DB-N/pressreleases/19937002/heres-why-intels-profits-could-soar/)",
