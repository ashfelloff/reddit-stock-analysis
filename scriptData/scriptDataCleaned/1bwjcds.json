  "selftext": "Story time! So, I wanted to make some tendies from the obvious pending implosion of DJT, but with option premiums being absurd, I decided to sell a bear credit spread on Wednesday:\n\nUpper leg - bought 47.5 Call 5/17 x10  \nLower leg - sold 32.5 Call 5/17 x10\n\nI got $9k credit for it, so, if no assignments happened, max pain was $6k loss and max profit was $9k. Since there was a 99.9% probability of DJT tanking, I thought this was a pretty good deal.\n\nOn Thursday, some psycho exercised 7 of of my 10 lower legs and assigned me a -700 short position, basically handing my about $3500 premium for free... then I rolled the upper leg for those to a closer strike and further OTM just to keep some insurance on the position and got back another \\~$3500  while keeping my short. Then I sold some April 19th 45P's for $6.75 a pop (which may have been premature, but that premium looked very juicy).\n\nI figure I can eat the borrowing fee for now and offset it with all the premiums I've collected while watching this dumpster fire go down.\n\nNow, why the FUCK would anyone exercise 5/17 32.5C's on this garbage with so much time left on these? Are they just wanting to hold this crap long term and collect the borrowing fees or something? Just makes no sense why they'd burn so much premium to hold those shares.\n\nThanks for listening! Current DJT positions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fphl4kdi7osc1.png?width=2744&format=png&auto=webp&s=8d9ea4dd9c7087d96fd57fdd14ef6e9df2895d66\n\n&#x200B;",

You sold those calls near intrinsic (you definitely did not get $3500 premiums for free ‚Äî what did you sell your bottom leg for and what was the underlying at the time)  and now your short position is costing you about 500% borrow, so approximately 700\\*45\\*500%/365 = $430 / day.\n\nYou‚Äôre going to learn now why you can‚Äôt sell low strike calls on high borrow stock.\n\nEDIT: i found our hero's trades.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lcka3xd7qosc1.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=c68f0ebe91e36c491df35ec8ff8996aff85ceaab\n\nso, note that OP sold $32.50 strike calls for \\~$16.50 (there are only 2 blocks of 10 contract trades that day). at the time, stock was trading for \\~$50 so he actually immediately *lost* \\~$1 / share (because he sold $32.50 + $16.50 = $49 stock and stock was at $50). the contract holder (probably a market maker) exercised to immediately take $700 from OP (so that answers why they would exercise against OP). now OP is stuck paying \\~60c / share or \\~$431 / day for 700 shares of borrow.\n\nbut also he sold 4/19 45P's which are now trading at \\~$10 so he's lost \\~$300/contract on those.\n\noptions trading is tricky. the real mad man here is OP who thinks he's the smart one in the trade.",

You're now stuck in a position where you are borrowing 700 shares of a stock with extremely high IV, so it'll have extremely high borrowing costs.
