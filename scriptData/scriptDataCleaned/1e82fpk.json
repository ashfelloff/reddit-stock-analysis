At 12 weeks that assuming perfect efficiency and not accounting for lunch etc would complete 9000 units. And I'm saying companies will need contractors because you still need day to day ops to do their thing. You can't have infrastructure just grind to a halt and divert all of them to repair this. We are going to see tens of thousands of temp job postings to fix this just in the US alone.\n\nNo IT department worth their salt will take crowdstrike after this, not even if crowdstrike paid them to sign on and would be willing to go through the removal process as much as that will suck.
