What did they get for it?  Last quarter they *lost* $7.2 billion in free cash flow.  \n\nThat's their reward for spending $158 billion.  \n\nYou just turned $600 into $57k.  You think that's a pretty good performance, and you'd be right about that.  What if I gave you $158 billion to play with?  Would you be pleased with your own performance, if your performance was exactly the same as Intel's?  [They're supposed to be on 2nm by now.](https://www.kitguru.net/components/cpu/anton-shilov/intel-no-change-in-10nm-schedule/)  They're where they were planning to be in 2018, except the chips don't work.\n\nThis is a company that just last year took $20 billion in Dem government subsidy and just now laid off 15% of its workforce.  Can you say biting the hand that fed you?  There is a strong argument to make that INTC is in fact a zombie company and that its backers are quickly losing the will to continue propping it up.",

They themselves have said profitability with that foundry shouldn't be expected before 2030 and those chips are rumored for first half of 2025 but let's see how much more investor money they can dig with a 50% drop in stock price and suspension of their dividend to save money\n\n[https://www.anandtech.com/show/21504/intel-18a-status-update-first-chips-booting-first-external-customer-tapeout-in-h125](https://www.anandtech.com/show/21504/intel-18a-status-update-first-chips-booting-first-external-customer-tapeout-in-h125)\n\nLittle bitch boy Patty G also thinks he's Nvidia's Jenson by betting on 18A so even then it'll be fun to know this train is going down even harder\n\n[https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-ceo-admits-ive-bet-the-whole-company-on-18a/](https://www.pcgamer.com/intel-ceo-admits-ive-bet-the-whole-company-on-18a/)\n\nFunny enough both articles also mention something along the lines of this\n\n\"The other reason why 18A is so important to Intel is that it's the main target node for its ambitious plans to become the second biggest customer foundry in the world by 2030.
