  "selftext": "Wiz has walked away from a $23 billion deal to be acquired by Google, in what would have been the search giant’s largest ever deal, telling employees it would pursue an initial public offering as it initially planned.\n\n“Saying no to such humbling offers is tough,” Wiz co-founder Assaf Rappaport said in a memo obtained by CNBC to the company’s worldwide employee base.\n\nThe deal would have nearly doubled the $12 billion valuation of the startup from its most recent round of funding. Wiz was founded in 2020 and has grown at a rapid speed under Rappaport, who had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May. A person familiar with the company’s thinking cited both antitrust and investor concerns as part of the motivation behind the decision to walk away.\n\nWiz’s cloud security products include prevention, active detection and response — a range that has appealed to large firms and would have helped Google compete with Microsoft which also sells security software.\n\nCNBC reported in July on the talks between Google and Wiz.\n\nThe company reportedly hit $100 million in annual recurring revenue after 18 months, and achieved $350 million in annual recurring revenue in 2023. It’s backed by a roster of blue-chip firms, including Israeli venture capitalist Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.\n\nGoogle successfully acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion in 2022. Google’s largest deal remains the acquisition of hardware maker Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, which it ended up selling to Lenovo for $2.9 billion in 2014. As recently as last week, Google reportedly ended conversations to acquire sales software maker HubSpot.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/google-wiz-deal-dead.html",

Which was difficult to solve because Groupon has no way to know a discount rate that is good for a business promotion without overwhelming them, but also able to drive enough new customers.
