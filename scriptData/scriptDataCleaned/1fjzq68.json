  "selftext": "Check my previous post 10 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/qJjoG5Diai) that we will never ever experience another -50% market decline because the feds & the gov are ready to go balls deep in this economic war against the evil axis. \n\nThey will never let the US stock market fail. The only asset that has outperformed inflation time after time has always been the stock market. \n\nWe're already creepin towards stagflation and the only people that gets f*ked are the ones who don't invest. The future of wealth preservation is not savings or CDs or treasuries, get f*ked, it's the stock market. \n\nWe are entering a new phase of the grand US economy and it is the phase of grand dellusion and mass hysteria of inflated wealth. \n\nWelcome to the new world order b*tches!\n________________________\n\n\n\n**Edit: Vote this sh*t up my regards. We need to spread this misinformation so the market never crashes. Then we get our lambos. Everybody gets one.**\n\n**edit 2: 4000 upvotes baby, get this sh*t to roaringkitty status. Let's make history, the rich ain't gonna get rich without us. We gonna get a slice of the pie**\n\n\n**edit 3: while you guys are at it, i wanted to share that r/economy is runned by prochina CCP cronies posting misinformation & chinese propaganda, banning anyone who speaks up against them especially this kid > u/wakeup2019 He gets others banned for calling him out but he never gets banned for harassing others. Go sh*t on him.**",
