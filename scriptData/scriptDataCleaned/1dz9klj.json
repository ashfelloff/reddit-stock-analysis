Booms/X/Y were all facing asset downturns, liquidity issues, credit drying up, and folks losing jobs if they could even land one. Job market was so bad folks were PAYING employers to get UNPAID INTERNSHIPS in hopes of getting the needed exp to land an unpaid internship that would lead to a job. Not getting $50-80K fastfood managerial jobs without a HS degree or quitting to land another job with +20% wage increase by 5pm the same afternoon.\n\nEven without inflation. MAG7 should be enough to show how much the world has fucking changed because of tech. Those same MAG7 are disproportionately represented in the QQQ. 2007 was the first Iphone. Youtube was founded in 05 and bought in 06. Deepmind didn't come until 2014. NVDA was a video game play. TSLA was so so far from what it is today that EVs were a joke. MSFT was big but not multi-tentacle the behemoth of today (even without AI). NFLX was still a mail DVDs company and barely started their streaming service in 07. Facebook didn't even IPO yet so we can't even get to Insta. Amazon Prime was launched in 05, running huge P/E with [miniscule EPS](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/pe-ratio), streaming came in 06, wholefoods in 17, and  they were dominant in only a few things instead of [fucking taking over the fucking world.](https://d3jlwjv6gmyigl.cloudfront.net/images/2020/04/Amazon-is-at-war-with-everyone.jpg)\n\n>\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"with very little actual economic growth\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n\nJust the fact that they would say that companies in the QQQ aren't MASSIVELY better than in 2008 just goes to show how much of a fucking mentally stunted clown/troll/ they are.",
