The World Federation of Advertisers (WFA) through its GARM initiative may be acting inconsistent with U.S. antitrust laws and congressional intent by coordinating GARM members’ efforts to demonetize and eliminate disfavored content online. \n\n>Evidence obtained by the Committee suggests that GARM members, led by Steer Team members, are colluding to demonetize conservative platforms and voices. This coordination does not always revolve around “brand safety” and “harmful” content as GARM publicly claims, but instead the desire to censor conservative and other views that GARM members disfavor. Communications reviewed by the Committee directly connects the major corporations with these efforts.\n\nAnd if you think that all sounds stupidly corrupt, think about what will happen once Trump can start pumping out executive orders again.\n\nThat's the only reason Truth Social isn't a penny stock right now. Its current value is tied to the probability that Trump will win the election and the stock will moon when he starts passing crazy ass laws like forcing the government to use Truth Social, forcing advertisers to advertise on it, and throwing monkey wrenches into the competition. Elon won't be so happy once Trump is fucking X to pump DJT.",

Only phase 2 entails releasing any sort of app to consumers.\n\n*\"In recent weeks, as part of its TV streaming initiative, TMTG signed contracts with its first data center partner to host its own TV content distribution network.
