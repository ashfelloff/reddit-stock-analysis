Instead, they're responding with \"We're assessing the situation and will get back to you on this.\"\n\nIt could end up being a Cyberpunk situation, where blanket refunds were offered by Steam, and that was precisely what tanked CDPR stock.\n\n200,000 people changed their review scores on Steam to negative. A lot of them did enjoy the game, but have been playing for 3 months and would gladly accept a full refund.\n\nFurther, this could prevent Sony from boosting its PSN numbers through this tactic, which is presumably what investors wanted to hear.\n\nIt will hurt the stock. The only question is how much. Sony is not just a videogame company and it would be foolish to short it without studying how it has moved based on other videogame related news.\n\nEDIT: Sony announced PSN will not be required for PC players. This avoids further refunds, but it means the whole strategy to onboard PC players to PSN is dead. This was important to their growth strategy, so that's dead too.",

So they mandate it. Problem is that PSN isn’t supported in many countries which means those people won’t be able to play the game now. Steam is offering a full refund to such customers. Community is pissed and people are out with pitchforks. Heck, even the developers of the game said to protest against Sony of something in a cryptic way lol. \n\nTo be honest, there are work arounds like creating a PSN account in a different country. There is technically no payment required and Sony is lax on regional account so for the most part, most of those people will still be able to play it but the dinosaurs at Sony can’t take a win they got out of nowhere without putting their foot in their mouth as usual.",

Its visible in the options menu under Account. When someone reports in game, it will be connected to a unique identifier already. Adding a PSN account doesn't overcome the issue of having a non-unique Steam Name as the primary identifier. If someone reports player behavior outside of the game, they would have no way to definitively link that report to a PSN, because that info isn't displayed for other players to see. \n\n\n\nThat hasn't been a dominating topic in the group discussion around this, but Sony is not a great manager of bans and appeals. A lot of their appeals process involves gathering very sensitive information about the account owner. \n\nAs an anecdote: my original PSN account was stolen after one of the hacks that hit Sony. I had some digital-only games attached to the account, so I tried to get it back. They wanted a copy of my government issued ID, a copy of my credit card statement showing purchases made for the account and the last 4 digits of my saved card.
