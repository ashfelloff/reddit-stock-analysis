I wish I could email you contents of 2 tickets I had to manage towards MS about a product not working properly. After I repeatedly provided very specific info about everything needed, they were just walking in circles, not providing any resolution, dragging over 3 weeks and then just closing the ticket even after I said the issue was not even close to being resolved. \n\nThen I had to suffer through 45 min call of broken English at the end of which the agent refused to end the meeting before he saw me give him 5 stars on his review of performance (I didn't) and started calling me names lmao. \n\nThere was a time when things could take a bit long but you would eventually reach an expert on the given product/issue and it'd get resolved. Not true today. \n\nOr is there any newer experience of yours different?\n\nEdit: and yes MS sql has been out there for how long? Everything runs on it. Of course they need to do at least this well.
