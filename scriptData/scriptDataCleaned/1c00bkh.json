The CAD on Feburary 28 made monthly highs around 74 cents to the us dollar, the same time that US oil inventories are at the highest for the month. \n\nTomorrow, the CAD central bank will be reporting national interest rates to be unchanged, like other countries. The CAD will sell off, increase the value of the US dollar, and increase oil prices even if the reported actual crude oil inventories are above the forecast. That is because crude oil inventories will likely be below what we saw on March 7th.\n\n7 hours ago, Biden administration has held off on buying back additional crude oil due to 'rampant inflation'. \n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-pulls-back-replenishing-us-124918687.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-pulls-back-replenishing-us-124918687.html)\n\nHe definitely will need to replenish reserves in the near future even if he holds off on purchases at the present moment.",
