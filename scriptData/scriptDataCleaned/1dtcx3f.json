However, if you inverse WSB/retail at the right moments, I think you can actually get the odds in your favor. When retail is all-in on something and cultishly bullish, it usually goes down and vice versa. There's no perfect equation for it. It's a little bit art, little bit science. But there's no doubt in my mind that you can get an edge this way.",
