                      "body": "That‚Äôs crazy. My goal here is to show yall a six figure gain porn on 0DTE SPY contracts.\n\nNow I‚Äôm probably gonna take a one or two week break. Unless there‚Äôs some earnings I wanna try, but otherwise gonna step back. Maybe put something in Monday, just for a little heat check üòÇ let me know what you think of this play. You not entertained? Buzz light year motto!\n\nBreaking this down tho, we‚Äôve seen SPY push hard for awhile. And this month we‚Äôve seen it bounce back to 530 already. So after yesterday‚Äôs dip to 522, I decided I wanted to buy something next early(this) morning (It‚Äôs the weekend, who knows what will happen). So I ended up opening up my platform late, and the price is 524 already. I‚Äôm thinking, I knew it, should‚Äôve got there earlier, but I still think it‚Äôll go up tho and I‚Äôm willing to eat the theta decay of holding for a few hours.\n\nSo I put in my first trade, and here I took a nap for an hour and woke up and saw the price was 519or so. I couldn‚Äôt believe it- I lost 1k. I convinced myself to buy with the theta decay stuff earlier but deep down I knew I was gonna hold it to expiration, (sometimes SPY flips in those last moments). But I‚Äôm also thinking, if it just goes up a bit and it does all that work and I just breakeven, well that‚Äôs a waste.\n\nSo I put in the next trade; if you‚Äôre holding a trade for a reason, I think it‚Äôs ok to double down a constant cost here to create new profit given the new price point. At worst you were gonna lose c, and now you‚Äôll lose 2c. Which if you‚Äôre smart c is small already. We‚Äôre kind of doing a Monty Hall with this double down. Did some errands and took another magic nap. Woke up to another chance at the table tomorrow. Play on! ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|yummy)",

The stupid thing is idk why I thought it‚Äôd go up, just an arbitrary decision I went to sleep with. But it either goes up down or stays the same. At the end of the day you‚Äôre just gambling on those three outcomes. Stress about technicals and imaginate flags idk but I just like to see the open and volume on contracts, basically just trying to see how the market is buying. Im gonna go out on a limb and say im a peter lynch - George soros type investor. At the end of the day playing SPY is like 3 person baccarat, it goes up down or stays the same, but once the price dips midday like that and you double down, now you change your play from up, to up and stays the same.
