  "score": 32,
  "selftext": "Let's say our criteria is that it is a competitor that stands to benefit from the antitrust probe *and* it is a decent company in it's own right.\n\nAMD just had a good earnings call and should benefit from the probe (if it is successful). What other companies could benefit? Is Intel a possible contender? Google with its TPUs? Or Apple, Amazon or Microsoft who are also likely to build their own AI solutions? Or some small companies like Graphcore, Cerebras Systems or Habana Labs?\n\nAlso, does the probe have to succeed in order for competitors to benefit? Or is simply the shadow of the probe enough to give these competitors enough breathing room to increase their chances of success.\n\nLove to hear your thoughts. Please note we're not here to debate whether this investigation is justified. Just want to know who could benefit.",
