  "selftext": "Does anyone have any opinions on if this is a good investment?\n\nGiven the recent AI boom everyone is focused on big players such as NVIDIA and AMD, but they are both supplied heavily by TSM for their chips. I don’t see much competition for TSM given they are so far advanced ahead of any American or Chinese competitor, and given the only increase in demand for AI technology, I don’t see how they wouldn’t grow.\n\nYes the stock is expensive right now, but given the growth opportunity I would argue there is still plenty of room for expansion.\n\nYes, China is a threat, but something tells me that China would not dare suffer the economic sanctions western nations would impose if they made a move in Taiwan.\n\nTrump has said he would likely put tariffs on the Taiwan semiconductor industry in order to grow domestic production, but still with tariffs, I don’t see big players switching to alternatives, as the gap between TSM and alternatives is very large.\n\nAny thoughts on TSM as an investment?",

My take is, eventually they will have enough production outside Taiwan to not consider the facilities in Taiwan critical anymore. If China ever invades, it will be at that point to reduce chances of US intervention.\n\nUS has vouched to destroy TSMC factories in Taiwan if China invades, meaning they lose their bleeding edge tech but the bulk of their production remains functional everywhere else. At that point stock would tank significantly, but will rise again eventually as TSMC recovers and reinvests somewhere else.\n\nI'm personally buying more next time there is a scare.
