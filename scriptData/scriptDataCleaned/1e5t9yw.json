              "body": "It isn't even a correction, but a rotation. The DOW was up 0.55% today. The market is selling tech to buy other assets. Volatility is to be expected when people sell 1 asset to buy another. \n\nIf you want to see the rotation in action, look at the small cap Russel index. That is index of small caps and it is up 10% in just July alone. The market is predicting rate cuts, which means the risk of small caps will go down. The market is now willing to take on the risk of these smaller companies, so they are selling tech to buy smaller companies. \n\nSmall caps are historically very volatile, but provide excellent returns in the long run. US small caps have beat the S&P 500 by like 3% annually (on average) for as long as we have data. But small caps (as an asset class), are the higher risk higher return assets that institutions are currently looking to get into when rates drop. Most will fail, but those that succeed will eventually become wildly successful and outweigh the losses.",
