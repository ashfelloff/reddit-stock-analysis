Risks until last week were cash, cash burn, and the need to raise money.  Cash burn will decrease and assuming VW delivers all of the money according to their timeline, this will be enough money until 27-28, the launch of the R2, the Illinois expansion, and the finishing of the GA plant.\n\nYear deliveries is expected to be flat and they have said time and time again not to expect anything notable with the RCV program until next year.  They could make an order announcement but obviously notable orders won‚Äôt be hitting customers until then.",
