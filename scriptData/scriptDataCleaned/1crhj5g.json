  "selftext": "Excuse the ignorance, but I was raised in an era of buy-side analysis when things like balance sheet ratios were taken into consideration.\n\nAt the end of Q1, this company had:\n~$600mm in cash and receivables \nAgainst ~ $530mm in AP and accrued expenses. \n\nSo maybe $70mm is left over after paying people and bills.\n\nThe company burns like $250mm in operating cash each quarter to keep the lights on.\n\nSo now we're at a $180mm deficit at 6/30/24.\n\nThe company had $1.1bb in inventory. Assuming they can advance 50% on their line of credit leaving a borrowing base (Assuming they haven't triggered the covenants to call the line due...) granting them $550mm with $270mm drawn on the line at 3/31 ) leaving $230mm of LOC against the $180mm deficit.  So they maybe have $50mm to play with to start Q3. Assuming their burn stays the same as nothing has fundamentally changed in this business, they have 2.5 weeks of runway to start Q3.\n\nWith that balance sheet any recap or bank financing is going to wipe out equity holders.\n\nThis isn't going to be a stock-which-cannot-be-named either since no one actually likes this company and the shorts are right to call this garbage. \n\nPosition:\n400 June 2024 $40 puts\n30 June 2024 $80 puts\n100 August $30 puts.\n\nEdit: Q1 not Q2 cash and receivables. \n",

First, their AI tools allow customers who might be dumb fucks still progress through the buying process thus allowing their labor costs low for customer acquisition.  Second, they had to heavily invest in their infrastructure to recondition and deliver retail sales but those systems are built.\n\nI don't know if it's bullshit or not but with zero retail locations they sold 1/3 Carmax's volume in Q1.  That's not nothing.  The big question for me is if that is a one time jump in growth or can that kind of growth continue.  If job postings mean anything Carvana has a lot of postings for the delivery side so maybe it's something they believe.\n\nMy own personal opinion is different.  I think the company is waaayy over valued for the short term and having spent 10+ years this could be a bias I admit.  The bias is I believe there is a finite number of people willing to buy a car sight unseen and with CarMax stores everywhere the growth will not be rapid.  I have to balance this bias with the Q1 results doing 1/3 CarMax's volume and the short term rate environment being tough for Carvana.  Then again they may pull some shit where they get SoFi cheap additional debt for warrants and offer special finance rates.  Those boys are innovative in a way that is pretty impressive.\n\nIf you put a gun to my head I would be buying EOY puts.  Otherwise I'm done losing money shorting this company.\n\nGood luck betting against a billionaire bud.  I really am rooting for ya to become the next Hello Kitty.",

(Im going off the most recent Q1-24 10-Q so feel free to correct me if there’s more recent info)\n\nFor starters, you claim that they have $600M of cash at the end of Q2. The end of Q2 is June 30, 2024. That date has not happened yet (which is why I think we may have different sources). Further, they’re not burning through operating cash. They just turned a profit in the most recent quarter. Albeit it looks like that was mainly due to revaluation of the fair value of warrants. But point stands, they weren’t exactly lighting money on fire. \n\nMost recent publicly available info is Q1-24 earnings, which has cash at $252M. That is down $250M from the $530M they reported as of 12/31/23. But why did their cash balance go down? It wasn’t payroll overencumbering the business. It was paying off a short term debt facility. $250M of which is due in the next 12 months. If they reeeeeally need cash, they can just issue equity. Tons of insider sales from guys at the top of this company who aren’t morons and know it’s overvalued. \n\nThey also have a couple lines of credit worth $1.5B and $600M. I believe these may be tied to asset (inventory) purchases but it’s late and I’m not going to dig that deep. All of this to say, there are several shitty things about this company and that’s why I’m short. It’ll be under $100 at some point by the end of the year. But I don’t think the 1-2 month payroll failure is remotely a possibility and I would hate to see a fellow CVNA bear lose the battle too quickly with June and August expiries.",
