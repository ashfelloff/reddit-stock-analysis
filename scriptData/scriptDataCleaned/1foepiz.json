  "score": 55,
  "selftext": "I think everyone here remembers the scandalous security issues with Okta (https://www.benzinga.com/opinion/24/09/40884059/oktas-costly-cyber-security-failures-a-60-million-lesson-in-transparency)\n\nThe biggest one was in 2021, when it was revealed that Okta employees could access customer data from their home laptops. Then LAPSUS wrote that they had gained access to Okta’s systems and could change passwords. For me, this is where Okta's ended.\n\nBut it didn’t end there for Okta. It also faced breaches affecting thousands of customers in 2022 and 2023 (https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/okta-says-hackers-stole-data-all-customer-support-users-cyber-breach-2023-11-29/). What I really can't get is how Okta is still on the market with such problems.\n\nIs this some kind of annual event? Are we expecting another breach this year? Or when do you think Okta will finally reach a breaking point for them?",
