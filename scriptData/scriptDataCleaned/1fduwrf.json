  "selftext": "“Amazon stock was rising on Tuesday, just enough to maintain its place as the S&P 500’s fourth-largest company by market value after overtaking Alphabet on Monday. It may owe Oracle a little bit of a thank you.\n\nShares of Amazon.com were up 2.6% at 2:09 p.m. on Monday, after rising 2.3% on Monday. With Monday’s move, Amazon passed Alphabet as the fourth-largest company in the U.S. for the first time since April 5. Alphabet’s stock has fallen 8.7% in September, while Amazon is off just 0.7%. Amazon’s market cap was $22 billion more than Alphabet’s at Monday’s close, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nAmazon had some good news for investors at an investor conference, noting that its cloud business, AWS, is gaining further traction in AI but that it’s also focused on “balancing expenditures with revenue growth,” according to BofA analyst Justin Post.\n\nThere was also good news from Oracle’s earnings. Yes, most of the good news was for Oracle stock, which has risen 12% on Thursday. But with the release of its earnings, Oracle and AWS said that they had come together with a new cloud product, Oracle Database@AWS. Oracle already has partnerships with Microsoft’s Azure and Google, but Post notes that the AWS/Oracle deal should be good for both companies. “Oracle & AMZN had been competitive for database customers, so new partnership suggests companies have a lot to gain by working together,” he writes.\n\nRight now investors will just settle for gains.”\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/how-amazon-stock-passed-alphabet-as-4th-largest-in-s-p-500-with-an-assist-from-oracle/ar-AA1qkrii",

      "body": "How to cheat the market of 20 trillion?\n\nOver two years (1H24 to 1H22), net income of US public non-financial companies declined by 1.5% at par and fell by 7.9% on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n\nMeanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading (Amazon factor), profits collapsed 18% at par and 23.3% when adjusted for inflation. \n\nAt the same time, the US market was balancing in the 3600-3800 range with a break to 3500 points (1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24).\n\nProfits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success (the difference in capitalization now and then).\n\nMental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality it’s stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.\n\nThis is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that don’t exist.\n\nIs it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, it’s true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports: \n\n- Trading: +10.7% y/y and +43.5% for 2Q24, and for 1H24 +11.6% y/y and +44.2% for two years (further in the sequence shown).\n\n- Medical: +38.9% and -22.2% / -19.5% and -44.9% (!)\n\n- Consumer Discretionary: -23.6% and -2.1% due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss / -8.7% and +0.7%.\n\n- Industrials: +4.4% and +4.7% / -9.3% and +10.3%.\n\n- Commodities and utilities: -13% and -52.1% / -21.1% and -33.9% (!)\n\n- Transportation and communications: +37.5% and +0.1% / +10% and -5.8%.\n\n- Technology: +22.8% and +38.9% / +30.7% and +24%.\n\nThese data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative (medical, raw materials and transportation, communications), two are in the zero (consumer discretionary and industrials) and only two sectors are in the plus (technology and trade due to Amazon).\n\nThere are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai (look it up).",
