  "selftext": "General Motors is laying off more than 1,000 salaried employees globally in its software and services division following a review to streamline the unit’s operations, CNBC has learned.\n\nThe layoffs, including roughly 600 jobs at GM’s tech campus near Detroit, come less than six months after leadership changes overseeing the operations, including former Apple executive Mike Abbott leaving the automaker due to health reasons.\n\n“As we build GM’s future, we must simplify for speed and excellence, make bold choices, and prioritize the investments that will have the greatest impact,” a GM spokesman said in an emailed statement. “As a result, we’re reducing certain teams within the Software and Services organization. We are grateful to those who helped establish a strong foundation that positions GM to lead moving forward.”\n\nGM declined to disclose the entire number of layoffs, but a source familiar with the action confirmed more than 1,000 salaried employees would be laid off, including 600 in Warren, Michigan.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/19/gm-lays-off-more-than-1000-salaried-software-and-services-employees.html",

Unions will negotiate reasonable salaries for their members and companies will oblige because they need said employees. \n\nI also don't think it makes sense to argue that in a market of low wages, companies fill superfluous positions since headcounts come at a lower cost. No matter the cost, if they can get away with doing more with less they will. \n\n>Yeah, \"to their members\". Not to society at large.\n\nIdeally, everyone would have a union that represents their interests as an integral component of the modern economy. If we can get to the point where they're the norm rather than the exception, employers will have to negotiate proper compensation and workplace conditions. It also gives them some freedom in their obligations to shareholders because they're now contractually bound to treat their employees well, whereas without the union, shareholders could make a stronger case for treating them like an expendable resource.",

For example, when I arrive home in our Bolt EUV, the car immediately connects to my wife’s iPhone that’s in the living room and transfers her music to the car before I can park it in the garage and shut it off. There are numerous solutions to this. They could let us priority rank the phones. They could introduce a 30 second delay in connecting a new phone if the car has been driving. They could prioritize connection based on signal strength. But instead the car just jumps to her phone, messing up both of our music speaker choices. \n\nGM - you need more and BETTER software engineers. Not less.",

Unfortunately it was totaled by a careless driver. No, not me or my wife. :) Beautiful 2005 GTO.  Fortunately those cars kept their value well and the insurance payout after 3 years was very close to what I had paid for it. \n\nTwo were 24 month leases (sorry, I shouldn’t have used the word “bought” for those 2, I agree it’s not a purchase).\n\nThe rest were new purchases and held for 100,000 miles and beyond. Then life changed, kids came or kids grew into teens, we needed more space, and so we traded.\n\nLike I said in my first post, not one has been a lemon.  They’ve all been excellent values, especially the two leases. Those were back in the day where a GM Mastercard could net you $2000 bonus cash off a short term lease.  A car like my 2013 Cruze LS leased for about $3000 as one-pay for 24 months, so…. I drove it for around $40 a month.\n\nThose days are long gone and I wouldn’t lease these days, except for an EV perhaps as there are lots of incentives available.\n\nAs I said, cars are a hobby and passion for me. I’ve worked hard to make sure I keep the costs down.  Perhaps some luck too, having been fortunate to live through the “cheap” cars era of 2009-2019.\n\nHave a great day everyone!",
