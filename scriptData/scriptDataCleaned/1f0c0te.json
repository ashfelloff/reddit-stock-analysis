  "selftext": "I missed the massive rally in ASTS that started on May 15th, so I did a lot of research and patiently waited for the right moment to enter my trade. I currently hold about $75K worth of put options.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/af5bekx5mnkd1.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=a6810c2952b06106505550bb0a6101c2560527b2\n\nHere’s why I think ASTS is headed for a big drop:\n\n**1.The Surge Itself is the Biggest Bearish Signal**\n\nASTS has skyrocketed nearly 2000% in just three months. For comparison, NVDA took three years to climb 2000% from its COVID-19 low, and NVDA actually had strong revenue and profit growth backing it up. ASTS, on the other hand, is a company that might not even be profitable until 2028. There's no comparison in terms of valuation or future potential.\n\nA rapid stock price increase often leads to profit-taking pressure and can even cause unforeseen operational issues for the company. According to their Q2 report, \"The increase in fair value of warrant liabilities resulted in a loss of $66.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, largely due to a significant increase in our share price.\" The stock price is now three times higher than it was on June 30th. If it doesn’t drop, I expect warrants to cause an even bigger loss in Q3, possibly between $200 to $300 million. ASTS only has $287.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, so this would be a heavy blow to their balance sheet.\n\n**2.Launching Satellites Requires Continuous Funding**\n\nThey’re launching five satellites in September, and they’ll need to launch 25 or 95 more after that. \n\nAccording to their Q2 report,\"We currently estimate we will need to raise approximately $275.0 million to $325.0 million to fund operating expenses and capital expenditures necessary to design, assemble and launch 20 Block 2 BB satellites and operate a constellation of 25 BB satellites.\" \"We plan to achieve service in the selected, targeted geographical areas with the launch and operation of 25 BB satellites and achieve substantial service in all targeted geographical areas to meet our long-term business goals with the launch and operation of approximately 95 BB satellites.\"\n\nTheir 2024 operating funds are in place, but I believe they’ll need to raise $275 to $325 million in 2025, and if they want to scale up to 95 satellites in 2026, they’ll need at least $1.1 to $1.3 billion. This means they’ll need to issue new stock or debt. Based on past actions, they’ll likely choose convertible debt. They’ve already issued about $310.8 million in convertible debt, and using the $5.75 conversion price from the January 2024 issuance of $110 million in convertible notes (I couldn’t find records for all their convertible debt), that converts to about 53 million shares—roughly one-third of the current shares outstanding.\n\nMy view is that the existing convertible debt will inevitably convert to stock, diluting shareholder equity, and they’ll need to keep issuing debt or stock to raise funds. The debt or stock issued will turn into company assets, and for a telecom-like company, the P/B ratio is usually below 2. For instance, VZ’s P/B ratio is 1.8, and AT&T’s is 1.34. However, ASTS has a staggering P/B ratio of 33.66. This means either the current price is way too high, or they’ll need to issue a lot of new shares in the future, either of which would drive the stock price down.\n\n**3.History Shows a Sharp Pullback is Inevitable After a Rapid Surge**\n\nI believe ASTS has long-term potential and could reach $50 or $100, but that might not happen until 2028 or 2030, not now. We’re currently in the phase where the stock has surged 2000%, and both volume and price are starting to decline. Based on ASTS’s past behavior, sharp rallies are typically followed by 50%-90% corrections. For example, in early February 2021, the stock doubled, hitting a high of $25.370 on February 10th, only to drop to $11.21 by March 4th. Two months later, on April 19, 2021, it was down to $7.12.\n\nAgain, in late July 2022, the stock doubled, peaking at $14.270 on August 17th, but by the end of September, it was down to $7, and by December, it was only $3.6.\n\nSo, I expect a reasonable pullback of 50%-75% over the next one to three months, with a more extreme drop of 80%-90% possible in the worst-case scenario.",

Being around $30 currently doesn't seem to be that far out of a normal price if you think of $10 as the starting point. The price of a stock is always based on the future value and not the current value. That's why when a company misses revenue by a penny, the price plummets. I think the $30 price is based on the next round of satellites and the deals currently in place. If new deals are announced, we'll see the price get adjusted based on future revenue.

Their current satellites are incompatible with their current rules and basically now at least 12-18 months behind ASTS. T-Mobile may switch to ASTS as they have shown in the filings that their spectrum works on their satellites as well. Also First Net funding was confirmed that same week for ASTS. They also were above $18 for 20 out of 30 trading days unlocking an additional 150 million dollars for them which they may not even need from warrants. They are funded for BB2 satellites and the launch is the unlock for other MNOs to cough up cash if they want to play. They reiterated two times no need for dilution as they most likely have DoD, MNOs, already contracted. They were sitting on Verizon deal for a good 4 months before even saying a peep.

For now at least the BW3 seems to be holding its eccentricity decently well so it has some station keeping capabilities (ie thrusters, I couldn’t find any info on what kind of station keeping thrusters), but the average altitude has fallen off a bit, according to the latest TLE it’s at 490km, and it was launched into a 500km orbit (503-519km at launch back in 2022. Proving that your satellite can talk to phones is one thing, maintaining a constellation is a completely different task with the significantly short lifetime of LEO satellites. So it would take a while monitoring BW3 and comparing it to BB1-5 over a couple of years to say whether or not their plans are sustainable.
