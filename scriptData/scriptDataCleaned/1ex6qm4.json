  "title": "Fed Hiked Rates Over 500 bps Since March 2022—So Why is a 25 bps Cut Causing Such a Stir?",
  "score": 68,
  "selftext": "I’ve been following the Fed’s actions closely, especially since March 2022 when they started raising interest rates aggressively to combat inflation. Over the past year and a half, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates by over **500 basis points (bps)**, pushing rates to levels we haven't seen in years.\n\nNow, there's talk of a **25 bps rate cut**, and it seems like the markets are going nuts over it. Honestly, I don’t get why everyone is reacting so strongly. I mean, after such a massive increase, what’s the big deal about a tiny 0.25% reduction? It feels like a drop in the ocean compared to what we’ve already seen.\n\nSure, I understand that every basis point counts in the world of finance, but given the magnitude of previous hikes, does this small reduction really make that much of a difference in the grand scheme of things?\n\nI’m curious to hear your thoughts on this. Do you think this reduction will play a crucial role in the U.S. economy? Could it signal a broader change in the Fed's policy direction, or is the market just overreacting to a small move? Let’s discuss!",

Remember debt is still VERY high, and liquidity in the market is causing all these inflation tantrums. So its a conflicting situation of sorts.\n\nE.g. because of high liquidity, people are ready to pay a higher premium. High liquidity essentially came from the QE in 2020 along with money distribution to help people survive job losses and other economic situations, but spending was far more curtailed because no travel, no eating out, not much vacations etc. So people saved a lot and that along with the 2022 ramp up, and then 2023 eruption in jobs and salaries along with the tech boom. Salaries that were high due to corporations feeling good with their valuations, based on stock markets which were pumped up by way of liquidity flowing there too. \n\nNot to mention the real estate craziness that fed into the cycle of flipping buying buying, driven by remote work and incentives to work hybrid coz companies saw that there were much more benefits (e.g. no more insurance to pay for employees turning up at work, etc.). \n\n  \nSo all in all, the market is coming to a reconciliation and the push higher imo is a strategy by funds and MMs to push to highs and then sell at those highs, and after seeing many stock market greed movies (WOWS), its not totally unfounded for this behavior to continue because, \"it always goes up\". \n\n  \nDump over!",
