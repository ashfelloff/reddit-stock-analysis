You doubters who said weed was a one day pump and dump.\n\nSomeone who bought SNDL even at the very top on Tuesday last week is now in the money.\n\nThis is a significant sign.  Cannabis stocks entered a bull market that has only just begun.  The resistance set Tuesday has been broken, but not by all the stonks.  Still time to get your portfolios high bros\n",
