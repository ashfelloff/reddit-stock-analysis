  "selftext": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams visited Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) to discuss securing the global foundry's advanced technology for Apple's artificial intelligence processors.\n\n\n\nWilliams met with Taiwan Semiconductor President C.C. Wei, the news outlet reported, citing sources close to the situation. The meeting, described as low-profile, may have centered around obtaining access to Taiwan Semiconductor's 2 nm process.\n\n\n\nApple and Taiwan Semiconductor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor, the world's largest foundry, also manufactures chips for companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD) and others.\n\n\n\nCupertino, Calif.-based Apple is reported to be working on chips for its in-house servers to handle some of the intense AI workloads that will be unveiled at this year's developer conference, scheduled for next month.\n\n\n\nThe first chip that may come to Apple's servers is its M2 Ultra, with plans to bring its latest silicon, the M4, to its in-house data centers. The M4 was unveiled earlier this month, along with new versions of the iPad Air and iPad Pro.\n\n\n\nChief Executive Tim Cook said recently that Apple has advantages in the AI space that its competitors do not.\n\n\n\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create,\" Cook said on the company's earnings call, held earlier this month.",

There are specialized chips needed for those applications. \n\nNVDA GPU waiting time is 10 months.. so it makes sense for Apple to 'try' its own chip, skip the queue and directly talk to the manufacturer (TSM).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/enrdsutdt82d1.jpeg?width=2114&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cae6da40f92df6bda307505c168f3143092b278",
