But if either of the above mentioned technicals occur, I'd wager a trend reversal, or at least a correction that may not play out by July.\n\nImo, you essentially bought calls at the top as momentum was stalling. A strong call opportunity is when 8 EMA is crossing above 21 and 50 on green dildo. Same is true for puts, though in opposite direction and color. True for all timeframes.\n\nIf your intent was to YOLO, then HODL.\n\nIf your intent was to trade, then you should have an exit strategy that limits your losses.\n\nThis is in no way regard proof. I have limited losses this way, and I have locked in losses only to lose out on profits had I held. But there's a reason they say \"the trend is your friend,\" and EMAs can clue you into trend reversals.\n\nGood luck!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yhkmp9m947uc1.png?width=3406&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbeea1b24e53c2e177b264af81d33b80f663129a",
