Therefore, the process can now proceed without re-taping out, as production delays being minimized._\n\n_The report noted that NVIDIA’s updated version of B200 is expected to be completed by late October, allowing the GB200 to enter mass production in December, with large-scale deliveries to ODMs expected in the first quarter of next year._\n\n_Previously, as per a report from The Information, NVIDIA’s GB200 was said to be experiencing a one-quarter delay in mass shipments. Another report from the Economic Daily News further suggested that the problem likely lies in the yield rates of advanced packaging, which mainly affected the non-reference-designed GB200 chips._\n\n_Industry sources cited by Commercial Times addressed that NVIDIA’s Blackwell chip used to be facing instability in metal layers during the HV process, which was then resolved by July._\n\n_In addition, since the issue reportedly occurred in the back-end-of-line process, a new tape-out was deemed unnecessary. Still, as CoWoS-L capacity remains a bottleneck, the advanced packaging for GB200 this year is expected to adopt  CoWoS-S._\n\n~~\n\nWait until Jerome turns on the money printer over the next quarter btw and that $2T sitting on the sidelines enters into the stonk market. Pride month has gone on far too long. Jensen mad if anyone listened closely to the call q/a and that Bloomberg fiasco of an interview after.\n\n**Positions**: $85k in $104 Feb ‘25 leaps that’re currently down $18k lol",

No one compares valuation multiples of individual companies in different sectors. Coke is a stable business with a stable dividend. It's basically looked at as a safe haven to track inflation plus dividend. There's a reason its a top Buffet holding.\n\nNvidia on the other hand has a majority of their data center business going to 5-6 big tech companies who also happen to be spending a massive amount of money on developing their own AI accelerators to eliminate their reliance on Nvidia. Google TPU is already used for training and serving all their own models (from YouTube to Search to Gemini to Waymo) and big companies like Apple have been using them too. You have Microsoft with their Maia chip development. Amazon has their Trainium and Inferentia chips. Meta has their MTIA chip for inference. Tesla has Dojo. Apple has their own custom silicon for on device inference and it looks like they are also tackling data center chips now too. Then you also have AMD with their big plans for the next few years. And Groq is blowing Nvidia out of the water on inference speeds.\n\nAnd Nvidia doesn't actually make anything they only design chips so every other big tech company can go to TSMC AVGO etc with their designs to get their chips manufactured in the same place as Nvidia. Lots of risk to Nvidia's growth and more importantly their profit margins in the mid term as all the big tech companies develop their own sources of custom AI accelerators.\n\nThey should be fine in the near term (1-2 years) but people will start looking out further into the future and there are some serious headwinds when you start to consider every big tech company pouring money into solutions to cut Nvidia out.\n\nIn summary, when your biggest customers happen to also be the biggest tech companies in the world with the deepest pockets in the world there is a lot of risk that they look to cut you out.",

All of the important deep learning libraries that are critical for AI model training and serving already run on the other hardware using CUDA alternatives.

It means that there is very little juice left to squeeze and less money available to drive prices higher. There is a very high correlation between equity holdings percentage and market returns.

      "body": "How to cheat the market of 20 trillion?\n\nOver two years (1H24 to 1H22), net income of US public non-financial companies declined by 1.5% at par and fell by 7.9% on an inflation-adjusted basis. \n\nMeanwhile, moderate stagnation with a downward trajectory was driven by the strong performance of technology companies, i.e. excluding technology and trading (Amazon factor), profits collapsed 18% at par and 23.3% when adjusted for inflation. \n\nAt the same time, the US market was balancing in the 3600-3800 range with a break to 3500 points (1H22 reports were known, as they are now for 1H24).\n\nProfits were down by a quarter in real terms with no successful reps in tech, and this was presented as a 20 trillion dollar success (the difference in capitalization now and then).\n\nMental distortions, AI hallucinations, pure idiocy, baybucks and highly concentrated insanity are the ingredients of a 20 trillion success and nothing more. Someone dreamed that they started growing at the economic boom rate of the 90s, when in reality it’s stagnation with a downward slope on a high base.\n\nThis is no longer in the field of economics, it is pure psychiatry and social engineering. The results in 2024 are worse than 2022, and the elation is as if one has teleported to an alternate universe of magical dreams, a fairy tale utopia AI world and incredible cash flows that don’t exist.\n\nIs it true that technology is showing an increase in profits? Yes, it’s true. A historic high in absolutes and high growth rates, yet everyone else is in severe decline by their own calculations based on company reports: \n\n- Trading: +10.7% y/y and +43.5% for 2Q24, and for 1H24 +11.6% y/y and +44.2% for two years (further in the sequence shown).\n\n- Medical: +38.9% and -22.2% / -19.5% and -44.9% (!)\n\n- Consumer Discretionary: -23.6% and -2.1% due to Warner Bros. 10 bln loss / -8.7% and +0.7%.\n\n- Industrials: +4.4% and +4.7% / -9.3% and +10.3%.\n\n- Commodities and utilities: -13% and -52.1% / -21.1% and -33.9% (!)\n\n- Transportation and communications: +37.5% and +0.1% / +10% and -5.8%.\n\n- Technology: +22.8% and +38.9% / +30.7% and +24%.\n\nThese data, please note, are at par! If we compare 1H24 to 1H22, three sectors are in the negative (medical, raw materials and transportation, communications), two are in the zero (consumer discretionary and industrials) and only two sectors are in the plus (technology and trade due to Amazon).\n\nThere are literally 10 tech companies in good profit, everyone else is very bad. But everyone else is on the hai (look it up).",
