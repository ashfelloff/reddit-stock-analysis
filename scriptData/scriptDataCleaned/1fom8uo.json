He never acknowledged he did anything wrong and went down with the ship, while Ellison immediately did the opposite. He recruited Ellison - someone who we have no reason to think is especially intelligent or qualified for the position he put her in - to do what he wanted. And I think he knew she was pliable. She was a nobody that ended up elevated into an incredible position of responsibility, and then asked to do things that were wrong to maintain that position. Many, many people would do that. I think he manipulated her because he's an actual psychopath, even by billionaire standards. \n\n\nAgain, Ellison went along with it but I also think she was dazzled by being plucked from obscurity into the weird world domination cult sbf was building. She deserves punishment but helping bring down sbf and recover the money for victims isn't worth nothing. This seems relatively close to a fair sentence. I think she could do more time. But I also think sbf could, too.",

      "body": "The FTX disaster had nothing to do with crypto being evil or un-investable, but everything to do with a typical scumbag hedge fund stealing money to pay for bad bets it made in non crypto financial markets. If there had been oversight and audits of the hedge fund, it would never been allowed to make huge unsecured trades or steal crypto from FTX customers. That said, every FTX customer got their money with interest back in 2024 so the hedge fund's losses are back on the hedge fund.\n\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/08/nearly-all-ftx-creditors-will-get-118-of-their-funds-back-in-cash-estate-says-in-new-plan/](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2024/05/08/nearly-all-ftx-creditors-will-get-118-of-their-funds-back-in-cash-estate-says-in-new-plan/)",
