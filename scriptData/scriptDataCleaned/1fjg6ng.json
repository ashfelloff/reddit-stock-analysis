If we cut 50 bps I’m going to ride the wave and dip out of the market because that is not a positive sign imo.  My bet is that we’ll see 25 bps and the market will react poorly to that so I opened an SPX put oct 18th 5625 strike.\n\nBut long term into november / december, rate cuts will only be an accelerating force for the markets",
