No, but it’s still up double digit percentage and the year is not even over yet. People on here need to get grip. If you’re freakin out over a stock being up 17% just wait until you actually see a bear market where stocks won’t be up double digit percentages but actually down double digit percentages. \n\nI remember seeing a post not too long ago on here of someone asking why Microsoft and Apples performance has been so lackluster. Microsoft is up 11% while Apple is up 22%. Microsofts performance is in line with the standard average annual return of the market while Apple is double that. I feel like with this kind of sentiment we are overdue for a market correction. Maybe like another 2022 where we see these people get pushed out cause a bear market will push these people out.",

I think this is what Tiktok does better, in that it appeals to both old and young generations alike. The appeal in Tiktok is that you don't need have friends to entertain yourself. Tiktok just keeps throwing random reels at you. It appeals to literally anyone with a single brain cell and is relatively stupid in seeking short term entertainment (unfortunately this happens to be the vast majority of people who are indeed fucking IDIOTS).\n\nFor Instagram, you need have friends to see their stories.

As for how much YouTube and Netflix makes from advertisers? I’m not sure.

Not just better - drastically so. Seriously, have you tried to google anything, that isn’t heavily manipulated by the money behind it? If reddits internal search function wasn’t useless, I’m not even sure I’d use google. \n\nEvery social has its own AI being integrated - the same as the one at the top of google essentially. How long until we don’t Google things anymore? What is a 5-10% reduction in their market cap? \n\nThey need to pivot. Their data moat is huge but shrinking.
