When I say \"have something else to buy\" for example, I don't mean buy that instant, but had ASTS not hit my desired price and started ripping instead, I wouldn't feel fomo, rather just bump it lower on my priority list and focus elsewhere. \n\nAlso, always keep cash on hand, I was actually early to the ASTS show, I started buying at $2.90, when it dropped to $2 I doubled my position and kept throwing what I could to average down.
