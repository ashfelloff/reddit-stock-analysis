  "selftext": "BA is going to tank at 1 PM when NASA announces that the Starliner is too unsafe to send home with astronauts on board and the are catching a ride with Space X instead. If you have any ability to get out beforehand, do it. \n\nI've been following this story for years and NASA has been signaling this for weeks. BA has finally relented and has started signaling that they will be selling out of spaceflight to focus on their main business (unaliving whistleblowers). Potential pump and dump when they do that. \n\nI have no positions in BA or their competitors, but my dad is a muckity muck in safety at the Cape that was part of the team that snuck a camera on the SRB before Columbia.

Not only are the astronauts’ lives at stake, but also the reputation of NASA, the world’s premier space agency, which has witnessed its share of tragedy over its history.",
