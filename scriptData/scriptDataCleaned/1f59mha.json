      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

      "body": "1. Always take a portion of every profit and put it in something low risk that you won't be trading or set it up to get your capital back out and just leave the profits in the position.\n\n2. Always check the proverbial weather before putting on a trade. Everyday you trade look at oil, currency exchange rates, bonds, options on the thing you are trading and highly related things. Also be aware of any big reports coming out, fed decisions, speakers, and minutes. Know when bond auctions are happening. All of that matters and can easily wreck your day or make your day easier. If you dont understand the impacts of these things that is why you are getting screwed suddenly. \n\n3. Risk management is king. If you dont have a system to keep your risk tolerable it can be painful. \n\n4. Also you need to have a plan for how you will handle your emotions in regards to a trade. People say trade without emotion and that can work for some but not for others. \n\nIn my case I use trading to open positions. I have a huge number of small positions that are the profits from the trades I did on that stock. I do my thing, make some money, pull my original capital out, and set a recurring daily investment on the position. The amount I actively trade has grown, but by a lot less than the amount I have grown my account. You can do it differently, but you need to always be putting money off to the side. If you are always running trades with most of your money you will eventually get burned bad. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y92de83ctwld1.png?width=1062&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d6834ba89153560158201452f056f798fa3e2e3",

August was my first month actively trading or using options, and I’m currently at 85% win/loss ratio taking small positions and made about $3k.

              "body": "If you are sending profits to the side regularly you aren't going back to square one. You can still blow up your capital, but then I have to ask were you diversified in your trades?\n\nYou are far less likely to blow up your account if you are only putting a portion at risk in any trade.\n\nFor example let's say you are day trading but are also open to swing trading. How about doing something like half your account in low risk positions, and then 5% day trade, and then put the remaining 45% into 5-10 swing trades across several sectors. Even if you blow up a single position you should still be ok.\n\nBeyond that hedge it. Don't just buy calls. Buy calls and sell calls to make a spread. \n\nSo that kind of diversity might be a day trade on nvda, a hedged trade on msft, maybe dabble in target or Walmart. Maybe you have a position in an oil company. Perhaps you also have a position on one of the major banks. Right there you are basically holding 5 relatively diverse positions. \n\nThen start building a position in a couple of other things. \n\nSo right now I have a bunch of positions that I opened with the profits from a debit spread. I have large positions on nvda, palantir, IWM, sbux. In fact looking over my account I think I'm north of 95 stocks or ETFs that I have a position in. I didn't start with that many, but most weeks I've found 1-2 stocks I want to add and I go out and make some money on them. I pull my capital out and leave the profits so many of these positions are small.",

This limits potential losses. Its all about the overall net. \n\nI have had trades I close with a small loss that would have been ok if I held. \n\nAnd for example today I bought 90 calls at 558 and 559 (SPY 3DTE, Tuesday) sold them for 6k profit when it was creeping higher. If I had held it would have been 30k. My cost was 14k \n\nThis two examples are very hard mentally. It sets you up for that one trade where you hold and it wipes you out completely. So its better to have a small loss and a nice profit 6k on the day, and be able to do it consistently than risk it all for a larger supposed gain which is not always the rule.
