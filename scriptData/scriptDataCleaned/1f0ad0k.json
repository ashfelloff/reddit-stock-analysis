  "selftext": "1. Greetings regards, it has been many months since my last play; TSM and that play costed me a great amount but back then I started off by playing with options on based on how I felt and I was right for 2 weeks straight until I started getting technical and before I knew it I lost my $30,000 gain and lost around $10,000 of my own money. As a 18 year old that just graduated I can definitely afford to risk some more money as my family financials are good enough for me to live off of. Now ever since my TSM play from March I've started to watch more stock news and economic news and slowly saved up money from my fast food job, hell I didn't even really know who daddy Powell was until TSM almost completely wiped out my portfolio. Now March was unlucky for me because of uncertainty with rate cuts and inflation rising which meant stocks would go down. However, we just came out of a big dip and daddy Powell has confirmed cuts and the economy is looking bullish as hell which leads to me my 2nd biggest play of 2024.\n2. Based on what I'm feeling right now NVDA will fly after ER, so I decided to do one final big yolo into NVDX(2x leveraged NVDA) in my ROTH IRA ALL $8000 and around $2000 in options on NVDA calls If this hits I will treat myself to a brand new cologne and the new sun wu kong game\n3.

But this isn't just another hype post; this is about **destiny**‚Äîspecifically, the destiny of the number **8**.\n\n# The Setup\n\nNVIDIA is set to release its earnings on August 28th, and analysts are expecting a **massive** revenue of **$28.71B**. That's right, **3 eights** in the revenue expectation alone. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n# The Signs\n\n1. **August 28th**: The earnings date itself is packed with eights.\n2. OP's username starts with the number 8. Coincidence? I think not.\n3. OP's portfolio's total value is hovering around **$8k**, and their peak P&L was on March **08**. Eights are everywhere!\n\n# The Play\n\nWith all these signs pointing towards the mighty 8, there's only one logical move: I'm going **ALL IN** on **NVDX 18C**. The stars (and numbers) have aligned for this play.\n\nIf you think I'm crazy, that's fine‚ÄîWSB is built on the crazy plays that turned out to be right. The eights have spoken, and I'm listening.\n\nGLTA. üöÄ",
