I don't know but I think they'll have no choice but to flock to those kinds of stores, now its a matter of on whom you bet in the cheap store realm. \n\nI think you'll win a good chunk if not in the short term, 2 years+, unless the company is badly run ofc, which I don't know.\n\nI think you're expecting it to rebound in less than a week though? Hopefully you hit near bottom and there's not another -15% to go in the next weeks, GL!",
