              "body": "The anti-tumor impact of IL-15 has been known for over a decade. It's a member of the IL-2 family, but, unlike IL-2, it doesn't engage CD25, which is highly expressed on Tregs. It works by promoting NK cell and CD8 T cell proliferation and expression of cytotoxic molecules like granzymes and perforins that can be used to kill tumor cells. Most of the studies looking at the anti-tumor impact of IL-15 have been in mice, though. Not sure exactly how well it works in humans and what kind of off-target effects would be expected. Although, I would imagine that developing autoimmunity of some kind will be a common side effect. \n\nI think there have been a number of IL-15 agonists in trial, but I don't think any have made it to market yet. Pretty sure none of them showed significant improvements in patient outcomes. Might be due to the short half life of human IL-15 (I think it is only a couple hours). Don't know the details for Anktiva or how it's different from previous attempts.",

Otherwise, your guess is as good as mine.\n\nI plan to regroup with my IRL investor friends on Monday after hours to re-evaluate once we see what Monday brings.\n\nI realize this is far from the type of response you were looking for, but it’s the best I can do.",
