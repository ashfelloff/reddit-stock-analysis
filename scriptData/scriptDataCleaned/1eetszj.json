  "selftext": "I like some of the rough due diligence  that is here. It's often not perfect, but at least its an opinion. I'm always surprised at how often people can poke holes in some of it, often in way I had not thought of myself.\n\nI like the community support when someone is struggling. I'm not a proponent of some of the YOLO bets, but at least for the most part people are not kicked while they are down too much.\n\nI'm not into options or gambling, but often I relate to this community the most on reddit. \n\nI think the want to to feel something is the commonalities between us. A big move up or a big move down brings forth emotion that other things in real life don't. The closest I've come to something similar is this: working on a project that is personally challenging. \n\nWhen I've done projects in my lifetime that might not work, it can be rough sometimes. Frequently the projects I've chosen have little financial benefit. I only tried the project because I thought I could get it to work. Most of the time I can actually get the project/contraption to work. It definitely doesn't sometimes as well. Those times really suck, but I would regret more not trying it.\n\nI just wanting to bring this forward as another outlet for people wanting to live. The benefit of is personal growth and learning experience. And when things go south it is much quicker to fix then sinking ones own personal finances. Hope this helps someone.",

I think you know this, but look up FUD (look it up again).\n\nNext research Debate and Debate Strategies. TL;DR You may have to argue a point you don't agree with, and the goal is to still win, and you can totally do it even when your position is a 100% loser.\n\nEven if you have 1 million positive things about a company, watching their stock dip slightly and getting hit with single plausible FUD is normally enough to make even smart, but undisciplined investors run for the exits. Just trade accordingly knowing that. The easiest way to prove this is to bookmark the FUD noting the current price. If they were wrong, and you were right, more times than not, then you need to learn to trust yourself more and control the emotional doubt you felt at the time of the bookmark going forward.",
