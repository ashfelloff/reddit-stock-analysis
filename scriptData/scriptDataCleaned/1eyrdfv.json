XAR is the largest holder of ACHR‚Äôs float with 17mm+ shares. XAR is an equal weight ETF meaning at each rebalancing it first balances all its holdings out to 3%\\* (\\*it‚Äôs a bit more complicated than this obviously). So all of the current 5% weighted large caps like Lockheed will be sold and the proceeds redistributed to the underweight securities. It has a high short interest with 7 days to cover and an average daily volume of 8m. At the end of September, the ETF rebalances and will be required by its fund documents to buy enough shares to equal 3% of its holdings. It is currently weighted at 1%. So, either A. the price remains unchanged and when rebalancing happens, XAR will need to purchase 34mm shares to bring it to equal weight, B. the price increases thereby increasing XAR‚Äôs weighting without buy pressure, or C. a little of A and a little of B, and a lotta for Me.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kq7tu7p9nbkd1.jpeg?width=2683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=647426e5d75a01cbc9de690994a73781eeb69fc3",

Your thesis on the XAR ETF being forced to buy more at next rebalancing is completely wrong\n\nXAR is \\*not\\* an equal-weighted index. The weights are limited by liquidity and market cap. Quote:\n\n>At each quarterly rebalancing, initially equal weight constituents with adjustments to ensure that, for a given theoretical portfolio value (TV), each constituent's index weight cannot exceed 4.5% of the FMC and the value that can be traded in three days. No stock in the index can have a weight greater than 4.5%.\n\n  \nI estimated the current values and got a liquidity-limited weighting of 1.1%, right on the money with the current weighting of 1.16%\n\n  \nI wish you luck, but don't count on any ETF rebalancing to help you here\n\n  \nsource: [https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-select-industry-indices.pdf](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-select-industry-indices.pdf)",

Add to that the fact that credit will become cheaper as Fed cuts rates, so it will have access to cheaper cash without dilutive effects, if needed. \n\nACHR already has a $6bn backlog, so the demand is very much there it just needs to start filling orders. And its large production facility is coming online next quarter with shipments to begin at start of 2025.",

The LA Rams are also working with ACHR, so will likely see NFL use as well. \n\nAs for the ‚Äútwo guys‚Äù, there are major investments from strategics at this point and they have two flight-capable craft, so it‚Äôs not just on paper anymore.
