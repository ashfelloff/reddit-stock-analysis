They are actually far LESS hippy than back in the 70s and 80s. A lot of what those hippies used to do is now right wing especially the conspiracy theories and all the hate for government and medicine and such.\n\nThe right shifted as well. They used to be about patriotism and military and sacrifice for the good of the country. Granted their politicians were always horrible. Now its about what does the country do for me? How can I capitalize on the country? Me take a vaccine and stop working to save American lives? Nope not a chance. Ill even break the law to not do that. I think ill just do whatever I want. Screw other Americans, its not my duty to protect them... That the right wing today. Illegals are taking all our jobs! Whats the gov'ment doing about it? I cant possibly compete with these uneducated, desperate people... oh woo is me... Support US made? NA I think ill vote for the guy who ran businesses out of China, Saudi Arabia and still has business with Russia, all practically our enemies. Remember when the right cared about crime? Na I think ill vote for the rapist womanizer and convicted criminal. Apparently some crimes are ok. Support US currency? Not me. I think ill go and support Bitcoin which helps other countries conduct illegal arms deals and help criminals launder money. Yep screw the USD. Someone looked at me funny, im scared, I should just shoot them in self defense! Does that sound like self sacrifice or patriotism to you? Nope that sounds like the confederacy.\n\nLeft winger really havent changed all that much. They still do some dumb things like focus too much on marginal details while missing the forest. That hasnt changed. They tend to take a lot of naive stances as well, rather than being reasonable. The entire property damage from protests is something I will never understand. It goes hand in hand with carrying guns to voting stations by right wingers. Its cowardly bullying and the ones being bullied are mostly normal folks. Its counter productive. If you are going to do that nonsense, at the very least get the exact people responsible not some random people. Thats why Im not a republican or democrat but the right has gone off the deep end at this point.",

And like the oligarchs in Russia, they are dumping the bad investments on fidelity and Americans 401k that they have no knowledge about.\n\nI don't think you actually researched Twitter or even use the platform today. It had zero chance to be profitable before Musk. Rather, it was on a course to bankruptcy within 1-3 years. Just opening their latest public earnings report will tell you that.\n\nToday I don't think there's anyone that doesn't hate Musk that thinks it's a worse platform than it was before the takeover. It still has it's problems, but the progress has been staggering and it's WAY easier to find truth on the platform today than it was a few years ago.",

      "body": "If you see Fidelity (Schwab, Vanguard, etc) investing significantly in private equity or IPO, that is generally a good sign of where and when you should put your money if given the opportunity. Fidelity is incredibly savvy in its investments. The political angst from both the right and left on this thread is ridiculous and irrelevant. Remember, it’s “Fidelity Investments.”For example, I bought Reddit at the IPO after reading Fidelity (among other heavy hitters) was investing over $700M in REDDIT.   Smart move on my part—just look at the RRDDIT chart. I wish I could directly invest in Musk’s X companies that are still privately owned as well as other privately held companies. Thankfully, I own some Fidelity funds that look for such opportunities.",
