Bulls always win LONG TERM, this is why I have automatic buys no matter what into index funds mostly. Investing and trading are 2 different animals. And there are in fact entire years where the s&p is negative, I know it sounds weird, but they happen and they‚Äôre called bear markets. People buying calls week after week (even month after month) with short expiration dates (aka most traders here) would get absolutely crushed if they continuously doubled down on calls during these times which inevitably always come (when not if).

True value is nowhere to be seen right now but always always makes a comeback. Also, I can philosophically believe in what I stated above and still make money trading. Just because you think we're all screwed doesn't mean you're incapable of playing the bullish side.\n\nA lesson you bulls are going to learn the hard way this time around.
