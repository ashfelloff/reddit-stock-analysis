  "selftext": "Twas the close before Intel, when all through the house, \n\nNot a Grandma was buying, not even a mouse;\n\nThe earnings were hung by the 10Q with care,\n\nin hopes that some gain porn soon would be there;\n\nThe grandson was nestled all snug in his bed\n\nWhile visions of EPS danced in his head\nWith Grandma in heaven, $700k in his lap,\n\nGrandson placed quite the order and gave Intel some cash.\n\nWhen out on Robinhood there arose such a clatter,\nGrandson sprang from his bed to see what was the matter.\n\nAway to the laptop he flew like a flash,\nand watched it all drop as he held all his bags \n\nBut he didn’t need money, no, he majored in math. \n\nWith dividend near yet a smile could crack,\n but then it got cut so I guess that’s a wrap. \n\nHe got an idea and he started to laugh:\n“I’ll give blowjobs at Wendy’s and make it all back!”\n\nNow that’s an idea Grandma could get behind.\nBut the Intel purchase? had that boy lost his mind?\n\nSo don’t be like him kids, for grandma worked hard.\nDon’t lose your inheritance by being a regard. \n\nBut grandson was fearless and started to cheer:  “I’ll hold till breakeven, it’s only 10 years!”\n",
