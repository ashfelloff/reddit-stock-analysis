This type of fraud became more widespread between the mid-2010s and 2021, federal investigators and real-estate brokers say, when commercial property prices surged to new highs and landlords had much to gain from such maneuvers. \n\n>Now, the drop in property values caused by higher interest rates and a rise in defaults are exposing more of these schemes, dealing another blow to a commercial real-estate market suffering through its worst stretch since the 2008-09 financial crisis. \n\n>“It’s a general trend throughout history that fraud occurs during boom times and is revealed during bust times,” said John Griffin, a professor of finance at the University of Texas’ McCombs School of Business.\n\n>In most cases, real-estate fraud is made possible because lenders take a hands-off approach to assessing a building’s value. As long as the numbers look in line with those of similar properties, lenders usually trust that they are accurate, brokers say. Auditing books is expensive and time consuming, and lenders competing for deals may be reluctant to antagonize landlords with onerous due diligence. ... ...  \n  \nSince last fall, at least five different landlords of properties, mostly apartment buildings, in cities including Cincinnati, Hartford, Conn., and Little Rock, Ark., have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. Some allegedly doctored building income statements, others allegedly faked property sales at inflated prices, all to get bigger loans.",

When the pressure, day after day, is to push values up, most people aren't aware of what they are doing.  And they are inclined to do it because people are more easily corrupted when starvation is the motivator.  Conversely, FIRREA eliminated contingent appraisal fees because it was believed appraisers had the incentive to push values up as then, the typical fee was 0.25% of the appraised value.  This isn't true.  Some people were corrupt in this instance, but most were not.\n\nIn any event, whether it is accounting for publicly traded companies or appraisal of loans issued with some measure of government backing - it makes no sense for a handful of companies to control the market.  Just like Arthur Andersen, the big 5 appraisal firms are chosen not because they are \"better\", but because they give the client what they want, and they have an army of lackies who will do the job no questions asked.\n\nOne of the big 5 needs to have an Arthur Andersen moment.",

If you're gambling on Offices, which are the riskiest subsector, office REITs are down 85-90% in just the past few years. Orion Office for example is trading at roughly 2x its funds from operations(FFO). It's entirely a gamble on how quickly their revenue falls due to vacancies.\n\nIf you want to gamble on CRE as a whole(industrial, farmland, healthcare, telecommunications, self storage, logistics, datacenters, etc), REITs as a whole are still down 30%.",

Make all the fake ass financials you want, no Lender even asks for them, at least not that I have seen recently and I have been doing this shit for decades.\n\nThe reality with commercial real estate is that the Fed has given the banks a pass to just act like all of those big shitty loans are doing just fine. They are going to motor right on through this whole thing until rates are near zero again while writing down the loans a little at a time. The alternative is a big old fucking financial crisis and no one is down with that shit again.",
