Models like the Tacoma and Forerunner are incredibly popular and they continue to deliver remarkably reliable vehicles at modest price points. All while the PE ratio remains at a meager 9.05. Still, I hardly ever hear anyone talk about TM. Am I missing something?",

I've been trying hard to find a reason to buy an electric (outside of the obvious that I don't want to emit carbon uneccessarily) but the value prop just isn't there. It's still cheaper to buy gas powered vehicles by a mile, plus you can get a quality used gas car that basically offsets the carbon savings vs buying a brand new car and batteries and all that is involved in that, for probably the lifetime of the vehicle, and I'm in WA where gas is insanely expensive and we have the cheapest electric in the nation, and some of the best electric car infrastructure, and it still doesn't make financial sense or environmental sense. I've genuinely been doing tons of research and it just does not add up.\n\nIn the future, when there is a glut of used electric vehicles on the road, the cost of batteries drops, the ease of replacing the batteries increases, the number of people who can service an electric car increases, and somehow the cost of insuring a vehicle drops (it wont) then it will make sense. But also...I'm not really seeing a used electric vehicle market developing. I would never buy a used Tesla.\n\nI'm definitely not going to buy a second vehicle as an electric. When my Corolla breaks down in 10 years I'll likely go electric. I can't imagine I'm that different than a lot of people.",

I'm obviously basing this off anecdote, but I'm not hearing any differing opinions in my circles.
