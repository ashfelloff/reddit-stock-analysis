For you now and how does that investment account look now. And if you can go back in time what would u change?  ",

He slowly started investing more and more.\n\nHe texted me a few months ago saying how thankful he was that I told him to do that. He crossed $100k at 26 while working a blue collar job in upstate NY (LCOL). He's also got $30k cash in a HYSA and just bought a $50k truck with cash. I'm almost 32 and he's doing better than me and I have a 6 figure job lol.\n\nedit: if anyone wants a good laugh, read /u/quent12dg comments below and just know he's messaging me now because he's butthurt.

Had old school geforce cards, some ATI cards, they were all such huge leaps at the time.  I'll never forget being able to actually play City of Heroes with decent framerates using my new radeon 9600 pro I won at a LAN party.\n\nWell fast forward 20 years and I ended up with an absolute metric ton of nvidia shares.  I'd spend $100 or so of each of my measly checks back then from the PC repair shop I worked at and would buy shares, at the time it was <$10/share.  I'd go from job to job, always with a raise, and always investing just a bit into tech stocks.  So I sorta stumbled into being a 35 year old multimillionaire.  I've since sold off most of it and re-invested with the assistance of a professional and sorta just shitpost, travel, and play video games now.  \n\nI wouldn't change a thing.  I love tech, always have, always will.  Still an NVDA shareholder and believe the company is just getting started.  I see no reduction in the demand for hardware accelerated graphics and in my opinion they are the top dawgs in the field.",

It's so cheap, rightfully so right now, but I have hope long term.  I was a sysadmin for many years by trade and in the enterprise world Intel is pretty much the only CPUs considered.  I've been responsible for the purchase of some millions in equipment over the years for various companies and think we only ended up with AMD powered equipment a handful of times- usually some one-off appliance (a backup appliance for example) that only came in that configuration.  I have seen the change in adoption figures, however, and see that AMD is gaining ground in this space.  Maybe a new era is here?  I don't know, that's what makes it so intriguing I think.\n\nAnother area I'm interested in is this burgeoning market for weight loss drugs.  NVO is so wildly successful its had an outsized effect on the Danish economy, there are lot of interesting articles discussing these effects.  No doubt there is opportunity amongst other companies creating ozempic alternatives.\n\nGood luck, keep your eyes open.",

I have fairly extensive experience professionally using AWS products and believe in the business model of roping people into an expensive environment that's somewhat tricky to leave while providing quality cloud compute in return.  That and I just like the product.\n\nI also have been options trading on the side with somewhat surprising success riding the very predictable up/down patterns of stocks like VSCO and BA, although I'd never hold shares.\n\nAnother growth ETF that was recommended to me was XAUG.  I don't have the expertise to describe exactly what it even is, but it has provided returns.\n\nI mentioned I re-invested some of my earnings with the assistence of a professional.  Part of this was purchasing a local old-school manufacturing plant.  They did about 500k/yr in business but it was all walk-in/word of mouth.  I whipped up a website and a google ads campaign, now it's a 5m/yr business that's carved out a niche doing these large out of state jobs.  If I was to recommend \\*anything\\*, it would be finding some way of getting into business for yourself.  Take out a loan, buy something from a business brokerage.  I've put people in place at the plant to run it, so I'm not there day to day and just handle the website/ads/internet side of the business.\n\nGood luck in your journey.",

I didn't work enough hours to qualify for a 401K at my part-time job so I didn't start a 401K until my early 20s. I didn't max my Roth IRA until I was in my 20s, when I had higher paying internships.\n\nInitially, I had one of the target funds for both my IRA and 401K, but in my mid-20s I switched everything to Vanguard and Fidelity's equivalent of the SP500.\n\nI've kept a spreadsheet where I've logged my data since January 2016. My IRA was at $8,171 and my 401K was at $1,365. Today, my IRA is around $130,000 and my 401K is at \\~$345K, so a combined $475,000 in 8 years.\n\nIf I had to go back and do it again, I would've tried to learn what the minimum working hours were at my job to qualify for the 401K so I could try to get there if I was somewhat close (if it needed to work a ton more hours, I probably wouldn't have changed a thing, since I had to balance school and eventually, another internship). I would've also moved my fund portfolio all to SP500 much sooner.\n\nFor brokerage accounts, I did dabble into individual stocks in my early 20s, but I got scared whenever it dipped. I'd sell at breakeven. I regret doing that now. If I could go back, I'd buy, hold, and never sell - which is exactly what I am doing now and it's working well.\n\nSo altogether, in 2016 I had $15,000 in my accounts. Today, I have around \\~$850,000, and combined with my husband, we have around $1.5M + \\~$400K in home equity.",

If I could go back in time the main thing I would've changed is investing more in myself and my career early on. I have a good career now, but it took me some time to get there.\n\nMy advice to young folks is don't invest more than 5-10% of your portfolio in individual stocks, And definitely don't touch options. It's an uncompensated risk and you're at a disadvantage compared to professionals, I'd say only do it if you want to for fulfillment in a way that paper trading doesn't provide. Or just do 100% index if you don't feel tempted to pick stocks. Too many people losing most of what they have because they speculate on individual companies.",
