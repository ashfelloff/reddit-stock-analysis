  "selftext": "E.l.f. Beauty raised its full-year guidance on Wednesday after posting a 40% growth in sales. \n\nShares of the company rose nearly 20% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe cosmetics retailer’s earnings came in well ahead of expectations on the top and bottom lines and it now expects sales to be between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion during fiscal 2025, ahead of the $1.30 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. \n\nHere’s how E.l.f. did in its second fiscal quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 77 cents adjusted vs. 43 cents expected\n\nRevenue: $301 million vs. $286 million expected\n\nThe company’s reported net income for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30 was $19 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $33 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, E.l.f. saw earnings of $45 million, or 77 cents per share.  \n\nSales rose to $301 million, up about 40% from $216 million a year earlier. \n\nE.l.f. raised its full-year revenue guidance from a previous range of $1.28 billion to $1.3 billion and also raised its adjusted earnings guidance. The retailer is expecting adjusted earnings to be between $3.47 to $3.53 per share, up from a prior outlook of between $3.36 and $3.41 per share. Analysts had been looking for earnings guidance of $3.51, according to LSEG. \n\nThe cosmetics company has been on a tear over the past couple of years thanks to its viral marketing and its prowess in winning over young shoppers with its value versions of prestige favorites. \n\n“We’re seeing multi-generational appeal on E.l.f. Not only are we the No. 1 brand amongst Gen Z by a pretty wide margin, but we’re also the most purchased brand amongst Gen Alpha and millennials,” CEO Tarang Amin said in an interview with CNBC. “We’re picking up consumers in pretty much every age and income cohort, which is great to see, and I think just talks to the strength of our strategy and the quality of our products.” \n\nAmin said that success has led both Target and Walgreens to plan to expand the shelf space they allot for the retailer starting in the spring. \n\nDuring the quarter, E.l.f.’s selling, general and administrative costs rose by $74 million to $186.1 million, or 62% of net sales, but it still managed to post a 71% gross margin, an increase of 0.4 percentage points from the year-ago quarter. \n\nTang attributed the increase in margin to favorable foreign exchange rates, previously enacted price increases internationally and its overall value proposition. \n\n“Our ability to engineer prestige quality at these extraordinary prices has been the real driver, but most of our margin progress over the years has been through our innovation mix,” Amin said. “As we introduce a new one of our holy grails, it gives us the opportunity to inch up margin a little bit while still offering an incredible value.” \n\nThe company has also been building out its international sales, which now make up about 21% of overall revenue. \n\nAmin said its exposure to markets outside of the U.S. will help soften the blow from any tariff hikes that could come under President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/06/elf-beauty-elf-earnings-q2-2025.html",

Their strategy of making affordable dupes of high-end products is working perfectly. The Gen Z appeal is massive and they're expanding shelf space at Target and Walgreens.\n\nInternational growth looking strong too - up 91% and now 16% of revenue. Smart move diversifying beyond US market. Margins holding steady at 71% despite higher costs.\n\nThe Naturium acquisition already paying off. Added 16 points to their growth this quarter. Their multi-brand strategy with e.l.f. Cosmetics, Naturium, Well People, and Keys Soulcare gives them solid market coverage.\n\nBalance sheet is rock solid. Low debt-to-equity at 0.37 and plenty of cash. This isn't just a growth story - it's a well-run business with staying power.",
