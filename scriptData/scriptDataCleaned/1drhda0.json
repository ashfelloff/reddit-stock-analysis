I am in RIVN in the hopes that they manage to get to contribution margin positive sooner rather than later and stop burning so much cash - they still likely need a cap raise going into R2 launch since the cash burn and working capital needs for the ramp are high. The market will outsize the reward in RIVN for merely getting to contribution margin positive, much less gross margin positive. The DCF is still trash for RIVN though. As for DCF’s, garbage in, garbage out and yours is clearly garbage. Check the revised production plans. On a pure valuation basis, NIO is currently outselling Rivian’s 2025 and 2026 possible levels, and is gross margin positive, and trades at less than half the P/S.\n\nOh, and Rivian is pretty much near the bottom in vehicle quality and reliability.. hazards for being a start up.

You hold shares in some Cayman Islands shell company with an economic agreement of future returns from the real Nio.

Overall, Tesla Model X outsold the R1S across all markets. And some folks opted for the Tesla Model Y, which sold 96,729 units in the US in Q1, or roughly 35% marketshare by itself. In Q1, Tesla had about 50% US marketshare, and that is with the refreshed Tesla Model 3 only available in small numbers as the production was cut over from the old model.\n\nThat means the R1T sold about 5,571 in Q1. Given the Rivian production shutdown and the growth of Cybertruck deliveries, likely Cybertruck outsold the R1T handily YTD. Cybertruck deliveries in Q2 are likely more than 10,000. That would beat the R1T on a YTD basis as well as beat the R1S in Q2.\n\nThat’s why it is misleading for you to just pick two individual vehicles to compare.",
