Both companies say they operate in a highly competitive environment.\n\"The concern appears to be that Visa is using volume-based discounts to discourage merchants from diverting debit volume to other networks,\" brokerage TD Cowen said.\n\n\"It appears to us that Justice needs to argue that Visa providing discounts creates a barrier to entry for new rivals that could have driven down pricing even more.\"\n\nNews of the potential lawsuit comes months after another major legal setback for the duo, when a judge rejected a $30 billion antitrust settlement under which Visa and Mastercard had agreed to limit the fees they charge merchants that accept their credit and debit cards.\nBrokerage KBW estimated that the U.S. debit business likely represents 10% of Visa revenues at the high end. It said the potential lawsuit is unlikely to be material in the long-term but expects a prolonged road to resolution.\nThe prudent course of action for Visa would be to wait until the November election to \"see the intentions of the next administration,\" said Odysseas Papadimitriou, CEO of personal finance firm WalletHub.\n\n\"If the next administration's intentions are anything similar to the current one, the goal should be to settle instead of fighting a legal battle. There is a lot of uncertainty when you have protracted court battles, especially against the government.\"\n\nMastercard shares fell 1% in morning trade. Both stocks have underperformed broader markets this year, gaining 11% and 16.5% respectively, compared with the S&P 500's (.SPX), opens new tab near 20% gain.\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/finance/visa-falls-report-us-doj-lawsuit-alleging-debit-card-monopoly-2024-09-24/",

Literally it wouod be **free money** to merchants….because merchants are usually full of shit.\n\nThis same bullshit happened in the past with debit cards\n\nhttps://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2342593\n\nAnd it made life worse off for consumers while merchants pocketed the gains \n\n> The cost to merchants of taking payment on debit cards declined by more than $7 billion annually as a result of the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, while the effective cost to issuers of providing debit card services to consumers increased by a corresponding amount. This paper reports an event-study analysis of stock prices to determine the impact on consumers of the Durbin Amendment. Did consumers gain more from cost savings passed on by merchants, in the form of lower prices and better services, than they lost from cost increases passed on by banks, in the form of higher prices or less service? We find that consumers lost more on the bank side than they gained on the merchant side. Our estimate is that, based on the expectations of investors, the present discounted value of the losses for consumers as a result of the implementation of the Durbin Amendment is between $22 and $25 billion.\n\nUnless merchants cough up the billions they stole from consumers by pushing that bullshit in the past I don’t want to hear a word about “muuuuhhh merchant fees”",
