      "body": "I think the overarching effect of this is far, far worse for the economy, currency and stock market than what most people realise. \n\nThe US dollar has always been seen as the new ‘gold standard’ in the fiat era due to the fact that American politics are one of the most stable in the world, providing a really bullish economic environment for capitalist ideas and businesses to grow. That stable political eco system has also guaranteed other stabilities that we’ve taken for granted; such as the world’s strongest military and currency. \n\nWith stuff like what happened today, we are talking about an event that America has not faced since the 60s. Half a century or so. If a front runner candidate for America’s presidency came within inches of death due to an assassination attempt, it would call into serious question the integrity and stability of the political system and judiciary (rule of law), as well as the ability of security agencies to protect key decision makers. \n\nWith this basic rule of law in question, the US dollar itself would come into increased speculation from investors; I mean, would you want to invest in a country’s currency where the head of state or political figures can be deposed via violence at any day and at any time? Probably not, because that’s a reflection of the overarching stability of the nation, extending to its currency and economics. This would inevitably cause devaluation of the dollar if left unchecked and people would need to spend more to buy, meaning that hopes of an interest rate cuts will be dealt another big blow. \n\nFor the stock market, yes, I potentially see some short term plays on DJT and alt-media on Monday, but the net effect on the market will be negative to retail. Since the dollar itself is likely to devaluate as a result, we are likely to see less rallies since people’s disposable incomes take a hit. Also, cost of buying securities, especially foreign ones will go up significantly.",
