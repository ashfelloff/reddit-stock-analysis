It was money I could afford to lose in order to teach myself to trade, common factor I noticed was that as soon as I bought into the position it tanked immediately, every time. Not giving up though, I‚Äôve seen people in this sub make life changing money from one trade, I‚Äôll get there ü•π",

      "body": "Sorry for your loss.  \n\nFirst, To me it's not enjoyable to see others lose money in any market since technology has made it possible for the average \"Pat\" to invest in fractional shares and crypto.  I'm a proponent of \"the people,\" being able to take advantage of all that the stock market has to offer.  Particularly the younger generations.  I want most everyone to understand the matter and allow everyone to gamble whatever they can afford to lose on investments that have a real potential to change their lives. \n\nThat said, when someone like you (OP) l takes losses like this, I'm curious if you understand why you lost what you did and how you could have prevented realizing that loss.\n\nIf you brought home as valuable lesson and speak about it , that would be MY loss porn.  I want to know the good honest why and how you realized this loss, and what you learned in the process that could potentially prevent other investors from experiencing this kind of loss. \n\nIt appears to me, your loss was a result of buying high and selling low.  (The opposite of what you want to do obviously). \n\nThe question is, if you buy high again in the future, what will you do to prevent losing your investment. (, Obviously, this doesn't necessarily apply to the higher risk \"options\" trading that many do when they have information that could help guide them towards a winning bet (like sports betting, you find out that, for example, your team has four critical members of the team officially out on medical, it's fairly safe to assume that their secondary players may not have the skillet to replace the other crystal players for the next game against a strong rival team). That's an decent educated gas based on data and basic common sense or logic as your predictor) but I digress.\n\nWhat do you think you could have done to avoid losing the money you lost in this particular \"investment\"\n\nWhat does the word \"investment\"mean to you?  Hopefully it includes the words \"Due diligence\" and \"risk of loss\" as well as hedging your bets with conservative investments that are time proven to grow slowly but surely.  It's possible to make a ton of money quickly, but as you can see, the most risky moves (like options) can often backfire without reliable data and perfect timing.\n\nHow you could have converted this loss into a potential gain or at the very least an eventual \"break even\" situation?  \n\nIf you owned fractional shares, you could have avoided an immediate loss by simply holding your stocks and not selling them at such a deep loss. \n\nBy not selling your shares but rather holding (unless, of course, the stock you purchased was that of a company in dire financial ruin or bankruptcy when you sold your shares) the potential of a return eventually would still exist.\n\nSometimes we all take temporary or even permanent losses (like we do at a casino or any gambling circumstance) depending on our decisions. \n\n Ultimately, you should never gamble money you can't afford to lose.  I'm a bit conservative in that way, but if you're young, you will have the chance to recoup those losses and find better ways of growing your investment portfolio.\n\nBest of luck.  I suggest doing a full post mortem and figure out what you did or didn't do that could have prevented this loss.  Just my $0.02!\n\nüòéüòâ ~Dave",
