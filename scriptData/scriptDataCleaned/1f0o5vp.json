What's funny is that the word \"normal\" wasn't actually used in its modern definition and intention to describe something \"conforming to a standard; usual, typical, or expected\" in mainstream text or dialogue until many years after the town was founded. \n\nThe use of the word \"normal\" in its modern definition is believed to come from a reference to the town itself. \nThe first recorded use in print is from a news article in The Illinois Herald in 1867 in which a young boy won a fishing derby and a local was quoted as saying \"That's a Normal thang that happens from time to time I suppose\".\n\nPeople began to reference the town of Normal, Illinois as the archetype for the standard American town. Things happened there that happened everywhere. It was just \"Normal\" stuff that could happen in Anytown, USA. \n\nFrom there the word came into the common nomenclature in the mid 1870's to mean \"standard\" or \"usual\". It's now commonly misconstrued that the town Normal was named so because it's boring, or nothing unusual happens there but in fact the opposite is true and the word was developed to represent the boringness that Normal came to represent. If you're still reading this and haven't guessed yet I'll confirm to you now that I'm pulling this out of my ass, which is normal for me.",
