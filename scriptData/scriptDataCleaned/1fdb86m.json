      "body": "Didn´t check the index, but tariff futures just rose, I suppose? \n\nChina needs to invest massively in health care, pensions etc. in order to stimulate it´s economy and increase consumer sentiment by cementing social security. And it needs to level the playing field with Europe, if it doesn´t want them to shut down trade further and rearrange the global flow of goods in a cold war era style. \n\nRight now the massive advantage, China has created for it´s own industry isn´t working for it, but against it. Trade is being throttled and that is hurting Chinas recovery just as badly as the European economy. It makes little sense to try to stop the massive outflow of capital and increase foreign investment by simply reducing regulations upon it, when at the same time a market is being created, where foreign money can´t make profit.",
