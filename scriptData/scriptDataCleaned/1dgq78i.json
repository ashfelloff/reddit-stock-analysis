  "selftext": "Alright, so I am quite confident about this. Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) has been doing pretty well for itself, especially given its recent impressive earnings report. This strong financial performance indicates robust underlying fundamentals and growth potential. Additionally, AVGO is mimicking Nvidia's market behaviour quite closely.\n\n\n\nThere are several reasons why I believe AVGO could continue to rise. Broadcom's diversification across various sectors, including semiconductors, software, and infrastructure software, positions it well for sustained growth. The company's smart acquisition strategies have expanded its market reach and enhanced its technological capabilities. Moreover, Broadcom's partnerships with major tech companies and its role in 5G infrastructure development are likely to drive significant revenue growth.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, AVGO's consistent dividend payments and share buyback programs show a strong commitment to returning value to shareholders, which is attractive to investors. The global demand for semiconductors is surging, and Broadcom is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend.\n\n\n\nGiven this pattern, I feel that by the time its stock split rolls around, it should be closer to $1,850. The strategic alignment, market dynamics, and strong growth factors suggest a favourable trend for AVGO, which bolsters my confidence in this projection.\n\n- I did refine this with GPT, so don't blame me if it sounds robotic, my writing ain't good.",

This represents a 15% rise over the current price within one month. The profit difference between the two options would be around $3,000 at this price point and would grow exponentially with further increases.\n\nUsing NVIDIA as an example, a significant part of my strategy hinges on its performance. NVIDIA's stock increased by 24% in the month following its earnings report, past its split leading to last week. While AVGO appears to be following a similar trend, driven by NVIDIA's innovations, I am betting that NVIDIA will positively influence AVGO. However, expecting a minimum 15% rise for AVGO within a month seems somewhat unrealistic to me, and the risk:reward doesn't seem as appealing.   \n  \nHope that makes sense.",
