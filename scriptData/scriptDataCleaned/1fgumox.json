How's that possible if the losses were the only factor in their bankruptcy? It's not.

I entered calls there and exited when it tested equal highs around 120 a week later and that was a very profitable trade. I don’t just buy stocks willy nilly I have different goals. I have long term investments, short/med/long term trades and I change what I do and what I trade/invest based on the macro, technical and fundamental conditions. An example of changing my long term investments based on these is I have been exiting tech and the major indices and rotating into bonds, bond etfs, metals and even some inverse indices due to the change in conditions. We are 100% entering a recession and the fed is about to cut rates so I’m trading/investing accordingly.
