  "score": 204,
  "selftext": "\"Intuitive Machines (Nasdaq: LUNR) has been awarded a Near Space Network (NSN) contract by NASA for communication and navigation services in the near space region. The contract, valued at up to $4.82 billion, is a Firm-Fixed-Price, Multiple Award, Indefinite-Delivery/Indefinite-Quantity (IDIQ) Task Order Contract with a base period of five years and an additional five-year option.\r  \n\r  \nThe contract highlights Intuitive Machines' lunar satellite constellation, which will provide enhanced data transmission services and autonomous operations. This aligns with the company's three pillars to commercialize lunar activities: scaling lunar lander capabilities, establishing a satellite network for data and navigation services, and developing infrastructure for lunar exploration and operations.\r  \n\r  \nAs part of the contract, Intuitive Machines will deploy lunar relay satellites and provide essential services for NASA's Artemis campaign to establish a long-term presence on the Moon.\"",
