              "body": "The problem that people are having is that they are looking at this like Nvidia + AMD + Qualcomm vs Intel for Intel to die. The reality is it is Intel vs Intel for Intel to die. It’s offing itself. \n\nThe issue Intel is going to have is a lot of people and businesses has lost trust in them. The 13th and 14th gen fuck ups haven’t financially hurt them yet but will this quarter and subsequent quarters. You can’t just fuck up your own chips act like assholes and expected your partners and customers to be ok with it. \n\nIntel delaying Datacenter/Ai servers in the past because of their own ineptitude then getting destroyed by Nvidia and AMD who are essentially a generation ahead because Intels offering sucked.\n\nRecovering that market share isn’t going to happen unless there are colossal fuck ups. Keep in mind server contracts are for multiple years ~ Intel keeps losing ground it’s gonna get worse for them if they are continuously 3rd choice.  \n\nIntel has companies like Mobileye and Altera that they could have probably sold for tons of profit quarters ago. Mobileye specifically they could have sold their 86% ish share for like 21 billion. Now it’s closer 9.8 billion and falling. A bad upcoming quarter for Mobileye will wipe so much value away.  \n\nOh and Intel has slowed production on all their fabs or has sold a % of said fab to an investment group. \n\nAmd also isn’t really second place to Intel anymore. In basically everything they are either going blow for blow or outright beating them. Only thing they aren’t having the same success on is Laptops because of volume and customizability. \n\nThey have also developed a really shitty work environment, stock keeps falling or stays the same so compensation blows, there is constant layoffs, and they just took away a ton of employee perks. No one with talent is going to work for Intel. \n\nAll these problems are Intel problems, taking a shotgun to their balls and cocking it. This didn’t happen over night. It was a long festering problem that they refused to do anything about for years. Now they are paying the price. Expect product delays, layoffs, problems with said products and overall a shitty situation getting worse.",

Microchips are basically the most advanced technology on the planet.

Manufacturing shitty processors makes you a friend to car companies that need cheap solutions, for example. If everything were as advanced as microchips, we'd be the Jetsons.\n\nA modern chip fab is the size of a school bus, costs a quarter of a billion dollars, and is only made in Denmark. The floor to enter the modern market is absurd.\n\nDomestically, here's what we got on the \"good stuff\" end.\n\nIntel makes its own crap, and is falling behind competitors, but is still pumping out stuff and fighting to stay relevant.\n\nL3Harris makes crap directly for the government.\n\nGlobalfoundries is the old AMD manufacturing arm, plus IBM's manufacturing arm, left to grow into its own beast after being dumped from 2009-early 2010s. I think it's a step or two behind TSMC, but rather than butt heads, they're sharing patents because the two companies can effectively block each other if they argue.\n\nWe also have a small handful of companies focusing on chips for cars, phones, and solar systems, but none of them manufacture \"brains\" like the above.\n\nTexas Instruments technically makes chips, but they've managed to carve out a niche where their ancient tech remains the standard, so they're basically an example of what Intel might end up being if it learns to shit out crap chips in a stable manner.",
