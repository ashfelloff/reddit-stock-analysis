The biggest problem is you have options that expire WORTHLESS if it doesn't get to 221+by expire date and u bought after it made a MONSTER move up meaning it might consolidate those gains for quite a while before attempting to move higher if at all. It's not impossible that it rips higher but My best prediction is it consolidates and drifts lower for while before it eventually moves higher but I just don't see it before your expire date.

I think it‚Äôs highly unlikely these contracts expire in the money, as it‚Äôd require another 7% move, and it already moved 10% on earnings.\n\nYou have several options, none of which are too terrible, but all of which take time:\n1) wait till before close next Friday, see if you get lucky. If you don‚Äôt, you can exercise 3 of those contracts, buy the underlying, hold them, and when the stock eventually gets to 300 you‚Äôll break even. You‚Äôll need about $66,000 more to do this but some of that can be on leverage. Exercise more options in order to require a lesser increase in the stock. \n2) sell the options now, use that money to buy more calls further out, keep doing that till you‚Äôve recovered\n3) sell the options now, use that money to buy calls on a different stock that has room to run, for example another earnings report (but this time buy before report). This could get you to break even fast, or you‚Äôll still lose your shirt, but it gives you another shot. \n4) sell the options today, thank your stars you could recoup 75%, stay out of options trading for a while\n5) cross your fingers, hope you get lucky and they expire ITM by end of next week, if you win great, if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll have closure and can move on with your life.",
