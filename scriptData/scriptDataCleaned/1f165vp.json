  "selftext": "I'm not sure if this is the right sub for this question, but here it goes. I've been reading up on the major financial crises recently (see below summaries in case you're curious) and I am wondering what people think might trigger the next one and when it might happen.\n\nWhile there's a lot of hype around AI, which could potentially be a risk factor, it's also highly beneficial in many areas, so I might be off the mark. Additionally, ongoing wars don't seem to be significantly impacting the markets. What do you think could lead to a major downturn?\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nSUMMARIES OF MAJOR CRISES \n\n1. 1973 Oil Crisis\n Triggered by the OPEC oil embargo, which led to a quadrupling of oil prices. This caused severe inflation, economic recession, and a sharp decline in stock markets worldwide.\n\n2. Black Monday (1987)\nOn October 19, 1987, global stock markets crashed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunging 22.6% in a single day. The exact causes are debated but include computerised trading and overvaluation.\n\n3. Japanese Asset Price Bubble (1991)\nA massive speculative bubble in Japanese real estate and stock markets burst in the early 1990s. The Nikkei index lost about 50% of its value, leading to a prolonged economic slump known as the \"Lost Decade.\"\n\n4. Asian Financial Crisis (1997)\nBeginning in Thailand with the collapse of its currency, the crisis spread across East Asia, leading to massive currency devaluations, stock market declines, and economic turmoil in countries like South Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia.\n\n5. Dot-com Bubble Burst (2000)\nAfter a period of extreme speculation in internet-related companies, the bubble burst, leading to a massive decline in the NASDAQ and global stock markets. Many tech companies went bankrupt, and trillions of dollars in market value were wiped out.\n\n6. Global Financial Crisis (2007-2008)\nThe most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression, triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market and the failure of major financial institutions. Stock markets around the world plummeted, leading to the Great Recession.\n\n7. European Sovereign Debt Crisis (2010)\nThe crisis started with concerns over Greece's high debt levels and quickly spread to other Eurozone countries. Stock markets across Europe fell sharply, and there were fears of a Euro collapse, leading to significant volatility in global markets.\n\n8. Chinese Stock Market Crash (2015)\nA dramatic decline in the Chinese stock market, fueled by a combination of high levels of margin trading and government intervention. This led to a significant drop in global stock markets, with concerns about China's economic slowdown.\n",

This ended up resulting in a lot of weird actions such as the excessive carry trade with the Japanese yen which began unwinding recently, causing a panic for a few days, that is no longer considered a threat.\n\nThere was also an undeclared recession in 2022, after the peak of 2021 in November. Take a look at (5) year charts of the NASDAQ for example, which demonstrated a -30% decline. The \"magnificent 7\" collective lost an incredible amount of value, and Tesla in particular lost around 75% of its value during that time.\n\n2023 AI boom, which has continued to this day, is on an absolutely unsustainable course. But the levers of financial manipulation currently work too fast to actually catch up to reality, and that is ultimately going to be the downfall, as it always is.\n\nLook at Nvidia's chart for another example. It has spiked in ways that rival or exceed the dot-com bubble, which took about a decade to ramp up & crash to a bottom.\n\nBut this time it is happening at breakneck speed, so may perhaps only take half the time to crack.\n\nI've speculated in the past, however, that a catastrophic act of war may be the impetus for the next crash which is unavoidable in terms of political & financial market rhetoric. However, NBER would need to be pressured to announce & acknowledge this, and the sitting President would need to admit the reality of the situation.\n\nSo, in short, the series of bubbles from COVID money printing, AI stock options, and a lacking underlying economic engine to support this false sense of growth is what is going to cause the next collapse, but it is unlikely to become transparent without an event such as the invasion of Taiwan, or advanced aggression in the Pacific with DPRK, retaliation from Russia, a broadening of the Middle Eastern conflict (which is already happening) in conjunction with America losing a grip on it all.",

The amount of investment is absurd, and as far as profitability, it's still too soon to tell, but clearly right now the AI services are being given away to continue the blitz scaling tech model... to me it seems like it won't be long until all those AI prompts need to cost literally the same, maybe even more as it will require manual tweaking, as the equivalent human input in order to truly be sustainable. The quality might also go down the shitter as copyright laws catch up and AI training becomes an issue... there is a possibility of AI inbreeding, where the only content easily available is AI generated itself.\n\nI would not be surprised to see thousands of business ventures go under in the next couple of years because they were either bullshitting their AI capabilities, or did not properly assess the very likely sharp rise in cost while we're already seeing maybe a lower ceiling than expected, just like self-driving. I expect self-driving taxis to be a thing, but not this futuristic perfect smooth ride... more like a bottom of the barrel, might get stuck and just fucking walk out mid ride, can't complain because the cost is lower, shitty service without any assistance, and aging cars that smell like puke and body odor. Same with AI basically. As far as how it's being pitched, It can only truly work at a very low level, and already seems to be turning into a novelty like tiktok filters, dirty songs on Youtube and Facebook memes. \n\nJust to be clear, I'm not talking about artificial intelligence... that was there way before the AI boom...

And then there’s insurance policies that have just gone up massively. In the UK - house insurance is up like 70-80%+ up year on year. Car insurance is so high yoy % and I can’t quite see how that’s happened. So I think this is a big one to come out next.\n\nOnly issue is; usually the governing bodies won’t do much anyways to help or prevent it - just take a look at all the water companies and pollution they are causing as the fines are cheaper to pay than cleaning the water etc. absolute joke.",
