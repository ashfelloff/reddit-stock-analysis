I think most people when they embark on investing believe that they know what they're doing they can't lose they have all of the right information. I've said it before that the best thing that can happen to somebody when they turn 21 and walk into a casino for the first time and start the gamble is that they lose money. \nPeople tell me why would you wish that upon others and my response is simple because greed has a way of taking control and naivete prohibits you from seeing the casinos were not built on winners. \nThe stock market is very similar I've spent the better half of my life over 36 years now still trying to learn every day right from wrong minimize losses maximize returns. The market's dynamic technology evolves but the one thing that always stays the same as buy low sell high. \n12,000 can be a lifetime of earnings a lifetime of savings for some people for others it can be a rounding error in their paycheck. \nMy suggestion is you get a second job earn the money back and give it back to your mom that's the first thing that I would do understand that hard work sweat equity over time ultimately pay off. If something can be earned very quickly it also can be lost just as fast and you just found that out in short order. \nSo my first suggestion is get a job I don't care if it's busing tables helping others on campus whatever you can do to start repatriating and paying back your mom because you will feel better yourself as a person that you write it the wrong. \nYour approach and I did not read into it I don't know if you're using options or betting on futures or trying to day trade it's not working and you need a reset. You need to take a step backwards and understand that investing is a marathon it's not a Sprint. \nI witness times in Bull market's first hand I can go back to 1998 sitting in a Chili's restaurant and all of the chatter around me were people talking about how much money they're making in the stock market that they're quitting their regular job because they make more day trading and investing in the stock market than they do their career that they studied for I went to school for. Typically this is representative of a high in the marketplace when the taxi driver gives you investment advice that's where the old adage be fearful when others are greedy and greedy and others are fearful should chime in and you start building a stockpile of cash rather than going very aggressive. \nGetting investment advice from blind faces online may or may not be something that I would advise myself but I'm speaking from the heart I'm speaking for somebody who has had some very high highs and who's lost a significant amount of money at times in the market. \nI wish you the very best and I hope you make the right choices not only and paying back your mom but in your future investment endeavors.",
