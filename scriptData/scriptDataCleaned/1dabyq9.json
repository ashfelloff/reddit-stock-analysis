Generative AI is a *tool*, not a *substitution*, for a human.\n\n> is enough to save companies billions in costs for employees whose entire job is to do such things.\n\n> [...]\n\n> etc.\n\nThat's the most common argument — \"billions will be saved\" and your examples are nowhere near close to assure that. And the AI still requires human supervision.\n\nBtw. most companies (except for Nvidia of course, since they're selling the shovels) are *losing* on AI.\n\nYou provide a few weak arguments, as if they collectively created one strong argument.\n\nAlso I don't know what the \"etc.\" at the end is means — am I supposed to come up with some strong points myself? Or does the list of weak use cases continue? You're using it to make it seem like there are endless actually profitable possibilities, but you didn't provide a single one.\n\n> There's just so many jobs that will be affected by this, both in efficiency (keeping the job but making it more efficient)\n\nYeah, people will have to learn to work with AI.

They know perfectly well that if they go out to the market and say \"AI isn't really working for us, we ran the numbers and it isn't worth the cost\", it will tank the entire market, their shares included.\n\nSo the big tech companies have weird incentives to stay onboard the AI hype train even if it's actually dragging their numbers down. That said, if it isn't making any money for them - and at least right now, I don't think it is - they could quietly cut back on spending on it while still talking it up to the press. That could result in some surprises to the downside for suppliers of the equipment like Nvidia.",

Being contrarian doesn’t mean you’re right or smart.\n\nThere is a weird dynamic here between early and late employees. There's a shine to working at NVIDIA now, whereas before it was kind of a boring tier 2 company. But now your stock grant is literally at a valuation of $3 trillion, with a ton of downside. I don't know; I mean, I would consider an offer, but it seems risky.\n\nIt’s pretty remarkable for people who have been there even a year. A senior engineer might get $200,000 cash and $150,000 in stock a year. That stock has increased tenfold, so their total compensation would go from $350,000 to $1.7 million.\n\nNever mind a staff or senior staff engineer, where you’d be making $250,000 cash and $400,000 in stock.
