  "selftext": "There are probably a million posts about this stock but I want to ask your opinions on if it would be a good idea to buy as many call options as I could, on a strike price of about $126 with a expiry of Dec 2026.\n\nI’m planning on just dumping my entire savings into Dec 2026 call options on NVIDIA. Good or bad idea? \n\nI’m going to say the trend is our friend here and assume that by, even 2025 that we’ll see gains above this strike price. \n\nAlso another question, I know the value of a call option goes down the closer to the expiry date it gets, is that only the upfront cost that you paid for the contracts that goes down or is it the actual profit made from the shares or is it both? \n\n\nIs leveraged x2 GOOG shares safer than a NVIDIA leap? \n\nEdit: going with just buying shares of leveraged NVIDIA\nThank you for your help ",

If you want long term growth for your life savings invest in a diversified portfolio and index funds. There is a lot more to the market than one single stock.

      "body": "The value of an option is the amount of money you would get if you sold it to someone else. It is determined by the price others are willing to pay for it, which is determined by how likely it is to go in-the-money before it expires, and how far in-the-money it is likely to go. (In-the-money basically means the stock price is higher than the strike price, which is the price you would have to pay for the shares if you exercised the option. How far in-the-money it is is how much money you would make exercising the option.) These are determined by how far in-the-money it is already (the delta); the stock's expected volatility (also known as implied volatility or IV or vega) (higher IV results in a higher options price because it's more likely that the stock price will increase before the expiration); and how long it is before the option expires (the theta) (because if it expires sooner, it's less likely for the stock price to exceed the strike price before expiration).\nThere are two ways to make money from buying stock options: either the stock price rises far enough above the strike price to compensate for the premium you paid for the option, or you sell the option to someone else for a higher premium than you paid.\nFor more information, visit r/options. \nBasically, buy a call option if you think the stock price will rise far enough above the strike price to compensate for the premium before the option expires, and buy a put option if you think the stock price will fall far enough below the strike price to compensate for the premium. And don't put more in than you can afford to lose.",

As we speak there are Hedge Funds combing through their shipping manifests in Asia and comparing it to their books, because the suspicion is that there is outright accounting fraud going on where non-existent GPUs are sold for cloud credits that are not being used. I would say your idea is very risky with this in mind. Even if nVidia is correctly valued on projected future earnings there is limited additional upside since it's likely already priced in. It's much more likely that bad news, a marked correction (or crash) or an earnings miss will send it in tailspin. Just my 2c",

There's no guarantee there. It's a suggestion, based on the assumption that these GPUs can be rented out 24/7, and that the rates don't go down as new hardware comes. Obviously, this depends on AI demand that is perpetually growing faster than supply of GPUs on the market, and for demand for old hardware to remain elevated despite better hardware being available.\n\nYou'd have to be incredibly naïve to take what they're saying at face value.
