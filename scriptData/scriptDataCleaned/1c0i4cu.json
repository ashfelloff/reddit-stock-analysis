In other words when you see oil going to 100+ (2022/2006-7-8) start worrying lol. \nOil up = inflation up\nOil up means everything you need to import costs more aka inflation. So if Israel actually eliminates the Iran threat and makes the oil cheaper or like not more expensive then we are going to continue bull market.\nThe inflation came 0.1% hot just like last report this time we cared, last month we didn't - you ask why?\nSimple because of a iran war threat which would make the whole oil industry via asia route to eu and usa go to shit, so we care about it now lol.\nOnce that threat is gone inflation is already fine because the only issue USA experiences with inflation is housing/shelter costs, that goes down with interest rate cuts.\nIn other words fuck oil \nWhat i blubbered sorry",
