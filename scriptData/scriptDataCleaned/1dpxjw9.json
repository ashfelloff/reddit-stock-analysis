If the ship had a catastrophic failure, fair enough but it's some silly hydrogen issue and they arrived safely (any landing you can walk away from n all that).\n\nA lot of the news headlines recently about Boeing have been completely unrelated to the company. A 737 bought 20 years ago and suddenly has a tyre issue is not Boeing's fault, emergency decent on pressurisation failure was not a Boeing issue. Ever since the legitimate Boeing failures, any issue involving any Boeing plane has immediately got branded a Boeing issue and people didn't use their common sense to realise there is more things at play (such as the operator's maintenance teams).\n\nIn conclusion, Boeing had bad headlines months ago which got priced in, nothing since then has been significant enough to move the share price.\n\nHowever, my trades lose money so feel free to disregard that completely and inverse me",
