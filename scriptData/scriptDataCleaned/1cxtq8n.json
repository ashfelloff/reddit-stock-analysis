  "selftext": "\nThe most important news from Microsoft BUILD conference: NVDA has competition\n\nThis is a very important little point in[Microsoft BUILD keynote](https://youtu.be/w1EepB0mCbE?si=_65UHAfSdYgpw-o-). The most advanced LLM model (GPT4) is running at a lower cost on AMD chips. It’s not just about AMD being able to do this. NVDA margins are so high that almost any solution that is not NVDA is going to be a better deal. \nIt’s also reasonable to think that big players like AAPL and GOOG want a piece of this cake too. It might take some time but they are for sure going to build chips for their needs. \n\nApple chips are not made for server but there was news that they are building racks of [M2 Ultra for LLM inference](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/06/apple-building-m2-ultra-and-m4-servers/). \n\nFor me, all signs are there to show NVDA is about to feel some pressure for those far margins. \n\nPosition: sold NVDA calls (c990 May 24), break even: NVDA $1015\n",

The risk management is incredibly bad, the losses you’re exposed to is infinite.\n\nHe sold $990 calls expiring 5/24. At that time Nvidia was trading at $940. When you sell a call you get a premium, here $185,000. The higher Nvidia goes the more you owe, so his breakeven was $1015, he’d make $0. His premium - what he owed would be $0.\n\nSince Nvidia has good earnings, it’s likely Nvidia will be over $990 and $1015. Once it’s over $990 his call can be assigned, and each contact allows the owner to buy 100 shares of Nvidia at $990.\n\nHowever he doesn’t own Nvidia, he’s naked! He’ll owe a lot of money. If Nvidia hits $1100 he owes $640,000 if my math is correct…",
