              "body": "It shouldn’t be saved. \n\nTheater chains created a lot of weird rules in different localities about being the exclusive purveyor of commercial films. \n\nIt’s part of why you have so few indie cinemas. For example. Back in the day Kerasotes Theaters (now merged into AMC) used to buy historic theater buildings in communities. Use them for many years as movie theaters. \n\nBuuut. When they would sell it back to the city or to a new developer - it would come with stipulations that the building can’t be used to show first run films for like 100 years or some bullshit. \n\nAMC inherited all of that. And some of those rules still stand. \n\nKill the last theater chain, and those rules die. \n\nAnd. Studios suddenly have to negotiate release schedules with a myriad of theater groups. - that collective bargaining is the way it used to be - and should be again. Studios have enormous leverage over AMC to dictate the technology the theater must buy to play a film, and how expensive it will be to play a film. \n\n\nThose cost pressures drive up ticket sales. But bargaining resistance with AMC gone will flow through the accounting all the way back to film budgets. \n\nIt could create a new need for middle budget films. The sweet spot of cool creative entertainment we had from the 70s-90s. \n\n\nSo fuck AMC. Let it fall. Let things be shitty for about 5 years. And then let’s see what happens as a patchwork of movie options start to come back. \n\nBecause whatever it might be, it’ll be better than what we have now. AMC sucks. 40 minutes of ads before a movie I paid for? Fuck you. ",
