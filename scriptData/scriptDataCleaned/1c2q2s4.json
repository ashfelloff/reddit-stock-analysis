Since today is the 3-month anniversary of the day I started, here is an update/story.\n\nIt started many months ago, Setptember to be exact, when I was selling cash secured puts on average stocks like META, MSFT, etc.. then everything changed in December when I decided to sell puts on AMC. AMC tanked and my puts got assigned, so I doubled down and it kept falling. Before I knew it, I was leveraged to the tits. Full send, max margin in AMC shares which you can see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/18wr5vz/the_first_and_probably_last_green_ytd_chart_i/) - a photo of my portfolio is in the comments. Unfortunately, AMC continued to go down.\n\nAround January 13th, I said fuck it. I sold EVERYTHING at a huge loss. I settled on keeping $58k and went full send into NFLX Put credit spreads barely out of the money. NFLX rose on earnings and the strategy was born.\n\nEventually, I did more research. I made the spreadsheet you see in my DD post and have since updated it further. Also, I almost exclusively sell deep otm call credit spreads now because I have found that they give me better risk to reward. Since January 13th, and Just to name a few, I've yeeted my whole net worth into selling OTM weekly Call Credit Spreads on NFLX, LULU, ULTA, COST, DG, MSTR, SMCI, BIDU, SOUN, DJT, and JPM. That's what I can remember right now at least.\n\nI haven't kept track of my total profit per week since I started, but here is the last 4 weeks (I know I'm missing some fees in my weekly ending amounts).\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zxo80m7tf5uc1.png?width=1345&format=png&auto=webp&s=fac9006b05bfbc5ecb25d0e7b4424b90f3d04f05\n\nThe $5700 I withdrew went towards this Rolex that I bought to celebrate.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uy6nl7hvf5uc1.jpg?width=2251&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dd19d0fdf79eddd2d1a0e6e83639260002179654\n\nand yeah, Imma keep going. Earning season starts up again next week. I'll make another update in a month or 2. Good luck and see you soon.",

Stop now and invest this nice amount you have and get long term on stocks you like. 200k is plenty to do the right thing. Your not the first to try this and not the last to lose it all! Also if you don't understand what he's doing don't attempt it. He is risking 100 to make 7 to 9 dollars. He only loses 7 to 9 percent of the time, but when he does he loses it all. In Roulette I can cover almost the entire board and win alot of times in a row and almost feel like I'm printing money, but one loss followed by another and it's all gone plus some. This is no different and the 6 numbers you don't have covered on the entire roulette board will hit twice in a row even though the odds say they should not. You can't just make a hack or endless money printer cause you think your smarter than the market, or have the crazy idea that your the only one who's tried this. This guy thinks he's Karen Burton and if you don't know who that is you should definitely not try this.",

Needless to say, I made like 4k before the whole thing imploded onto my face and all 3 positions went from winning to max loss in a single day, where IV shoot up for no reason and all legs were deep ITM and never recovered. Now unfortunately, here in Europe the options market is pretty illiquid, so most of the plays were made on cash-settled indexes. Needless to say, I now have the remaining 25k and trying to do the same on stocks but with very small positions (1-2 contracts on low price stocks).

It's really obvious at hindsight but at that time it seemed the right play. All 0.10 delta (highly unlikely it would happen but it did). I've been doing the same thing ever since and I think I haven't lost a single position.

Yes the premium was higher but one day you would wake up from winning to an instant max loss position, in that case you couldn't do much, other than pray for a come back (and this happened 3 times back to back). I also prefer put credit spreads over call credit spreads because the premium is higher (people are willing to pay more for downside protection) and statistically stocks usually go up. I keep my strategy the same, sell put credit spreads 1\\[month till expiration, not go full in on a single position but I have like 5 different spreads open (on different equities).

I am aiming for about 3-4% monthly with this and they usually expire way OTM which means you can aim for higher returns theoretically so 8% sounds realistic but it would be my upper limit if I wanted to get greedier for my personal risk appetite.\n\n  \nIf i could give you any advice for aiming for higher returns, that would be using a bollinger band  on a 1month chart /w 2 standard deviations and identify some support/resistance levels (depending on put or call spreads). Then sell your short put outside of the band limits. The delta could be a lot higher (maybe 0.30) but chances are on your side. Yet again, I don't really believe in technical analysis but statistically you would win more times using this vs comparing to the delta or propability of profit, because delta/pop doesn't take into account support/resistance levels or bollinger bands if that makes sense to you.",
