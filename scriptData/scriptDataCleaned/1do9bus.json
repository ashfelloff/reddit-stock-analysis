  "selftext": "Alright degenerates,\n\nBeen balls deep in GRND research lately, and I'm starting to think we're sleeping on a rainbow gold mine here.\n\nGrindr's investor day is tomorrow, and these guys are talking about building a wholeass \"global gayborhood\" in your pocket. We're not just talking dick pics and \"I'm horny\" messages here - this could be the Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp for the LGBTQIA++. Most recently they're expanding into travel because apparently gays travel a lot.\n\nGeorge Arison is a Gigachad baller CEO. I watched his interviews. He's a human catalyst for getting shit done.\n\n[gay bear CEO](https://preview.redd.it/7gn0yj5qkq8d1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=82463c096e386577fe0ec126d9a0e2a59199ae03)\n\nHe's been teasing AI and machine learning shit they've been testing, which sounds like it could print money if they get it right. We all know gays love to roleplay and pretend, so lots of potential in this Gay-AI. Even if their AI-wingman feature is just some horny twink bot, it's a revenue stream waiting to happen...\n\nAnother thing is that they're only monetizing 7% of their users right now. SEVEN PERCENT. That's like leaving money on the table. They recently tried changing their pricing model to offer weekly subs and bam... 16% increase in revenue per paying user. Just like that. üíÖ The CFO also said earlier this month that AB testing revealed prices are more inelastic than expected in the US, so they can clearly still increase revenue by optimizing their pricing.\n\nNow I'm not saying GRND is gonna Uranus üçë overnight. But consider this: Match Group is trading at 5x Grindr, but Grindr's extending far beyond dating, their users are spending 2x the time on the app, gays are statistically richer and hornier, and tap water is turning everyone gay these days. You do the math.\n\nMy current position is 3000 shares and 100 contracts August 15c",

There's also potential for greater market penetration, as they only spent $2.3 million on ads last year (less than 1% of their revenue), which is minuscule compared to competitors like Tinder.",
