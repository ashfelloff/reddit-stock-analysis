Truck stops could have EV charging stations at the parking spots  and the trucks could be designed to have the same run time as the allowable driving hours for the operator. When the driver stops for the day, the truck can recharge. \n\nThis would likely require some improvements to the grid and other infrastructure, but is definitely possible.",

Their method of deployment is simply better, sending their fleets out as non liability fsd testing strategy allows them to figure out and smooth all the edge cases. We already see massive improvements on the fsd over just last few years. I haven’t actually driven for over a month and just let the autopilot took me everywhere, maybe have to auto correct it once in a while during heavy traffic because it is too conservative to merge. \n\nThey can simply scale better because they don’t need prerequisite mapping, plus the extreme cost to manufacture each car. I’ve done similar mapping project in VR with vps and knows how extremely intensive it is, this just isn’t really scalable. You can remind me in 5 years and see who wins the race. ",

In 2016, Musk said a Tesla car would be able to make a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention before the end of 2017.\n\nAndrew Yang is a lawyer, not an engineer.\n\nLong-haul trucking may be the first industry disrupted by autonomous vehicles, but it likely won't be Tesla that is first to market.\n\nTesla's approach to autonomy is probably a dead end. Elon went against his engineers' recommendations and decided to rely primarily on cameras.\n\nTesla's EV semis are so heavy that they are mostly suited to transporting bulky, but lightweight items, like potato chips. Tesla also seems to be slowing down production on their semis.",
