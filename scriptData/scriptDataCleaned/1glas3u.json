Mostly because there's an inverse relationship between the VIX and a screaming market where EVERYONE casts doubt aside to BUY BUY BUY on the hopes of deregulation and forthcoming pro-corporate policies. \n\nI, too, opened a VIX position on the expectation of a contested election and the underlying uncertainty it'd bring.   I'm holding, though, in the belief this rally is short-lived and drama is soon to follow.   But I'm a regard, so what the hell do I know.\n\nMy MSOS position, on the other hand, is cooked under the next administration.  Gonna sell at a -40% loss and chalk it up to getting Trumped.",
