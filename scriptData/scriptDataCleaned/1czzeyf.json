  "selftext": "SPY will gap to $535.50 Tuesday by EOD. The sell off was a shake out that affected the entire market Thursday. Naturally, I bought calls because market only going up. OTM call at 533.30 and ITM call at 527.80. I hope you bought calls because this still has room to go up. 533.00 is easily obtainable 535.50 is preferable will a bullish Tuesday coming off of Memorial Day. You know that crack heads on Wall Street will be itching to make money move after binging an 8ball at their block party Monday. Only way this goes tits up is if the Middle East flexes their big cocker and JB decides to be a deep state regard and fall in line with our EU soy boys. \n\nTLDR; SPY go up because crack heads on wall street will be itching to make money after not being able to trade Monday. This is not trading advice and Iâ€™m literally a regard whoâ€™s been lucky for the past month after 6 years of understandable loses. \n\nMERICAAAAAAAAAAâ€™ \n\nPS personalities 3 and 4 do not agree with 1 and 2 and donâ€™t like this post so please upvote and prove them wrong. \n\nLastly, fuck you Jeremy at Costco Iâ€™m not giving you my receipt. I hope you see this regard. ",
