I keep saying that but this sub is sooooo into it, either that or they have a huge astroturfing presence. \n\nTheir current account offerings are inferior to other traditional banks in terms of interest rates et cetera, and they lack the fancy stuff that fin tech competitors offer (like direct ACH payments, forex et cetera). I tried, like really tried, to use them to originate our mortgage with 830 credit and a HHI four times the purchase price (in a VLCOL area) and they just didn‚Äôt ever get back to me. Called them emailed them messaged them on the app. Nothing. Eventually just went with a local company no problems. Better interest rate lol. Now they send me junk mail every 2-3 months taking me to refinance at 7% haha. \n\nAnyways that‚Äôs my only experience with them, but I definitely wouldn‚Äôt trust them with *any* money. It‚Äôs like the lights are on but nobody is home. They got a flashy app but that‚Äôs it. If you need to be flexible, Revolut plus a traditional online only bank and you‚Äôre set. SoFi mate tries to do both but it falls short massively. Anyways if I wasn‚Äôt so financially conservative I would short them, but this company is terrible. The sentiment here on Reddit is so comically one sided and overly positive it‚Äôs laughable. Like I see posts all the time that are like, ‚Äúwow SoFi is a great company should I invest my entire 401k‚Äù et cetera.

YT and Social Media should be for keeping an eye out for trends, not investment advice. Putting your hard earned money into something someone else believes in is crazy unless you've done your due diligence and agree. ETFs are for the ones that don't want to do the research. \n\nThe problem with that rationale is that you can look into SoFi and see there's a flat evaluation and decide to pass. At the same time you see everyone talking about it and 10% gains one day, 5% the next and get FOMO...but if you zoom out there's always a reverse trend.",
