There are plenty of legal means to invest in western ETFs nowadays and in fact a lot of people speculate that the recent US market bubble is related to Asian money. People find ways to buy real estates abroad and that’s how prices have rise greatly around the globe due to Chinese money.

Because we are in a post-rational world. \n\nSo prev. gold would experience a rush of buying power on instability, as a safe haven, but since the new reality consists completely void of objective norms then what’s the point of buying gold? It’s lost its anchor. \nIf tomorrow isn’t going to be any safer or less safe than today only still incoherent and irrational than putting your nuts away for winter isn’t worth it ‘cos we don’t see this as a ‘winter’ this is just the new reality. There is no adjustment back to the mean here, to the average, because we are so far from the base line that buying gold isn’t worth it ‘cos this is the new normal. It would now take something even more extreme to push people into gold.
