  "selftext": "Too many on here are cherry picking instances in history where the markets tanked once the Fed started cutting rates\n\nThey use three examples to back up their case...2001 and 2007 and 2019\n\nTalk about cherry picking the worst examples...in 2001, the markets were in the thralls of the dot com bubble bursting...in 2007, the economy was about to implode from the subprime mortgage crisis...and in 2019, trade war tensions and a global economic slowdown were the main reasons for the market's decline...the markets would've tanked whether or not there were rate cuts...the Fed cutting rates was basically an attempt to administer CPR to an ailing economy\n\nI'm usually bearish so don't think I'm wearing rose colored glasses in our current situation...the markets may go down for a variety of reasons from here on out...whether it being overbought or the last week of September being a bad month for stocks or the upcoming election uncertainty\n\nBut the objective truth is that the current economy is in nowhere near as bad a shape as it was in the above three time periods people are cherry picking to use as examples\n\nCherry picking instances where the markets started declining straight after rate cuts by the Fed is lazy and careless fundamental analysis...what about all the other times the markets rose after the Fed started rate cuts?\n\n\"Data from Ned Davis Research shows that, historically, stocks perform well in the 12 months following the first rate cut. Since 1974, stocks have been positive 80% of the time, with an average return of 15%.\"\n\nJust look at the chart and come to an objective conclusion for yourselves...in most instances, markets were up in as little as three months after the Fed started cutting rates\n",

You think we are in as bad a situation as 2001 and 2007 and 2019?\n\n2001 - dot com bubble burst...how many zombie unprofitable companies went bust... today's AI bubble isn't close to anything like the dot com bubble...the bubble today is being created and sustained mainly by 3-4 of the Magnificent 7...and they have the money to sustain the bubble with their capex spending on AI...the AI bubble isn't being sustained by hundreds of thousands of speculative non profitable companies like it was back in the dot com bubble\n\nIf there is any bursting of the bubble it will mainly affect the valuations of the big 3-4 spenders on AI...and while that will affect the markets because of how much weight they carry in components like SPY and NASDAQ, it's not going to cause a massive implosion because there just aren't as many of those non profitable speculative companies as there were back in 2001...do you have any recollection just how bad the bubble was in 2001?  Money was getting thrown at companies just for having a .com in their names...I don't see the AI situation anywhere near as egregious as it was back in 2001\n\n2007 - well...we don't even need to compare this to our current situation...2007 was a structural and systemic meltdown of epic proportions...there isn't anything currently foreseeable that could have the same consequence as what happened in 2007...if you want to trot out how much consumer credit card debt there is or how much global debt there is, then sure...those are definitely problems that will eventually come home to roost but the government still can kick the can down the road by printing more money...consequences won't have to be dealt with for a long time and for purposes of this discussion, I'm only talking about how rate cuts will affect the markets and economy for the foreseeable future (within the next year or so)\n\n2019 - this wasn't even really a year worth mentioning because the markets recovered pretty quickly after rate cuts...markets were already up 3 months after the first rate cuts...it was a black swan event (Covid) that really upended the markets a year later\n\nI totally agree with you that there are a ton of glaring factors why the US could be in trouble...this is why I'm bearish...but my point is that we are currently in a fundamentally stronger situation than we were during the other periods...the economy is still growing...consumers are still spending...company revenues are still growing...the unemployment rate isn't out of control...the rate cut cycle isn't going to tank the markets because of the current economic strength...all the issues you listed are problems that will manifest in the future...but most likely way after when the Fed has already cut interest rates back to neutral, which will be a year or so from now",

              "body": "There’s a very similar situation as dot com bubble going on with any company that mentions Gen AI getting inflated. I work in AI/ML as an applied scientist and AI startups are raising billions without a product or revenue. Very few companies are actually making any money with Gen AI. Many are making money with traditional supervised learning models but that’s been the case for a decade now. But there are hundreds of Gen AI companies raising money with no prospect of making money. Many of the largest ones (the unicorns) have realized they’re dead in the water and are giving up and selling to big tech (Inflection, CharacterAI, Adept, etc). Even OpenAI is losing 5B a year despite having a successful product in terms of users (albeit not a good business model). The only people really making money is Nvidia and tangential chip and data center build out companies. But the companies actually using the data centers aren’t making any money with Gen AI outside of call centers which are low hanging fruit paying people in SE Asia a couple bucks an hour.\n\nWhen you go back and look at the dot com bubble the vast majority of the total market cap gains were made by big established companies with plenty of revenue and earnings. Look at the charts for Microsoft, IBM, Intel, Cisco, Oracle, Qualcomm, Nokia, etc. Hundreds and hundreds of billions in market cap created in a few years. Some of them never recovered to the peaks. It took Microsoft 16 years to recover to its dot com peak and they were an amazing company. Yes, there were worthless companies like pets.com but they didn’t account for much of the total market cap gain. Same situation today there are many large cap tech companies exploding. And it’s not just Mag 7. Oracle has blown up. Dell. Super micro. Palantir. Adobe. Arm. Broadcom. Arista. Massive market caps in the hundreds of billions.\n\nIf you look at market as a whole we aren’t that far off from dot com valuation multiples. \n\nhttps://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe",

They keep presenting shitty data and recession indicators triggering and then come up with some shit why this time it’s different. Just like they did in every recession ever. Listen to the data, not what they tell you about it. They kept lying about the data and quietly revising it two weeks later for the past year. Plus if whatever happens to the m2 rate of change happens to inflation 15-18Months later, like it’s been in the past, we’ve beaten inflation a long time ago and are probably even heading towards deflation. Truflation is already at about 1.1%. All this plus the soft landing narrative coming back tells me we’re about to head into the last and final push to the upside before we’re heading into a multi year bear market. When over the next 3 Months more data comes out and the market realizes it keeps getting worse and worse despite the fed cuts the drop is going to hit fast and hard.",

      "body": "This is such an uninformed post. In most cases even these positive gains were tied to a recession. In 1974 they started cutting rates at the end of the recession. In 1980 they brought rates from about 17% in april down to 8% by July and back up to 18% by december. Not sure that’s really a rate cut in the truest sense that it’s a more long term cut (also ignoring the fact that an 8% rate is insanely high as well). Recession starts mid 1981. The 1984 rate cut was really a continuation of the cuts that started in 81. They raised rates from about 8% to 11% in 83 after they had fallen from 18% over the last couple years. Then rates continued their decline until about 1987. The cuts of 89 do support your point. There was a market correction around that time, but no selloff or bear market. I’m not sure I would really count the “rate cuts” of 1995 as rate cuts. Rates moved from about 6% to 5% over 4 years from 1995 to 1999. Pretty insignificant change in monetary policy over a 4 year time span if you ask me. The 98 rates cuts were sort of just a continuation of the 95 rate cuts. If you want to consider them separately then the 95 rate cuts were a total cut of half a percent and the 98 cuts were a total cut of a half a percent. Pretty insignificant rate cuts. Now if the fed stops the current cuts then these would actually be a perfect time to look back on for our situation but I doubt the cuts stop. The cuts of 2001 were real and saw the rates go from about 6% to less than 2% in a little over a year. The cuts of 2007 were large and we all know what happened. The cuts of 2019 were only about 0.75% in total before the pandemic and then when the pandemic hit they quickly dropped them to 0 and the stock market tanked the rapidly recovered. Not sure how many people actually would see those gains 3 and 5 years out or if they panic sold. Ignoring the pandemic, a rate cut of 0.75% wouldn’t be expected to alter the economy much. So unless there has already been a recession the 1974 cuts have little relevance to now. The 1980 “cuts” were merely erratic monetary policy and weren’t maintained for more than a few months. The 1981 cuts started after a recession hit and the market tanked. Otherwise you would see negative or near zero returns 3 and 5 years out. The 1984 cuts were after a brief increase in rates along a longer trend of decreasing rates from an all time high of 18%. Not super relevant to today I would argue. The 1989 cuts might support your point though I could try to argue they were still part of that downward trend from 18% that started in the early 80s. The 1995 and 98 cuts were insignificant cuts of about 0.5%. We all know what happened in 01 and 07. And 19 is hard to draw conclusions from due to the pandemic that shortly followed. Tldr: this post is borderline misinformation and I’m led to believe this Ned Davis fellow has lots of calls. If the fed actually aggressively cuts rates this would be the first time if not one of the first times (depending on your stance around the context of the 1989 cuts) that a recession does not coincide with aggressive rate cuts. I think the question is more so whether they continue cutting or not. If not then we’re probably fine, if they do it’s because were fucked",

Including 1984 and 1998 in \"first cut\" data is disingenuous, because the Fed had already been on a campaign of cutting in the recent years. \n\nAlso, the recession signal is not \"first Fed cut.\" It's 10y-2yr yield curve uninversion. The yield curves were not inverted in 1995 (or 1984 and 1998).\n\nSo that leaves 1974, 1980, 1981, 1989, 2001, 2007, and 2019.\n\nRecessions coincided with each of these cuts. 1974 was special in that the recession was already in full swing and the markets were at the bottom by the time they started cutting. You should probably be including 1973 instead, which did have a big cut and a major stock crash. \n\nSo now we have 1973, 1981, 2001, and 2007 as major crashes following rate cuts and yield curve uninversion (all of which give negative returns in your table), and 1980, 1989, and 2019 which gave minor recessions and short-lived market crashes. You only don't see the minor crashes as negative in your chart because the 3 month window straddles or misses them.\n\nThe signal is undefeated.
