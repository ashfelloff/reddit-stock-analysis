  "selftext": "With the NVIDIA split happening tomorrow, I'll have over 100 shares and am considering switching from standard call options to covered calls. I've been reading up on them and the general consensus I'm finding is that there is basically no way to lose money, you're just putting a ceiling on your potential earnings. Is this accurate? Is there anything I should be wary about when trading them?",

The worst case scenario is you get greedy for the premium and sell a covered call well below your initial cost per share and then it gets exercised and you lose your shares and end up losing money. This information is explained in the YouTube channel InTheMoney and that guy does a great job explaining everything. How in the world does a 6 sentence paragraph do a better job explaining options than a 20 minute video that has literal pictures for examples. \n\nSorry for sounding frustrated but there’s no way you’ve done your dd if these are the type of questions you’re asking.",

The difference between those questions and yours is that if you understood what a covered call is then the worst case scenario is inherently given and my questions require variables to be assessed first (I don’t even remember what I could have asked on BBY I just know I made like 50k on that trade). You do not know what a covered calls is or how they work. Instead of learning what they are and how they work, you skipped the basics of options and decided to just see if you could get an answer you liked here.
