They settled on a raft of broad policy recommendations that were included in their 33-page report.\n\nWhile any legislation related to AI will be difficult to pass, especially in an election year and in a divided Congress, the senators said that regulation and incentives for innovation are urgently needed.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-investment-congress-millions-8f3a051faadc50d2366e8a88a69c5470?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share](https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-ai-investment-congress-millions-8f3a051faadc50d2366e8a88a69c5470?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=share)",
