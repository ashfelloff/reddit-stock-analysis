  "selftext": "PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Chewy, Inc. (NYSE: CHWY) (‚ÄúChewy‚Äù or ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a trusted destination for pet parents and partners everywhere, announced today that it has agreed to repurchase an aggregate of 17,550,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a price per share of $28.49, which represents a 5.0% discount to yesterday‚Äôs closing price, resulting in an aggregate repurchase price of approximately $500 million (the ‚ÄúRepurchase‚Äù) from Buddy Chester Sub LLC, which is an entity affiliated with funds advised by BC Partners Advisors LP (‚ÄúBC Partners‚Äù), Chewy‚Äôs largest shareholder. The repurchased shares will be cancelled and retired upon completion of the Repurchase.\n\nChewy believes today‚Äôs Repurchase is an accretive use of capital and provides an efficient mechanism to repurchase shares at a discount to the current market price, while further reducing the ownership position of the Company‚Äôs largest shareholder. Chewy‚Äôs increasing profitability and free cash flow generation enables the Company to further optimize its capital allocation strategy through this transaction, which comes in addition to the recently announced $500 million share repurchase program. This transaction together with the Company‚Äôs share repurchase program underscores the confidence Chewy has in the business and its compelling growth and margin expansion strategy. In light of Chewy‚Äôs expanding free cash flow generation, the Company will continue to assess options to opportunistically return cash to its shareholders.\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240626578986/en/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
