Hence shares not options, although levering with 2026 leaps could work\n\nIf we hit a recession before then all bets are off.  I‚Äôll be honest I‚Äôm lazy with my DD on this one.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs way more knowledgable people on their timelines and plans to profitability.  \n\nBut I know they make great products, their leadership is good, and they are ‚Äúundervalued‚Äù compared to their historical price.  That‚Äôs enough for me to throw a small % at it as a dart throw.  I‚Äôm definitely not full porting and always recommend good risk management, especially with high beta companies\n\nPlus they‚Äôre one of my clients at work and they got me paid.  Amzn has a huge initiative to move all their distribution centers (last mile, last half mile) to EV.  I believe Rivian will be their vendor of choice for that initiative.  My position in amazon is significantly larger (although I‚Äôll probably swing it if it hits 200 again as there seems to be resistance there)",

You give the vibe of a crazed gambling addict who‚Äôs run out of funds and desperately needs his fix. \n\nBe real, no one is going to send internet strangers that amount of money for no reason. Why would OP do that instead of pursuing his own investment (or gambling) goals, or buying themselves something nice? \n\nAsking internet strangers for money is super, super cringe.",
