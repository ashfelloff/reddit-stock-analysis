That is to say that not all type 2 diabetics have issues with insulin release, rather the cells that respond to insulin become desensitized. Beta islet control insulin secretion only. Not insulin sensitivity. \n\nThe patient they they tried it on had a kidney transplant already as he was end stage renal failure. After the transplant they say his glycemic control was poor, but the range he was in, was not poorly controlled. In fact his GL range varied from 3.66-14.6mmol/L. The diabetic target is actually 4-7 preprandial and 5-10 post prandial. \n\nThe condition of his new kidney was not described either. Was there islet issues to begin with? \n\nThis kind of thing was done in the past as a solution to type 1 diabetics but later found that that autoimmunity destroyed them eventually. \n\nFor type 2…the mechanism of which this “cured” T2D doesn’t seem to fit into the pathology.\n\nAlso. This was not a paper. It was an opinion piece in cell. So it’s not scrutinized.",
