Their FSD is overpriced considering the TACC operates in much the same way. They could decrease fsd subscription costs (which they did) to increase the revenue on a product with no marginal cost (once coded, it doesn‚Äôt cost them more to sell 1 or 1000 subscriptions) but who is going to pay for the fsd when it doesn‚Äôt work much better than TACC after all the bad press.

I do not recommend trading earnings, trade on the lead up to earnings, or afterwards.  My next target is 152.16, then go from there.  152 is a strong support level (See April 26, 2023).
