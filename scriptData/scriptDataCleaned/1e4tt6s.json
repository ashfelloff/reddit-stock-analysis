That's what happens when half the entire USD supply is printed in 3 years.\n\nThe price increases that were happening immediately were corporate scams. The actual effects of inflation take time to set in. What's a big issue is we'll have the damage set in AFTER the corporations increased the prices of their goods by like 300%.\n\nHonestly idk what can be done. The government needs to pass some law that prevents companies from increasing prices by such unbalanced levels. For example, taco bell prices have risen 600% over the last 10 years. That's WAY higher than necessary.\n\nAlso they need to pass a law that prevents shrinkflation. The items that have remained the same price have NOT remained the same size. Most recently I've noticed the quarter pounder meat from Mcdonalds is about 30-40% smaller.",
