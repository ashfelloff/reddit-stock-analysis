If you’re invested in a company like Apple or alphabet, think about it when it dips. Those companies are not going to go under. A dip is a reason to buy, not sell. \n\nBut it looks like you’ve lost quite a bit. If I were you I’d park it in something safe and do more research on market investing. I moved all my investments to meta a couple weeks ago and I’ve made gains while most other tech stocks fell. Bit of luck and a bit of market research worked in my favor.",
