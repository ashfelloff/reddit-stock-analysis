AMD would lead to a x86 monopoly. NVDA would lead to a datacenter monopoly. \n\nFor you young kids out there, this is why they broke up AT&T back in the 80s.  Heck even more recently this is why Microsoft, Google, Apple, Amazon and META are all constantly in and out of court in the US.  Also why the EU is starting to crack down on NVDA already.  \n\nMicrosoft is currently under fire after their layoffs directly after purchasing Activision/Blizzard.  Sprint and T-mobile had to fight for two years to get their merger approved.  NVDA or AMD buying intel would be even more of a boondoggle than either one of those.",
