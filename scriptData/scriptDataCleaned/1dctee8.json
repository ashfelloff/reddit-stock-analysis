  "selftext": "Hi\nIn the UK (albeit can invest almost anywhere / in anything) and currently have a SIPP account (which is akin to the US Roth IRA). 20 years before I will use the funds. \n\nI hold most of my funds in a pretty standard collection of ETFs (US and world) but wanted to place 15% ish potentially in stocks focusing on future high growth winners. My general rule is: research well and once it's in don't move the money (unless there is some sort of black Swan event). \n\nOn this basis, with a don't touch for 20 years horizon, what stocks would you invest in now that you think at some point have the opportunity to be the next MS or Nvidia etc. \n\nJust to say before it is inevitably said, yes fully aware identifying the next Nvidia will have a significant element of luck!\n\nWould love to know your thoughts. \n\nThanks \n\n",

Actually literally any company associated with the space is looking like a better investment right now.

Granted, my strategy was to look at stocks consistently recommended by people who write articles on the subject rather than Redditors, but I’m under no delusion that people hired to write articles are actually better  than Redditors. It wasn’t the quality of their analysis I looked for, it was much more the frequency that a stock was recommended. And I figured there are enough number crunchers out there that the current stock price already reflects that analysis, so the only open question is sheer speculation about the future. \n\nThat said, now I just buy ETFs. (Not because I did badly picking individual stocks, I think I beat the market, but I just know that historically, even the best can’t consistently beat the market, and it became more important to me to reliably match the market than try to beat it.)",
