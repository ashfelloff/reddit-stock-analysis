  "selftext": "https://futurism.com/nasa-spacex-rescue-astronauts-stranded-boeing-starliner\n\nThere are multiple articles on this topic over Boeing critical engineering incompetence and staggering level of excuses, but the bottom line is the mission that was supposed to be 10 days is now two months. SpaceX is capable of easily getting the stranded Astronauts home thankfully if necessary.\n\nOne starts to wonder at what point will government be forced to stop giving Boeing multiple billion dollar projects that they under deliver on.   For article context  Starliner = boeing    Crew Dragon = SpaceX \n\n\"Crew Dragon and Starliner were developed under the same NASA Commercial Crew program. But while SpaceX has successfully launched 12 crewed missions since 2020, including eight crew rotational journeys to the ISS, Boeing only launched its first crewed test flight last month.\n\nAnd if Starliner were to be deemed unfit for its return journey, NASA would presumably have to come up with a plan B: launching another Crew Dragon spacecraft\"\n\n",

There are just a lot of incentives not to let SpaceX completely own the space market.\n\nI genuinely think that Rocket Lab is a good business, but I also think that ultimately, down the line, a company like Google could be convinced to spend 20-30B to buy Rocket Lab outright so they can have their own launch capability, or invest a large amount of money to help them better compete with SpaceX.",

It will stay private until Mars is colonized or Musk dies and since that is the mission of SpaceX they will continue to innovate to drive costs down.  Other companies have less noble or aspirational goals and leaders are easy to switch to safe mode when they don't have something like that or stocks are present.\n\nSpaceX is also in a unique position in that while it could monopolize the market, its business model sort of creates new markets.  SpaceX can't exist with a focus on everything (needs a narrow focus) and as those markets open up over the next 50 years there is plenty of room for competition.",
