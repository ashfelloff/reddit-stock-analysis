Down graded their sitting areas with uncomfortable seating in an effort to get customers to buy their drinks and get out. What made Starbucks great was the fact you could sit down, relax hang out and come coffee. it wasn't a fast food place, it was a place to hang out. \n\nThe best way I can put it. Starbucks is the Michael Kors of coffee shops. It's what poor people think is fancy so they take pictures thinking they have something luxurious. When in reality it is on par with Target branded accessories. Maintaining that illusion is the key to their profitability not trying to compete with brands the public views as lesser than.",

And have you seen the lines at stores that are located inside airports? The lines are huge in the mornings.
