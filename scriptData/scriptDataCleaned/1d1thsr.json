Understanding the Dealer/Market maker exposure and their hedging strategies can help you avoid death by paper cuts as realized volatility is often overstated and be on the right side of the trade. Many weeks that means selling delta neutral and taking advantage of a sideways market. \n\nTLDR\n\nLearning to read volatility will help you position better to avoid theta losses, and only buying options when realized volatility is increasing and coming more in line with implied.",

There isn't enough liquidity to support the current levels, and there wasn't in 2022, because the Treasury sucked liquidity out of the market at the start of the year with exorbitant debt issuance.  Then prices fall/correct back down to levels that can be supported by the liquidity level.\n\nAlso, I think lower IV (even though actual volatility is high) is a result of simple supply/demand.  Options are cheap because there isn't enough liquidity to buy and drive their prices higher.\n\nI'm usually theta positive.
