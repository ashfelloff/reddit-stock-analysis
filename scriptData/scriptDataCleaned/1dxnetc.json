The rest is in 3 individual stocks, 25% spy and 8% tqqq shares.\n\nThe leaps are by far the most profitable strategy I've done.\n\nI do 10% otm longest exp leap I can get. Every red day I buy at least 1. When I run out of cash I stop buying. When they reach about 60-100% depending on the speed, I liquidate, buy spy or other individual stocks shares from half and start over with leaps.\n\nUp a casual 40% on my port this year. Not wsb material (this is wsb right, right?), but it works and I'm happy.",

Theta would start to hit really hard and if poorly timed the loss would be a lot. It’s hard to backtest but I’m curious how well it would work if you kept the LEAPS at like 25% of a portfolio, then buying dips with more LEAPS over that period. Does the rise on the way out beat the drop on the way in, assuming you can keep enough powder dry?",

I didn't. A few days later my whole port was in red.\nI trust my gut when it comes to defensiveness. And it's telling me to be cautious. Anyways.\n\nI'm actively gearing down, I'm on my last round of heavy tqqq leaps for the time being. When tqqq hits 85, I'm likely liquidating both leaps and shares and rotating into something less tech heavy and restarting with itm spy leaps, but less exposure.\n\nI'm also preparing some more defensive holdings such as O and pharma (housing and medicine we'll always need). I want to have a commodities position too, but I haven't decided on one yet. Any food Index you guys know about?",
