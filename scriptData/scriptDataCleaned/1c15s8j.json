  "selftext": "ik this is a loss for ants but itâ€™s ~15% of my account so have to post. iâ€™m sure that alongside many others, I bought into the TSM hype a month ago when the 4/10 reports and 4/19 earnings hype was being pumped throughout this sub alongside the screams of NVDA hitting 1k within a few days. \n\nDown a considerable amount nowâ€¦ might as well just hold and hope for a pre-earnings run up. Honestly donâ€™t think itâ€™ll happen because I think a lot of people are in the same boat as me and we all know that the markers are fixed and we usually never win when we all think that we found a great idea. too many of us to let us win, but hoping for a miracle and that this inverses. just looking to break-even! any thoughts drop em!",
