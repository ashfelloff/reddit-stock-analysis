The price patterns are very similar, especially in the past month.*\n\n**There are 4 other stocks that have similar price movements to NVDA :**\n\n**KLA Corporation (KLAC)**  \nProvides process control and yield management solutions for semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n**Micron Technology, Inc. (MU)**  \nProduces DRAM and NAND flash memory for computers, consumer electronics, automotive, and mobile devices.\n\n**Lam Research Corporation (LRCX)**  \nSupplies equipment for thin film deposition, plasma etching, photoresist strip, and wafer cleaning in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\n**Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT)**  \nManufactures tools for semiconductor wafer production, including deposition, etching, and planarization systems, as well as solutions for flat panel display and solar photovoltaic manufacturing.\n\nAll of these stocks are in the Semiconductor group. Anyone who is familiar with this sector or holds any of these stocks in their portfolio, please feel free to share your additional insights. 🙇🏻\n\nP.S. Correlation does not imply causation 😊\n\nMethod Used:  \nI used the stock screener on Nasdaq to select tech stocks with a market cap > $10B. Then, I obtained the price data from Yahoo Finance to calculate daily returns over the past year and used the Pearson correlation coefficient to find the correlation.\n\nTop 5 correlations with NVDA from my experiment:  \nKLAC: 0.9050  \nMU: 0.9036  \nLRCX: 0.8701  \nAMAT: 0.8513  \nADI: 0.8393  \nNote: AMD has a correlation of 0.7279.",
