  "selftext": "Everything is Rosie. The Fed is easing, cash is trash, analysts say S&P is 5000 for sure, payroll’s booming, and plenty of jobs.  I believe you need to stay in stocks especially with the buy back action. Time to buy the bargains:  \n\nBoeing- everything was a shit storm this year  with insider employees testifying poor quality, strikes, and share delusion . But it’s a Duopoly with Uncle Sam’s backing. Thousands of back orders and a new CEO. \n\nEnergy Transfer (ET). They own a shit load of natural gas lines. Data centers need that energy- forget nuke power - many years away.  Buy NG infrastructure.  Very high dividend. \n\nOxy - Buffet buying hand over fist.  Great balance sheet for a great energy play. \n\nLulu- low end luxury clothing that China recently discovered. Also a strong balance sheet with a very low P/E.  I see it doubling. \n\nPfizer - no success with weight loss drugs but a big pipeline of mRNA cancer drugs including other chronic disease drugs in the pipeline.  P/E ridiculous low.    \n\nMy 5 picks for the week.  You thoughts!",

But that’s just one piece of the puzzle, they will continue to benefit from the increased demand for energy and electricity as the population continues to grow. Oil/nat gas is not going anywhere in the next decade, and the Permian basin is going to be the most important oil field within the United States.\n\nThey also have a CEO who is focused on shareholder value. She continues to lower debt, and aggressively buys back stock rather than focusing on exploration. Many oil/gas companies continue to try and find new oil fields, which is an expensive undertaking. This is a long term strategy that will payout amazingly within the next 2-5 years.\n\nCarbon Capture technology, while there are many skeptics this is just another cherry on top if it does turn out to be as lucrative as the company believes.\n\nFor every $1 change in oil prices, it is about $260m of added FCF. So its major risk is that it is essentially a leveraged bet on WTI prices. However, if prices can stay around $70-$80 they will profit greatly. Their breakeven price is below $40.\n\nEven from a valuation standpoint the stock is cheap, should be priced at $75.",
