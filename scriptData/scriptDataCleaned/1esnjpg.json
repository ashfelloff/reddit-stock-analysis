  "title": "Robinhood Will Deactivate Your Account and Force Sell if You Take a Vacation",
  "score": 2050,
  "selftext": "Back in 2020/21, I ended up leaving the US for a few months. It was very difficult to travel internationally at that time, but hopefully understandable why someone with the ability would stay in a country without any Covid cases yet.\n\nBecause I was outside the US for a few months, Robinhood ended up freezing my account and forced to sell all assets. I ended up losing a rather significant amount of money as practically all asset prices were going up at that time.\n\nIt's worth noting: I hadn't passed the threshold of time spent outside the US to be considered a foreign resident by the actual definition. But Robinhood has their own internal policy to determine whether you're \"residing outside the US\". They won't tell you how long it is.\n\nI suppose if you're even on vacation in Mexico or Europe for few weeks, you're technically \"residing outside the US\" at that time?\n\nPretty much, this should be interpreted that Robinhood won't let you take a vacation outside the US for a longer period of time than they deem fit. They also won't tell you what this maximum period of time is for \"security reasons\".   \n  \nSupport initially cited industry regulations. When told that it contradicts the definition of tax residency, they cited internal policies. Clearly RH is just making things up as they go.\n\n**TL:DR**: If anyone is planning on taking an extended trip outside the US, be aware that Robinhood has a policy of closing your account. Even if you're just on vacation and still a US resident for tax and all other purposes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkmzpmt1nrid1.png?width=692&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4d52433dac85bedef4419f41edd33b8489aa25e\n\n",

Perhaps this has something to do with restrictions and legal limitations they have by not being licensed in certain countries. \n\nPerhaps he did too many trades in Restricted (non US) areas. Perhaps the app has a timer which logs the first non-US trade and if a US teade isn't done within a specified time frame they assume that you do in fact live overseas. \n\nI'm sure somewhere in the terms and conditions it says this.  \n\nAlso, given that a Google search pulls up less than 10 other complaints about this policy suggests he is in a very small minority of \"rule breakers\" who got caught. \n\nWhether he is a US citizen or a dual citizen, or a visa carrier, is a moot point.   He seems to have gone past the \"clock limit\" and triggered an alarm for foreign investors.  \n\nChina is enough of a concern for legal recourse that RH doesn't want to even risk taking a loss there by way of accusations of RH conducting business in China or Hong Kong. \n\nI'm only bringing this point up because the assertion that he was \"on vacation\" seems to be over the limit of what Robinhood considers vacation.",
