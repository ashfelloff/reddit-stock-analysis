To my point, if fundamentals were sufficient why did BABA get so low? 50% off from it's all time highs people were screaming about how it's impossible to ignore the fundamentals. They continued whaling until passing 75% of its lows before quieting down. Why? Fundamentals didn't matter BABA and others were purely getting beat down by the CCP, the improving fundamental and beating expectations crushed by their iron fist policies like the Tech Crackdown. \n\nThere is ways to make money but I'd attest it to more speculation and luck than actual skill. Maybe I'm wrong and as simple as buying back 30% up from all time lows is the perfect swing entry needed for example.
