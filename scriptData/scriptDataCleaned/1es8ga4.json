  "selftext": "Sources:\n\nDeals and IPOs\n\nIntel to buy driverless technology firm Mobileye for $15.3 billion\n\nPublished Mon, Mar 13 20177:49 AM EDT\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/13/intel-to-buy-mobileye-for-14-billion-to-15-billion-israeli-media-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/13/intel-to-buy-mobileye-for-14-billion-to-15-billion-israeli-media-report.html)\n\nIPO\n\nStarted with 17B valuation: [https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/mobileye-pops-more-than-30percent-in-ipo-after-spinning-out-of-intel.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/26/mobileye-pops-more-than-30percent-in-ipo-after-spinning-out-of-intel.html)\n\nSome have speculated that MBLY listing was for the benefit of employees to sell their stock awards if they need cash. Others suggested it was a way for INTC to fund new FAB expansions.\n\n  \nMBLY is not INTC though, it is a seperate company, although it seems some people think they are 1 and the same and if INTC isnt doing well ,the same would go for MBLY.\n\nEdit: It appears INTC sold 38.5 million additional shares for $40.84 per share in June 2023, so Grandma is down 65% if she bought some shares at that time, current buyers can get 3 shares for the price of 1 at that time: https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/mbly/insider-activity",
