  "selftext": "Hi Regards,\n\nJust an update on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bollba/tsla_42069_by_end_of_the_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).\n\nI am still doing uber during the night. Used the proceeds brought 2 more calls. \n\nIf there is a chance, I will let the riders know about Tesla cars, and let them experience FSD V12. \n\nJust some thoughts I wanna share:\n\n* there are quite a number of people who realized that under current interest rate, it doesn't make sense for them to own a car, their transportation cost per month would be lower than the monthly payment for a car + related costs. They don't need to worry about parking, theft, traffic etc. (prospect future rideshare app customers)\n* there are a lot of people who are still on the fence about buying an EV. (prospect customers for cars)\n* Majority of the Male riders are much open on using FSD, female riders are exactly opposite of this. (tsla marketing team should take note on this)\n* Robotaxi would probably go through stages\n   * the first stage would be something I am doing right now, there will be a driver supervising\n   * 2nd stage would be when tesla announce they take liability while car is driving on FSD\n   * 3rd stage would be majority of the cars on the road is driving on FSD, the higher the percentage, the safer and more efficient the robotaxi will be, the growth and profit margin will be exponential \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs always current position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/exy4344jibwc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c5ea91fdf5fb98f2d5b054ec343677b0316de94e",
