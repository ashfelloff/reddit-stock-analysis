Buying power is not the same than positive cash. IBKR will happily lend you those 673K [at a rate of 6.8%](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/margin-rates.php).

Then later I got a call about my account being negative. I asked how could this be possible since this kind of account cannot trade on margin. They said the bank must have reversed the transfer. I called the bank who said this did not happen, that scwab sent it back. I called scwab again, told them it was not the bank. Someone finally looked into it, so I funded the account, made orders with a positive balance, then scwab accidentally sent the money back, then filled my order. All fees were waved and I deposited again. Many apologies were made and scwab took the blame, claiming it was a glitch.\n\nNot as cool of a glitch, but it was confirmed to be a glitch none the less.",
