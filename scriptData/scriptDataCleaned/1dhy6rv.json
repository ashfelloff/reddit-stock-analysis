  "selftext": "Hello my fellow regards. I think that ASTS is going to announce something big this week and I think it will likely be related to FirstNet. We all know ASTS has premier patented technology of something that would be incredibly useful to the United States defense. Now, ASTS released this video last week: [https://x.com/AST\\_SpaceMobile/status/1801589822517072008](https://x.com/AST_SpaceMobile/status/1801589822517072008)\n\nWhy would they release something like this if they're not about to get FirstNet funding from the US? To me, the writing is on the wall. \n\nFirstNet is basically a mission to deploy and maintain the first nation-wide wireless broadband network. FirstNet has an event on June 25-27 and I really think that given the ASTS video above they're telegraphing an announcement at this event. Source for event: [https://www.firstnet.gov/newsroom/press-releases/firstnet-authority-nist-announce-keynote-speakers-agenda-5x5-public-safety](https://www.firstnet.gov/newsroom/press-releases/firstnet-authority-nist-announce-keynote-speakers-agenda-5x5-public-safety)\n\nAll this to say, I've put a lot of my money into ASTS. Positions are:\n\n450 shares\n\n19 calls at $13 with 6/28 expo\n\n20 calls at $12.5 with 7/19 expo\n\nI'll probably buy more stock at open.",

Military usage which in itself is worth a fuck ton. Government usage. Increasing need for AI connectivity, IOT connectivity, and Automotive connectivity. First responders need constant access too.  It's pretty much a no brainier when you think of the value and long term sustainable growth potential. I truly see this as the next generation of connectivity for a world that needs constant connection. It's market cap is like 1.5 billion dollars. Starlink is like 150 billion dollars. It's a better product with over 3000 patents to protect it's intellectual property. ASTS can surpass Starlink in market cap which is at least 100 times what it is today. If I own 10,000 or more shares then I'm a millionaire. That's just me thinking out loud though. Your mileage may vary. Speak with a professional advisor and what not and all that jarble. ",
