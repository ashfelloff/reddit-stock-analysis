Yes, they can come up bigger than the organization they replaced.\n\nBut you are right that established players try to hold on to their moat, and you are right that industry has become more concentrated.\n\nWhat you are not mentioning is the mechanism in which they try to accomplish this. The primary tool has been burdensome regulation. They lobby for it. Pam Am I think is one of the most stark examples of this. For years they were basically the only American international airline due to extreme regulation. It was after the deregulation of the airline industry that they quickly got swallowed up by competitors (also leading to a precipitous drop in prices)\n\nIt‚Äôs the best tool they have to hold on if they otherwise don‚Äôt innovate. Large established organizations LOVE burdensome regulation. They can afford to comply with them, while new competition cannot. Over the last 20 years regulations have increased substantially. And they are accumulative, as every year new regulations get added, and early removed.\n\nSo yes I agree with your assessment of increased concentration. Though I‚Äôm surprised you seem to think increasing regulations even more is the solution, rather than a contributing factor. Do you think there is ever too much regulation?

Companies with bad workforce would start doing 100% inspection on every part, to weed out the bad parts. But that doesn't change that you are making bad parts, some still get through, your profit margin is awful, and you end up going out of business. \n\nThen the bean counters decided that Europe, with all its bureaucracy, was the way to go. So the aerospace industry imposed a system called AS9100, it's a comprehensive document that specifies how every aspect of a business must be run. \n\nSo now, instead of inspecting quality into the parts, they are trying to administrate quality into every part.\n\nThe reason we managed to go to the moon, is because the WORKFORCE at the time knew what it was doing! They didn't need constant oversight to do things right. \n\nBoeing is just a symptom of the times. We gave up teaching trades, and told everyone that without a college degree they were a moron.",

      "body": "Their space program is junk and yet NASA let's them continue to be in the running for making stuff for them. \n\nTheir Starliner was a hot mess right from the first day of testing. After it failed multiple times NASA even admitted that they didn't make Boeing go through the same paperwork and other things that they made every single other company did. Why? Because \"it's Boeing!\"\n\nNow NASA let them continue and build that Crap....I mean Starliner and actually send 2 people into space which BARELY got them there. And now their stuck because that capsule is an even more hot mess. \n\nSpace X has more than proven themselves with reliable and functional space equipment. NASA needs to cut ties with Boeing and let Space X be it's partner for sending people and cargo into space...... but, they won't because their idiots.",
