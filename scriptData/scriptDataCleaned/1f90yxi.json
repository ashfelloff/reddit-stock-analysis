At least in the West there are some partnerships that are healthy.  But the Chinese only get lower GDP countries into lord/serf arrangements.  They have no value of the planet either, just growing industry to further the party's desires, which namely is global control under a totalitarian order.  They are not a friend of the planet.\n\nCoal fired planets increasing in China is not a lie, but can be factually monitored (one can see it from satellite):\n\nChina permitted more coal power plants last year than any time in the last seven years, according to a new report released this week. It's the equivalent of about two new coal power plants per week. The report by energy data organizations Global Energy Monitor and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air finds the country quadrupled the amount of new coal power approvals in 2022 compared to 2021.\n\nThat's despite the fact that much of the world is getting off coal, says Flora Champenois, coal research analyst at Global Energy Monitor and one of the co-authors of the report.\n\n\"Everybody else is moving away from coal and China seems to be stepping on the gas,\" she says. \"We saw that China has six times as much plants starting construction as the rest of the world combined.\"",
