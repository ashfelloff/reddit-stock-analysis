It’s astounding how much positive press they give Tesla, no matter how good or bad they are doing. \n\nBy contrast, every time another EV company like Rivian gets good news, these same sites immediately have “bad news” to suddenly report on Rivian in response. It’s like they want to prop up cry baby Elon and ensure any other EV fails miserably. I guess competition is a bad thing if you’re a Tesla stock holder…",
