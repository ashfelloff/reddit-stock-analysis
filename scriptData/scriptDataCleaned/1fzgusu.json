  "title": "US Says It’s Weighing Google Breakup as Remedy in Monopoly Case",
  "score": 155,
  "selftext": "> The US Justice Department told a federal judge it is considering recommending that Google be forced to sell off parts of its operations to alleviate the harm caused by its monopolization of the online search market, in what would be a historic antitrust breakup.\n\n> In a court filing Tuesday, antitrust enforcers said Judge Amit Mehta could also force the Alphabet Inc. unit to provide access to the underlying data it uses to build its search results and artificial intelligence products.\n\n> The Justice Department “is considering behavioral and structural remedies that would prevent Google from using products such as Chrome, Play, and Android to advantage Google search and Google search-related products and features — including emerging search access points and features, such as artificial intelligence — over rivals or new entrants,” the agency said in the filing.\n\n> The filing represents Washington’s first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. \n\n> The 32-page filing lays outs a framework of potential options for the judge to consider as the case moves to the remedy phase.

This split, if it ever happens, will only drive Google profits up in the short run.  \n\n\nFor instance, if Google Playstore, YouTube, and search are split, all it does is make those profit arrangements public. The ad center may or may not get more profitable in the short run.\n\n\nSaid that, I think this is a nothingburger. Imagine, DOJ actually breaking up Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia and the stink it will cause to boomer retirement money. This will be shut down in no time.",
