You can be the seller rather than the buyer.. commissions on options are way lower than they used to be.   I sell at least 5x the amount of options I buy and most of what I buy is just protecting my downside like a stop loss.  Occasionally I buy a speculative call or put if I feel strongly it‚Äôs going to move in one direction but I also cash out when I have a decent profit I don‚Äôt try to let it run very long.  I‚Äôve seen it too many times I spend $300 per contract and have the opportunity to cash out at $500 and get greedy then it does a 180 and doesn‚Äôt come back.  Be the house most of the time and lock in profits when you can‚Ä¶ This is the way IMO.",
