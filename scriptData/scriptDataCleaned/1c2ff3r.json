  "score": 650,
  "selftext": "It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!\n\nThere are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.\n\nIn spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?\n\nFor one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.\n\nIntel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. \n\nThere's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. \n\nTheir earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards.",

I agree with most of what you're saying there; I meant the government will keep them from going to zero; I did not mean they'll be profitable from government alone, and the reason I cited Boeing is other than the Starliner space craft and 787 Dreamliner, all their products for the last 20+ years are just new variants of 30 to 50 year old planes with slight modifications. Their current flagship military project is a new F15 variant, and that's a great plane, but 2 generations behind modern fighters. So they've basically been a dog shit company this entire century, and here we are 24 years in and they're still in business. And not only are they still in business, but they're valuable enough for whistleblowers to commit suicide to the back of the head and \"nothing to see here folks\" is about all the info we got about that.\n\n\nWith Intel, I think they have a moat because manufacturing and foundries take too long to build for any true Anerican company to become competitive on that scale in the next 3 to 5 years. By then, Intel should have had at least some opportunity to cash in on their manufacturing mega zord. The government will keep the lights on, and heavily subsidized significant increases in production capacity. Intel can leverage that manufacturing capacity to do something other than government work that turns a profit, and the only reason they wouldnt is if their schedule is full, which would necessarily mean their business has exponentially increased. \n\n\nThey have an awful lot of good forward looking aspects, but they were recently overpriced, and there is still an outside shot for dark horse to give them some manufacturing competition. But I think they're very close to having a lockdown de facto monopoly on space and defense semiconductor manufacturing for a long time. And then as long as they dont pull a Boeing and spend the next 30 to 50 years releasing slightly modified versions of the original Pentium 4, I think they'll do very well.",

          "body": "Intel is trying to become a domestic supplier of microchips because of pressure from the Government over supply concerns should a conflict breakout in Taiwan. They promised 4 nodes in 5 years but the only thing keeping that alive is smoke and mirrors. It's maybe 2 nodes in 5 years (4nm and 3nm are basically the same; 20A and 18A as well) but won't actually hit scale until year 8 and beyond. They basically bet the company on High-NA EUV to make it happen to. TSMC 3nm-refresh is said to be on par with 20A in terms of performance and power consumption. Their 2nm process is scheduled to be in full production ahead of Intel's 18A and there is no reason to suspect it won't destroy Intel on every metric - including price. High-NA has half the optical resolution as traditional lithography. That means any large form facture dies, like we see on HPC or high-yield server parts, are going to need double the number of exposures. Traditionally that isn't a huge problem, most chips need 50-100 difference masks, but the power output is also halved. This means greater chance of stochastic defects with double the chances for error. It's a receipt for poor yield. You might as well do what China is doing and just use a million mature Hyper-NA DUV passes where the science is at least fully modeled and can be predicted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, Intel should spin off their foundry division like AMD did, focus on design (their expertise) and let the government prop up the domestic fab business without killing the company. Setup a Public/Private board with industry and government leaders and utilize a funding structure with grants, government backed bonds, and public equity similar to what the auto industry got in 2008. You want to save Intel? It's gonna be on the same scale as that.  You will need 80-100 billion over the next 5-10 years to get their fabs up to par with TSMC. More if you want to surpass them. And that is just the fab side of their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTheir design side has their own problems as they try to separate from China. China is their largest geographic sales region by both revenue and profit. As the sock-puppet OP mentioned their AI play is improving and it's one of the few AI chips not export controlled to China! Or at least it wasn't. You take that away and their design business is going to need a government bail out of their own to stay in business and remain competitive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIntel is tanking because the fundamentals just aren't there. They need drastic action but are being pulled in too many directions by the needs of the government. 100% they would be out of the manufacturing business if not for tensions with China. They wanted out. Every signal said they were getting out. But their stuck because of geopolitics. And you know what's even more fucked? This is conspiracy land, but given America's past with Stuxnet and cyber-warfare, I would not be surprised if Intel wasn't a huge target for Chinese cyber operations. If you really want to Red Team this, Intel's foundry business is too ripe a target to pass up. Something in one circuit board that moved a mirror by a 1/100th of an inch between each exposure would be enough to ruin them. You are dealing with atomic precision here on brand new technology. A fan turning on at the wrong time - even just randomly - would be enough. The supply chains for those High-NA machines span the globe. Thousands of subcontractors across the EU, Asia-Pacific, North America, Canada - and it would just take one to sink their business.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is just too much risk. Too much head wind. Too much outside interference. As that dumb-ass TV show would say - \"I'm out\".",
