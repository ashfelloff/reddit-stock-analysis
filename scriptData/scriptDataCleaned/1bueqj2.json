Every day just waking up with increasingly decrepit and geriatric bones, knee pain, going into work for $12/hour all to make enough money to help your grandkids live a better life than you did.\n\nYou're on your deathbed having finished your notorized will, feeling good about leaving your grandkid all the rest of your life's savings thinking about all the things they'll do to have a better life and remember you by for the rest of their life.\n\n...And within 6 hours of croaking and will processed, he immediately blows it on $240 4/19 $TSLA calls and loses it all immediately.
