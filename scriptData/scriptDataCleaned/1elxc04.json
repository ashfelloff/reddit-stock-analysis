  "selftext": "Hear me out\n\nWhile everyone is drooling over NVDA, AMD has been quietly positioning itself for a massive AI breakout.\n\n1. **MI300: The NVDA Killer**\nAMD's MI300 chip is set to disrupt the AI GPU market. It's not just hype - Microsoft and Meta are already on board. This beast could capture 20-30% of the AI data center market, eating into NVDA's lunch.\n\n2. **Xilinx Acquisition: The Secret Weapon**\nEveryone's sleeping on the Xilinx deal. This isn't just another boring acquisition - it's AMD's ticket to dominating adaptive computing and edge AI.\n\n3. **AI PCs: The Next Big Thing**\nForget about data centers for a sec. AMD's pushing hard into AI-compatible CPUs for PCs. This could be a massive, untapped market that NVDA can't touch.\n\n4. **Lisa Su: The 4D Chess Master**\nAMD's CEO isn't just smart - she's related to Jensen Huang (NVDA's CEO). It's like a tech soap opera, and Lisa's playing the long game.\n\n5. **Potential Earnings Explosion**\nAnalysts are projecting AMD's earnings could hit $10 per share by 2026. Do the math - that could push the stock to $300+.\n\nThe recent dip? That's your golden ticket, regards. While the market's freaking out over some China drama, AMD's busy laying the groundwork for AI domination.\n\nLet's ride this bitch to Valhalla",

No idea if good or bad but nVidia has peaked a lot.\n\nI hold lot of Nvidia too but I have more confidence in AMD for 2025, Nvidia had good gains this year.   \n\nDont listen to folks here.

There secret weapon is networking and video encoding/decoding at high speeds and great efficiency!\n\nLisa Su is a genius, she defeated Intel who was way bigger and better for almost 50 years!\n\nAn other missed bullet point is chiplets! AMD has a lot of experience with chiplets and advanced packaging, and now they are using it on GPUs as well https://www.techpowerup.com/301071/amd-explains-the-economics-behind-chiplets-for-gpus. \n\nThis is the thing Nvidia struggles with, given that the B200 is delayed because of packaging problems.
