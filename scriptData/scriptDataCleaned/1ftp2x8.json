No it's because they know Israel just not only attacked a group they back but also invaded another middle eastern country while continuing to illegally occupy more and more Palestinian land in a war where they've killed over 40,000 Muslims and have been keeping Palestinians in an open air prison where they're subject to different laws (literal apartheid).  There were literally protests in Israel because people were annoyed that soldiers who raped Palestinians were being charged, you can watch soldiers laughing as they ransack civilian homes. You can see Israeli defence ministers and politicians call for the total destruction of Palestine. Then Israel invades more middle eastern land and murders more Muslim civilians. \n\nIsrael has routinely killed Iranian military, scientists and civilians while reeking havoc on neighbouring countries, there is quite literally an arrest warrant out for the president and military leader. Give it a few years, you'll pretend you didn't say dumb shit like this when it's viewed historically. \n\nGood luck investing if you understand the world this little.",
