I cannot tell you what you should do but I can relate my story and maybe thatâ€™ll help you somehow.\n\nI lost many times what you lost decades ago and I survived.  When that happened to me I cut my losses and regrouped.  I went back to the drawing board and discovered that I lacked some skills I needed to be a success.  After years of observation I began to make decisions again and with my newfound knowledge and, more importantly, first hand real life experience I was able to turn it around.",

I simply hadnâ€™t done enough studying and observation to have a handle on equity markets overall or the equities I was investing in.\n\nIt was embarrassing really.  I got a job with a public company which granted me options.  Those options did well and I made money on them.  Well being a complete regard I somehow ascribed my success to me LMAO.  I thought I could simply continue that success with other investments not really knowing a damn thing.",
