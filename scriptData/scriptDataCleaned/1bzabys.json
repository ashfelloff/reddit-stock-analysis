  "selftext": "Hi Regards,\n\nI will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).\n\nI may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.\n\nMy position: $48.5C\n\nThe other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.\n\n  \nHere is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \\~8% to 12% post earnings:\n\n1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%\n\n2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share\n\n3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.\n\n4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).\n\n5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:\n\nBonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):\n\n***\"So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.\"***\n\n***\"Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***\n\n***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***\n\n***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***\n\n***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.\"***\n\nThis is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.\n\nThis is NOT financial advice.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nBaymax\n\n*How Would You Rate Your Pain?*",
