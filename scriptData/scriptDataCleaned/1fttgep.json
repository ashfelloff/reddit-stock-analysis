Out of 20k used tacos, only 5 were face-lift 2nd gen with the 4cyl/stick/4wd. Only one was white. \n\nIf it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me. I'm still rocking the terrorist 5 spoke steelies for the look.\n\nBetter, imo. I've seen those trucks climb through pure hell loaded down with 28 insurgents.",
