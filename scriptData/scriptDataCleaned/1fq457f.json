I have made these mistakes before as a beginner.\n\nAlso make absolutely certain you can afford any exercise assignment, because with ITM options it is there. even early exercise can happen. you can also look up the Wheel strategy for options, that's what helped me a lot. It's better to stick to long-term investments.\n\nAs someone who has been trading for 2 years, I regret trying day trading, I just stick long-term now and I try to build a career in some other field working for a company.
