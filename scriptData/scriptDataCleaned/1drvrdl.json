  "selftext": "Honestly I think the Temu and Shein market push will do way better than expected. Temu and shein (especially temu) miss out on many customer opportunities due to the lack of trust brought by the shady “too good to be true” nature in both of them. Amazon is extremely familiar and there’s already a total of over 310mil active users.\n\nIncluding the new Alexa subscription, with Amazon moving in the direction of AI, they have an opportunity to make something comparable to the IPhone, THE Home AI. Something that everyone will have. They could also open the idea of rolling out yearly updated models.\n\nI genuinely think this next half of the year is going to be crazy if Amazon plays it right",

AMZN is only getting bigger, and it isn't going anywhere anytime soon. There were 3 trucks on my road at the same time the other day. If I go into a UPS, FedEx, hell, even a post office, all I see are AMZN packages. Mind you, both UPS and FedEx are publicly traded companies!! They are pushing more packages of AMZN than their own. This just reinforces my sentiment that they aren't going anywhere. Now, with AI and AWS becoming focal points for AMZN, there is nowhere to go but up. They will compete with the top names in the sector and possibly emerge victorious. With that being said, over the next 6 months, I believe AMZN will see continued growth. Some people may disagree, and that's ok, but there's no denying the fact that at almost every turn, there is something AMZN related in their view. Good luck!!",

I have found myself browing on Amazon, finding items I like, reading reviews, then buying the product on Temu for 65% less. Basic nonsense like shorts, shirts, socks, household items (fixtures, tupperware, etc).. Small electrical doodads for projects, or consumables for the garage, etc.. most of the things I buy, I dont actually need a name brand version of, and its usually the same chinese factory selling it on Temu, AliExpress, Ebay, and Amazon - with Amazon / Ebay being the most expensive place to purchase these items.\n\nSwitching has also helped me adjust my behavior from instant gratification to longer term planning.\n\nAmazon became the new ebay years ago - flooded with chinese no name products and fake reviews - they charge for prime video to be commercial free (even though youre already paying for prime, so now you have to pay twice?), theres really limited value in using Amazon services these days except for the occasional purchase of an item that I actually want to pay extra for in order to guarantee quality (buying a hard drive for the computer, motor oil, something like that where the brand actually matters) and even then, I can usually find a better deal on those items at a different, more specific / tailored retailer.\n\n**Edit:** or the occasional last minute purchase i.e. going camping tomorrow and need a thing I forgot to purchase etc\n\nAmazon definitely isnt going to fail tomorrow, but as an individual consumer, I feel they have no moat / no value added. I think their non-consumer services like AWS etc will keep them in power but I imagine as people start to wise up and continue being smarter with their money (because our government keeps robbing us of its value) they will start to be seen as a luxury rather than a convenience to the average joe.",

      "body": "Let me ask you a question. Have you used this year more Amazon services than last year?\n\nMy answer is that I've uses way less Amazon services than last year because they suck every year more.\n\nI buy less because the delivery gets worse every year. Packages don't get delivered on time, packages get stolen, etc. And it has become a nightmare to get a refund of packages which were supposed to be delivered but actually weren't.\n\nI cancelled my Prime subscription because Prime Videos sucks and the advantage of next day deliveries doesn't exist anymore.\n\nIt's time for me to support other shops now more because a lot of them stepped their online business up a lot and provide customer service like the good old Amazon.",
