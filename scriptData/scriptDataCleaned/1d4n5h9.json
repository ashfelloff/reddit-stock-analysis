  "selftext": "Krispy Kreme ($DNUT) is going to start phasing into Mcdonalds restaurants in the second half of 2024. They did a pilot run and shockingly, McDonalds customers responded well to fried dough covered in lots of sugar. By 2026, they will be in 12,000 Mcdonalds restaurants, almost doubling their locations. The company is at about break even right now because they are spending money to be able to deliver lots of fresh donuts to many locations nationwide. They are in the process of updating their business model to focus more on delivering donuts to places where people are rather than having people come to their locations. They will be able to deliver fresh, superior donuts, to pretty much every location in the US. The stock is at an all time low because of the Ozempic mania fear, weakening consumer fears, and a lack of demand for unprofitable companies due to the high interest rates. If management is able to successfully transition their business model and execute well on the McDonalds partnership, Krispy Kreme could become valued closer to something like Wingstop or Chipotle. Their infrastructure to be able to deliver fresh pastries, made and delivered daily to where ever the consumers are, could become very valuable if management executes well. \n\nPositions: 3500 shares @ $10.03. Implied volatility on the options is pretty low but I prefer a larger position rather than paying for leverage with options.",
