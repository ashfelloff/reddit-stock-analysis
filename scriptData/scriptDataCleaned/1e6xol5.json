Its a horrible reflection on the quality control and engineering practices going on at Crowdstrike. Its not a \"dip\" to buy, in the cybersec space TRUST is everything, and once youve lost it, its hard to deal with.\n\nHopefully these tech companies realize that you can't get away with mass engineering layoffs while injesting idiotic non-tech MBAs at every corner without consequences. You'd think Boeing is the case-study on why this doesnt work, but alas I guess short term profits rule all.",

This information significantly changes the assessment of the situation. Given the scale and duration of the outage, as well as the critical nature of the affected sectors, I would indeed revise my assessment. Here's an updated perspective:\n\nRevised Assessment:\n\n1. Severity of the Impact:\n   - The global scale and duration of the outage, affecting critical infrastructure like airports, banks, and government agencies, is extremely serious.\n   - This level of disruption is likely to have severe financial and reputational consequences for CrowdStrike.\n\n2. Potential Financial Impact:\n   - The company may face substantial compensation claims from affected businesses.\n   - Loss of revenue due to contract cancellations is likely to be significant.\n   - Potential fines from regulatory bodies could be substantial.\n\n3. Reputational Damage:\n   - Trust is paramount in cybersecurity, and this incident severely damages CrowdStrike's reputation.\n   - Regaining trust from major institutions like banks and government agencies will be challenging and time-consuming.\n\n4. Legal Ramifications:\n   - The likelihood of multiple high-profile lawsuits has increased significantly.\n   - Potential class-action lawsuits from affected businesses and individuals could be substantial.\n\n5. Competitive Position:\n   - Competitors are likely to gain significant market share as businesses look for alternative solutions.\n   - CrowdStrike's position as a leader in the industry is now in jeopardy.\n\n6. Regulatory Scrutiny:\n   - Given the impact on critical infrastructure, expect intense regulatory scrutiny and possible new regulations.\n\n7. Recovery Timeline:\n   - The recovery process, both in terms of fixing the issue and rebuilding trust, is likely to be lengthy.\n\nRevised Investment Perspective:\n\nGiven this new information, the investment risk has increased substantially. While there might still be a potential \"buy the dip\" opportunity for very risk-tolerant, long-term investors, the risks are now much higher:\n\n1. The stock price could potentially fall much further as the full impact becomes clear.\n2. Recovery, if possible, is likely to take much longer than initially estimated.\n3. The company's growth trajectory and market position may be permanently altered.\n\nRecommendation:\n\n1. Exercise extreme caution. This situation is more severe than initially thought.\n2. If considering an investment, wait for much more clarity on the financial impact, legal consequences, and the company's recovery plan.\n3. Watch for signs of how quickly major clients return to using CrowdStrike's services, if at all.\n4. Monitor for any changes in senior management or company structure as a result of this incident.\n5. Consider the potential for the company to become an acquisition target if the stock price falls dramatically.\n\nRemember, in situations like this, there's a real possibility of permanent capital loss. Any investment decision should be made with the understanding that this could potentially be a company-altering event. As always, diversification and careful risk management are crucial.",

We know that Crowdstrike is very deeply entrenched with the intelligence agencies.  Makes it seem even more suspicious when the crowdstrike CEO gives interviews, without giving any real details!!  Like what is the point of giving an interview except for trying to promote a narrative/story.",

They essentially back up the functionality of your business when the internet/system goes down, seems now more than ever this might be more important than we think. Curious your thoughts as I have had this on my watchlist, thanks !",

Rubrik is a modern offering for a need that has existed from the beginning of time, but it‚Äôs not a proprietary recipe or strategy and like many things will likely blend into the market long term. Veeam, Backup Exec, and many others at one time held the top spot.\n\nRubrik in the context of the CrowdStrike incident would produce the most value for virtual machines. For bare metal and end user compute, it‚Äôs not useless but far more work to use than it would be to perform the fix CrowdStrike provided. Backups are a last resort in most cases and I don‚Äôt think that will change anytime soon. Most organizations run Windows endpoints and servers, so even if your servers were all virtual machines and could be restored via Rubrik, the server infrastructure was still toast.\n\nNo, I don‚Äôt think Runrik is where you‚Äôll see the most value long-term.",
