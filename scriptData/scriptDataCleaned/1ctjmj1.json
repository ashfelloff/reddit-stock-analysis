Didn't know it was instant. \n\nThe UI sucks but stocks are free to trade and I've gotten good fills. Just don't say trade on it. Waste of time you'll lose when frustrated. \n\nOptions are okay. I feel like my fill is good so the .65 might be worth it to get in and out without wondering why it didn't fill. \n\nCongrats on the gains. ",
