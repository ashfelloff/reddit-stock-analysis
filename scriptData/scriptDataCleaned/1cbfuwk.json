Markets can stay irrational for a long long time but nowadays most decent stocks usually get a bid within a few years as opposed to near a decade like TSLA did from 2010 to Jan/2020.\n\nOP's choice of TSLA vs NFLX clearly shows they don't even understand the basic premise of momentum, public knowledge and information being priced in, analyst expectations, prior pricing, underlying value, future guidence/expectations, and \"running up/down\" going into earnings. \n\nOP shouldn't be \"done with earnings\" but should be \"done with stocks\". Clowns like that should stick to 60/40 index etfs and retire old but they'll gamble with WSB like a regard and get BTFO instead.",

All anyone wanted to know was timeline for further launches (esp Model 2) and Elon confirmed things are on track (I think this is BS, but doesn’t matter). I bought calls because if everyone knows the numbers will be shit, then the numbers don’t really matter and all your left with is elons ability to spin bullshit about the future.",

I know a lot of folks, myself included, who are still sharing without paying, and I know even more folks who were sharing with immediate families and just cancelled entirely when they started trying to block them out (including some of my own direct family members). I currently get significantly inferior product than when I originally signed up, and the current monthly cost is over 400% of what I was paying back then, when their library was a lot bigger and they would still send 2 DVDs at a time in the mail. Between going so woke as to become the laughing stock of internet memes, and jacking up prices as the service continues to decline, I can't imagine any realistic positive forward looking statement that doesnt involve investing in crypto or something. Massive price increases and lower quality service in a repetitive loop is just not a sustainable business model.\n\n\nBesides that, a bigger beat was priced in.
