You could look at selling the $9 or $10 calls against your long call position.  it lets you rake in some premium to offset potential losses in your long calls. The downside is that it also caps your upside if the stock really starts to run higher.\n\nNow, the sweet spot here is to match the expiration dates of those short calls to your existing long calls. That gives you a super tight hedge. But you could also sell shorter-dated OTM calls if you're just looking to generate some near-term income to cushion the downside.  short term bearish long term bullish\n\nThe other route you could take is to just close out those $7.50 calls. That locks in your gains so far and gives you a bit more breathing room on the downside.",
