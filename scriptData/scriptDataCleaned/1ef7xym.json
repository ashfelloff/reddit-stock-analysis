Going into seasonal weakness and a news vacuum during a slight downtrend will only help the downtrend. Bond market has 80% chance of rate cut priced in, I’m not an expert at all, but I don’t see a rate cut coming. The economy is “doing too good” to justify it. They would rather save the cut for a time when it looks like it’s needed. We had a very strong move(since November) to get to this point and those buyers are not going to lay down so I don’t see a catastrophic sell off by any means. To me, August - mid/late September will be a slow bleed lower…. Pending what this week brings. So I wouldn’t sell them right now, but I would be cautious/skeptical if we don’t move higher this week. Maybe just sell calls against them to generate some income as again, I don’t see an immediate huge decline coming, but a huge upside move seems more and more unlikely at this point.",
