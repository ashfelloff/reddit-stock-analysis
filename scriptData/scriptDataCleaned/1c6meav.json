      "body": "Not much to discuss since my last update. Been nothing but flat since then. Wasn‚Äôt sure I was gonna post an updated but wanted to be consistent\n\nThe one positive takeaway is that when the rest of the market has been a sea of blood red the last week, TKO has stayed consistent. Or maybe that‚Äôs just my positive spin.\n\nNow UFC 300 has also come and gone and as expected, it was a banger and a huge success. Here are some of the numbers that UFC released 90 minutes ago:\n\nGATE\n\n$16.5 million, the third highest-grossing UFC event ever\n\nATTENDANCE\n\n20,067, a new record for a UFC event at T-Mobile Arena\n\nUFC‚Äôs sixth consecutive sellout in 2024 and the eleventh straight sellout dating back to October 2023.\n\nVIEWERSHIP\n\nMost-watched UFC Pay Per View Prelims ever across ESPN platforms (ESPN+, Hulu SVOD, ESPN & ESPN Deportes combined)\n\nMost-watched UFC Pay Per View Prelims ever on ESPN, with 1.86 million total viewers\n\nViewership on ESPN grew every 30 minutes from 8:00p ‚Äì 10:00p ET, peaking with 2.49 million total viewers at 9:48p ET leading into the main card Pay-Per-View on ESPN+ at 10:00p ET.\n\nMost-viewed sports event of Saturday during primetime (8:00p ‚Äì 10:00p ET) on cable and network television among total viewers and key demographics, including P18-34, P18-49, P25-54, M18-34, M18-49, M25-54, F18-34, F18-49, and F25-54.\n\nMERCHANDISE\n\n#1 all-time merchandise sales ever for a UFC arena event (*not including stadium shows)\n\n#2 all-time merchandise sales for any UFC event (*behind only UFC 193: ROUSEY vs. HOLM at Etihad Stadium in Melbourne in 2015)\n\nGLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS\n\nHighest-grossing sponsorship sales for an event in UFC history\n\nAll available inventory sold out\n\nCOMMERCIAL PAY PER VIEW IN US, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA\n\nU.S.: Highest result since July 2021 (UFC 264)\n\nCanada: Highest result since March 2020 (UFC 248)\n\nAustralia: Highest result since January 2021 (UFC 257)\n\nMovie theaters in the U.S. set a record for a UFC event with the highest number of participating locations\n\nSOCIAL:\n\nBest performing event on social media in UFC history, breaking records for cross platform video views, impressions, and interactions. Throughout fight week (April 8 ‚Äì 13), UFC social media amassed more than 1.1 billion video views, with 213 million views coming from Max Holloway‚Äôs knockout of Justin Gaethje, which was posted across several platforms.\n\nAt this point I will most likely hold through earnings. Also the fact the CEO and executive chairman of Endeavor bought 3.2 million shares of TKO the day before WM40 also helps fill me with confidence.\n\nBut only time will tell. I guess I can use this post as a way to keep the convo going.",

I don't do options or any of that, I only do normal trading, buy and hold type of stuff.¬†\n\nI'm excited for earnings this week! I'm a big fan of WWE, they have been absolutely on fire since HHH took over and with all the new things TKO is trying (production, presentation, press conferences for PLE's, just a bunch of things).¬†\n\nI bought this stock because this is a product that I \"get\" and that I enjoy and consume. And as someone who follows WWE, I can say that this company has not been this hot since the Attitude Era during the late 90's/early 2000's.\n\nGo look at the highlights from the recent France (Lyon) shows, Smackdown and PLE Backlash. Absolutely insane crowd that set records for revenue. Currently HHH is teasing a Wrestlemania in London, he keeps mentioning Mayor Khan needing to \"get in touch with him.\n\nI'm just really impressed with this company and the much needed fresh and new direction it's taking. Bought in at the mid 80's, I see it as a stable stock that will steadily rise (with slight dips now and then) into the 110's - 120's like the price targets seem to be at.\n\nCan't wait for Wednesday's earnings! ¬†",
