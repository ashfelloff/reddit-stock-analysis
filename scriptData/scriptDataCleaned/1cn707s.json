  "selftext": "Robinhood’s 3% match on IRAs looks like it was a huge success based off of their increase in AUM. At first glance one might think it’s a big hit to the company shelling out 3% on billions of dollars but if you start to think more about what they’ve accomplished, it was ingenious. \n\nHOOD doesn’t allow mutual funds which meant if you wanted to get the 3% IRA transfer you had to liquidate your mutual funds. Most people have MF in their IRA accounts, so now they have to go buy ETFs which means money in RH pocket. So they grab some cash back there.\n\nTheir average account size will balloon as 40-50 year olds with seven figure accounts move their money to HOOD because we know a great deal when we see it!\n\nThose 40-50 year olds will also grab their checking and savings and move it to RH for 5.25% interest. \n\nThen they’ll bring their brokerage account too because they want the 1% match and also lower trading costs. Plus we have real money to trade (I’m 52 y/o) and we aren’t buying 10 shares of AMC we buy 100 shares of DIS (bought yesterday on the dip, wish me luck).\n\nThe five year lock in means they have plenty of time to recoup all of the money they’ve laid out and more. Plus don’t underestimate how much they were spending already just to attract new customers. \n\n\nIt’ll be very interesting to see how much this promo has changed their average customer profile and RH future.\n \n\n",
