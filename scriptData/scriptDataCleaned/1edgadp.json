      "body": "Companies stay private way too long and grow way too big, and then want to go public as an opportunity to cash out once all the easy growth is already over. They view public markets as a source of liquidity for founders/early investors, not as an opportunity for the public to participate in the growth. With this mindset, it’s no surprise that these IPOs don’t do well. Investors shouldn’t touch them.\n\ntl;dr ABNB IPOing at $1bn market cap is very exciting, IPOing at $100bn at market cap is a slap in the face to the public markets",

          "body": "It's all a scam.\n\nCompanies used to go (and sometimes still go) IPO because they needed to grow. They had organic growth, profitability, but to build factories or whatever, they needed a lot more money.\n\nMost of this stuff isn't organic and the VCs have plenty of money. The VCs are just exiting as what they see as peak. Like maybe there's a company with a billion customers losing millions, and they figure a billion is about top, so hype it and dump it. Or in the case of Airbnb I'm guessing they looked at how growth of bookings wasn't that stellar, and there were growing rivals.",

Seems like they may have just had a bad batch and the odds went against them. \n\nThere's also the possibility that the good ones can be taken back by private equity and restructured like Celsius was. There's another firm I am blanking on which went public multiple times and was bought back by the original founder at crazy discounts using the money VC funds gave them to go public. \n\nThe smart ones with a good product or service will generally survive and return in a few years.
