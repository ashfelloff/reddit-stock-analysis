  "selftext": "\nThis is an update from my previous post [‚ÄúAnyone ever gotten this?‚Äù](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/SOSGImr0kf) \n\nFirst, here's the rundown of what happened: So, I had this genius plan to score an \"easy\" $500 by dealing with NVDA options. I sold 10 calls at the $902.5 strike for $2.75 each and hedged with 10 call contracts at the $900 strike that I got for $4.75. Quick math: that's a breakeven at $902, selling for $902.5, netting me a sweet $0.50 per share. \n\nBut here's the kicker, I didn't know you could call your broker until 5:30 PM if your option expires in the money. Long story short, the buyer of my $902.5 strike calls ghosted, leaving me with 1000 shares of NVDA from the expired $900 strike calls and a cash account deficit of $897,813.87. Which is some RH BS because the shares were worth $901,250, but still stressful AF. \n\nI wasn't thrilled about being on the hook for $1000 for every $1 move in NVDA. But Robinhood's 24-hour market came in clutch. I unloaded those shares on Sunday night at $909.62 a pop, raking in a profit of $7.62 per stock. I probably could have made more if I held but I‚Äôm relieved I‚Äôm out. Crisis averted, tendies secured. üöÄüí∞ü§ë\n\nTLDR: Robinhood told me I owed them almost $900k after I did an NVDA spread without knowing about DNE, so I almost got spread, but got lucky and ended up making $7k or 350% in four days.",

This left the OP with a borrowed 1,000 shares worth of NVDA at $900 per share to hold over the weekend.

If you owe the bank 100million Dollars, the bank has a problem. \n\nIn this case OP had a automatically executed because it was ITM and the guy who owned OPs 902.5 call he sold, had it set to DNE. They both would have traded at the same time. Even though Robinhood floated OP 900kish to exercise the ITM contract, they weren't really ever at risk of being out 900k. OP had 1000 shares of Nvidia that they would have force sold on Monday. Not a big deal.for Robinhood, even if Nvidia lost like 50$ in share value over the weekend. OP would have gotten fucked though.
