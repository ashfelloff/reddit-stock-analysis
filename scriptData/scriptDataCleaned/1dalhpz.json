How many of you remember when 5-8% annual return was doing well and 10-15% made you a rockstar?\n\nI was around. I remember _the fear_ that gripped almost _everything_ as we watched in horror and thought JPMorgan, Bank of America and Suntrust (prior to their recent merger, DANG I'M OLD) were on the brink of following Lehman and Bear Sterns. I remember when America didn't run on \"too big to fail\" and when putting money into something like cryptocurrency would make you a laughing stock among traders.\n\nThe only question is this - has the world really, truly, actually changed and all this basically infinite \"growth\" leading to unfathomable gains here to stay?\n\nOr is \"too big to fail\" inevitably going to turn into \"too big to succeed?\"\n\nDiscuss!",

Some like JPM, GS, BAC, and DAL have proven they are not \"too big to succeed\" while others like C, WFC, BA, INTC, big3autos, and some Airlines are.\n\n>How many of you actually know what a real bear market looks like? \n\nThere's no non-real bear market. 2022 was a real bear market and so was 2020.\n\nThe \"REAL\" you are trying to get at isn't the \"market\" but **REAL LIFE** real. That's what defines the GFC. Folks lost their jobs, folks lost their homes, every company fell, 100year+ companies in the S&P500 when to 0, and there were no fucking jobs so you had no fucking pay. Crime goes up be it \"urban demographic\" robbing jewelry store, house wives pulling credit card fraud to make end meet, or just petty shoplifting theft. It's not that your neighbor is unemployed but YOU are unemployed. \n\nThere ain't no fucking pay rises but pay cuts IF YOU ARE LUCKY. Many will see unemployment, pay declines, pension cuts, and/or see their stocks drop if not got to 0. If you run a business then you struggle to make sales, fire folks to make ends meet, pickup and stack more of the work upon yourself to make bills, and most likely still see the business you put your time/money/life into die. \n\nMeanwhile you watch Reganomics BS with government bailing out megacorps while letting people lose their fucking homes, savings, assets, cars, and shirts. Foreclosures/evictions, folks hitting the street, instability as main street revolts against wall street (remember [folks actually did it in person and not for the money back in the day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street)), and you see the general rot around you. \n\nThere wasn't no fucking \"lel let's print money for everyone\" with PPP, EIDL, grants, eviction protection, foreclosure protection, free lunches, food banks, free phones/internets/ipads/laptops/etcetc, free utilities, rent paid for you, extended + boosted unemployment, stimmy check upon stimmy check, and infinite 0% rates where everyone and their cat could borrow.\n\nForget about getting paid or rises let alone this whole \"LOL I QUIT AND I'LL HAVE ANOTHER JOB WITH +20% WAGE INCREASE IN BY 1PM AFTERNOON!\" shit that happened in 2020-2024. Shit wasn't so bad that top 100 Uni grads where doing unpaid internships they were ***PAYING FOR THE \"\"\"PRIVILAGE\"\"\" TO WORK UNPAID INTERNSHIPS FOR THE \"\"\"EXPERIENCE\"\"\" IN HOPES OF LANDING AN UNPAID INTERNSHIPT THAT WOULD LEAD TO A JOB***. [The ones that \"made it\" would be hated by everyone along with their own mom for being a filthy fucking banker, work 80hrs a week, and then fucking die making like 50K or some shit](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/nov/22/moritz-erhardt-merrill-lynch-intern-dead-inquest) This was in 2013 btw. Already WAY better than in 2008-2012 imo.\n\n\n\nOh and like 10-15 years later you have to listen to fucking zoomies with [their 50K jobs without a high school degree](https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/fast-food-chain-offers-teen-managers-living-wage-to-offset-worker-shortage) acting like you lucked the fuck out because you \"could have bought the dip\" without realizing you wouldn't even have a fucking job let alone getting paid, go through years of stagnant wages, and get hit with a \"once-in-a-century\" pandemic followed by a \"once-in-a-century\" coup before a \"once-in-a-century\" war in Europe with as side of \"once-in-a-century\" unseen inflation plus a \"once-in-a-century\" year where 60/40 both gets BTFO  where a \"once-in-a-century\" housing shortage also hits before a \"once-in-a-century\" rapid rate hike locks you out of housing market but somehow doesn't decrease home price all during your marriage seeking and family formation years.",

Yahoo finance even had a stock market game (paper trading).  There was TONS of hype in the stock market to novices.  Which inflated the boom greatly and quickly.\n\nYou mentioned the recoveries are quicker now.  And that is true because in 00-01 we didn't have a Federal Reserve willing to prop up the entire market and keep every company alive once the bottom fell out.  A LOT of no value companies (and some higher value ones) went bust back then as a result.  \n\nAs it should be.  That's healthy for the market.\n\nAfter 08 the Fed decided to stop letting nature take it's course and intervene wherever it saw fit.  \n\nSo a lot of companies that probably should have died, didn't.  They just festered.\n\nToday there is even more Fed Res involvement, so my view is there is even less chance of complete disaster from a large company's PoV.  \n\nWell, with a caveat -- If too many things implode at once, there isn't enough debt to print to save it all.  So there is still a chance of a bust followed by a slow recovery.  But it would require something rather monumental (China war, China closing exports, Nukes flying, EMPs, allied foreign money etc) to trigger.\n\nSo I think the US market is safe-ish so long as there isn't a hugeeee sudden upheaval.  Even if there is a shock that involves a recovery, it more than likely won't take long like it used to in order to recover.  And thats mostly because of the Fed Res printing money (that taxpayers don't have) to keep things alive.",

My take is the next one would be so expensive as to be prohibitive and even assuming they can, the consequences seem poised to be insurmountable.

And, in the event things start to sour strongly again, they will begin propping up what they need to in order to avoid the avalanche of bankruptcies (a collapse).  Or, at least, attempt to avoid it.\n\nBut, yes, if/when there is another downturn, they will attempt to keep the wheels on the wagon by strategically propping up banks/lenders and large corps.  Same plan as always.  They will have to get more selective, but it seems to be the only song they know (since it worked in the past).  There would probably also be more bond fundraisers and a larger tug of war between federal depts for funding (probably more cuts than anything). \n\nOTOH adversaries (namely China and Russia) would amplify their attempts to break the US economically by targeting the wounds once they begin to bleed.  The 'Never let a crisis go to waste' type thinking.  Even if it hurts them significantly in the short term, they would take that risk since the payoff for them would be immense if they succeeded for the long term.\n\nI think that is precisely why the Fed Res now steps in to avoid total busts.  Because we might not recover from one should it happen again at the width and depth that they used to.  Recover in the sense of global standing.\n\nThat is, If we had a Great Depression or even dotcom level bust, it would likely mean giving up economic power (and thus influence globally) that would be very difficult to regain.  It would change how the world looks and I think that would probably be an even more chaotic one \\[power vacuum -- I don't mean a Bissell\\].

If you’re too young to have gone through one of these, remember that. Watch everything when you see the writing on the wall, and sell when it hits the fan.

Hilarious.\n\nThere will be short-term pains to be sure, but it will pump up the military-industrial complex and advanced manufacturing because it will be fought with drones and artilleries.

Early losses, little losses, are good losses.  Don't wait to take the BIG loss.  But unfortunately that's psychologically hardest.  When you have a modest loss, you have HOPE (hopium) that the price will recover.  Decide in advance (possibly with a stop-loss)  that a certain price decline (or rise if shorting) will mean that you were WRONG, and get out, instead of hoping and fretting.

It's business and being emotional loses money.\n* Try to avoid investing due to trends/hype/FOMO. If you do end up going in, get out quick, take your gains and diversify.\n* Do not, I repeat, DO NOT trade options if you do not understand how it works or what you're buying selling.

It felt like we were making up new rules for finance on the spot.\n\nLooking back, the 2007-2009 period was a real test for traders and investors. It changed how we think about market dynamics and risk management.
