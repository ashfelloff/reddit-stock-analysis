Certification alone is a 7+ year journey. \n\nAnd Joby is aiming to be an operator of vehicles, not just a manufacturer. This means they have to front all the capital, and recoup later once an aircraft is operational. Far more upside, but more expensive.",

They have something like $350m in cash at a $1B valuation. I believe they'll need at least another $1B in cash to get to certification. How does the math on that pencil out? I don't think it does. And this money has to be mostly equity financing as its too risky for debt. And in the best case, they do raise money which means insane dilution given their small market cap.\n\nJoby on the other hand has been raising a lot of money - but importantly, at 4x the valuation, and without tanking the stock (institutional investors have been holding). \n\nJoby has around $900m in cash, with another $500m committed and coming over the next year or two. Is the extra 10% dilution awesome? Obviously not, but they recognize that getting to commercialization takes a ridiculous amount of cash. If it works, the dilution won't matter because the upside is so high. If it doesn't work, the dilution also doesn't matter.",
