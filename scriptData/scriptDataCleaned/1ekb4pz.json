                      "body": "I can trash-talk crypto all day. It's like religion. Every time someone finds a flaw in it, the meaning fucking changes.\n\nInitially, crypto was touted as a decentralized, government-free solution, a rebellion against traditional banking. It promised liberation from centralized control and bank fees.\n\nHowever, the reality of using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin as a transactional currency has been underwhelming. For example, Bitcoin transactions can take over 15 minutes to process, which is impractical for everyday use. As a result, many businesses that initially adopted it have since abandoned it.\n\nThere have been numerous incidents where exchanges have disappeared with users' funds. And it's users installing weird apps that drain their wallets. This has led to a paradox where the people who celebrated crypto's independence from regulation are now calling for oversight from traditional financial institutions and  government entities, which is the very thing Bitcoin was supposed to be against.\n\nThe narrative has pivoted again, with Bitcoin becoming 'digital gold.' This is yet another rebranding to position it as a store of value rather than a currency.\n\nEvery time a flaw is exposed, the goalposts move and the definition of Bitcoin changes. But It's always the critics who \"just don't understand Bitcoin.\"",
