IT IS THE NEW PARADIGM SHIFT IS HERE. YES YOU MIGHT HAVE NEW GPU ENTRANTS, BUT WHOMEVER THE NEW AI CHIP KING IS: ALL WILL NEED HIGH PERFORMANCE READ WRITE MEMORY: AND THERE IS ONLY ONE THAT HAS THAT: MICRON.

With both Idaho and New York fabs online, Mehrotra told CNBC that Micron plans to increase the share of chips it makes in the U.S. from 10&#37; to nearly 60&#37; in the next two decades.\\\\\"https:\\/\\/www.cnbc.com\\/2023\\/10\\/23\\/micron-building-biggest-chip-fab-in-us-history-despite-china-ban.html$SPY There's only 1.10bil shares. The .49 cents EPS expected will slay in my opinion, with that massive demand, and MICRONS HBM \\(High Bandwidth Memory\\) sold out before manufacturing... you guys know they are sold out for 2024, right? . Bears need to do a little more homework. \\\\\"The company's HBM capacity in fiscal year 2024 has already been sold out, of which is expected to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
