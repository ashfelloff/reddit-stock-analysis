  "selftext": "For those who like voodoo.  I recently noted that June 20^(th) / 21st have the WORST 5-day average returns of any day outside of September based on over 70 years of stock market data. Well, based on the same data, next Monday and Wednesday are the 9^(th) and 6^(th) worst trading days of the entire year.  The QQQ gap at $469 is itching to get filled, QQQ RSI has only tagged this level eight times in the last 30 years, volatility is near lows and itching to spike, a ton of long gamma is resetting thanks to triple witching, and the options complex is too stretched to the upside short-term.  All of this combined could catch traders on the wrong side next week.  I closed out my all my Wed. put options expiring today for a decent six figure gain.   I am rolling the dice with the house's money into QQQ and \"big 7\" put spread positions for next week and see if lightning can strike twice.  Bring on the hater.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr5ynnia6z7d1.jpg?width=1880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=81631ba95dd7bbce851449fcc15bc95147d14aee\n\n",
