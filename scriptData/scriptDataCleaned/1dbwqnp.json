      "body": "Can you explain what's so special about tax harvesting? I always thought it was just a natural part of investing, some decisions are successful and some bring loss but ultimately I only pay tax from profits only. For example, in my country I have five years to use losses from previous years to offset current profits. Is tax harvesting a similar concept?",

          "body": "chatgpt is your friend :\n\n\nImagine you have $1,000 invested in Stock A, but the value of Stock A has declined since you bought it, and it's now worth $800. This means you've experienced a $200 capital loss on your investment in Stock A.\n\nRealizing the Loss: You decide to sell Stock A to realize the $200 capital loss. After selling, you have $800 in cash from the sale.\n\nOffsetting Gains: Suppose you also have $500 in capital gains from selling other investments earlier in the year. By using the $200 capital loss from selling Stock A, you can offset $200 of your $500 capital gains. This reduces your taxable capital gains to $300 for the year.\n\nCarrying Forward Losses: If your capital losses exceed your capital gains for the year, you can carry forward the excess losses to future tax years. In this example, you have $200 in unused capital losses that can be carried forward to offset capital gains in future years.\n\nSo, in summary, by strategically selling Stock A to realize the capital loss, you've reduced your taxable capital gains for the current tax year and potentially reduced your tax liability. Additionally, you've created a tax asset in the form of $200 in unused capital losses that can be used to offset future gains.",
