If people think that your shit is just overpriced then they're not coming and now you reduced you volume. \n\nCoca Cola has had this game planned out for probably centuries now. The cost of the coca cola syrup is probably like $0.10 cents per cup. The store makes a hella markup for selling you that big gulp for $1.99 now or whatever the price is.
