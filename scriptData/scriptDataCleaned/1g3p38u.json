The arrangement should allow them to make ~$80 million in revenue and not carry the loans themselves, skirting the rule. \n\nOnce that reality hits, it will take one or two analysts upgrading the target price to make the price jump. \n\nThere is still double digit short interest in the stock, I think like 18%.

Each contract is for 100 shares, so he purchased the right to buy millions of shares of sofi for $8 before January 2025. Sofi is at $10 right now so he’s $2 above his strike price multiplied by the number of shares. It’s a lot of money but he also risked millions of dollars. If the stock had not reached his strike price at the expiration date, the contracts would have expired worthless. Basically, he put it all on black and won.",

                  "body": "Good question. There’s something I didn’t mention - premiums. Premiums are the cost of the contract. For every contract you buy, there’s someone selling that contract. Premiums are decided by the market and factors such as date to expiration and the difference between strike price and current price. For example, a contract for a $1 price move that expires in one week would be more expensive than a $5 price move that expires tomorrow because one is more likely than the other. \n\nIf you own at least 100 shares of a stock, selling calls (these are called covered calls) are a good way to generate passive income, but you do run the risk of losing your shares if the strike price hits.",
