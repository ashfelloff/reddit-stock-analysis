I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.\n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Quantitative Tightening Goes Global for the First Time, in Test for Markets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-22/central-bank-qt-goes-global-fed-ecb-boj-are-all-doing-quantitative-tightening)\n\n* [**SNOW**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - Earnings beat, .18 vs .16 EPS expected. $868M vs $852M revenue expected. Raised guidance, and announced $2.5B buyback program. Cites that CRWD incident had no impact at all from a consumption standpoint. Market simply sees this stock as overvalued (from what I can glean).\n* [**TEM**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TEM&p=d) - Had a huge spike yesterday off no news two days ago, then a decently steady up-move yesterday. Watching the $75 level, but not too interested in it otherwise.\n* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - Oddly enough, I have a negative bias towards the stock now. We’ve failed to see the stock break $40, the range that it moves in a day is slowly decreasing and we’re seeing less volume compared to the move from 21->33. Currently short a nominal position, but have a stop in case we spike off the open like yesterday.\n* [**LUNR**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LUNR&p=d) - Again, watching the $6 level today. CEO stated “key award discussions in the coming week” which is heavily implied to be, but not confirmed, the NSNS contract worth nearly $540M. PLEASE remember this when trading this.\n* [**BEN**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BEN&p=d) - [SEC investigating co-CIO of firm’s Western Asset Unit](https://www.ft.com/content/39d30d90-e28a-4851-85e2-ab4503f1f015), stock sold off massively intraday yesterday. Watching again today in case of another selloff.\n\nEarnings: [**CAVA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CAVA&p=d), [**WDAY**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=WDAY&p=d)",

That was fantastic news and alleviated major fears. \n\nWithout a major setback with these first five satellites they will continue to acquire funding, get there first, and rivals in space communication will be playing catch up for five years. \n\n\nWhy do you think it ran up?

It's different from day trading, where traders buy and sell stocks within the same day, often executing multiple trades in a single day.\n\n>Many retail investors might buy and hold stocks for short or long periods based on their strategy, market outlook, or financial goals. When you see people talking about buying, holding, or selling specific stocks, they could be:\n\n>**Day Traders**: Buying and selling stocks within the same trading day to profit from small price fluctuations.\n\n>**Swing Traders**: Holding stocks for a few days to weeks, aiming to profit from short-term market movements.\n\n>**Long-Term Investors**: Buying and holding stocks for months or years, focusing on the company’s growth or dividends rather than short-term price changes.\n\n>Your plan to buy a stock and sell it after a couple of weeks fits more with swing trading. Many people engage in this type of trading to get a taste of the market or to try and make short-term profits.\n\n>If you proceed, keep in mind the following:\n\n>**Transaction Costs**: Ensure the potential profit is more than the trading fees, if applicable.\n\n>**Tax Implications**: In a taxable brokerage account, selling a stock within a year could subject you to short-term capital gains tax, which is typically higher than long-term capital gains tax.\n\n>**Market Risk**: Stock prices can be unpredictable in the short term, and your expected profit might not materialize.\n\n>If this approach appeals to you, you’re not alone—many people test the waters of the stock market this way.",
