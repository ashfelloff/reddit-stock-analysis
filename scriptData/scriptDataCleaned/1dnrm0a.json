That doesn't require any kind of insane growth, just some shoring up of inefficiencies and a bit of expansion in a sector or two. By all accounts, energy will be positive for Tesla next earnings while deliveries will probably slip. Cutting part of your work force certainly can add to margins.\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter anyway if you're thinking longer term.

Margin picture is murky, as job cut effect won’t show this quarter. Unclear if they used their own cash or bought down interest rates for interest rate deals. As usual, the outlook probably  means much more than Q2 results.\n\nThe economic woes in China may be turning a corner… the bruising fight has taken down the stock for NIO, XPEV, and while BYD has been having a good recovery from Feb low, it is still well off ATH.\n\nA mix of interest rates, subsidy changes, and tariffs, as well as a renewed surge of FUD from fossil fuel interests have made 2024 complicated. Germany had to pull their subsidies due to how they were funding them, the tariff trade war between China and U.S., China and EU, and so forth have affected both vehicles and vehicle part costs and outlook. The news that the EU is temporarily suspended additional tariffs while negotiations take place is likely to make the outlook a bit better in the short term.\n\nAs of recently, the Cybertruck is handily outselling the Rivian R1T and Ford F-150 Lightning combined, with a run rate of over 60,000 a year. The refreshed Model 3 is finally in full production globally, so Q3 should have full production. The U.S. IRA battery component requirements became stricter in 2024 which has caused some pricing issues, but Model 3 LR got the tax credit back just recently, while the standard range still doesn’t have it. And outlook with some interest rate cuts can definitely change the demand picture.",

Like Amazon their retail is insanely low margin but high revenue, but they make all their money from the cloud. Not as extreme but you get the point. \n\nYou said this is a 65 PE for a negative growth stock. That is the point I'm challenging. With Tesla energy growing, slightly lower auto deliveries doesn't make their **profit** negative. Remember P/E is about profit. Not revenue. It's very possible that their profit goes up this quarter from last quarter.",
