  "title": "\"All In\" in Bumble - $209.000",

  "selftext": "Hello friends and regards - special shout-out to regarded friends\n\nI just went \"all in\" with a solid 5+ through Bumble using Superswipe: \"If you were a Transformer, you'd be Optimus Fine\", I said. The total cost for this epic win? Just an estimated $5 — considerably less than the $50 I usually spent behind Wendy’s for similar quality. With this robust efficiency improvement, I immediately remembered Peter Thiel's 10x rule about what great technology can do for you. Indeed, this really got me thinking and researching about Bumble's value, leading to my first-ever Yolo bet of >$200k\n\n**The Yolo Set-Up**: Bumble dropped a brutal 40% after Q2 reporting, and shares are now down >90% from all time highs. Shareholders are clearly swiping left on woke management that has zero clue on how to monetize the most easily monetizable user group in the universe — sexless regards sending likes and “Hey”s in direct correlation to how much they are hoping and praying\n\n**Deep Value Profits:** But underneath the sell-off there is now a deep value thesis, imo: Bumble is generating annualized net profits of around $120-150 million, while shares are trading <$900 million. And although profits are not growing, they aren't compressing either: Indeed, Bumble's revenues are flat YoY, as Bumble continues to be one of the top-grossing apps in the U.S. and globally - check top-grossing Charts [here](https://app.sensortower.com/top-charts?category=0&country=US&date=2024-09-08&device=iphone&os=ios)\n\n**\\~25% Buyback Yield:** Bumble is making a solid Buffett move with its profits, using cash to buy back stock while shares are trading at basement prices: \n\n*We ended the quarter with $287 million in cash and cash equivalent. Since, the inception of our repurchase program, we have returned $241 million to shareholders representing more than 125% of our free cash flow over that time…* *At the end of Q2, we had $209 million remaining on our $450 million total buyback authorization.* *Our strong balance sheet and profitability gives us the financial flexibility to continue returning cash to our shareholders.* *We remain very committed to our buyback program and continue to believe that buying back shares remains a very good use of our capital* [*(*](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/bumble-bmbl-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/)[*Post Q2 earnings call*](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/bumble-bmbl-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/)*)*\n\nSo, Bumble is gearing up to buy back \\~25% of its float over the next 6-12 months.\n\n**Fair Value Potentially At $14:** I use a DCF model to value BMBL shares, based on consensus FCF estimates, a WACC of 10% and a TGV of zero. This calculation suggests that BMBL shares are fairly valued at around $14, equal to 15x FY 2025 earnings — vs. <$7 currently. I surely made a mistake in my calculation to value BMBL, because I am regarded and the alpha-male hormone release from my Bumble sex adventure is clouding my thinking. So, do your own valuation and don't trust mine blindly.\n\n**My position:** 22,000 shares worth \\~$148,000; plus 20,000 call contracts with January 2025 expiration, strike $4, worth \\~$61,000.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p6aqij6warnd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a74c3d1d6348b3d46ae24abf67e4e8ed658be1d\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r41nqk6warnd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=496439c2f36689266e8e565e162a01c001d171f7\n\n",

I can only find answers here on Reddit, anywhere else is just generative garbage..\n\nTinder used to be great back in the days, now all they have is bots and an algorithm that favors a few, the app would blurry the person that likes you then when you pay for premium the person that likes you is someone you swiped left on. Then bumble has girls making the first move, me and you know girls hate to make the first move because they rather want to be chased.. the only dating app that’s somewhat successful now is Hinge, and they’re making the app worse now and way more expensive. I say if you’re going to make an app expensive then make sure it actually works, you can swipe for days and get 2 matches then have to pay extra to swipe on good looking people..\n\nHonestly I might start shorting bumble, great idea lol 😂",

Tinder/Bumble/Hinge have perfected their algorithms to give the ugly/average dudes enough crumbs to keep using the app, and the longer and more desperate they get the more money they're likely to spend. Women and attractive men do not make these companies a lot of money since they can for the most part get the full value out of the app without paying for any of the 'premium' features. The amount of young sexless men will increase, everyone knows that gen Z is so far the least social generation in history. A lot of them don't have any hobbies, don't have any friends to out with or meet people through, and don't go to bars/clubs/events. That leaves them with little options to  'satisfy' their sexual urges, porn or apps. Apps are the closest shot to getting anything, which is close to 0%, which is why so many of these men gravitate towards it.\n\nTLDR: Dudes are desperate and horny, OP is probably regarded, and Bumble as a company sucks, but the stock could do something like go up.",
