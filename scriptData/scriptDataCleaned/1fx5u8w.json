The two services were originally scheduled to open on October 7.\n\nA relevant person in charge of a securities company said that this is the first time that China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation(CSDC) has started work in advance during a long holiday. However, the person in charge said that newly applied securities accounts will still have to wait until October 8 to be opened, and normal transactions can only be carried out on October 9.\"\nhttps://www.yinsfinance.com/article/1355711.shtml\n\nBackground knowledge:\n1. October 8 is the first trading day after the Chinese National Day holiday.  \n2. To open a new securities account in the Chinese stock market. \"Investors must submit an account opening application to a securities company with valid certification documents; after accepting the investor's account opening application, the securities company will carefully review the investor's valid identity documents and other account opening information to ensure that the information is true, accurate and complete; for qualified account opening applications, the securities company will submit the relevant account opening application information to China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation through the account opening system. After necessary review, China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation will assign a number and feedback the securities account number to the securities company, and the securities company will print the securities account card and give it to the investor. At this point, the securities account opening procedures are completed. After opening a securities account, investors can entrust the securities company to participate in securities trading.\" \nhttp://www.chinaclear.cn/zdjs/zjzhfw/201307/233edd7d0ca1407580ba927225efe787.shtml\n\n\n",
