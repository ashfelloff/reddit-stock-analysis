The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue & total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev & eq combined\n\n3. Third round, consistency. Any \"weird\" financials, inconsistencies are tossed\n\n4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics\n\n5. Fifth leaves us with around 50.

I think that's explained by it was originally issued at a much higher than fair price to maximize capital, lots of stocks especially small do it like that. \\*And\\* they also had shrinking income -> negative going into that stretch down you're talking about.

Also Trump winning will cause this stock to randomly sell off over the next 4 years as he berates Bezos in public and works behind the scenes to screw Amazon over.
