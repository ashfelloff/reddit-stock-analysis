  "selftext": "This is a nuclear energy co. that Sam Altman initially seed funded. Price went up over 100% in past 5 days ($9 to $22) after increased interest in AI turning to nuclear energy sources. The company looks good and is/was close to having a contract with the Air Force and has received permits to build in ID . But Cathie Wood sold her shares today, (and bought shares in another NE co. - BWXT) and price dropped to $20 but was as low as $18.50. Do you think this signals a large sell-off after initial surge? Price target (old?I) is around $10.  I'm new to this! I love this sector but don't want to get in too early.",
