As climate change accelerates droughts and sea levels rise, clean fresh water becomes more of a rarity. The most recent example of this is the fight between the states with access to the Colorado River—there wasn’t enough water to go around for both the farms and civilians, so they’ve had to ration it. \n\nI invested in various types of companies, but it was generally around water infrastructure like pumping and filtration systems. The US also has a very old water infrastructure system that’s in need of repair, so I tried to get in early at companies like XYL, AWK, PNR, and MWA.

I am a bit more leery of HIMS; I will watch their short-term price movement closely. With that said, I think both have long-term growth potential in line exceeding just about any stock.\n\n\nAnother stock I'm heavily invested in is EGY. With a recent purchase and subsequent stall in dividend and reversion of share buybacks noted, Vaalco was cruising towards decent revenue growth. I think the next couple/few quarters will produce ups and downs while they get Svenska's assets acclimated to their model. After that, I'm hopeful that can continue their base production along the same rise as it were, while reaping the benefits of a regional powerhouse that could grow exponentially (again, relatively speaking).",
