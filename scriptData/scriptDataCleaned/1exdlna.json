So during COVID the wealthy got this windfall of money in various ways, there was no discernible interest rate so it found its way into every asset. High rates now, lots of money and cash, they are aggressively buying bonds as well. As we get into a rate cutting cycle that money that's in money markets and some of it that's in bonds is going to find its way into other assets. I totally get that the average guy that's making $40 or 50K a year is struggling right now and it's easy to think the economy is in shambles when that's your friend circle, the thing is, the wealthy are still doing just fine. Next year is looking to be another year of asset accumulation, the real question with Nvidia is how long does the AI narrative last because as long as it does, as long as they keep up this growth and this story, there's plenty of money to chase it even if you don't personally have very much.",

Even if it be correct that market trends opposite of OI, it‚Äôs more important to get short-term directions correct than long-term.
