Their electric cars are cheaper upfront as you don't have to pay for the battery which is most of the cost of evs. Its like $10,000 usd off compared to other brands. Instead you lease the battery. In china starting in march there are mandatory battery checks and you must be in compliance, with nio you can always just swap to a new one. They offer battery swap stations which in 3 mins you can swap your car battery for a fully charged one. Their sales are heavily increasing along with profit margins on last earnings a few days ago, even in the intense ev price wars going on. The swap stations also alone generates 200k profit usd per station/year as it stabilizes the energy grids in china. Dubai/Saudi Arabia heavily investing. Multiple partners. Several thousand patents.

There was an offhand comment a while ago that a station they built in Denmark could generate $200k in profit by stabilizing their grid\n\nHow has that been working out? [This year they basically closed shop in Denmark after selling under 100 cars in 2 years](https://fdm-dk.translate.goog/nyheder/nyt-om-biler/2024-03-ambitioes-kineser-gaar-dvale-danmark?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=da&_x_tr_pto=wapp)\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that Nio’s best source of profit has been selling shares to stupid American investors as they’ve had some pretty crazy dilution, doubling the shares outstanding since covid\n\nSo to recap, losing $10,000+ every car they sell, and they dump shares like crazy. And their #1 country for sales has an economy that’s in the shitter and getting worse. Real winner\n\nEdit: math was wrong because I’m an idiot, they are losing $10k per car not $100k per car",
