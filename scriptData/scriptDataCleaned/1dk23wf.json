They also don’t have a large market cap just a high stock price due to their smaller float. \n\n$MU has earnings next week if it's good we can get a good move up like $NVDA had initially during the start of this crazy run.\n\n$ARM has no history so people can be playing the upside future.\n\n\nWhat are you all looking at as the next big mover ?",

Nvidia won't 10x again, microsoft won't 10x again, but a smaller player like AMD who is getting shafted right now might do. For the space sector, most public space companies have around 1B or less market cap and are risky buys, but do have the opportunity to grow substantially if the demand increases. But to make a sizable amount of money off of these, the earlier you invest the better, if you accept the risk that comes with it.",

Utilizing an expensive LLM to generate billions of random molecules doesn't seem to add much to existing algorithms. It may be somewhat useful for academics that are exploring completely unknown biochemical pathways that will eventually open up new categories of drugs to the private sector, but these researchers will also be limited by the amount of funding they can get to research the limitless number of AI-generated molecules, most of which are probably useless. \n\nMoreover, AI can do little to reduce risk of unintended consequences of a treatment because it is by definition limited by the available data. Once a new drug is in the human body, it is at the mercy of potentially billions of interactions that no existing data exists to feed into predictive algorithms. The recent failures of drug candidates from companies like Benevolent AI show that not even molecules showing early stage success with AI design are safe from late stage failure due to unforeseen interactions, which is even more devastating for a drug startup.",

While I don't fully buy into the value proposition of a full blown superapp in the US, I do think something new could emerge out of the combination of social networking, fintech, e-commerce, and various gig economy apps like Uber and Doordash, with an AI wrapper around all of it.\n\nI don't think any of this is really investible yet, just something to watch and be aware of.\n\nFor investible assets right now, I'm shifting more of my portfolio into Tesla and Palantir. Palantir, I think, may be ready to jump into the high 20s or low 30s as its new trading range. Tesla is a bit trickier but I think with the pay package voted on and out of the way, that better times must be coming. Encouragingly, Elon didn't sabotage the last earnings call, so maybe those will finally start going well.\n\nOne thought I've had on Tesla is the possibility that they could eventually divest the low margin auto business.
