I’m also prepared to bail if something geopolitical happened to supply chains that would reverse inflation. Any serious downside to treasuries would have an initial panic rally before inflation fears kick in. Holding more than 6 months would be risky, best to have no leverage by next june. \n\nedit: forgot to mention you want to bail if trump wins, its not likely but gold and cash will be your friend if that plays out. After rate cuts resume in a Trump 2025/26 world during the next hike cycle, it would be safe to buy again. ",

I suggest you go chart USCS vs XLY instead of giving your naked opinion on things. **Spoiler alert, XLY is a proxy for retail spending.**\n\n>It's a proxy for equity values of retailers.\n\nNot, it's the **actual** equity value of a group of retailer equities. There's no proxy about it. [You can look at the holdings here if you're curious.](https://www.sectorspdrs.com/mainfund/xly)\n\nNow, I don't want to fully blow your mind but equity values of retailers go up when they become more profitable (which they do by selling things to consumers - that's called \"retailing\").\n\nDespite me saying I'm not using the companies to define the macro environment, you want to ask me about their specifics?\n\nI guess your wall of Google'd or ChatGTP questions is supposed to be intimidating?\n\nTell you what. I'll go through each one just for you because you're my special little guy.\n\n>Did you consider that inflation itself is built into revenue growth? \n\nNot really clear what you mean with the terms of your question. My contention is that inflation causes revenue growth until prices become too high and consumers reject them. This is known as supply and demand.\n\n>Did you adjust for that? \n\nDid I adjust what for what? You want me to pull inflation adjusted revenues for DLTR and DG? Why?\n\nGoodness, you don't think revenues were the issue, do you? \n\nUh-oh. Someone is bullshitting. You didn't even check their earnings reports did you? The projections were the real problem (again, which cited waning consumer demand)\n\n>Did you also unitize at the same store level? \n\nDid I unitize what? Revenues per store for both companies? Why the hell would I do that?\n\nAgain, I'm trying to talk about macroeconomics, not two companies and certainly not the individual stores of each of the companies.\n\n>Did you determine whether they gained or lost market share? \n\nOver what period? Versus which retailers? Here. Let me find that for you. Oh, look. [The market share for DG was stable.](https://csimarket.com/stocks/competitionSEG2.php?code=DG). It's a stupid question if you're trying to disprove my point.\n\nYou think market share of a retailer can't decline when they lose revenue because they're specific demographic of customer can't buy anything?\n\nIf you want to find DLTR's market share, go do it yourself.\n\nI'll be here looking for your point.\n\n>Margin management? \n\nWhat specifically about margin management? You seem to just be throwing out some list of words ChatGPT gave you. \"Chat GPT, make it sound like I know what I'm talking about when it comes to a company's fundamentals.\"\n\n>E-commerce vs brick and mortar? \n\nWhat do you mean? You want me to compare the market share of e-commerce retailers vs. brick and mortar retailers? Why? Obviously, it's growing. \n\nYou think it suddenly e-commerce competition blasted off last quarter vs. every other quarter in the last few years and then some e-commerce company scooped up all of the DG and DLTR customer in Q2 of this year?\n\n>On the macro side, did you account for income growth when looking at levels of debt? \n\nAnother muddy question. Did I compare income growth to personal savings rate? Income levels to debt levels? Debt to GDP?\n\nHere.

This definition isn’t perfect, but it describes almost every downturn since World War II.\n\nWith expectations of low or even negative growth for the first two quarters of 2022, President Biden’s Council of Economic Advisers has been trying to blunt the news by disavowing this textbook definition. It is “neither the official definition nor the way economists evaluate the state of the business cycle,” reads a post on the White House website.
