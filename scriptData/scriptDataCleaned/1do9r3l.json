  "selftext": "I’m a big believer in rivian and have confidence it will rise long term, but this made me look at car company historical stocks… \n\nIt seems cars are as ubiquitous as many tech we see today but why do they perform with such mediocrity compared to tech companies? I understand the competition is fierce there but even very reputable companies such as Honda appear to just not have strong growth over the past 5-10 years?\n\nEdit: is the attraction in car company stocks the dividend yield?",

Tesla will either figure out how to make humanoid robots do something useful at scale or they won't. \n\nThe energy storage thing is the least risky and is already growing quite nicely. Not enough to offset stalled car market. Solving FSD and making robots do something useful are two sides of the same coin and are approaching a type of AGI, and if they can solve it in short order, they will be way ahead of their competitors. \n\nCan they use this to make money? The robotaxi market will need to develop. I don't see everyone just giving up their autos in the first decade. But if it grows at a nice clip, it could be a money maker for them, and they appear to be way ahead there with a general solution (other solutions are geo-bound).\n\nThe robot thing - if I could buy a robot for $10,000 that would do chores for me around the house, I would probably bite. But these will most likely end up doing repetitive tasks in factories for a while, where a robot can work nearly 24 hours a day and replace 3 shifts of workers, and also work weekends. The problem set in a factory is much more limited, so it will be easier to train for these sorts of environments. \n\nThe cars sold without FSD to mass market are going to be squeezed by the ICE market and by cheap electrics from China. They will also need to enter the cheap cars market if they want to scale up to 20 million cars - the luxury market is about tapped out.\n\nThe auto portion of Tesla will stay around, I think, and probably be decently strong for Tesla, but don't expect them to hit it out of the park unless they can make the side hustles work bigly.",

      "body": "Car companies are low profit margins to begin with, it is a highly competitive industry, not exactly a recurring revenue source (unless you count people who lease cars constantly, but even then that's every 3 years or so), huge overhead costs (especially if the factory is unionized), recalls/lawsuits and just about all car manufacturers use independently owned dealships to sell their cars. Sure you can buy a Ford from their website, but most likely you're going to a dealship to buy a car from them...\n\nNow Tesla is unique in the fact that they also have software in the car they charge for. Software as a service  (SAS) is great source or recurring revenue. They also own the dealerships they sell their cars at, so they sell directly to their customers. They also have giga factories they built to build their cars. \n\nNow if the big auto manufacturers can get into, these facets of the game, it will increase their margins. You would need to see if Rivian is built more like Tesla or the run of the mill auto manufacturer as far as their business model goes... last I checked Rivian is wildly unprofitable per car they sell, hell most auto manufacturers who make electric cars are unprofitable at the moment. Tesla right now is far ahead of the competition because they make good margins on their cars, better than the traditional auto industry. \n\nI hope this information helps.",
