  "selftext": "To all the shamers, naysayers, lurkers, and boyfriends.  Yall may remember my post on how I lost $30K in a few hours. Im here to tell you in a few seconds on how it will all come back and some.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fuxeiy/30k\\_500\\_in\\_a\\_few\\_hours\\_call\\_me\\_to\\_inverse\\_me\\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1fuxeiy/30k_500_in_a_few_hours_call_me_to_inverse_me_next/)\n\nBelieve me I don't feel great about it. I feel even less about this sub as I thought we were here to make plays. $30K really isn't shit.. I know that buys a lot of bublicious vape juice for you spare bedroom dwellers but chill.\n\nI thought about throwing in another 5K this week but I honestly want to show the lads and laddets here that cumbacks are still possible. I had fellow degens messaging me that they too lost some coin that day and how torn they are, how they feel so lost and I cant blame them. Anyway I will be posting weekly updates or Ad Hoc. As my previous post stated I was originally trying to take a portion of my new car money and flip it. While I can still go buy the car it has not yet come out. Its a 2025 model refresh and at over $100k I thought it would be nice if the market paid for it. Anyways. The dual mandate here is first, recover my losses and second, show to the fellow degens that you can come back from the low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s519wncp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da821ed4dd2cf8a022435ff9c29960f603747606\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/khvslocp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d48d347fc5887c4423a4f31cf4b0b718940b02f4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3b20ocp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfcf7e654f273b177beeba60b8740b541a9c8587\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ha930ocp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b71389f55578bc3bd43be2344b2a66a8edbefa6b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n9a6vjdp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80f521f50e6ac05c0ed3e0c1d2307444638848e4\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/65u4qocp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=284a552bbc201d7c9fcff51feeddfe6bd986f802\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xqkmrncp67ud1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=565a65813ae04345f260d730a48dce7fe19d5e2d\n\n",
