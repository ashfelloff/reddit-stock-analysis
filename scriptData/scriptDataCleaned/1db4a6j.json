  "selftext": "If you look back at my post from 16 days ago you will see I was questioning buying $1600 call options for NVIDIA at the cheap price of $18 per call. I got called crazy and dumb by fellow redditors. Looking back I won’t listen to what others have to say because just two days ago I got curious and checked and saw they happened to be trading around $85 in the recent run by NVIDIA. Moral of the story if the options are cheap and you have a gut feeling that a catalyst may temporarily swing the price of the call option then just go ahead and get some. The catalyst I honestly had in mind was the 10-1 stock split which still hasn’t occurred yet. I am the type of individual who overthinks everything, but maybe just maybe one of these days I will learn to trust my gut. It ends up being right most of the time!",
