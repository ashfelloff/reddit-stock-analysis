I'm moving to Andalusia next year where they abolished wealth taxes because they're bullshit taxes on net assets and Andorra is too damn cold.\n\nFor their short sighted greed of taking 1% of worldwide net assets every year, they lose billions in income/dividend and capital gains tax from the people that left.
