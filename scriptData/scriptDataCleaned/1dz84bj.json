  "score": 822,
  "selftext": "TDOC went from $300 in Feb 2021 to $9 today, and can go lower, just look at Allbirds. Fired CEO of past 15 years who was inept and absolutely botched Livongo/Teladoc merger. New CEO seems unlikely to be able to fix the mess. President was fired last week. Mass exodus of employees going to digital health startups who then steal market share. No advancements in AI. Insane marketing overspend for BetterHelp.\n\nStock at all time low and next earnings report 7/23.\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\n",

I wasn’t happy when TDOC bought them out however. I have a chronic illness and at one point had to go to the doctors office very regularly. Due to this I knew the limitations of virtual healthcare and thought it wasn’t a great idea. \n\nNever the less I held TDOC. I remember the day it hit $307 and I was up 30k on the stock. I told myself this looks so unnatural and that I should sell but unfortunately I didn’t. You all know the story from there. Sadly I didn’t set a stop loss above my buy in price to at least take out my initial investment so I’m down 90ish percent on this stock and I really don’t see a rebound unless a miracle happens. I’m so in the red I might as well ride it out to 0 or hope for some good news. \n\nHuge bummer for me but a big lesson learned",
