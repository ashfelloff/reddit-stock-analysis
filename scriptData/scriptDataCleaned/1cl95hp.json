If you actually knew what your were talking about, you would already know this.\n\nThe *global* BEV sales volume crown was given back to Tesla in Q1, even though it was a down quarter for Tesla. That’s because BYD’s global BEV sales went down much further. But still, they don’t really compete against each other the way you are portraying it. And again, you don’t understand the Chinese market.",

Teslas from the plant are sold in china and also exported, what's the damn point? Look at Tesla sales in China directly and be done with it. \n\nYes I know you meant global and I'm saying that byd as a brand that primarily delivers in the east asian region managed to beat and compete with Tesla, an internationally operating company. They compete, Tesla not having a competitive product does not mean that Tesla is out of the competition.\n\nYou can pull more obscure numbers out and somehow point here and there by proxy, but at the end of the day tesla simply is not doing well currently and missing expectations.",

It's just less likely when you have such a large, efficient operation. As much as this board hates Musk/TSLA, they are still incredibly profitable. They actually make money on their cars (approx $15k per vehicle) and they do have some of the most sophisticated production techniques in the world. \n\nContrast that to GM/Ford that lose insane amounts of money on each EV they sell. They are literally using SUV/Truck money to subsdizie their EV sales to meet EPA targets. Otherwise they would have already folded.\n\nHowever, there is always a chance that TSLA ends up in the EV graveyard.
