  "selftext": "My BRK.A $186 buy order ended up filling but at $648k... Phoned my broker they said it hit NYSE and I actually own the share. This is in my TFSA and it took out margin/negative amount in the account to buy it. Don't actually have the money to buy it. You are not allowed to have margin on a TFSA. The brokers system messed up... Would never think I would be able to say I am a BRK.A holder\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2undfbjn8g4d1.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d7163ee53ecdb65327904cf349d6c778cf115a2\n\n**Update**: Just checked my account this morning and everything on my account went back to normal(how my account was before the BRK.A trade was filled).",

When you see a 99% drop in a stock like that it's basically a screw up in the market.  That price is only going to be on the top of the book for a split second and you are never going to be able to react in time to get that as a human reacting and placing the order.  There are HFTs lined up with colocated servers and millisecond latency and you will never beat them.  Furthermore, if you did somehow manage to get the trade executed at $0.13 the exchange knows this is a glitch and whoever sold you the shares will just ask to DK the trade, and the exchange will do this 100% of the time.",

The market rules just generally allow for trades that are obvious mistakes like that to get cancelled because nobody would want to trade if losing over $500k was as easy as a typo.\n\nIn OPs case, he will not get the trade reversed because he placed a market order and it was filled at a fair market price.  That's really the central question that the exchange will look at to determine if it can be reversed.  Was the trade executed at a fair market price?  So long as it was, even if you placed the trade by mistake, you have a chance to instantly reverse that mistake for minimal losses.",
