  "selftext": "Hello everyone\n\nI am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.\n\nOne allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [\"John Barnett found dead in US\"](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:\n\n*\"In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.\"*\n\nHe also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. \n\nAnother Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:\n\n\t*\"A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer “absolutely” has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*\n\n*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*\n\n*“I have raised these issues over three years,” he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing’s safety culture. “I was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.”*\n\nSincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.\n\n**TESLA'S whistleblower**\n\nOn a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article \"[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.\n\nYet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.\n\nOverall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:\n\n* Privacy data breach\n* Cybertruck details and problems\n* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)\n* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud\n\n**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.\n\n**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article \"[\"A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws\"](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate\"](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)\n\n**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: \"[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors\"](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:\n\n*Erik Larsen\\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: “I often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.”*\n\n*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. “I guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,” thought service technician Borja Clausen\\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\\* wrote: “I experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.”*\n\nReuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [\"Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective\"](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) \n\nAgain, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:\n\n*\"Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts – the left and right drive axles – and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*\n\n*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.\"*\n\nA similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)\n\n**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)\n\n* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *“Where you put stuff in a financial statement matters,” she said. “If I’m taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I’m moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it’s also not as transparent about the quality of the product.”*\n* accountancy of new car sales: \"*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of “used” cars to “new” in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla’s delivery numbers, they said, though they didn’t try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. \"*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better\"\n* inventories value assessment: \"*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from “scrap” to “work in progress.” Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.\"* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  \n\nIt seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. \n\nHandelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.\n\nWhy do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?\n\n&#x200B;",
