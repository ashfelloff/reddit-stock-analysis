There's no ‚Äûintrinsic value‚Äù to water any more than there is to gold. Both are valued for reasons: water helps you stay alive, gold (or money in general) helps society move forward ‚Äî you can sell your product (e.g. clothes) and buy mine (e.g. food).\n\nIf we figured out a way to stay alive without having to drink water, then it would lose its ‚Äûintrinsic‚Äù value (or if everyone had access to an ocean of drinking water). It could be the case for an alien.\n\nWithout money we'd most likely be stuck in very primitive societies. If the creation of a thriving civilization has less value to you than simply staying alive (like an animal), then you may be too narrow-minded.\n\nNote that I'm not saying water has no value at all; it's just that it's not inherently ‚Äûbetter‚Äù than any other thing ‚Äî everything is valuable *for a reason* or *for certain purpose* (well, maybe except for intelligent beings in general ‚Äî at least in my opinion ‚Äî but that gets too philosophical).",
