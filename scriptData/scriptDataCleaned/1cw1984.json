Tariffs are paid by the importing business.\n\nBut as time went on, people just accepted and forgot about it.\n\nThen Biden came into office and thought for sure he would drop the idiotic tariffs. But it has become less about economics and more about “we need to punish China” Again, yes, tariffs cause less manufacturing demand from China but it hurts American business and consumers maybe more.\n\nNow it seems like both parties are using harsh tariffs as almost bragging rights.",
