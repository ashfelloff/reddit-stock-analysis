  "selftext": "So the stock was down 5 days in a row and down 5%.  I figured that was a big drop. It would rebound 2% or so. \n\nI was correct however I was off by 1 day and 0.5% that means 2/3 green days on a weekly call and I am down $$. I set a profit target of 40k i didn’t hit it. Really wishing I set a lower profit target because this was worth 38k lol.\n\nWhen I make money on these Yolo’s I get 50-100 up votes if this goes to 0 i get 900+ up votes and hundreds of comments. \n\nO.5% i make money 1-2% Friday i make a lot. \n\nTho for 0 dte it is best to sell by 11 am.
