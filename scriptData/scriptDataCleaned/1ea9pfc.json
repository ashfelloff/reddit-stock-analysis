  "title": "\"This outage showed how many services depend on us\" – Will CrowdStrike win the title of Short of the Year?",
  "score": 89,
  "selftext": "After people spent nights waiting for their flights and for healthcare, we still keep getting more and more \"good news\".\n\nFirst we got perfect crisis management from David Weston (VP), where he said about \"the broad economic and societal impacts reflect the use of CrowdStrike by enterprises that run many critical services\" - is it an even an apology or promotion lol?\n\nThen we got news about insider trading by the Chief Security Officer which happened on Monday (so before the outrage). And I also can predict all these legal battles which CrowdStrike would face with the latest US trends, already saw one of the outage case against them\n\nAnd along the way, the CrowdStrike's CEO (George Kurtz) was the CTO of McAfee in 2010, when the company suffered a similar outage. Guess it's just his career strategy or something\n\nAfter all these, do we still have hope on CrowdStrike? Or would it win the title of Short of the Year along with the The worst cyber event in human history?",
