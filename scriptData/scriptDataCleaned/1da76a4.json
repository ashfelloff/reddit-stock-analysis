          "body": "SAFER 'Lite' In Spending Bill Potentially Meaningful\n\nWeed Weekly summarizes each week's main developments, with key thoughts and considerations. Focus this issue is on the new FY25 House spending bill and the surprise inclusion of language reflecting a slimmed down version of SAFER. The key difference — which could be meaningful from a capital markets perspective — is the protection provided to all financial institutions vs specific to depository institutions.\n\nFrom an investment perspective — as we have written many times — the big factor that is depressing current multiples of US MSOs is the lack of institutional capital. This is due to the current legal status of cannabis and capital market stakeholders fears of federal prosecution.\n\nThis has resulted in US cannabis names only trading on the pink sheets, a lack of custodians for the stocks, and compliance departments at institutional investors reluctant to participate. While likely rescheduling to schedule 3 this year could help address this, we believe we also need to see other things like SAFER Banking passed and a likely new Cole Memo.\n\nWith regard to SAFER, there are a couple of issues. One, a vote on a standalone bill keeps getting held up, with the latest consensus being that it may not be until the lame-duck session post the election, at the earliest, if at all. Two, the current language of the standalone SAFER bill is specific to providing protections for depository institutions only, so unclear what this would mean for broader capital market participants such as investment banks, exchanges, and institutional investors.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there was a potentially meaningful development this week when a GOP House Committee presented its government 2025 fiscal year spending bill. Within this, there is an addition of what could be viewed as SAFER 'Lite'. Notable is that instead of providing protection to depository institutions only per the standalone, the language provides protections to all financial institutions, specifically saying, “none of the funds made available in this Act may be used to penalize a financial institution solely because the institution provides financial services [to a cannabis business].” In the cannabis businesses it lists, it is notable it includes both marijuana and hemp-derived cannabinoid products, i.e., hemp THC.\n\nIf we look at the definition of a financial institution from FinCEN, it includes 'banks', as well as 'brokers or dealers in securities'. Therefore, if this was ultimately to pass — there are a number of steps to still go through in the House, and we would also need to see it included in the Senate version — the broader reach for protections vs just depository institutions, alongside rescheduling, a likely new Cole Memo, and then almost certainly, new updated guidance from FinCEN could be sufficient incremental developments to finally open up capital markets activity.\n\nEncouragingly, the bill passed its first obstacle this week, with a vote in favor to move it to full committee, with a full committee vote next week, and then it will be sent to the House floor for a vote should it pass that. So watch this space.",
