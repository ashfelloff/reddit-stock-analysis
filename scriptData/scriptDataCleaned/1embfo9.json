I had figured it'd be 10 as well but I was surprised at how much under we came, especially since the flight was included in that price. We also got lightning lane every day. We had a blast. I'm not sure how the new lightning lane system works, but the old way (which apparently everybody hated) really worked out well for us. We rode everything we wanted to and didn't wait longer than 25 minutes for a ride and that was only for the first ride of the day which we didn't have a lightning lane for.\n\nWe probably could've saved a grand by driving from pa to fl but I'm not sure we would've survived that.",

Back then I don't remember much difference in pricing but that was a different time.\n\nI don't have a ton of firsthand experiences recently as our kids have been young so it's been mostly Disney.  This last trip was the first time our kids were old enough for Universal and it was great to get back there, but I don't remember it being any cheaper really.\n\nMaybe it's just because Universal's Express pass is SO outrageously expensive that it's not even a consideration, while Disney's Genie+ (LL now I guess) is just reasonable enough to be enticing to pay the upcharge.\n\nNo ILL's at Universal but honestly I would have preferred that option while we were there so we could've ridden Hagrid's Motorbike as the line was over 2 hours so we ended up skipping it.\n\nUniversal charges for park-hopping just like Disney does.\n\nEDIT: I just did a quick look and Universal is around $50 more expensive this month than Disney on the dates I looked, for just the entry ticket.  That easily covers the price of Genie+ and an ILL, but with the option at Disney to pay less if you don't want those things.",

We also get in-state discount on the parks and the resort.  \n\nGuess what? Going to Disney LAND 2nd weekend of September.  Already booked.  Again, a biz conference for me in Orange County, CA, so some of the stay in Dana Point is covered.\n\nGuess what else?  She wants to spend her fucking birthday (a big one) at Disney WORLD a month later in October.  It’s already booked for us too.\n\nYou know what *I* want?  A Viking 72C sportfishing yacht.  Am I gonna get that?  No.  I’m not.  Because I’m here.  And at Disney theme parks.  FML.",
