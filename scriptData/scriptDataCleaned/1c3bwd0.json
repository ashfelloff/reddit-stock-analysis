  "selftext": "Netflix earnings coming up this week on April 18th after hours. The stock is up about 33% YTD and 80% since 1 year ago. I see some gaps that need to be filled and its due for a small pullback. I predict it will drop 5-10% on earnings and will be buying puts right before market close on the 18th unless someone can change my mind.\n\nTell me why you think I'm wrong.\n\nBest regards\n\n",

I‚Äôve gotten fucked on 3 ER‚Äôs before this lol. everything I‚Äôm hearing about Netflix is bullish. their expectations are insanely high, idk how they will meet that EPS and revenue.. even if they do miss those expectations the guidance could come in higher then expected and our puts get fucked. I truly see Netflix eating shit on Thursday and I already got my puts but I‚Äôm going to buy a call or two as well just in case. \nI‚Äôd advise you guys do the same. Who‚Äôs got full conviction they are going to eat shit? And why? I‚Äôm not seeing anything too negative besides the high expectations, inflation making an impact on subscribers keeping their subscriptions, and their shitty shows.",
