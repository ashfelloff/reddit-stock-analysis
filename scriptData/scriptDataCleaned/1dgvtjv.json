The aircraft climbed to 3000 feet, entered a hold and returned to Honolulu for a safe landing.\n\n>According to ADS-B Data the aircraft descended normally through about 950 feet MSL at 05:12:31 with a sink rate of about 800-1000 fpm, at 05:12:47 however the aircraft is seen climbing through 875 feet MSL at a high climb rate.\n\n>What happened in these 16 seconds is described in an internal memo circulating in Southwest Airlines stating, that during the go around due to weather conditions the first officer, pilot flying, inadvertently pushed the control column forward while monitoring the power settings causing the aircraft to descend to about 400 feet MSL before the aircraft started climbing again.\n\n>The airline stated that the occurrence has been handled by the SMS (Safety Management System). The FAA is investigating the occurrence.\n\nOh look another Boeing Nothingburger",

The \"plunge\" was just a normal landing for most of that altitude loss and then it accidentally dipped down a bit from 1000-400.

I assume serious investors realizes occasional mechanical failures are unavoidable. \n\nGiven they have a widely used producf and already established manufacturing channels you shpuld base your investment strategies in their management failures not their mechanical ones\n\nLittle headlines like these arent a good thing to base puts on.
