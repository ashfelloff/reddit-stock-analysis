  "selftext": "Stock just posted 100%+ revenue growth for fiscal 2024 and guided for another 80-100% growth in 2025. Margins contracted slightly, though the CEO had already mentioned multiple times this year that margins were going to fall as they looked to rapidly grow revenue and market share. He‚Äôs also guided for margins to steadily tick back up in the coming quarters.\n\nThe stock cratered 18% this morning and is down 55% from highs. They‚Äôre now sitting at a PE of 24, and forward PE of 15. \n\nI don‚Äôt hold any, but am truly scratching my head at this valuation and debating about buying a bunch of shares or some LEAPs in the coming months. They‚Äôre a fast growing company with low debt and healthy margins. In an industry that‚Äôs expected to grow at a double digit CAGR for the foreseeable future.\n\nDo people expect margins to keep falling? Or revenue to start declining in the next year? I don‚Äôt see how else you‚Äôd have a company that‚Äôs doubling its revenue YoY trading at such a ridiculously cheap valuation with such sound fundamentals. ",

      "body": "Great post. Thank you. This one hurt too many investors, is overdone, and the stock's oversold. They already guided the profit margins will be slightly higher this quarter (Q1FY25) than what they just reported this last quarter (Q4FY24). They ended FY24 with 14.1 percent and plan to stay within the 14-17 percent. They also guide conservatively at the beginning of the FY as shown by last few years initial fiscal year guidances. \n\nWhile it's a low margin sector, they've beefed up their assets by expanding mfg. facilities, been profitable since inception, have several patents, are family founded and founder led, own stakes in their supplier companies, have three decades of industry expertise and partnerships, and proven they are far ahead of any chip industry geopolitical and regulatory risks. Their backorders continue to be at record highs and their hyperscaler customer demand is astounding as MSFT, META, NVDA, TSLA, AMZN, and GOOGL just reaffirmed on their ER calls with their AI infra capex spend. The DOE is even a customer. So yes, the company is undervalued 60 percent off the highs, with a 11 forward PE and market cap below next year's revenue guidance--which was astounding as well as what they are about to do for their industry with DLC.",
