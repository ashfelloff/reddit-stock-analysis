          "body": "In simple terms - when you buy a Put, you are buying the option to sell at a specified price at a future date. In this case, that specified price (or strike price) is $110 and that future date is August 2nd. When you buy options you have to pay a premium for the option. In this case, OP paid an average of $0.97 per share per contract. Each contract represents 100 shares of the underlying company. Thus, $0.97x 100 shares x 100contracts = $9,700 total spent on the premiums (the cost of the option).\n\nOP bought these options on June 20 when the price was at its 52 weeks high. Keep in mind the options contracts have a $110 strike. So they are out of the money. Because they are essentially worthless. No one would exercise a contract to sell at $110 when the market is $140+. That is why OP was able to buy the options for so cheap.\n\nSo as the price of the underlying stock fell on the 20th and continued to fall on the 21st The $110 strike price is becoming more realistic. Meaning that OP's contracts at a $110 strike price become more valuable. Not because OP can execute the contracts, they are still out of the money, but the premium on those contracts are worth more. That is what the market price of $2.58 is reflecting. That $2.58 per share per contract. Thus, $2.58 x 100 shares x 100 contracts = $25,800 is what OP would receive if they sold their option contract at that market price. $25,800 - $9,700 = $16,100 profit for OP.\n\nIn short, the closer the stock price gets to strike price on OP's contracts, the more valuable they become. OP wants the price to continue to move down towards or past their strike price. Imagine, if the stock price fell to $105, OP's right to sell the stock becomes very valuable because they are able to sell your shares for more than the market is offering. If they stock price continues to fall OP will have two choices. 1) hold on the the options and sell any shares they have at the $110 strike price or 2) sell the contracts at whatever prevailing market premium.\n\nHope that helps!",
