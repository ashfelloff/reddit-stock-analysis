          "body": "China's dilemma isn't that they can't pump it. It's about how to pump it in a way that benefits the population the most. A big chunk of Chinese economy is still tied to state capital, therefore big economy is not equivalent to very prosperous citizens at the individual level. Materially most people are well off, financially not so much, except people born in the first and second tier cities with bloated property valuations. The average citizens for decades could not easily invest abroad due to capital control, and since they are also skeptical of their own stock market, their surplus was mostly invested into properties sitting empty which had been busted for a few years now. \n\nChina is now running against time. Whatever measures they will implement, cannot be too late, and also cannot be structurally ineffective. The easiest way of course is to pump the Chinese stock market, but first they need to get their citizens trust back into the stock market. A highly volatile stock market does not inspire trust. So my hypothesis is that they will start with some small support to calm the stock market i.e. the so called rug pull is not going to be 100% down to where it was before the \"buy the news\" pump by the market. The government itself has not pumped yet but eventually will. I predict later Q4 2024 leading to Chinese New Year for the feel good timing.",

I know the operate under capitalism as per dictionary definition, but since they call themselves communist they could always decide to nationalize something or something \"doesn't align with communist values\" and fuck the company you're invested in. Seems too risky simply for the reason they call themselves communist imo. \n\nAlthough I would find it hilarious if someone got super rich on the stock market of a country which calls itself communist.
