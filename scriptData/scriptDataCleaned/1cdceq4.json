  "selftext": "Today, I trusted my gut after months of contemplating, and I liquidated my entire portfolio. Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:\n\n* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.\n* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say \"wow, my savings are losing value\"; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to. Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up. When you lose 25% of your purchasing power and live paycheck to paycheck, you are forced to adjust your lifestyle or take on incremental debt. \n   * Off the last bullet, [credit card debt is at an all time high](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-debt-record-high/), and [credit card delinquency is worst on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/credit-card-delinquency-rates-were-worst-on-record-in-fed-study?embedded-checkout=true). Here are some quick stats: 49% of credit card holders carry a balance month to month, credit card delinquencies have soared more than 50% in the past year, and 6.4% of all accounts are now 90 days past due, and the average credit card annual percentage rate is at a record 20.74%.\n   * Further, [buy now pay later (\"BNPL\") service usage hit an all time high this past holiday season](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/21/buy-now-pay-later-shoppers-deal-with-holiday-debt.html%23:~:text%3DDuring%2520the%2520season%252C%2520buy%2520now,nearly%252043%2525%252C%2520Adobe%2520said.&ved=2ahUKEwicy7K_9N6FAxVAhIkEHRLMB58QFnoECA8QAw&usg=AOvVaw0Gm5tpilHUFvMEbNeu8NnN). \n   * Finally, [78.9% of federal student loan balances are on forbearance or default status as of 4/18/2024 which accounts for 71.5% of borrowers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/).\n* [Basics like food are up multiples](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58350). No need to explain further, we have all been to the grocery store and felt this.\n* Homes are completely unaffordable / [the cost of buying a home has hit an all time high](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1090/redfin-reports-buying-a-home-costs-more-than-ever-with), as such, home ownership is becoming less feasible and millennials / Gen Z are not building equity in what has historically been American's most valuable asset.\n* [Child care is skyrocketing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-threat-that-high-childcare-costs-pose-to-the-us-economy-124248273.html). The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-22986/child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf-program) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income; however, that figure is roughly 24%. [Bank of America said the average childcare payment per household has risen over 30% since 2019 for its customers](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.html). We are at a point where some families are determining if they are better off to become a single income household versus a dual income household with child care.\n* While the USD still remains the most dominant force (by a significant margin), regardless of opinion on sanctions, sanctions typically lead to weakening the USD. Further, nations are considering moving away from the USD more now than ever before. So much so that [political candidates are discussing potential penalties for nations that move away from the USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize?embedded-checkout=true). \n* [GDP missed estimates this morning at 1.6% versus estimates of 2.2%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/us-gdp-first-quarter-report).\n* Finally, not to mention all of the chaos going on in the world right now. Conflict in Eastern Europe, conflict in the Middle East, the US border crisis, China & Taiwan, etc.\n\nAll the while, we are being told that everything is fine! There is nothing to worry about! This is the soft landing we have been looking for, and inflation is normalizing...right? I mean even the stock market recently hit an all time high. [Janet Yellen said it herself today, despite the GDP miss, the US economy is firing on all cylinders](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/gdp-report-first-quarter-numbers-expected-to-show-strong-u-s-growth-continuing/card/yellen-says-u-s-economy-firing-on-all-cylanders-despite-gdp-miss-jumOOgWIaDKmTFzTj2ub). I know this is my opinion, but I am looking around and things are not adding up. It doesn't make sense, and I do not think that this is sustainable. \n\nThank you for reading, I look forward to seeing other's opinions.",

But then don't go and dump it into something stupid like silver or pork bellies.  Think about a business that could work for you, either as a silent partner or a garage-based sole proprietorship, and invest in yourself.

No matter how much the industry or too wealthy individuals complain, they all eventually fall in line and pay up. \n\nThe benefits of propping up middle class are immense and quite frankly immeasurable. Money in the hands of middle class working citizens means direct savings or expenditures. Which then is money in the pockets of corporations. OTOH, you give tax breaks to corporations and rich people and they will happily buy islands or invest where the cost of production is lowest. Capitalism doesn’t care about America or rest of the world. The only undisputed principle of capitalism is ‘highest ROI’. No corporate or capitalist ever does anything out of the goodness of their hearts. In fact, corporations and these people at the top will ruin and squeeze every last cent of anything breathing because of simple greed. That’s what made them what they are. You expect a Bezos or Musk or the Sacklers to ever do anything remotely resembling public interest? Everything else is pure Chutzpah. \n\nReg your point about bringing back manufacturing and other jobs to America, that ship sailed long long ago. The only way any jobs are coming back to America are with government intervention for there is simply no incentive large enough for businesses to do so. \n\nMiddle class is the one that lifts top and bottom at the same time. And that’s the way it has always been.",

Another thing is that the dollar is the universal currency, so it's crazy how we can print money and inflation dissipates worldwide.

Unfortunately, it's very difficult to predict when the market will crash; personally, I just follow the trend.

Its not going to come down to few paragraph comments, after all economy is sum of its transactions by end of the day.\n\nWhat almost everyone is ignoring in random comments is increase in productivity, its usually not just 10% increase but in many industries its even numbers like 10000%.\n\nJust 20 years ago for example enginners might not even had a god damn computers in their company, not to talk how long it will take to draw and calculate by hand what can be easily done with an application, if you run into problem, you had to walk after pen and paper, then sit down and write a letter, and then go personally mail it. Now many problems can be solved anywhere with a smartphone and google, that already unknown to younger people increased ones productivity by shitload.\n\nTechnology has been huge factor to everything including USA army power and their domination of the world.\n\nAnother factor is loan based economy, company A and B is1 billion dollar big, company A does nothing ,earns what he always earns, company B takes 5 billion dollar loan and opens up 5 factories, earns 5x more and is now 5x bigger than company A and eating its market share. Countries also do stuff like that on larger scale. In various ways we are allowed to expand and grow today, we don't have to wait until we actually have the money to do so which would be way longer.\n\nAnother factor is birth rate, 1950s there were 150 mil population in USA, now there is 340 mil, not to mention the world.\n\nAnother factor is exploitation, we are getting smarter and more clever at exploiting natural resources of other countries plus before you needed to hire locally and pay local expensive wages, nowadays an Indian will do pretty much any highly skilled and highly educated job for like a dollar a day or something.\n\nRemember that many companies are either expanding or have expansion potential, if a company hits a Billion people market in India or billion people market in China it can sky rocket the entire companies revenue and it happens more often than one thinks ''Why is Netflix up if we all said we quit it? Oh India''.",

You could make 10 posts explaining how the money is printed, where its going and how its working, its that complicated, on top of that there will always be money printed, also its nothing new, we started printing money in 18th century and there are few questionable prints in 19th century, yeah i am talking more than 200 years ago, even before 2 world wars, everyone is still around.\n\nAmericans losing 25% purchasing power, this is also not actually easy data to come by and will have to extract it yourself, because all i can find is talking about purchasing power of 1$, ignoring the fact that you now make more dollars than decades before. But lets assume this is true, its not the mega caps, SPY index and what not suffering, its going to be the small businesses and little guys as always. So a person is not going to buy this and that, he is still going to buy smartphone and subscribe to Netflix even though he has 25% less purchasing power. Bigger companies can be both fine and grow, we all want the same hype stuff not the boring stuff nobody cares about.\n\nEveryone has much debt reee, its not bad, it can show slowdown in the future or people will manage to acquire even more debt, pretty much every richest country has actual problem with its masses being in credit card debt and other loans, but as we already know, loans fuel the economy, that is why we went up so much in stocks by end of the day.\n\nFood inflated, could also write a long paragraph, but also what exactly is that suppose to crash? Food inflated 100% at least 3 times in my lifetime, we still going stronger than ever.\n\nHomes are unafordable and childcare is expensive - how are these arguments for stock market exactly? And don't say 2008 because it was because of junk loans causing chain bankruptcies, not housing market itself.\n\nUS dollar is possibly going to get lower? I mean the poster left arguments that can be interpreted as its going to be stronger than ever, they will even fight for its dominance.\n\nGPD a bit lower than expected but still growing, so we keep growing, just a tad bit slower. Economy is in upwards swing here.\n\nAll the wars in Middle east, Eastern Europe and China, Taiwan. This is how you know people here don't study the economy, wars will enrich us and our economy, given that we actually win them. I don't see how is this argument related to stock market and its crashes or growth that much.\n\nIts not that strong of a case if you think for it for 5 minutes.\n\nIn my opinion going back to productivity growth, AI has insane potential and if it gets integrated in every day life and all sorts of work, we are looking at another insane productivity and growth. AI can already proof reading for gramatical errors saving time for entire industries like lawyers and tons of people who can adapt to using it. The day it thinks and is actually reliable is going to be insane, when it actually gets integrated into everywhere and its more usable everywhere its going to get even more insane.\n\nMarket and world is definitely scary, but its always scary, i wouldn't want to sit out from this. If one is invested long term, even the crashes are green, but most people wait for 50% dump after stuff goes up 200% while it dumps 20% and just keeps going up more afterward.\n\nWe have people waiting for crash since 2012, then saying 2020 bottom is the first leg, the another leg is coming down and they will keep waiting for another decade i guess.",
