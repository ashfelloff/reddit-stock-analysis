I had the game reserved with them which cost $5 at the time, and they talked me into paying for the game in full because I would be able to \"walk right up and pick up my copy\". \n\nWell, me and my buddies show up for the midnight release and get in a massive fucking line. All but one of us had paid in full. He hadn't even reserved his copy, and he walked right up to the counter and got a copy and came back to where we were. So, I go and talk to the employee who talked me into paying in full, and he told me that I couldn't check out through the other 2 much shorter lines. You see, gamestop knew what we didn't. EVERYONE was doing midnight releases for Halo 2... Toysrus, Bestbuy, Walmart, and there were an absolute fuck ton of copies with no chance of any store running out so gamestop had 2 lines for people who hadn't reserved and was rushing the people who hadn't already given them money through. They already had our $60 so fuck us... Everyone who hadn't given them money got VIP service. We ended up waiting about another hour and a half while they checked those people out.\n\nAnd that's not even the worst story I have about this cunty company.",
