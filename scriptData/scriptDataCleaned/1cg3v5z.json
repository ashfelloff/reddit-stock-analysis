I live an average lifestyle, except my wife and I have 2 dogs and no kids. We neither want them, nor think we would be able to afford them. But it seems I should have went with a computer career to be more comfortable and take more vacations. I did incredibly well in school, but then tried to go into HR(not recruiting), which has a huge barrier to entry apparently, and I landed in the insurance field as an adjuster. The wife is a dietician who makes about the same as me, but she has $50K in student loan debt. I am 35 years old and yes, it is too late for me to go back to school with all we have going on. Oh, and we just bought our first house almost 2 years ago.",
