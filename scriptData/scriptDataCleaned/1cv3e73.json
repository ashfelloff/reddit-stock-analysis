This starts with Li earnings I have 11 34c 6/14 \nThis will propel me if all things go well to upwards of 700$ with the 700 I will buy 30 108c 5/31 of tjx and after they crush their earnings I will be up to over 4k. Something tells me this will work out very well, and the kicker an after I make it all back Iâ€™m done gambling and will go back to my charts and crayons watch the S&P. Iâ€™m very positive this plays out well. ",
