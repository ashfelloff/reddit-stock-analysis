Why not pull out 5k at 10k and walk with a 5x?\n\nObviously you can't make the same argument for 1k to 1001, but at some point when you've hit like a 5x, you probably should take something out. But you don't hit omega-insane and regarded runs like 1k to 150k by pulling out at 5k. You make those runs by going all in, on stupid ass bets, over and over and over again.\n\nImho, the people on wsb that do this and turn 10k into 1m and then cash out, are just lucky enough to do that and have everyone in their life tell them to cash tf out now before they lose it all. Or by some god damn miracle, they realize themselves that it is time to stop. But more often then not, you don't hit insane runs like this without being truly moronic",
