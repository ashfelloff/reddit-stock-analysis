YouTube feels schizophrenic by design and never got better with use, only made me ask \"why?!\" more.\n\nGoing to edit in that one thing YouTube actually does do better is very small  indie artist options. There's a LOT more music on YouTube that I can't find on Spotify . It's the nature of turning any YouTube video labelled music into a playable song.
