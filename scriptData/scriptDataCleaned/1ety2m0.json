  "selftext": "A U.S. judge temporarily blocked media companies Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery and Fox from launching their sports streaming service, Venu, according to court filings.\n\nThe temporary injunction, granted in response to a lawsuit brought by Fubo TV, comes just weeks ahead of the start of the NFL season. The companies had planned to launch their service by that date.\n\nThe lawsuit brought by Fubo, an internet TV bundle akin to the traditional pay TV package, had claimed Venu would upend its business.\n\n“We respectfully disagree with the court’s ruling and are appealing it,” the companies said in a joint statement on Friday.\n\n“We believe that Fubo’s arguments are wrong on the facts and the law, and that Fubo has failed to prove it is legally entitled to a preliminary injunction. Venu Sports is a pro-competitive option that aims to enhance consumer choice by reaching a segment of viewers who currently are not served by existing subscription options.”\n\nFubo’s stock was up 20% on the news of the injunction. A Fubo representative didn’t immediately comment.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/16/judge-temporarily-blocks-sports-streaming-service-venu-ruling-in-favor-of-fubo-tv-on-antitrust-concerns.html",

It's not just that Venu would \"upend\" Fubo's business. The issue is Disney, WBD, and Fox force Fubo TV and others to purchase extra channels that nobody wants to get access to their sports content. That makes their plans more expensive. Meanwhile, Disney, WBD, and Fox won't require their customers to buy extra stuff for Venu, so it's automatically more attractive to customers and will likely be cheaper. \n\n\nIt is anti-competitive to force your competitors to offer unwanted content that raises their prices. On the other hand, Disney, WBD, and Fox have a point that they're the ones taking on financial risk to create this programming, so they should be able to do whatever they want with it.",

A bunch of unwanted channels you cant pick and choose what you want.\n\nHave Disney, WBD, or Fox commented in a more elaborate way? Article you linked said FUBO likely goes bankrupt if DIS/WBD/Fox win. FUBO is trying to not be the next Blockbuster. Is why they probably filed this lawsuit. Is there a better DIS/WBD/Fox comment to hear their side to have a more informed view of this.",

Unlike them, Disney, Fox and Warners said Fubo didn’t risk billions of dollars to acquire unique content and then billions more to turn that content into desirable programming. The company “remains an undercapitalized startup with minimal differentiation that acts as a middleman aggregator of content that other companies make possible,” they said.",
