I sort of want to buy more LKNCY right now but the trend is downwards, SBUX is cheap too so it's both another option plus it means the competition in China is too stiff with Cotti or whatever new mofo is losing VC money to eat market share now, China isn't doing well and there is increased exposure, and most importantly there are so many good deals right now outside of retail coffee (Small caps, LT treasuries, 5.5% cash, TSLA/AMZN, all the other ipos/techs/spacs that got BTFO 70-90% from the pandemic era.)\n\nhttps://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-wallstreetbets-trader-lost-life-savings-luckin-coffee-stock-decline-2020-6-1029281054",
