Console sales are down, gaming is just down bad in general. The PS5 and Xbox 20 years console refreshes is ridiculous when Iphones and Samsung phones and tablets are coming out every year. I think that consolidation with the lack of any type of gaming interest is really hurting the PC market in general.\n\nGTA6 is not coming out anytime soon.

It now appears the recovery is more gradual than previously expected. This is expected to continue in 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness. Regarding Logic, the competitive foundry dynamics have resulted in a slower ramp of new nodes at certain customers, leading to several fab push outs and resulting changes in litho demand timing, in particular EUV. In Memory, we see limited capacity additions, with the focus still on technology transitions supporting the HBM and DDR5 AI-related demand. 1 \"We expect fourth-quarter total net sales between €8.8 billion and €9.2 billion with a gross margin between 49% and 50% which includes the recognition of the first two High NA systems upon customer acceptance, reflecting progress on imaging, overlay and contrast.",
