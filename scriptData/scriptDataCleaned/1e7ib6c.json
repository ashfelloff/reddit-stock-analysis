For all of the massive gains posted on WSB , I realize now many if not most are from blind luck. Buying and holding wild long term calls in one or maybe a few companies & benefiting from a ride up. Ofc luck vs skill is a nuanced debate. My point is there are not a lot of strategic bets and systems of trading for most of the WSB gains I've seen, I realized it correlates strongly to buy and hold on call options of a few stocks that the person rode to the $$$. \n\nIt's not repeatable as a strategy IMO , it's throwing a dart at a dartboard and hoping it hits a 🎯 \n\n  \nNothing wrong with this but I don't think it's repeatable or consistent and I think there are many people with the same \"strategy\" who ended up much less fortunate when they selected the wrong calls expiration, companies etc. \n\n  \nAs for Nvidia I bought puts at 120 back in June , they were too short I lost  the. All, I rebought many more at 135 and sold at 95, I'm happy with the trade. All indicators and statistics available showed the stock was massively overbought even compared to big tech stocks which themselves as a sector tend to be very overbought. I spent hours upon hours breaking down the companies financials earnings and comparing them with other big cap tech companies all the ratios etc and I can without a doubt say that all indicators show Nvidia was and maybe still is overbought. \n\n  \nMaybe you are right and they bounce back but that's a risk I wouldnt take. Although if you still held the year end calls I think you probably have a solid chance to make money but I have no idea how reliable the earnings will be to increase the price after a big chunk of late adopters to Nvidia lost a bunch of money. \n\n  \nTbh in interested in your thinking / basis for NVIDIA going past it's all time highs? \n\n  \nDo you think this pattern will repeat endlessly? It already became the biggest company in the world with a 3 trillion valuation, does it go to 5 trillion? 10? \n\nAnd if so why / how., if it's based on the earnings being good I'm not sure how much higher it can go. It's all opinions I could be dead wrong but the thing that pushed me over the edge was seeing Jensen huang sell the legally allowable limit of stock to a total of over 600Million at the moment. \n\nWhat goes up ,.must ...

But when I have conviction, I nail it bigly. I've been buying NVDA calls since it was split adjust $30. Actually, I owned $70k in shares back in 2002. Had to liquidate them to settle my divorce, but that's a different story.\n\nI've paper handed so much profit on NVDA on the run-up because I too thought it had run up too far, too fast. I almost bought 10 $90 calls for $60 when it was at $85 before earnings. It ran to $1200 before they would have expired. Literally missed out on $250,000 in profits because I was too scared. \n\nSo, my more recent strategy has been to buy deep ITM calls. When NVDA hit $110, I bought 30 Jan 2025 $120 Calls. As soon as it hit $135, I knew it was too far and too much in the short-term, so I sold 30-day OTM calls against it. Ended up looking like a genius. Closed out a $15k position for only $500. \n\nBut I didn't think NVDA would dip so low, or I would have sold calls against the position once again. Lesson learned.\n\nAs for how far NVDA will go. I've already posted too many times about how the cyclicality of semis. Even the new fandangled AI hoopla will become cyclical - The question is when. I have no idea. Most people don't. Anyone who says they do is full of shit. \n\nSo, in the meantime, I am profiting as much as I can off the move.\n\nCurrent positions (other than some random short-term NVDA plays are)\n\n1000 shares\n\n100 Sept 6th $120 Calls\n\nPosting in next comments - because I practice what I preach",

I didn't even have an ex wife to blame for it just paper hands lol. \n\nI understand the strategy and thinking , I have no current position in Nvidia I'm just watching it, I think it goes down further but I'm less certain now than I was when it was at 120s-130s after the split. \n\n  \nI genuinely hope it goes up enough for you to profit, but I think you are playing a very very dangerous game. \n\n  \nWhen I looked at the companies financials the thing that stood out to me was how low the actual numbers were compared to other large companies, it was 3-10x other companies market cap but less than or equal to them in revenue & income. The ratios were insanely high especially p/e and even compared to the other tech companies they were massively higher. \n\nAtm it's compared to other giant tech companies (apple , msft , meta , Amazon, Google) \n\n#3 market cap \n\nBut it's lowest in revenue and lowest in earnings . \n\nBut the scariest part to me is the recent market cap gain , compared to other companies it is STILL even after the \"adjustment way way more recent gains than the other tech giants that have already gone through previous drops and are more established. And it's not even close. \n\n  \nSomething I found interesting when I was comparing it also was the stocks run up is a near perfect match to what happened to Tesla years back, literally dip for dip gain for gain it's quite crazy. And that story didn't end well at this point for tsla back then it went way down. \n\n  \n/ My 2 cents only time will tell.",
