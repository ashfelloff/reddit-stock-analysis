      "body": "although margin is way up from price increases SBUX is shedding customers; even if they drop prices they may not recover the customer base quickly enough. My local Starbucks (we now have 2 in our small town) went from literal lines around the building a few years ago to being completely empty most of the time as of today. They are currently focused on speedier service, new products, and promotions while at the same time they acknowledge that they are losing customers to \"value players\" in China but don't seem to be willing to do anything about it. SBUX is going to tank this year if anything. This is likely a very bad position\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/business/starbucks-earnings-second-quarter-2024/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2024/05/01/business/starbucks-earnings-second-quarter-2024/index.html)",
