  "selftext": "\n\nAll options were on SPY.\n\nTimeline:\n\n7/31:\nJPow does press conference and SPY rises. Anticipated sell-off thinking ISM manufacturing numbers would come up weak. Long $6k on put spreads expiring 9/20.\n\n8/1:\nSell-off begins. Anticipate even greater drops as unemployment report drops next day, and with initial jobless claims coming in high all month, Sahm is gonna trigger. Long $18k on 1DTE SPY puts.\n\n8/2:\nThe 1DTEs print for +$37k! Anticipating more sell-offs after the weekend due to aftershocks of today‚Äôs news, as well as ISM services report. Long $27k on 1DTE SPY puts.\n\n8/5:\nWtf Japan. Massive overnight/pre-market crash, Black Monday part 2 for the Nikkei. Closed the puts soon after open before SPY could rally too hard, made the biggest winner today at +$160k.\n\nAnticipating modest rally tomorrow, bouncing off the last three days of insane drilling. Long $48k on 1DTE SPY calls.\n\n8/6:\nUpon typing this, I paperhanded the hell out of my calls this morning, but still sold them off between $523-524 for a very modest profit of +$26k.\n\nOnly sitting on my small put spread from last week now, thinking it‚Äôll become more profitable with some vega and theta drops before closing out, if not waiting until expiration entirely.",
