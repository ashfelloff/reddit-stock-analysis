If that happens they will tank even further.\n\nConsumer wise people are waking up to the fact that AMD is cheaper and requires less power which is big for a laptop. Anyone who doesn’t really need a real laptop is on ARM already. Server market is all about core counts and AMD has that cornered. Intel is in a very difficult position and all is their own making.

They compete in many areas, but are they not the best in one of them. And even when they turn around, they got a lot of catch-up to do, because AMD and Nvidia have been and will continue to move at a higher pace.",

At least Pat has a background in technology and not like Bob Swan who's a Biz major who probably weaseled his way up kissing ass at the golf course. \n\nPat just got there with the ship half sunk, is trying to unsink the Titanic while also turning it into the right direction, and keeping the folks who jumped off from freezing to death. Problem is it is a herculean task, he's 63 coming out of retirement in an industry where you'll need to go back to school after 4-8 years or else you look washed, and the tech part of the company is so far behind that INTC is working on developing/manufacturing 5/7NM when leaders are on 3nm and moving onto 2nm. That's why I said Pat's like Joe. It's not that Pat isn't good. It's just that the job is so big, the gap so large, and the ship so fucked up that it might be a tough on a 63yr old man. Elon, Jensen, Lisa Su, Cook, or Diamon might have a hard time turning this ship around.\n\nI put most of the blame on the board and large share holders. If they were going to do all this anyways then they should have done this in 2021 or 2022 instead of 2024. You should always hit investor all at once with the bad news instead cutting everyone to death with a thousand blows. Would have much appreciated if the INTC board just fired Bob Swan, hired Pat, and pull all this shit on us during 2020 instead of wasting everyone else's time by doing it in 2024.",

It shows immaturity and shows that people here at best are just traders without deep understanding of Intel as whole. Also people do not seem to remember that at one time, AMD was in the shit hole sitting at 2$ almost bankrupt and it took the hiring of Jim Keller and many years to recover and reach the state where it is today. It took Nvidia over 10 years in investing in CUDA to be where they are now. Same it will take Pat at least a few years to steer the ship. I read the CPU architecture articles from Intel & AMD (and now also ARM flavors) since year 2000 and watch their reviews. Back in 2016 I saw the first architecture preview of ZEN and had a \"shit, this looks very good moment\". Looked at stock, was little over 1$ and decided not to invest due to fear that they will not make it. Looked back in June at the review of the Intel server CPU that is made just from E cores and I had again a \"this is quite good\" moment. And this is the one with E cores, they haven't launched the one with P cores yet. Intel still has the lead in single thread performance. They will lose it temporary to AMD with Zen 5 for a month or two but they will take it back. Server CPUs are closing the gap to AMD and ARM still not at same in single thread performance. Only ARM CPU that beats Intel in single thread performance is Apple but when normalizing to same frequency, Intel is narrowing the gap. Also Apple CPUs kind of \"cheat\" due to their designs being monstruously wide, having huge OOO windows and leveraging the wider memory bandwidth that their solutions employ. On top, Intel, for the first time in decades started the proposal of cleaning up the x86 architecture. \n\nI think the analogy with the Titanic is the best one without going into the technical details that I mentioned. Job is huge, but already in the middle. It's in the pain point where everyone who does not have forward looking vision, does not understand the end goal or does not have the ability to see the path to it. Intel is undergoing a huge business transformation like it never had before since inception. The lack of transformation kept the stock stagnating for years. Now this transformation will be the one that will make the stock move heavily in the future. If people look at history, the stock hasn't seen such a minimum since 2013. I'd say Intel is where AMD was in 2015-2016. Wondering how many would have said about AMD that will be where it is back in 2016.",
