I‚Äôm guessing (and I could absolutely be wrong) that this means the housing market is a big indicator of how well they‚Äôre likely to perform, since more homes = more lawns to fertilize.\n\nThat said, it seems like they‚Äôve taken a beating since their COVID surge when everyone was at home and could care for their lawns, so much so that they‚Äôve now lost a decade of gains and are back to where their price was in 2014-15 (they‚Äôre just below 70 right now, although their 52W low went as far down as 43.67).\n\nAnyone familiar with the company willing to share some info?",

The store had hardly any Scotts merchandise, but there was a massive row of equipment for hydroponics, a method of growing that allows people to cultivate cannabis (or any other plant, for that matter) indoors, using targeted lighting and liquid solutions spiked with nutrients. Hagedorn asked to see the store owner, and out walked a short guy with wild hair and a lazy eye. He told Hagedorn that everyone called him an idiot when he first started selling hydroponics equipment, but the stuff was flying off the shelves, with an average receipt of $400--straight cash. It was a starkly different scene from what he'd just witnessed at a Home Depot across town, which had plenty of Scotts Miracle-Gro products but no hydroponics equipment. \"Two worlds, same town. **I came back, and I told everyone 'We're doing it,' \" Hagedorn recalls. \"If you don't like it, leave. We're doing it. It's beyond stopping. And we're not getting into pot growing. We're talking dirt, fertilizer, pesticides, growing systems, lights. You know it's a multibillion-dollar business, and we've got no growth in our core.

The bigger issue recently/last year was this: https://www.wsj.com/articles/scotts-miracle-gro-shortage-glut-inventory-fertilizer-11663261193\n\nThey went from a shortage during covid to a glut because they overproduced thinking the demand would continue and it didn't.
