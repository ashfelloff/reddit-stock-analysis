  "selftext": "So DJT essentially are issuing 40 million additional shares to Trump and former TMTG shareholders (insiders) if the share price of DJT stays above $17.50 for 20 days in any 30 day period. As of Monday 22nd of April, those 20 days have been met.\n\nNow how many public shares are there of DJT. Considering TMTG was only held by insiders, we are left with the public shares of DWAC. This amounts to exactly 28,715,597 according to this SEC filing. As a result the additional shares being issued are considerably larger than the number of public shares available.\n\nAs a result insiders seem to be capitalising on the demand with retail investors paying the price of their shares being diluted. I have attached the link to the SEC filing for this if you’re interested in reading this.\n\nThis information had to be put out there as I am not convinced many retail investors are actually aware of this. \n\nSource - \n\nhttps://www.fastcompany.com/91108230/trump-to-earn-950-million-trump-media-unless-djt-stock-plunges\n",

              "body": "I just dug into this a bit. It's really fascinating and crazy, but apparently a common SPAC practice...\n\nThe warrants do become exercisable after 30 days, but they are not registered until the recent S-1 becomes \"effective\".\n\nThen, as soon as that happens, the company may \"redeem\" the warrants for $0.01 each. Yes, it's terrible for warrant holders... because it forces them to either (a) exercise the options \\[which generates $ for DJT company but causes 1 share dilution per warrant\\], or (b) exercise the option on a cashless basis (at the sole discretion of the company) which would NOT generate $ for the company, but would reduce dilution to a fraction of a share (probably .25-.33 of a share) per warrant.\n\nI think there are like 5-15M warrants out there... I count about 4M from the SPAC raise and another 3M issued at merger time.\n\nMy guess is that the company will want to raise $ and force (a), which will raise $11.50/warrant for the company. So while that could raise up to $50-150M in capital, it would cause maximum dilution of 5-15M additional shares (3-10% of outstanding, but much higher of the float). That would also be landing after the registration becomes effective, which means many more insiders could sell.\n\nRedemption requires 30 days notice to warrant holders, so we should know well ahead of time. However, it can be done before the registration is effective, as soon as the options are exercisable, which is 30 days post combination (so 4/26 or so?). Redemption is also all-or-none (ie all outstanding warrants, so as not to favor individual holders).\n\nThe harder thing to know is when the S-1 becomes effective, because I'm not sure how that works. I think it's anytime between the S-1 being published and \\~60 days.\n\nBottom line is, and it's hard to time, but there could be a huge patch of selling pressure coming when all these stars align... and also unclear how & when market responds to such information being published, because it's not like it's trading on any financial fundamentals....",
