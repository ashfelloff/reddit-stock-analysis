Good luck to ASTS on litigating those issues for 5 years while the patents run their course (they only last 20 years). Most patent prosecutors charge a contingency fee. If they do, ASTS will be looking at a loss of 33% on the infringement value. If they don‚Äôt, ASTS will be paying huge legal fees. Most patents fail to meet legal precedent for enforcement. Getting a patent does not require any sort of intense scientific investigation. Holding it through challenges is what makes it valuable and proves it has worth. The ONLY patents that patent trolls can use to make money are those that have enough meat to survive the risk of an action which leads to a licensing fee. Any licensing fee for competitors here would be small compared to their market cap. Patent law is a whole thing worth learning if you intend to rely on quantity of patents as an argument for buying a stock. I‚Äôd rather have 3 solid patents I can license rather than 3500 BS ones.
