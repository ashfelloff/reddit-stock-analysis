Since then the stock has been down hard and interest rates have gone up significantly, hampering a loan.\n\nThe middle East and Austrailian interest is a great sign.   Aramco is owned by the Saudi Wealth Fund and is worth  $925 billion, so the $12 billion they raised is small potatoes for them.\n\nMy question, ehat if any leverage does TELL.have and what or how much will the stock be diluted if there is a deal.\n\nMy hope is that TELL only sells a small stake and Aramco chooses future product at a discount in lieu of a larger stake.",
