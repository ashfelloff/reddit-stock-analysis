Back in April some people in here were hyping up $ASTS, so I decided to say fuck it and I bought a bunch of $10 call options because they were quite literally dirt cheap and I didn't have much to lose.\n\nHoly fucking shit, I wish I bought more.\n\nIt went up $20k in just the past two days. I have never seen this much money at once before in my life. Whoever the fuck was hyping up ASTS a few months ago, thank you. I'll buy you some Intel shares, my treat :)",
