I am an ex-prop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on _____?‚Äù will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. ‚ÄúIs ___ a good investment?‚Äù will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Payroll Revisions Point to Cooling US Labor Market](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-05/payroll-revisions-point-to-cooling-us-labor-market)\n\n**[TSLA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=TSLA)-** Released Q2 TSLA delivery numbers on Tuesday. We broke the 250 level. Going to stay hands off in this for now (got burned trying to short too early), but if we get overextended then I‚Äôll look into a short.\n\n**[MDWD](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=MDWD)-** Up on a supposed $34 takeover offer.\n\n**[M](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=M)-** Buyout offer for M for $6.9B. (Current bid is roughly $24.80)\n\n**[MARA](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=MARA)/[RIOT](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=RIOT)/[COIN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=COIN)/[HOOD](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=HOOD)/[BITO](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=BITO)-** We saw BTC and the entire CC market tank due to Mt. Gox payout fears, because it releases more supply into the market. (Roughly 1 Million BTC was lost during the hack)\n\n**[AMZN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)-** And again, watching AMZN for any potential upswings.\n",

It doesn't matter if it doesnt sound smart, people WILL upgrade at some point anyways so ai is just something that will give them the extra push needed to make the decision, after iphone 16 sales will likely go up for at least 2 years! Lastly you have to consider that in the future AI can become some type of subscription further tying you into the apple ecosystem, services have seen considerable growth lately and now account for 1/4 of apple's revenue if I'm not wrong",
