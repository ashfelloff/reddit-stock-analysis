The only way the stock price goes down is if a split is not announced. Even if they are overvalued by 20% they have a history of splitting the stock at/above 700\n\nThis a ballsy play but I don't see what makes you think this monster will be defeated\n\nEvery tech company especially meta announced increased spending budget for ai\n\nDo give us a reason why you think they'll go down?",

I'm down to only 16 shares of NVDA, and will probably unload 4 after it hits $1,000. Deeply regret selling off 25 or so shares in the 2022 crash. In my experience people who insult other's about being in mom's basement or similar are young and poor, so good luck with that.
