But nevertheless...\n\nThings that I dislike:\n\nToo much bullish attitude, from the CEO to the shareholders to the extent I've seen youtube videos suggesting one should invest 100% in PLTR for retirement. Really bad advice imo.\n\nThere is a feel that having an anti stance towards PLTR suggests being unpatriotic. Might be my misconception but that's what a free country entails - having your own opinion.\n\nThings that I like:\n\nI think the business model of trialware is great and has lots of potential.\n\nIt's one of the very few companies where I see AI being used as intended and not a gimmick.\n\nPeople are concerned about privacy while surrendering to Google to read their email, serve FB their most intimate info and secrets, let YouTube geo-locate you as they please, Amazon to suddenly start showing ads on top of my Prime membership. I'm not saying we should, I'm saying I chose to in order to use their services and I'm ok with it. Do note I didn't include services like Ring etc. who were invading privacy until they got caught. Do I mind getting my face scanned on the highway by one of the automated toll booths if the needs arises ? Nope, it's a public place anyone can record as per the constitution. Just an example of the point I was driving.\n\nCompanies like BP are benefitting which in turn helps them get to carbon neutral. Isn't that a win-win for everyone ? Now with their [partnership with Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/ee/news/announcement/oracle-and-palantir-join-forces-to-deliver-mission-critical-ai-solutions-to-governments-and-businesses-2024-04-04/), hopefully deploying would make it more seamless and shorten the turn around time.\n\nFrom 9/11 to World Central Kitchen, it's not that the data was not there. We know that it was either not shared between services effectively or tagged or communicated. While we might never know if the new AI tech will remedy this - I sure hope so and that is definitely something I can get behind.\n\nEdit: Palantir + Oracle link source and why it matters for next ER: Firstly, it resolves an issue highlighted during their Q4 earnings call, where the company still faced difficulties in expanding their sales team to meet the increased demand for their product suite. Secondly, with Oracle’s “regionally scaled” and adaptable data centers, Palantir’s software can now be easily hosted at Oracle’s various locations whilst ensuring compliance with localized data privacy regulations.",

They note concerns about excessive bullishness surrounding the stock and a perceived pressure to support the company as patriotic. However, they appreciate the business model of trialware and believe in the potential of AI in Palantir's operations. They also discuss privacy concerns and how they view the trade-off between privacy and convenience in using technology services. The author sees potential benefits in Palantir's partnerships, particularly with Oracle, which could address some of the company's challenges and improve its capabilities in data management and analysis.

Let's also assume this is a blue collar operation and doesn't have much experience with CRM's (I live in Michigan, there's many companies that operate in the 19th century office wise). These transformers are essential for transferring electrical energy between circuits, playing a crucial role in both power distribution and industrial applications.\n\nIn the scenario, involving grain-oriented electrical steel, a key material used in transformer cores, Palantir Foundry’s predictive analytics could foresee supply chain disruptions by scrutinizing global steel trade patterns, political events, and market dynamics. If an impending geopolitical event threatens the supply. Foundry’s advanced analytics would alert said company ahead of time. This enables the manufacturer to proactively engage with alternative suppliers or consider substitute materials like amorphous steel, ensuring their transformer production continues efficiently despite potential supply challenges and lack of technical prowess.",
