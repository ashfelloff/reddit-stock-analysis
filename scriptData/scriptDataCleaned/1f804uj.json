Nearest catalyst is another contract announcement like NSN, or something unexpected like the Imagine Dragons thing. (Did that contribute to today's pump? Who knows.) Also this is a weird stock that will sometimes jump 10% in either direction on no news. \n\nMy advice: sell your options for profit after the next pump (hopefully NSN comes soon) and then either buy shares or if you still want options get some that expire well out. There's no guarantee the January mission will be on time (it was already delayed from Q4) since there's a hard deadline on it relating to lighting conditions at the moon's south pole, i.e. the moon has seasons and when it's winter there won't be light for solar panels. So if the mission is delayed any further it will be pushed far out.  \n\nThen again there are other good catalysts expected next year too. IM-3 will happen at some point (I think it was originally scheduled for Q1 and delayed but I'm not sure) and there's a large contract for designing a lunar rover that LUNR has decent (but not overwhelming) odds of getting next year.",
