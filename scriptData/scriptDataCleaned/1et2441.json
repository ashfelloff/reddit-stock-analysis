I'm not convinced it'll be going down anytime soon, not enough to bet against it. I sold calls today and am partly regretting it, but I made a good profit on them. I fell into the bear trap like an idiot, so I'm being a bit more careful before I start going all YOLO again. Next time market does some bearshit like that again, I'm sitting it out.

I'm not playing that game again.",
