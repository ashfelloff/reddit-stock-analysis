I bought the dip.\n\nWSB folks really freaking out about Warren Buffett selling AAPL and BAC when 13F data came out reflecting shit that happened in Q2 (when folks were in full AI circle wankfest). \n\nAlso just cause Buffett does something doesn't mean you have to too. Berkshire's portfolio was like >1/3 apple and they might have wanted to reduce exposure. Just cause WB/BRK might want to diversify or hold cash doesn't mean you should. Just like how if WB takes medicine for backpain, wears diapers cause he can't hold his bladder no more, and doesn't play basketball in fear of breaking his bones doesn't mean we should do the same. \n\nFolks need to realize they aren't BRK/WB so they can't nor should do the same thing. What kind of 20-30 year old would hold fucking cash when it's constantly losing value?!??! Only old ass boomers want that because they can't work anymore. WB/BRK are ALREADY RICH. Rich folks don't need to get rich twice. They try to mitigate risk and hedge downturns to protect their WEALTH. Most on WSB have a few Ks and can't even afford tendies. Your average WSB degen isn't 2024 WB even if they delusionally gamble as if they believe they are (young Buffett did use leverage but he didn't do dumb shit like buy useless SPACs, invest in speculative bottle caps, or hold cash)",
