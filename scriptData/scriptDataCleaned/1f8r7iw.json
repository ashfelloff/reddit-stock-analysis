  "score": 477,
  "selftext": "Intel's (INTC.O) contract manufacturing business has suffered a setback after tests with chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) failed, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, dealing a blow to the company's turnaround efforts.\n\nThe tests conducted by Broadcom involved sending silicon wafers - the foot-wide discs on which chips are printed - through Intel's most advanced manufacturing process known as 18A, the sources said. Broadcom received the wafers back from Intel last month. After its engineers and executives studied the results, the company concluded the manufacturing process is not yet viable to move to high-volume production.\n\n",

You can build a small plant domestically for about $250M. Leading-edge fabs today cost $30B.\n\nLeading-edge is a totally different ball game than the legacy stuff.

I mean, Apple spends an AMD revenue's worth at TSMC every single year. It definitely helps with funding capex.\n\nAMD ended up getting towed behind Apple's boat, and that has gave them generally good processes for the past 10 years. Nodes are the big advancement in CPUs these days. You can pull off architectural optimizations, but even a shitty node launch will give you 10% more speed for absolutely free, or 3% lower power draw for absolutely free. No tradeoffs, it literally is a free lunch. TSMC pulled off that jump over Intel foundries 3 straight times, and it allowed AMD to make up ground on Intel fast.\n\nThere's no node magic to be had this time. Intel is shackled to a corpse with their internal foundry, and even if they go 3rd party to TSMC, it just brings them even with AMD. It won't give them a competitive advantage.",
