There's risk inflation stays around 2.5% instead of going down to 2.0%, but like I said, that's the tradeoff Powell is willing to make in order to keep the labor market.\n\nthe 1970s had a huge portion of the labor force in union. That's how you get persistent inflation, annual wage increases. Unions are almost non-existent right now. You also had multiple oil crisis in the 1970s, each of them re-starting those inflation spikes. Even during Russian war, the oil spike was much less than the 1970s adjusted for inflation (about half I believe), and as we've seen from Biden, the guy's willing to deplete the strategic petroleum reserve to lower oil prices and save his presidency, and also to pump money into the economy even when the US economy was booming (2022, not 2021).\n\nSo you have both the Fed and the government trying real hard to tolerate higher inflation and avoiding the recession.\n\nBtw, I'm pretty sure you're using CPI, not PCE YoY. The main difference is PCE has much lower weights in housing, which is quite high compared to other components. Core PCE YoY is 2.8% right now, and is steadily going down. The Fed cares about core PCE and not CPI, in case if you're not aware. Whether or not it's fair, that's just the rules.\n\n[https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-pce-price-index-905](https://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-pce-price-index-905)",
