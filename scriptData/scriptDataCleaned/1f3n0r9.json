That's not a small amount by any means, this will help to elevate the value of the stock in the long run. \n\nFor context, this puts Nvidia in league with companies like Apple now, who spent $110 billion this year on buyback and has overall has spent $800 billion on buyback in company history. Companies that can afford to do this on any meaningful scale are set up to create value for the long haul.

AI may be the greatest lever to wealth creation ever and Nvidias at the center, and the technology is still far from being realized.

This year they promised a $50B buyback. At this time, they have $35B in cash equivalents. According to these numbers, the buyback is very fair. I can see where people would think because they have 24B shares outstanding and a $3T valuation that they might be lowballing their buybacks. Not true.",
