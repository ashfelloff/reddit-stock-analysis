  "selftext": "I am 19, in college, and had 6k to my name in June. In the photo of my all time there are three distinct stages: the slow making ETF stage, the reckless options losses which brought me down to just 500 in my account, and then $ASTS gains ü§ë. I deposited 2k to start and just when I was about to lose pretty much all of it to stupid options like $MU earnings, I deposited four more grand and put it all into ASTS calls. I know it‚Äôs nothing compared to the millions some people made today but I‚Äôll take a 178% return in 3 months! Already waiting for a good re-entry because this thing is showing no signs of slowing down. Also gained a nice bonus from my 85 shares. \n\nTLDR: Invest in $ASTS \n\n\n",
