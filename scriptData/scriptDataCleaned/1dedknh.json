They’re saying 1 rate cut because if they say no rate cuts (which is more likely what’s going to happen) people will get even more restless and it will put more downward pressure on the market, and if they announce more rate cuts the market will keep ripping until it’s too late. This is their way of trying to get people to hold steady instead of moving the market up or down. Unfortunately most people are as dumb as you are so it’s probably going to keep going until we go bust",

There are a few companies that are propping the stock market up based purely off speculation of what value they may provide in the future, and they’ve created an illusion that the market is still healthy, 401K’s are still good, and there’s still money to be had. \n\nThen there is the consumer which is what props up the consumer market which is the actual engine that allows the investment market to keep churning. Consumer purchasing power has been on a decline while household debt has been stacking. The car market which in my opinion is a good microcosm of investment markets mixing with consumer markets has begun to collapse as we’ve expected for the last 2 years. \n\nSentiment is the only thing that keeps people making the stupid decisions that will keep the market ripping in the short term, but the market is not inelastic. Money does run out. It may take a while, and there may be some bull runs that keep the optimists feeling comfortable enough to keep pumping money in, but at some point the consumer is going to crumble, which will create the downward pressure that will lead to a recession.\n\nIf you think the growth of the last 6 years is healthy, you’re clearly a Covid trader and you have some hard lessons inbound.",

What was it six at first? I don’t listen to any of these commentators anymore. Glad I’ve been going with my gut on everything now. People are looking at the deficit like it’s this huge deal and not factoring in how much America is actually worth. If America was a company their balance sheet would show 38 trillion in debt with assets of around 1000 trillion…. Start adding up all of the military that is still in existence and working. Add up all the infrastructure both already built and being built. Add up all the national lands. Add all of the intellectual property. What’s that work out to be? Let alone this is the one place on earth. Everybody seems to want to come. That is why keep on buying stocks. Any pullback every time",

None of the price increases of the last 4 years are being canceled. \n\n\nIn many parts of the U.S. you need a 6 figure income to qualify for a mortgage on a single family house. An income of $50k a year won't get you a decent apartment anymore or qualify for a condo mortgage. 30% of drivers in my area are uninsured because auto insurance on a junker car is a rip off.
