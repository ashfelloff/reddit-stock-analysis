  "selftext": "So a lot of people liked the HIMS jump this week due to an early announcement of the weight loss injections. Here are my thoughts and my opinions on HIMS, as a European. \n\nHIMS are in what I believe to be a very high demand market and they have the publicity and advertising to back themselves up. They deliver dick pills for Erectile dysfunction and sell viagra at what I read as being $120 a use. As a European and student of Biomedicine I know that this turnover rate is crazy.\n\nErectile dysfunction has been recorded at an all time high in recent years due to developing porn addictions. Therapists and Doctors can back this up. I’m going to be investing £50 every week into hims across the next year and possibly the next few. \n\nWeight loss tablets are also in high demand they are in demand for those suffering from PCOS and suffer from weight gain or inability to lose weight as symptoms of their pcos. Its one thing to feel upset that you kay find difficulties getting pregnant but then its another thing to feel insecure because of weight gain you cant control. Young men trying to become as shredded as the influencers they see plastered over their feeds.\n\nDiscreet delivery and online prescriptions makes HIMS a appealing vendor to those with insecurities.\n\n\nTLDR: Dick might not go up but stock sure will. ED is at an all time high and soon my ISA will be.\n",
