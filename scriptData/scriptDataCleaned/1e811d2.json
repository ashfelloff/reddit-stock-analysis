For the idiots in the room, financial quarters end in March, June, September, December. \n\nSo even without the typo, this would represent holdings ~2 weeks prior to the assassination attempt, which may have themselves been opened weeks earlier, and potentially not even still owned on the date of the SEC filing.\n\nFurther, (again, ignoring the typo) the ‚Äúshares‚Äù would actually need to be divided by 100 to represent the put contracts owned, as the 12m is the ‚Äúnotional‚Äù shares ‚Äúowned‚Äù.\n\nAka, people are stupid as fuck.\n\nEdit: Also, another bold faced lie around this whole thing, Blackrock **DOES NOT** own this investment firm, nor does Vanguard, it‚Äôs literally the opposite. APW owns some Blackrock and Vanguard shares, same as probably every investment firm on the planet. \n\nThis is literally the equivalent of me owning a few shares of Apple, committing a crime, and then people reporting that ‚Äúu/iwasrightonce, owned by Apple, committed a crime‚Äù",
