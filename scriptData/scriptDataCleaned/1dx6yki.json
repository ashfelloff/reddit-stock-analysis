Why do people want to make it all in one play? also this stock is by no means done, lots of room to make money everyday if you manage your risk. \n\nWhat I’m saying is, most people see the stock moving and think this is my chance to hit it big and then lose everything. How about instead of being a greedy person be a smart person who makes smaller profits to make consistent gains everyday. This way you learn what works and what doesn’t without take massive losses. \n\nNever invest more than 3% in a single trade.",
