                      "body": "When you have a lot of data, like Reddit comments, it's too big to put on one computer.  Also, one computer is to slow to handle sending all those comments to every user who wants to see them.  So you have to split your database between multiple machines that we call nodes.\n\nThat makes things difficult because we want all users to see the same data, but we need them to be talking to different nodes.  And what happens when you post a comment?  You don't want to have to send a message to every node because that would defeat the purpose of splitting the database.  So what we do is compromise on data consistency, and when the user posts a comment that only goes to one node.  But we want the users reading from all nodes to be able to see that comment, so behind the scenes there is a process that adds that incoming comment to each node.  We call that replication.\n\nThat takes time, which is what we call replication delay.  So when you post a comment, it will be visible to people reading from the immediate node you posted on, and it will become visible on the other nodes as the replication process completes.  When there is heavy load, this delay time will rise.  That is likely the cause of those phantom comments we were seeing yesterday.",
