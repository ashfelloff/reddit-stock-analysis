  "selftext": "* The Core (excludes volatile food and energy prices) PCE price index for September increased 2.7 % vs the expected 2.6% on an annual basis.\n* Core PCE MOM is 0.3% vs 0.3% expected\n* PCE price index YOY for September is 2.1% vs 2.1% expected\n* PCE MoM is 0.2% vs 0.2% Expected\n* FOMC focuses on PCE inflation in its quarterly economic projections and states its longer-run inflation goal in terms of headline PCE. PCE inflation has been preferred over CPI since 2000 for three main reasons:\n\n1. The expenditure weights in the PCE can change as people substitute away from some goods and services for others\n2. PCE includes more comprehensive coverage of goods and services\n3. Historical PCE data can be revised more than for seasonal factors only\n\n* There is a 94.6% chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut in November as of this morning after the PCE report, according to the CME FedWatch Tool. That would bring the target federal funds rate down to a range of 4.50%-4.75%.\n\n[https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/personal-income-and-outlays-september-2024](https://www.bea.gov/news/2024/personal-income-and-outlays-september-2024)",
