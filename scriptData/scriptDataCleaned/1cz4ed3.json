In fda insulin pump regulating land, you have to force tandem to put out a big red emergency memo about this because disruption of insulin delivery is a big risk. It’s in the best interest of everyone involved and it’s relatively common in the industry. No revenue lost.\n\nSens is a penny stock in the shadow of the 9000 pound gorilla Dexcom. They are in fact way down the line behind freestyle, etc. Tandem is arguably something like a 5000 pound gorilla in a different side of the industry. Beaten down by a few factors, one of which is this blanket sentiment that semaglutide glp1 will eliminate need for insulin and insulin related devices. The last 6 months of a bull run have made a statement to say no, ppl still use these devices. Tandem is lagging Insulet, dexcom, etc. and I don’t know how much from here but this accumulating story just sounds pretty fun and seems like it could have legs. Ur unreasonable bearishness is bringing it out of me",

I am skeptical about the acquisition thing bc it would be the easiest pump and dump, but they have had multiple releases about this being resolved with an update before the blackout even started. It was resolved pretty quickly and in pharma stocks, that’s usually all it takes. We also know that their company’s performance is massively ahead of what analysts had predicted for the last quarter.\n\nI know the article you linked is from May, but the issue is about a month or so older than that. If you want to bet against the company, that’s fine, but just use the most up-to-date data.

That being said, it would be highly unusual to announce news that they were being acquired at a healthcare conference. More likely they are announcing a new product/technology approval or a partnership with another company. Given that they are presenting this potentially \"confidential/material\" information at a large healthcare conference, it's also likely that they expect the information to be bullish.",
