In fda insulin pump regulating land, you have to force tandem to put out a big red emergency memo about this because disruption of insulin delivery is a big risk. It‚Äôs in the best interest of everyone involved and it‚Äôs relatively common in the industry. No revenue lost.\n\nSens is a penny stock in the shadow of the 9000 pound gorilla Dexcom. They are in fact way down the line behind freestyle, etc. Tandem is arguably something like a 5000 pound gorilla in a different side of the industry. Beaten down by a few factors, one of which is this blanket sentiment that semaglutide glp1 will eliminate need for insulin and insulin related devices. The last 6 months of a bull run have made a statement to say no, ppl still use these devices. Tandem is lagging Insulet, dexcom, etc. and I don‚Äôt know how much from here but this accumulating story just sounds pretty fun and seems like it could have legs.

That being said, it would be highly unusual to announce news that they were being acquired at a healthcare conference. More likely they are announcing a new product/technology approval or a partnership with another company. Given that they are presenting this potentially \"confidential/material\" information at a large healthcare conference, it's also likely that they expect the information to be bullish.",
