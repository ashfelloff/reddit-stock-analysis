He also wouldn't lower himself to say 'specially' instead of 'especially', despite his wacky image, he's still relatively educated (JD from Harvard).\n\nAlso his track record is more like 50/50, it's just when he's wrong he's spectacularly wrong and it's quite memorable. No one remembers his decent calls but they are out there.\n\nThe inverse Cramer ETF even shuttered so I guess it didn't do all that well. Was probably a quick money grab more than anything to make a little money off of the myth.",
