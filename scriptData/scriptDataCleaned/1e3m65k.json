You see some cool prototypes, slowly ramp up growth, you're typically building on top of existing infrastructure since that's more efficient and you're more worried about the front end experience.\n\nAI is completely the opposite though. Everyone saw GPT3.5, it was a cool prototype. It was built for $5M. Instead of a bunch of companies taking that basic building block and finding efficient uses for it, somehow our imaginations ran wild and we went, \"well this thing is really cool for only $5M, I wonder what we can do for $50 billion!\" It's honestly a really unique thing in computing that something is even immediately scalable 10000x, much less a bunch of companies actually agreeing to do that before strong use cases for AI actually appear.
