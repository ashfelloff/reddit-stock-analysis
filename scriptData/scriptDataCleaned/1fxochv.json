  "selftext": "I am trying to wrap my head around Ferrari stock but I don’t get it. My issue is that it’s an 85 billion euro company with only 5,000 employees and has an nvidia-level earnings multiple. It seems to be growing at a very nice pace but that pace doesn’t seem high enough to justify the multiple. It has a very nice product but 100 billion dollar market cap for a company that sells under 10k cars in a year sounds like way too much. \n\nI’ve heard some very respected investors talk highly about it. Is there some expectation for things to get much better? Maybe they’ll sell more cars, buy a business, raise prices, cut costs? I don’t know much about this company and after very little research I can confidently say that I don’t understand it at all. Anybody have any insight as to why this could be a good investment? ",

      "body": "The whole point of ferrari is not to sell as many cars as they can. Their goal is to artificially limit supply and keep their very high margins. They have a very strong brand and will always sell no matter what, recession or not, people who can afford a ferrari will buy one.\n\nSo when you buy Ferrari you buy a brand not a carmaker. They are like a luxury goods company and license their name so there are alternate oncome streams\n\nBut at these valuations it is likely not a good investment in my opinion.",

Last year, they sold over 13,000 cars, which is more than three times what they were making 20 years ago.

Yes, it might look good, but you are looking on ,,dead\" numbers as my senior always told me.  \nAs an Investors wants to know, if a company can keep or rise the profit in the future  \nJust googled the news about VW and I found these points:\n\n- China: Losing market shares in all categories: Classic enginge, plug-in, Electric. \n\n-Europe: Only selling 7.9 mil cars in europe, 2019 it was 9.9mil.\n\n-High costs for employees: germany as a strong protection group for employees. So VW cant adjust the number of employees like corp. in USA.\n\n- Their own IT Sub-corporate ,,Cariad\" failed hard..\n\n-Margin: Operative Margin is only 5.6% instead within 6.5-7%.\n\n- No big game changer cars for electric car markets.\n\n  \nOfc, other brands within VW like Skoda, are doing better. Also Porsche is  struggeling in China but still a profit brand. And dont forget the politics.\n\nAnd you can see similar problems also in BWM and Mercedes.\n\nConclusion: VW and co. are not dead. They still have the financial power and models/brand to hold their positions and to transform into succesful e-car providers. BUT Chinese brands and Tesla do have the better Supply regarding E-cars. And the politicians (in EU) are banning classic fuel cars and focusing on E-Car. And looking on the distribution of e-cars market shares, german brands are far behind compared to their classic fuel cars.\n\nJust my 2 cents.",

They always have money and they always want a Ferrari bc it is a fuckin Ferrari! Quality Italian supercar. In terms of a market downturn Ferrari will still thrive due to rich people always having a demand to buy them whenever they want regardless of market situations. I never bought into it because it always traded at such a high p/e but i regret it i could have bought it back when it was $180. It’s been a monster of a stock since it went public in 2015.",

I firmly believe it has the best business model of any public company that actually sells a manufactured product. \n\nThey're probably top-5 in brand recognition of any company in the world, their customers are all wealthy, and they make a small amount of cars every year\n\nBecause they're selling to wealthy buyers, there's no haggling over price and because they make a small amount of cars every year and have multi-year waiting lists, they can forecast revenues with precision.  And since there is no haggling over price, if their costs go up, they can pass that through to the buyer easily, so margins can also be forecasted with precision\n\nObviously there are loads of other factors, but knowing exactly how many cars you're going to sell every year and being able to charge anything you want for them, it makes for a very unique stock.  Kind of like if Rolex was publicly traded, they would know exactly how many watches they would sell and at what price.",
