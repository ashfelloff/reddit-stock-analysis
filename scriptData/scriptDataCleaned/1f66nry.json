That would be the best path\n\nHonestly this is what happens when you have a CEO with a marketing background running a tech company (previous CEO)\n\nStock will rise once they are already competitive not before.\n\nSo now the question of the day, who here is willing to bet on Intel's success (I would if I could, but I'm poor, can't afford much (got $40 in it)). Personally I'm waiting till 15th gen desktop launches to see if there going to replace defective 13th and 14th gen with it. If so I'll buy more. If not I'll wait and see",

As well as for desktops and laptops replacement because end of support for Windows 10. Demand for next years should be noticable bigger. Unfortunately story with faulty last gen didn't get them good PR, so with new gen they should at least not lose another percent of the market.\n\nEDIT: They didn't get those money from CHIPS act yet I believe.",
