It's what I said on some other comment, agentic LLMs are not advanced enough to replace humans, generally. I don't think Klarna would make this forward-looking statement to their shareholders without being true.\n\nI think what we're missing here is what the hell bullshit tasks agent did in 11 minutes that the AI does now more acurately in 2 min. If I had to guess, it's just doing the verification steps, pulling some basic account information if the customer asks, and maybe processing the simplest and most riskless of actions. Definitely they don't have the AI investigating fraud alegations over some misdelivered goods (yet).\n\nYou may not call for trivial stuff, but customer care is my line of work and other people will definitely call for the most regarded reasons.",

I ain’t trusting that. \n\nI have to talk to three levels of dudes in the Philippines before I finally reach a manager, who thinks I’m applying for a credit card instead of opening a savings account? I’m switching banks. \n\nI read a product description that’s composed of total word salad? Well, I’m not buying your product. \n\nI see an ad that doesn’t stand out or really tell me anything? I don’t care about your brand. \n\nIn customer services, especially, literally nothing is going to beat a friendly, sympathetic voice who sounds native, knows what they’re talking about and has the power to solve your problem. \n\nHowever, on a certain level, people will be willing to accept less. And they have to be - since the friendly native voice is pretty expensive, comparatively. \n\nAm I going to trust an AI to arrange my mortgage? Well no. \n\nWill I trust an AI to decide whether my medical symptoms warrant a trip to the hospital? Also no. \n\nWill I let it take my bill payments? Well yeah, since I can check they’ve gone through on my account. \n\nWill I trust it to tell me “Yeah regard, I’ll let you return your new jeans after you got too fat for the size you ordered.”? Also yeah. \n\nWill I let it arrange my new phone contract? Y’know what? Maybe. As long as I know I can talk to the friendly native voice if things go wrong. \n\nAs with most things, I think we’re working out where humanity’s bar is.",

The vast majority of questions are routine, but people won't look through a lengthy FAQ, they want someone to hold their hand. A chat bot gives them that interactivity for their simple questions. That makes it quite good at replacing, e.g., call volume to first-level offshore call centers.\n\nOn the other hand, for more complex issues, or questions where the customer doesn't really know the problem, you need a well-trained human agent who is familiar with how the system operates and knows the right questions to ask.",
