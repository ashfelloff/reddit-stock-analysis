Odds are you got lucky to get the big profit, but then made several bad decisions which caused you to fall off a cliff. I'd wager that you don't use a stop loss.\n\nYou should spend some significant time learning the subject before re-entering the trading arena. Sites like Investopedia are helpful. The are lots of great YouTubes out there which teach and explain different facets of trading. I like the SMB Capital videos, and every morning I watch the Morning Market Prep by Right Way Options.  Warrior Trading also has a number of good videos. You probably should try using a play money account for a while to test your ideas before committing more cash. If you are just listening to others to YOLO into things, it is a sure recipe for disaster.\n\nRemember, if this were easy everyone would be doing it instead of working. Good luck.",

Also, get thinkorswim and trade from a computer so you can enter trades quickly and get in at same avgs as the admins. Wit hactive trader on thinkorswim, its so fast and easy to trade. Stop taking your own plays, you clearly are not good at trading yet. The admins in the group are right 80% of the time meaning if you control your size properly you will easily double this account every single month and get back to profitable trading within 6 months.\n\nDM me if you want info but its really easy to find, they have a big IG following and it's worth the $100 bucks or so a month.",
