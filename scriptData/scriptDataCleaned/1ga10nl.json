      "body": "MSTR has increased the bitcoin it owns this year by about 33% and has increased its current share count roughly 15% through convertible debt offers resulting in a current increase of BTC per share of about 18% YTD. If it continues at this rate in 4 years the amount of Bitcoin it holds per share doubles. In 10 years BTC per share is 6x higher. If this happens owning MicroStrategy will give a shareholder more bitcoin than if they just bought a ETF. This is the chance holders are taking. So they are basically taking on low interest debt and buying bitcoin giving them leverage to the price of bitcoin in both directions.\n\nMany institutions that are limited to only investing in bonds want to lend money to MicroStrategy because it offers much better returns than government bonds or any other bonds. The other thing to remember is they have a software business that is working on developing bitcoin applications and have a goal of becoming a bank as well. So the premium to net asset value also reflects the chance that any of these ventures will be profitable, much like how many magnificent 7 companies are worth 30-50x times current earnings in a year. \n\nIf inflation continues to accelerate and BTC continues its trend over the past 15 years MSTR will possibly be the largest company in the world in 10-20 years. If bitcoin stagnates for longer than a 4 year period they could go bankrupt.  If BTC starts doing 10% a year average and doesn't have any explosive years like in the past MSTR might do ok but a Bitcoin ETF would likely out preform it. This is the chance investors are taking.",

The value of a company is the present value of the cash flows that the company will earn in its lifetime. The fact that those cash flows are in the future means that we don‚Äôt know what they are, we can only make educated guesses, which is why the stock price is random to a degree. \n\nBitcoin has no future cash flows. It is an asset with a price because people think it has value, just like gold/silver/beanie babies. The technology behind bitcoin is very real, and will one day maybe lead to some new change, but the price is a question mark. There is no clear relationship. It has the price that it does because people are willing to pay for it and that‚Äôs it.",
