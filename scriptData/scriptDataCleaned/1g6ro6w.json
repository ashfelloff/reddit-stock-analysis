The thing is, he also had a tenacity and time after time continued delivering things that nobody else could.  I used to poke fun of colleagues who rushed out to get the 'new' Tesla but also always thought they were nice looking cars and their owners seemed to love them.   \n\nIt's interesting that it's the Tesla charging network which has emerged as the clear cut winner and best option and all other manufacturers are adopting Tesla standards.  Reviews I've seen indicate the Tesla charging stations are generally the most reliable and fastest (deliver the most and most consistent power) of those out there.\n\nIt's also interesting that in the EV space, there is really no other serious competition to Tesla even with the backlash against musk.  Even the big 3 auto makers really aren't competing with him seriously.  Cyber truck is goofy, sure, but I see them around and I can't recall seeing a Ford Lightning yet.\n\nThen there is the solar home energy and robotics divisions.  Tesla solar energy panels/roofs/battery systems have been in production for a few years.  The robots are presumably coming along but likely not as soon as those wanting them would like.  Will someone else beat them to market though? \n\nOutside of the Tesla brand, how many rocket boosters has Boeing (or anyone else) sent up and then recaptured by landing them gently back in the launching cradle?  Amazon is now beginning to work on deploying a low orbit satellite network but Elon is well ahead of everyone else there too...",

If you were not on board with the Tesla cult you could rationally see Tesla as a nice little company that would be a success if it got solidified at a sort of BMW point in the auto industry.

I lost a boatload of money on NVDA options this way during their down period this year because my timing was off and options expire. Meanwhile, whenever my bets pay off, I always sell out too soon because I'm nervous about having made a profit. I sold out my Apple options early even though I didn't have to, then watched as the stock continued to go up and up and up after I sold out my options that hadn't even expired yet.\n\nDon't be me.\n\nI'm trying not to be me, either.
