One bad trade stays on your mind (“man I should have secured my profits”) and it’s all downhill from there to blowing up your account.\n\nOP already 40x his money from $200, that is outstanding. Why not take at least half of it away and reinvest the other half? Of course, split that half further for Uncle Sam.\n\nReinvesting $4k is a lot higher than the $200 he started off with. There is security of mind knowing you already have $4k safe in ya bank account considering that you originally started out with $200. \n\nAlso considering the steamroller around the corner with uncertainty for inflation and rate cuts: see banks signaling alarms in guidance. \n\nLess pressure = less stress = better decisions = better chance of reproducing results.

Since it's not my money it's not as bad, since the initial 150$ is still in the green. I was down to 500$ 3 weeks ago and now grew it back to 1000$~. I intend on limiting my positions to 8-10% only.
