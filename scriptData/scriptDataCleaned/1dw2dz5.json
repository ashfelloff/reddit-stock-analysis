  "score": 119,
  "selftext": "There hasn't been much buzz about Amazon's AI efforts lately. Everyone's jerking off to Nvidia, Google and Microsoft in the AI race, but I think Amazon's about to pull a fast one on all of us. Here's why:\n\n- That fat $4 billion they yeeted at Anthropic.\n- Anthropic's Claude 3.5 is shitting all over OpenAI's stuff right now. Amazon might've backed the right horse here, and nobody's talking about it.\n- AWS is already the 800-pound gorilla in cloud. Lots of compute to leverage for AI (nobody's bigger than them).\n- Amazon's obviously got a lot of cash to snag top AI talent. \n- The whole AGI race. I wouldn't bet against Amazon pulling some Skynet-level shit out of nowhere. I'm also long the other big tech because of this thesis too, however.\n\nAnyway, as for my position, I own 500 $AMZN shares (and some LEAPs).\n\nTL;DR: $AMZN has big dick AI energy but is keeping it in their pants. Claude 3.5 > GPT-4. AWS + Anthropic = üöÄüöÄüöÄ",
