      "body": "Canoo is heading down the same path as Fisker. They've resorted to massive dilutive financing at horrible terms and they still can't make any cars. The CEO has been selling a grand idea to shareholders for a couple years now and claiming that Canoo is different from other EV companies because they have contracts to sell lots of cars to large companies. Except the terms of those contracts were never revealed and the CEO likely overpromised on the deliverables and now can't meet them. It's easy to promise things but delivering them is a whole other story. They promised to finally start manufacturing at the start of 2024 but haven't released how many cars they have produced and have been staying fairly quiet generally. The best news that they can give shareholders is \"we bought some assets from a bankrupt EV company at a discount\". Their glassdoor reviews are terrible, revealing that the company is in complete chaos. They recently did a final round of debt financing with a mysterious Cayman Islands investor and out of $62m of financing, they netted just $15m. That debt converts to 27m shares, and once that investor starts dumping, the price will continue to go down. The CEO did an interview a few weeks ago and looked like he had ants crawling all over him (lying). He laughed at a question about restoring shareholder confidence. The company created a pretty idea on paper, sold it to investors via a SPAC merger, somehow burned about $1.5 billion, and produced like 20 cars (which are still basically prototypes). I have puts on this company. There seems to be a good amount of retail interest in this company right now, hence the recent rally, but it will fade. And even if it doesn't, the $62m in convertible debt that converts to 27m shares will keep a hard ceiling on how high this stock can go.",
