Pretty much nothing is 100% full proof but if you buy a contract like this they will most likely double in value by the time Nvda hits $150 or so. So with that being said I‚Äôm just giving him a boring way that in current market conditions his money could 2x-3x. If NVIDIA gets to 180 by beginning the holiday season that 160 contract expiring 12/20/24 will be worth around $2500 or so. Could get there faster and be worth more. Just there‚Äôs a very strong possibility he wouldn‚Äôt lose money. If NVIDIA is worth 168 a week before Christmas he didn‚Äôt lose money. If it‚Äôs up more, then he made money. If he can afford to put 300 more in the 150 12/20/24 calls are around 1150. Like .49 delta meaning it‚Äôs going up about $50 each 1 nvda goes up. It got to 141 last week so after this bull/bear fight it should be right back up there. He could double his money by end of summer. If it‚Äôs at 160 after earnings with the Implied volatility the 160 12/20/24 contract in August/September could be worth 1800-2500 then depending on the movement.",

By end of April, I had $1005.  I had a horrible May.  At 430pm on 5/31, I had $69 left.  I was over playing, and holding for the big baggers and the results were only loses.  In May I injected another $500.  I haven‚Äôt put a penny in this month.\n\nSince 6/1, I‚Äôve lived by the following rules:\n\n1. switch to a cash account\n2. never hold a position past closing.\n3. always take profit (even if you miss the peak and end up with 1% gain).\n4. never YOLO a single play.  I use up to 50% of total cash for a move and then the balance on other short term plays\n5. if you get to 30% - 40% profit.  Close and be very happy.\n6. never be greedy.  Take the small wins\n7. retreat is a win.  If my play goes down 20%.  I exit without question.  I can earn it back at some point\n\nGodspeed regards.",

Feeling like you might be able to rebound with $800 when you weren't able to manage $6k is just a feeling.\n\nSuccessful trading isn't about feelings, though there are periods of drawdowns and subsequent rebounds.\n\nRegarding the things you've learned, expand upon that and describe how you think what you've learned will help you rebound.  Were you spending this money to learn a profitable technique and system?  Did the emotional rollercoaster of profits and losses teach you something about mental state and discipline?\n\nNo-one here can provide much advice because you've not actually exposed much about how you came to part with nearly $6k \"options trading\".  Without details of what you've learned, no-one here could possibly have an impression as to your level of skill and probability of inverting that equity curve.\n\nEnsure you're only using money you could lose comfortably and not impact your life in any way, develop a proven back-tested system to trade with and always practice discipline.  Less trades but higher quality, the quality is something quantifiable based on aforementioned back-tested system.\n\nStart a trade journal that details why you entered the trade, what was the profit target, stop loss (if any) and everything in between.\n\nForget everyone else's performance and most of what you hear/see because 99% of the time it's FUD or fake.  Focus on developing your own edge that melds with your characteristics.\n\nYou owe it to your future self to determine whether this is something you seriously want to continue with as a form of wealth preservation and growth - not gambling and generally fooling around without a plan.  No-one else can decide that for you.",
