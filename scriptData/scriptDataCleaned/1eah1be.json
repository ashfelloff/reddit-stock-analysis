  "selftext": "Today TSLA is doing their earnings so all eyes on them, but seriously tho, GOOG is releasing theirs too and it's important that we all fucking come together and look into this. WSB is about good DD, right?\n\nHere‚Äôs what analysts are expecting:\n\n*Earnings per share: $1.84\n\n*Revenue: $84.19 billion\n\nThere are a few other numbers expected in the report:\n\n* YouTube advertising revenue: $8.93 billion\n\n* Google Cloud revenue: $10.20 billion\n\n* Traffic acquisition costs (TAC): $13.54 billion\n\nThis company has really outperformed other internet and software mega caps through the year, so I think they can keep posting steady growth. I expect modest growth in key areas such as cloud and overall revenue, after a quarter of massive leadership moves, AI announcements and market expansions.\n\nLet's take a look at what's been going on during the second quarter. Alphabet saw a number of expansion updates, including for its self-driving car unit Waymo, which opened its service to all San Francisco users. The move was Waymo‚Äôs second citywide rollout, following its 2020 debut in the Phoenix metropolitan area.\n\nIn May, Alphabet held its annual developer conference, where it announced a massive number of new artificial intelligence products including a new large language model called Gemini 1.5 Flash, which can quickly summarize conversations, caption images and videos and extract data from large documents and tables. This shit makes chatGPT look weak. Yes, I will be putting glue on my pizza and I think the recommendation to try eating at least one rock per day isn't *that bad*.\n\nThe company also launched AI Overview, which CEO Sundar Pichai called the biggest change in search in 25 years, to a limited audience, allowing users to see a summary of answers to queries at the very top of Google search. \n\nAlphabet also announced a new DEI hire and finance chief, Anat Ashkenazi, who came from Eli Lily (the world‚Äôs most valuable drugmaker). Ashkenazi begins her tenure on July 31, replacing Ruth Porat, who has taken on a new role as Alphabet president and chief investment officer.  \n\nHowever, they have recently continued layoffs, getting rid of more than 100 people from several teams in Google‚Äôs cloud unit, one of its fastest-growing businesses. The company also laid off at least 200 employees from its ‚ÄúCore‚Äù engineering teams moving some roles to India and Mexico. But honestly, this is just called \"being efficient.\" I'm sure Indians will take over most WFH jobs by 2030, and that's just how capitalism works. \n\nThe one issue is the cybersecurity company Wiz. On Monday they walked away from a $23 billion deal with Google. The acquisition could have really helped bolster Google‚Äôs cloud unit revenue.\n\nWith that being said GOOG 7/26 200c @ 1.10 seems like a good bet. If it's a dud, it's a dud. There will be many other earning plays to throw money in. Who's in with me?",
