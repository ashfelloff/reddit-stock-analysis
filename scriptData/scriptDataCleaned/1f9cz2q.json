      "body": "Friday’s report can and probably will be a mixed bag. The ADP numbers tomorrow should be a good indicator of what the market will want to do if it the numbers suck tho - I don’t expect they will since ADP numbers are usually inaccurate garbage to start with.  I wouldn’t be surprised if ADP shows an increase in jobs.\n\nThe headline number is the most important - if the claims are ridiculous high, it will cause everyone to panic.  The rate is less important - the rate can and will tick up if more people are looking to enter back into the market.  So the % is less important than the headline number. If the headline number comes in line but the rate increases, that would signal the economy isn’t going off the deep end.  If the headline number is high and the rate increases, the economy will look weak and Powell will look like an idiot for not cutting sooner - people will probably cry looking for a 100 basis point cut then (we’ll be lucky to get 50 already).\n\nMag 7 is going to have weakness no matter what as a rate cut will signal the start of the real rotation.  The gut check these days is actually IWM.  When I see QQQ tanking, I immediately check IWM. As long as that’s not tanking as hard, it’s signaling we’re in the rotation away from Tech back into Small caps as managers look for outsized gains.  If IWM tanks with the Qs, we’re looking at a real pullback.  For further confirmation, SPY and DIA should show less downward pressure (and they have) as they are more diverse than the tech centric Qs.\n\nThe jobs report will have a bigger impact on Bond rates which will in turn impact equity markets. The key is the 2/10 spread. It inverted already once which caused the initial sell off, if it inverts again, we may see another 5% shave off.\n\nThe rate cut will signal market weakness and lead to a broad selloff most likely.  The depth of it will depend on the basis points they cut.  Utilities have too many regulatory headwinds due to the election and California just being a dumpster fire.  Their upside will be limited until November after the last parts of the hurricane season pass and election pass.  The best play for the rate cut are regional banks or CRE.  Both benefit due to the upcoming refinancing that starts at the beginning of 2025 and both need it desperately. Without it, there’s a crush that comes starting in January with a high risk of default contagion spreading.",

California lead a lot of country’s regulatory environment and depending on how the rest of wildfire season plays out, it will influence both Utilities and Insurance segments actually.  Insurance won their battle recently but Utilities are in a more precocious position.  Instability in the California market spreads to other markets with any kind of climate fears (Florida, Texas, Carolinas, etc).\n\nIf California targets Utilities again in another bad fire, it’ll shake the confidence in the sector heavily.  There will be a push at some point to bury lines most likely.  If they do it, Hawaii will follow, then more states will get the balls to follow suit. Burying lines takes a tremendous amount of capital and the states probably won’t let them raise rates.  It creates heavy risk that there will be a push in the broader industry for unrecoverable capital expenditures.",
