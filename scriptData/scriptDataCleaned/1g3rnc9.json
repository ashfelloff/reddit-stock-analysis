              "body": "I see it differently.  One of the core interests of conservatives in America (not the average working type, but political strategists types) is to privatize everything, or at least make everything pay to play.  One of those spaces is the public road ways.  Generally they've gone after this with toll roads.  A good example of this is how carpool lanes in California have been shifted to \"FastTrack\" lanes.  The original purpose of taking a lane on the public highway was to encourage ride sharing to alleviate traffic during peak times.  In some places it's effectively been converted to a toll lane instead.\n\nWhat's going to happen in places like California and Texas when robotaxis for private purchase hit the streets is it's going to impact traffic.  The response is probably going to be increase the cost of use through vehicle registration, which wont be a problem for people who are constantly monetizing their cars (regardless of fleet size), but will impact people who just want to drive on the public road.\n\nIt's the exact same thing that has happened with housing.  Excess demand led to cost escalation resulting in higher and higher mortgage payments as people entered the housing market.  That increased pressure for people to look for passive income opportunities like a second house they could rent out (short or long term) or adding an accessory structure.  That initial excess demand pressure was driven in part because of investors and Wall Street buying up properties to turn into income generating sources.\n\nThe long term end result of what is going on with this is that the only people who are going to be able to use the public roads are the people who can afford to, and the only people who are going to be able to afford to are going be wealthy people, companies, and people who are offsetting the cost by monetizing their vehicle.  That's my prediction anyway.",

Should person owning the car make it available through some website and that would direct car to customer? Like putting car to available mode for local taxi company? Then that taxi company would have paid the person? Or would that company have been Tesla? If there is no company then how potential customer could get the car or know that there's car available. If there's company they want their cut.\n\nSecond thing is that if that would have been huge cash cow for car owners wouldn't they then compete against Tesla? If Tesla is making a robotaxi and there are million automatic Teslas picking customers then Tesla's robotaxi is making less money.",
