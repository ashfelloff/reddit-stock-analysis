We know Chinese consumers have been weak, and the company on Monday cited intensified competition as a headwind to sales growth going forward.

Bats, gloves, balls, etc were not cheaper. Checked shoes, obviously mostly counterfeits. Not cheaper unless you want the counterfeits. But i mean... they are obviously counterfeit, no one will be fooled. Checked tools. Not cheaper, just off brand. Checked garage shelfing, again not cheaper if you go with something similar weight on Amazon.\n\nIm sure if we keep digging we will find certain products to be cheaper on Temu but it seems to me that its not exactly a clear cut advantage.\n\nNot sure about their refund policy since I never tried them. But on Alibaba, the sellers go around refund rules by simply lying. Alibaba will side with the seller. Its a seller friendly platform. Ive had this happen to me a couple of times which is why I stopped using it. Its not worth the small savings. Does Temu give the seller any say? Cause if they do, expect them to lie.

For example, at least in my build, if I try to remove one item from my basket, a scary warning modal pops up to ask me if I want to *”cancel”* my order. Not modify. Not that item. Cancel the whole order. When I tap yes, it allows me to delete individual items. The reason this is insidious is that for a lot of people, they have a basket of goods they’ve been researching and they don’t want to do it all over again. The wording is misleading precisely to discourage removing items. I’m sure this improves revenue per order by some percent.\n\nI think they have succeeded because they were willing to be maximally evil, ignoring laws along the way. My guess is that regulators are going to crush them in the coming years.",
