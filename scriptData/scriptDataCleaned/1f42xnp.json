Real talk, buying extremely elevated IV options with a few DTE is quite possibly the worst probability a trader can get themselves into.  You should have just burned your money and roasted marshmallows on it instead.\n\nLook at the option chain for this DTE...  Hardly anyone buying made money.  The call side completely collapsed and only the > $130 puts gained any kind of value.\n\nI sold $123 ATM puts yesterday on the same DTE and they were well ITM this morning but I closed the trade with around 50% profit.  IV is a huge factor in the Black Scholes model and can't be overlooked.\n\nAnyway, thought I would share.  I had to learn the hard way once upon a time as well.

I won't go into that but you can graph it pretty easy on trading platforms like ThinkOrSwim.\n\nThe quick and easy way is comparing the target DTE chain's IV to other DTE IV.  Normal non-meme stocks will have IV throughout all DTE chain's between 20 and 80-ish.  If a DTE IV level is > 100 while the other strikes are much below that, it has elevated IV.\n\nUnder almost all normal circumstances, the DTE closest to an earnings will elevate in IV.  Yesterday with NVDA the Friday expiration was at Captain Insano ranges compared to the others.\n\nI am leaving meme stocks out of it because the IV on those are completely whack much of the time.  I'm only speaking about normal, large and highly liquid companies.  Trading volatility on meme stocks is an entirely different animal.",

Thus, if you were trading ES which is 10x bigger, you'd be looking at $12.50 per tick movement.\n\nNQ = QQQ\n\nMNQ = 1/10th of NQ. It moves also in .25 tick increments, per 1 point. You make/lose 50 cents per tick, or $5 bucks if trading NQ, which is 10x bigger than the micro MNQ counterpart.\n\n.25 increments per point, so 1 point = 4 ticks. You can calculate your P/L in ticks or points if you wish. Knowing the values you can say:\n\nMNQ 1 tick (.25) = 50 cents, 1 point (4 x .25) = $2\n\nMES 1 tick (.25) = $1.25, thus 1 point also 4x .25 = $5\n\nTherefore, you could downsize to literally a single micro contract of MES or MNQ. This eliminates the \"too fast\" movement of your P/L.\n\nThe SPY and ES/MES charts move at almost identical speeds. Same goes for QQQ and its counterparts, NQ/MNQ.\n\nSure, if you grabbed 48 NQ contracts you'd likely get wiped out in a few seconds if you got the direction wrong. And the gains would be glorious, but you'd have to get it EXACTLY right. Which is like, never.\n\nI usually trade with about 1-5 micros, rarely 1-2 of the \"big boys\" (ES or NQ)\n\nOptions do not give you definite ways to calculate your P/L. But you know how much you'll lose, which is usually -99% of what you paid in premium. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)\n\nFutures are straight forward. It's much simpler than you think. \n\nNo PDT, dont need 25k to day trade, no \"1-2 days for cash to settle after taking a trade\" just fucking trade.\n\nYes, there is margin requirements. But that is just like a \"bond\" for opening a position. Once you close, that money comes back to your account instantly, plus (or minus) your gains.\n\nIt is so fucking easy, the only reason people don't do it is because RH sucks a dick and doesn't offer it. \n\n1 out of a million are getting rich on options on WSB.\n\nBut you could literally day trade your way to a larger account without the restraints of:\n\n1) PDT\n\n2) Expirations\n\n3) Unknown gains expected\n\n4) gap downs/ gap ups (futures can have stop losses to save your ass on overnight moves against your position)\n\n5) can be traded with a smol account, I'm talking literally 200 bucks to 5000 bucks or more if you wish. Depends on your risk tolerance.\n\n6) Markets open wayyy more time\n\nThats all I can think of right now.",

Not quite sure about that because they certainly seem to fluctuate almost randomly and seemingly never go up in value despite the direction being correct.\n\nSelling options involves a whole other approach and you basically already have to have money, for example a put credit spread (I believe that’s the term) involves something like a 2k account selling a low number of contracts and potentially pocketing a couple hundred bucks…that isn’t the kind of trading people want to do, 😂. They want the 1k worth of OOM option contracts that 🚀after an earnings call bumps the stock 30%.\n\nWhat’s the Silicon Valley quote, “I don’t want to make a little bit of money every day, I wanna make a fuck ton of money all at once!”",
