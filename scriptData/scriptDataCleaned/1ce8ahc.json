Number 3 is clever and why people who poo poo chatbots are lying to themselves.\n\n\n\nBut the reason the Fed can't control inflation is because the cost of business loans isn't what gave us inflation. So changing that cost (interest rates) doesn't do much.\n\nAnd the reason its indirect effect has been so mild is because there's so much existing debt that paying higher interest on debt is adding money to the economy, offsetting the reduced volume of loans caused by high rates.\n\nWe can tackle long term inflation causes by spending more and building infrastructure and investing in more output. But short term inflation will have to be managed by Congress changing taxation and spending. And even then, businesses lag 6-18 months in making price decisions (aka the real life agents of what is inflation) so there's no a lot of point in fighting short term inflation.ttt",

No written well, but is true.\n\nNumber 3 is a clever analogy based on the Fed's attempt at \"forward expectations\" (this is a technical economics term). It's a pretty dubious concept given how little businesses reprice their goods based on aggregate future inflation forecasts (as in, not at all). Clever, but not true. We can substitute \"next song\" for like, \"big buildup with a drop that doesn't deliver\".\n\nNumber 4 is both true and worded well. \n\nWeirdly all 4 matrix quadrants are represented there.
