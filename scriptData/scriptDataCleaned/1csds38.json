  "selftext": "Fellow regards,\n\nRumble ($RUM) - also known as the streaming platform used by sigmas like Tate & Sneako - reported earnings tonight and guess what, they were shite!\n\n1. Earnings Recap: Global monthly active users dropped from 67 to 50 million, missing estimates with 17 million in Q1 revenue, which totals to a loss north of 40 million. Stock still sits comfortably at 2 billion market cap with no real growth perspective, given that they are unable to produce any sustainable viewership and instead continue to burn cash.\n\n2. Worth mentioning that they started their 2nd attempt to sue $GOOGL for a billion $$$, a pathetic attempt to potentially get back cash and fuel their cash burning operations a bit longer.\n\nNote: No position yet, curious how you‘d play that given that short-interest is rather high at 18% and the current environment rather allowing these names to shoot up instead of being drilled down.",
