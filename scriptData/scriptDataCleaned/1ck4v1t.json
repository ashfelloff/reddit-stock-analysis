  "score": 857,
  "selftext": "A little backstory, a friend told me about options trading and they were doing very well (quadrupled their portfolio in a month). Looked like they were making money pretty easily, so I started to do the same and well… I guess you could say it backfired nearly every time. Mostly of the spikes and drops were me going all in on SOFI, then I got screwed on Q1 earnings. I’m debating if I should just focus on buying stocks and focus mostly on dividend growth, or if there’s a way to shoot myself out of this 99% hole. ",

Sold 4 the day before and doubled my investment. Then kept 2 and it absolutely fucking rocketed.\n\nBetter if I'd held all 6? Sure. But my risk was managed and those 2 calls went from $140 entry price to $2200 exit price overnight.\n\nJust one way to consider approaching things. What I would say is not to ever buy a call expiring in the same week they expire. If you can't afford to play, don't.

If the majority of people were actually making money trading options or day trading they wouldn't be taking the time to be making videos and designing courses. They would just... make money instead which is much easier. So why do we still take the plunge and believe this time will be different? Well... it's human nature. We want to believe that in one swoop we will change our luck and come out on top. It rarely happens, 99% of the time increasing your wealth is slow and takes decades. But that's boring and not exciting as the possibility of flexing in your 20's. So what should you do? Invest in yourself to make more money, buy index funds with 90% of your savings and take the other 10% you saved and pick your poison (blackjack, roulette, options trading, state lottery).
