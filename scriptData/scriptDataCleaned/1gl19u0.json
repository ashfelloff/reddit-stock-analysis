                  "body": "Hey so on a serious note. You do not believe there is any validity to technical analysis.?\n\n I agree that in the large scheme of things it is just a made up thing. But when so many people start trading and believing in the same thing, it becomes more real and less coincidence. How does a stock respect a trendline so much if not for a million other retail traders drawing that same line and making plays off of that. This is just a simple example of course but there are many more. To me it is psychology based if anything. Figuring out what a large group of people are likely going to do if a,b, or c happens is definitely paramount to profiting off swing and scalp trades.\n\n It's a snowball effect as well. Let's say a big institution decides they are going to invest now in something, the orders have to executed which in turn raises price, retail people see this and jump on the bandwagon, just so happens that this breaks resistance or some other key level, more people get in on the trade to ride up. It breaks through a trenline prompting more to get in, an engulfing pattern triggers more etc. Well now the stock is a bit overvalued for the day let's say and people want to take profit, they are likely to take it at key level, that key level is part of basic technical analysis in many instances. \n\nI would argue all of this creates \"edge\" on top of financial information pertaining to the stock. But human psychology is a huge part. The other is risk management. And to your credit, it is like gambling in that aspect. If I get in on a 50/50 and my returns are above 2 to 1 then I'm playing a winning game. In the long run of numbers I will likely be ahead.",

                      "body": "Yes, there is a psychological aspect to stock movements but they are neither consistent nor predictable so trading purely on technical is not sound and not something that is done by professionals. Maybe back in the olden days there were clearer patterns but in today‚Äôs computerized markets you can bet every obvious signal has been dissected and exploited by quants/algos a hundred times over and relationships have broken down. Consider that is who you are likely trading against as a retail investor. \n\nLooking at RSI and whatnot gives some professionals (generally of the older cohort) extra comfort as a secondary or tertiary factor. But there is always something more solid anchoring the investment decision. Just imagine how stupid anyone risking institutional capital would sound telling their bosses  ‚Äúhey I bought this stock because the Batman signal that appears when you zoom out to 3 months is very bullish‚Äù. But this kind of logic is somehow perfectly reasonable to the retail trader crowd from what I‚Äôve seen. \n\nWhat I meant was I think it‚Äôs odd that people try to ‚Äúmaster‚Äù and trade on technical analysis courses purchased from internet gurus (frauds). Why not pick up any book on financial analysis and develop an actual investment process that is logical and repeatable? My suspicion is that people think trading is more fun when they are short-term gambling but they are afraid to admit that is what they are doing. But you have to know most stocks in the medium-long term move on a fundamentals\n\nIn other words, my advice is learn to actually invest first and then consider sprinkling on some technical analysis if that‚Äôs what you want to do.",
