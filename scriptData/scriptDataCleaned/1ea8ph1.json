          "body": "I can't speak to any of that, but I can say that I had colleagues who were grounded - in a major US airport - for nearly 48 hours, without Delta offering refunds or concrete solutions. After multiple cancellations, they rented a car and drove over 12 hours back home. They are filing a formal DoT complaint. \n\nThe EU is not perfect, but their airline passenger rights regulations would've guaranteed flight delay compensation plus a refund after just 5 hours of non-weather-related delays. Not the case in the U.S. - and as a result the inconvenienced passenger gets shafted. I don't usually err on the side of more regulation, but the older I get the more it seems things are getting worse for airline passengers in this country, and something has to change.",
