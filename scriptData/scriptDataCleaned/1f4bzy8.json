Given that they spend a few billion on R&D annually and dividends and are buying back up to $50bn in shares that too when the stock is insanely expensive, I think they're really trying to return all of the excess capital to shareholders as they can afford to.\n\nAnother important thing that Jensen mentioned is that datacentre TCO goes down with new generations of silicon because they get more performance per watt per cubic metre of space in the datacentres. So while yes power draw goes up, you get more performance out of your system than the excess power drawn. So datacentre companies have an incentive to keep the train running.",
