You can then save them in your speculative watchlist and do some research on them , float, insider sales, history of management , ownership(never trade non US stocks ).\n\nYou 'll find out that most of those heavy volume gainers are shitty , garbage pump and dump. So be careful with them and don't feel bad for not catching them before they pop.  I think I caught like $1 move on LUNR and sold it ,  same with RKLB.\n\nThose meme stocks are really easy to find but they are very difficult to trade .  I 've been trading , daytrading , for many years and I'm still very careful about trading them .\n\nI use IBKR screener .\n\nANd stay away from biotech , 90% of  those premarket heavy movers are biotech pump and dumps,   If I ever trade them I literally buy $400 worth of a stock with a 10% stop loss when I see volume contraction and price pull back .

I used to own lunr many times and had like 25% loss on it before it went up like that .  One  tiny mistake and lunr can be a  $1 company again .\n\nThe only way to find stocks like that before they start popping up on heavy volume is by  specializing  in a specific  industry . For example you gonna specialize in space exploration/industry .  Make a list of all the companies . Do a deep dive, into finance, management , CEO , earnings, debt , insider transactions etc  .  Specialize , very narrow specialization and you might find the next new big thing but most of them will go nowhere .",

If you're in very specific programs for assistance for housing, childcare, etc. may only apply to household incomes under a certain amount. Your take home money would *still be greater,* but it's possible that the value of those welfare programs is higher than the additional take home.

But again, those calls would've been worthless if NKE didn't randomly move up 5% overnight, and NKE is a slow moving, so the expectation was zero. then news made it jump.\n\nTLDR: the plays on the market that make money like this are the plays that are super cheap due to low expectation of pay out, combined with either the exact correct earnings report or news report that sends the stock moving super hard in the right direction to make it pay out\n\nOP's calls printed because on aug 5 they were dirt cheap, and just two days later with still another 5 months left, the stock was 50 cents from the strike.",
