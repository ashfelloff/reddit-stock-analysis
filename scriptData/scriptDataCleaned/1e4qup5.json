              "body": "Why do you people always buy week of calls???\n\nMy friend, when you buy options you pay for 2 things: volatility and time. \n\nYou buy week of calls, sure, you’re not paying much for time, but you’re paying a shit ton for volatility. Now of course a lot of that volatility is already priced in because every single person already knows earnings are a high volatility event. That means you need to not only overcome your cost, but also the implied volatility.\n\nIf I buy calls 3 weeks out, implied volatility over three weeks is actually meaningful past a single event. If I buy calls week of, that implied volatility is going to crumple the position right after earnings unless there’s some insane blowout information, and there’s a high chance of falling under that volatility line\n\nNot financial advice but week of calls are just bat shit insane unless you fully understand the implied volatility",

Positive news after earnings as well. \n\nWall Street has been modeling decreasing numbers and Tesla just surprised them. That should be a signal (as we saw in the price action recently). The money on the short side was there to be made but shorts got greedy and didn’t take as much as they should, have if any at all, when Tesla was sub 150. \n\nIf TSLA beats eps and rev with inventories declining and margins stabilizing, oh baby we are headed to $300. \n\nElon just got model 3 LR (upgraded) to $35,000 price point over 300 miles range. No one is close to them. \n\nWorried about range. Well now you can get a 50 miles of range boost for a one time fee $2,000. They are innovating way faster and harder than any other EV offering out there. \n\nThey have two category killers now. Model y and model 3. Hell even cybertruck is taking top spot in EV truck sales. \n\nThis stock is a long game. It’s extremely hard to profit off of it without following it. \n\nI’ve been in it for 5+ years now. I like the setup for q2 earnings. And if it falls that will be your chance to load up for the next phase of the stock. But I think with all the negative sentiment built up and the mental blockages this stock has caused some, there is a higher probability of a good reaction.",
