I’m one of the tards that averaged down on calls expiring next week for IWM and SPY hoping for a similar recovery from Thursday after the CPI release. You guys think poppa powell gonna let this slide? who doubled up on puts and who averaged down on their calls that went to shambles? ",

Its difficult to close a losing position because you know that when you do it's going to reverse, like Thursday,  but when you hang on it doesn't. Tough business.  But at least position sizing kept me out of real trouble.",

I think first rate cut pushed to July. Whether they cut or not this year, markets will gain at least some if companies continue reporting strong returns. If rate cuts come in June or July, then markets will get enough new capital from banks/funds moving capital from bond markets into equities that we should see bigger gains thru the end of year, and also strong gains in 2025 if rate cuts continue (as long as economy continues showing its strength).",
