Hindsight is 20/20, but it shouldn't have been hard to see that as long as they didn't absolutely shit the bed on earnings and Elon didn't walk out tell everyone to fuck off they were going to \"moon\".  Which is still $50 shy of the December price point.  They had no where to go but up.\n\nPLTR on the other hand coming of a low on April 20 and on earnings day was going up all day, which was awesome, why wouldn't it continue, right?  Their guidance wasn't terrible but everyone saw them for what they are, they used AI in every sentence but they are consumers of AI products and not necessarily producers, there isn't a lot of room for growth, so yeah the stock tanked after earnings and I lost my shirt.\n\nHOOD will be interesting today, it's moving back up to a recent high of $20.
