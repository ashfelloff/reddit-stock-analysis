They all rely on the spinning up of newly enriched Uranium, and they don't do that in house. That makes for a more costly, pro-proliferation, higher waste business model. Oklo reactors are also theoretically safer for a couple reasons. They are not pressurized. There are not as many moving parts associated with their design (no rods, no cooling pumps, etc) just natural flow through expansion and contraction and cooling from naturally generated convection currents. Molten salt is perfectly fine being at the required operating temperature. These facts all differ from the other SMRs.\n\nOklo's biggest hurdle will be regulatory. The NRC has a long precedent in reviewing light water pressurized reactors such as those brought forth by NuScale, but not so much time reviewing molten salt reactors for approval. The NRC as a regulatory body is quite picky and resistant to new ideas. They are also not really incentivized to approve new plans.

They just didn’t know what they were doing and weren’t able to supply basic information that they should’ve had going into licensing and at least should have been able to provide when the NRC requested it.\n\n If you invest in Oklo, you’re probably going to get burned. Their only advantage is that Sam Altman is backing them now, which will make it harder for them to go under.\n\nAlso, Kairos is headed by nuclear engineer PhDs and professors from Berkeley who know what they’re doing and have approved CPAs for their test reactors. Just because they’re in the bay area doesn’t mean they’re silicon valley trash.",

They received backing anyways, from very prominent people. That's because their concept would pave the way for accessing and utilizing fuel waste. A hurdle that none of the other companies you listed had to deal with. They are trailblazing a path to a new potential market.\n\nKairos seems great. I went to Berkeley though. Berkeley professors do not always know what they are doing. Some of them are so smart, they are stupid. However, I am not arguing with you that Kairos might also be a good investment in the future if they go public.",
