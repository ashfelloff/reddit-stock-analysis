  "selftext": "The United States under the Biden administration is leading something of a coalition and is trying to squeeze the Chinese out of the market. The goal is very simply to prevent the Chinese from swamping industries that the Biden Administration is attempting to develop both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe Chinese will respond to this by increasing their subsidies even more than they already do, which will force those involved to simply up their tariffs, they‚Äôll then attempt to put it in any market they can, which will really only be the developing world.\n\nIn Europe, it isn't a question of whether they'll be tariffs but how high. Under the European Commission, 40% is what's likely as of right now, though the chances of that increasing is relatively high.\n\nAnd as China continues to age on top of tariifs, cheap goods will slowly disappear and eventually reemerge with a ‚ÄòMade in Mexico‚Äô or ‚ÄòMade in Vietnam‚Äô sticker in about a decade if everything goes right.",
