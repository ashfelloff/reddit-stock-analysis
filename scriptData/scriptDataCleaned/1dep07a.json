Golden Gate broke the company into 2 and hurt them by doing land leasebacks when the properties were already owned free and clear.  Then Thai Union screwed Red Lobster by forcing supply to come mainly from them and not other suppliers. This helped Thai Union books and helped kill off Red Lobsters' little bit of profitability. Especially when there were better prices elsewhere. So when Thai Union said they took a loss on that investment, that's false. It's all on how you look at it.",

They'd have to add about 354M shares to the pool of 3.19B shares, which would probably dilute the share price down by about 13.4% (if it was done today), or from $177 down to ~$155 (although it isn't right away and probably not all at once).\n\nAs the market cap goes down, this percentage gets larger  for share price departure from baseline (and if it goes up, it gets smaller).\n\nThat said, boomer casino relies heavily on sentiment and timing - a look around has people celebrating this as bullish, so maybe Tesla goes to a trillion and when he takes his bonus the depression is north of where it is today aggregate.\n\nIt's a good deal... For Elon Musk. Imo he's still just using shareholders like his personal wallet, or literal bag holders.\n\nE: I would invite readers to learn about \"outstanding shares\" and their relevance to market capitalization, as this seems to be entirely misunderstood by a handful of commenters.
