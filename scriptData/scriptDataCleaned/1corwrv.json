It's very different when it's not on the public market, and frankly the stock market sentiment doesn't affect early venture rounds.\n\nThe value of productivity-related AI is as simple as the subscription cost is less than the potential reduction in salary and hiring costs. If it doesn't work out financially companies are not gonna subscribe to them. Start-ups may be burning money in salaries, but investors need to see that there's an actual margin over the scalable AI service to consider investing.",

They are incredibly good at producing logic in scripting languages, and probably have something like the level of a high-school senior or college freshman at more complex coding tasks.
