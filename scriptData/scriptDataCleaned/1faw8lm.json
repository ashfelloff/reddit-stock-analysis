However, we have had rolling recessions in manufacturing. My company is doing well this year, but SMI manufacturing PMI would indicate that manufacturing is still slow. Inventories are going down. Our customers are ordering parts they haven’t for a while. I like what I see. With the unemployment rate still being fairly low, consumers still have a normal level of money to spend. The free money from Covid is almost gone so there has been some slowdown in consumer spending, but not recession horrible. The fear of recession is worse than the recession itself. Quite often, you don’t know the recession has happened until it’s over.",

The common logic is that the short term bond yields start to drop as they get bought up as a safe haven.  Even the recessions in the 80s the yield curve uninverting was a sign that you were already in a recession. \n\nSo if I can simplify it, inverting is a sign it will happen, uninverting is a sign that it's imminent.",
