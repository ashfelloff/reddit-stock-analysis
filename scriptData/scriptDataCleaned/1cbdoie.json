          "body": "IV is a measure of uncertainty in a stock. Uncertainty happens when folks are expecting the stock to make big moves around a certain time, like earnings dates, or release of car sales numbers.\n\nSpeculators buy or sell lots of options that expire a few days after that date for far out of the money(compared to regular weeks) calls or puts, usually the next Friday evening. IV tracks that and hence goes up. Before the event happens, time value and IV are high, because of anticipation. After the event happens, the IV and time value gets crushed, because earnings are known now, so the stock gets more 'boring', and less likely to make big moves till Friday in the eyes of option traders(it's just like another normal week now).\n\nSo you could end up predicting the right direction after a big event, but still have options' value get knocked down a lot. For example, if folks have $165 calls for Tesla, and the stock goes $10 up tomorrow morning to $155, the calls may still be worth much lower than it was today morning, because the earnings surprise has passed and the likelihood of a big pump in the next 3 days is minimal compared to what it was today morning when the stock was at $145. This is called IV crush. Usually people are surprised saying \"hey there's still 3 days, it could pump, why did the value drop so low after the stock went up after earnings\". But in the markets eyes it's much less likely to pump that high than it was before earnings were released.",
