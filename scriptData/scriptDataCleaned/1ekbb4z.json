I gave it 30 minutes she was rolling. I didnât feel anything so I ate more. I gave it another 30 minutes I still didnât feel anything. I ate the rest of that bread. Then I smoked a joint. \n\nYâall I didnât even understand the concept of violently high. I went to the video store with my sister and like weâre walking around and suddenly I was like I have to go outside. I vomited all over the parking lot. Then I went home and fell asleep.
