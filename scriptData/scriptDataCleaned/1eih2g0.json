Let me take you down memory lane. GDP for Q3 2007 was 3.8%. That was less than 4 months before the 2008 Recession officially began. \n\n[https://www.bea.gov/index.php/news/2007/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2007-advance-estimates](https://www.bea.gov/index.php/news/2007/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2007-advance-estimates)\n\nThe economy doesn't ease into a recession. It always rams into it (because of herd mentality). Employers are afraid to lay off, but suddenly they all start doing it when they see their colleagues are now doing it.",
