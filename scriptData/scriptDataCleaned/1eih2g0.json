Let me take you down memory lane. GDP for Q3 2007 was 3.8%. That was less than 4 months before the 2008 Recession officially began. \n\n[https://www.bea.gov/index.php/news/2007/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2007-advance-estimates](https://www.bea.gov/index.php/news/2007/gross-domestic-product-third-quarter-2007-advance-estimates)\n\nThe economy doesn't ease into a recession.

      "body": "Situation was different then.  The selloff was because monetarists don't understand how the federal funds rate works.  To them, raising interest rates means economic collapse.  The treasury department shifted everything to short term instruments long before October 2022, so as soon as rates went as rates went up, yields started to exponentially increase. Treasury debt holders then started investing that money in the stock market right away, and we've generally had a rally ever since.  All of this was driven by monetary policy and wasn't really reflective of the economy.\n\nNow, the economy is slowing.  Rates have been steady for a while, which means treasury interest payments are flat.  The fiscal deficit is also trending down.  \n\nThis is the first genuine economic slowdown in some time.  The solution is largely political, and it's hard to say what is going to happen.",
