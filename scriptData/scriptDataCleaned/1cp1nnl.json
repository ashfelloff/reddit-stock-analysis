At first, NVDA made crazy $ while people adopted GPUs for gaming - Eventually most gamers had an NVDA/ATI card and the rate of adoption decreased. Gamers would wait for every 2nd or 3rd iteration to upgrade. It didn't make much of a $/performance change to upgrade every time NVDA released a new chip. NVDA almost went out of business. But then Corn was introduced and caused a resurgence in chip sales for mining.\n\nSame will happen with AI. I think META is spending \\~$35 Billion to stock up on chips. They obviously aren't going to do that every year with every new NVDA chip release. Eventually, once they are in a good place with hardware, they will just go through upgrade cycles - every year upgrading some % of their slowest/least energy efficient chips. Not doing a complete overhaul.\n\nThe big question - how long until everyone is pretty much stocked up? That's when NVDA will reprice downward and find a new range.",

I dunno if you've ever worked in a non-tech related company but \"change in the way they do business\" is the exact opposite of what they do best.\n\nI work in industrial construction, multi billion dollar jobs. there are all these small tech companies trying to sell the client and contractors AI and apps and all kinds of little dickshit stuff, and sure they pick up a few \"business development\" contracts here and there. But they (the companies and their products) are more of a nuisance than anything most of the time and 90% of the time things just go back to the way they were before and the billions of dollars of maintenance and construction work just keeps on trucking.\n\nI'm just not understanding where the value is going to come from yet. Even my partner who works in tech complains about AI, like her boss half forces the employees to use it because it \"saves time\" when you have to write generic reports but then she finds out the AI written stuff is littered with errors because the data is not set up properly or was garbage in the first place and she has to comb through it anyways and it ends up taking longer than if she had just done it properly herself. I know it's anecdotal but all the experience I have with it in my real life the only people trying really trying to sell it as the next big thing come off like greasy car salespeople who know they are trying to get you to use garbage, or bosses trying to shove it down employees throats because some exec got sold by one of these snake oil sales people and spent money on it so now they are trying to justify the cost of it.",
