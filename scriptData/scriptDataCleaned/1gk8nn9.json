They are counted on government very recent government promises.  The Chips act wasn't an awarded contract, and them crying about getting something they knew nothing about 5 years ago makes them look desperate and weak.  Also firing 15k employees is not a good sign of growth.  They need help badly.  \n\nEven though they are both tech companies, they are still very different, so it's hard to compare the two.  Intel also fumbled on taking advantage of AI early on and was very late to the GPU market.  \n\nFor the last couple of years, Palantir has been impressively consistent.  It wouldn't surprise me if they were picked up by someone who could afford them in the next couple of years.",
