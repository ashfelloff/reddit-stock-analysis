  "selftext": "I’d like to hear from the community here on this topic - why does it seem (to me, at least) that investment media generate so much content about REITs? I feel they’re right up there with big tech, commodities, and whatever the hot flavor of the quarter is in terms of content. \n\nIs it just that they’re targeting older investors who think they are “safer” investments due to being dividend producers and/or being “real estate”? Is it some bias and/or partnerships with the REIT companies? Something else?  ",

The fear of a continued decline in demand is very much priced in, and most office REITs are deleveraging aggressively, and should be able to survive a surge in vacancies.\n\nOther REITs like datacenters, cell towers, self storage, etc are performing very well, many of them growing FFO YoY faster than inflation, but are still very cheap.\n\nIf you buy a market cap weighted index of REITs, only about 5% of it is offices, because they're so cheap. You get a price/FFO average of about 12.6X, or a 8% FFO yield.\n\nIf we assume interest rates remain elevated(unlikely) and the slowdown we're seeing in offices continues rather than a recovery, such that the current low FFO growth rate average of 5% continues, that comes out to a 13% annualized return over the next decade.\n\nContrast that with the S&P500 expected to return between 4-5% over the next decade, REITs pose a great opportunity for contrarian investors seeking to enhance returns.",
