THANKS.**\n\n\n\nThere are 136k contracts open on 130 calls for 8/30 expiration. 80k open on 140 calls.\n\nNothing close on put side (30k at 125 put, 64k at 120 put).\n\nThey will not allow those calls to wind up ITM. Retail cannot be allowed to win at that scale.\n\nCalling flat, all contracts IV crushed.\n\nPosition: iron condor Sell 140C Buy 150C/ Sell 120P Buy 110P. all 8/30 expiration.\n\nFor morons - THIS MEANS I AM BETTING ON FLAT PRICE WITH SOME PROTECTION TO PREVENT CRAZY LOSSES IF THINGS GO WILD IN EITHER DIRECTION.\n\nEDIT - \"They\" is flippant hyperbole to describe the algos controlled by MM and hedge funds and institutions, collectively\n\nStop saying \"buy shares idiot\" this isnt WallStreetPrudentInvestments",

So yes, there may be significant hedge funds doing what you're saying but if they are shorting it (which would be absolutely moronic) they would have to unwind those shorts which would only drive the stock price further up.

Well that was completely ignored, and now everyone is treating it like it’s true, despite Nvidia’s denial. \nThe point being there’s SO MUCH MORE FUD this ER than any of NVIDIA’s other earnings reports. Nobody thought they’d explode like this, and honestly it sort of feels like the MM’s are trying to play “catch-up” on the AI BOOM that they thought wouldn’t amount to anything. There are so many more FUD articles about this “AI cycle” because nobody knows what or how it is going to cycle yet. \nThen there’s Jensen Huang, who schedules an exclusive live interview with Bloomberg immediately following the ER call. Sorry, but you don’t do that if your numbers meets/misses expectations. If you were CEO would YOU schedule an interview immediately after the earnings call to discuss why your company failed to meet expectations?
