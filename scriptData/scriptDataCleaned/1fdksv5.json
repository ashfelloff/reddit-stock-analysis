  "selftext": "Sept 10 (Reuters) - Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab said on Tuesday it delivered 40 commercial jets in August, up five from the same month in 2023 when it struggled with a manufacturing defect on its 737 MAX, as the U.S. planemaker eyes higher output under new CEO Kelly Ortberg.\n\nBoeing has pledged to boost production of its strongest selling jet, the MAX, to 38 per month by year's end.\n\nBut the planemaker faces obstacles such as a possible strike as early as Friday by more than 32,000 Seattle-area and Portland factory workers who vote on a new deal Sept. 12.\n\nThe U.S. planemaker is operating a slower assembly line since a Jan. 5 in-flight blowout, opens new tab of a door plug on a 737 MAX 9 jet that heightened regulatory scrutiny.\n\nBoeing handed over 32 MAX jets to customers last month, including nine deliveries to customers in China, the most since December 2019.\n\nBoeing delivered 43 commercial jets in July, including 31 MAX jets.\n\nInvestors closely watch delivery numbers, as airplane makers receive the majority of payment for an aircraft when it is transferred to a customer.\n\nAfter adjustments to reflect the backlog, Boeing reported adjusted net orders for the month of 24.\n\nThat brought Boeing's gross order total so far this year through August 31 to 250. After removing cancellations and conversions, Boeing posted a net total of 207 orders since the start of 2024.\n\nFollowing further accounting adjustments, Boeing reported adjusted net orders of 122 airplanes so far this year.\n\nYear to date through August 31, Boeing delivered 258 airplanes, including 198 MAX jets.\n\nEuropean rival Airbus (AIR.PA), opens new tab said last week it had delivered 47 aircraft in August, down from 77 in July, to reach 447 so far this year.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-delivers-40-jets-august-up-5-year-ago-2024-09-10/",
