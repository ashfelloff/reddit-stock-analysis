When I was trading crypto I was bringing in 1k to 20k per day. Then it started being 10k losses over and over until I was bankrupt. I had about 20 bitcoin and lost them all on bybit. This was when Bitcoin was around 7k. I really wish I just HODL’d them instead. I’d have a clean mil to a mil and a half. Instead, I lost a few hundred thousand dollars, literally everything I had, and started life over essentially. It was a dark time in my life. It still is if I think about it anywho. I gave up trading after that. Well that’s not entirely true. I bought 50k of a pharmaceutical company and 1 dollar and it is currently at  6 cents I believe. I don’t know when to just sell and take a loss because I’ve done that before and then it goes back up. I will leave it to the professionals from now on I think.",

              "body": "\n\n\"This is an intriguing strategy. Once again, you're leveraging the overall market sentiment. The jobless claims report came in somewhat positive, but not enough to sustain a rally. The market briefly spiked upward before reversing, leading to a sell-off. I had SPY puts, which I purchased the day before with a strike price of 545 and a 0DTE expiration. When the market faked an upward move, the premium on my put contracts lost 60% of their value. In hindsight, understanding your strategy better, that would have been an ideal time to buy moreeee average down and lower my cost basis—but I didn’t. \n\nAs we all know, the market then started selling off, and my puts went in the money. I eventually sold my contracts at prices of 3.70, 4.15, and later, around 5. I typically don’t have the nerve to wait for the highest point of appreciation, so I stagger my exits, selling about 30% once I reach a 50%-100% return. The volatility worked in my favor this time.\n\nLooking ahead, I’m anticipating price swings and have entered the weekend fairly flat, with the exception of small short positions in ORCL and PDF.\"",

Yes we had $20 in downwards movement between 2 days, in that same mindset my puts won’t be as sure this week. I’m actually going expecting sideways and possibly an up day.\n\nI feel strongly NVDA will cause some chaos. It will hit $100 or under and hit a spring. A lot of the market will follow the bounce, but it won’t come back as high as its early August bounce. Spy is just a general reflection of the rest of the market. Which will bounce around with it\n\nDo I think his plays are cooked? No. But I absolutely would have taken profits before the weekend decay. Readjust Monday.
