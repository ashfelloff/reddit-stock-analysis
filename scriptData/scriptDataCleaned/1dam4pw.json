I’ll let you know how regarded I am come 6/14. Anyone here bet the farm on INTC?",

I've seen projections that go as low as 15.\n\nWith all the construction they have going on, it depends on how smoothly it progresses and how quickly their investments start to impact earnings.\n\nI like their new products and their investments into new fabs. With the policy changes in the us, they could challenge tsmc for the top spot in coming years. But it's going to be a while still before production is fully ramped up and has an effect on earnings.\n\nConsidering we're still at the \"if\" stage and not near the \"when\" stage yet, I think there's more downward pressures in the short term. It's looking good, but i think if you get in now, you may wind up being a bag holder waiting for good news that isn't yet guaranteed.\n\nThere's a ton of new fabs being built out. The semi conductor industry also tends to overbuild, and not all new fabs are as in demand as their projections indicated.  Intel isn't guaranteed to be the leader with their adoption of asml's latest tech either. It worked out for tsmc, but it remains to be seen if Intel gets rewarded the same way tsmc did for early adoption.",
