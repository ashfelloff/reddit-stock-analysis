Actually AAPL, NFLX and AMZN all have a forward PE for 2025 of around 30 and are way above the average S&P PE.\n\nIt does make somewhat sense as everyone jumped on the AI bandwagon and only now people are questioning how these companies recoup these billion $ investments.\n\nAnother thing was that people saw no real other option than invest in these large IT companies as with the current FED rate it just doesn't really suit small caps and to some extend midcaps as they just don't have that much cashflow usually.\n\nHowever now it seems like there finally might be a rate cut soon and given that small caps even with higher EPS growth than the large FAANGM companies are dirt cheap (some with PE of around 10) a general rotation has also started.\n\nSo less emphasize on these expensive Top 7 or so companies and more money into small and mid caps.",
