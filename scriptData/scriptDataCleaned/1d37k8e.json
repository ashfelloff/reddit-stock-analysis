Closest thing was microsoft, but when I found out I could only get like a share or two or whatever, I picked another \"videogame\" stock and found nvidia, which I recognized from quite a few PC game startup screens. \n\n\nAaaaaaand then I forgot about it until February of this year.",

I bought an Nvidia GPU many years back and my mom happened to call the same day and we ended up talking about stocks because she wanted to put her money into something. I just blurted out Nvidia in passing. Nothing serious, but I guess she dumped some coin into it. She never specified how much or when she bought it.\n\nShe tried to write me a check for my birthday a few months ago to thank me for \"my advice\" which I took but later gave back because it was too much and I discussed my feelings about this with her so there's no hard feelings.",
