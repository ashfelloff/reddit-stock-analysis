Is there really no one there with any vision?\n\nCurious for some real takes on Intel, bear and bull.\n\nEdit: after reading through all the replies, the consensus seems to be that Intel definitely has potential and is likely to grow into it in the coming years but no one should be holding their breath, it’s likely to be a while before the market gives INTC any love.",

And in that, AMD Polaris GPUs were great at 200$.\n\nBut that doesn't really work if your software is not optimized to run the same software and Nvidia's been building on CUDA for machine learning for a decade.\n\nEven though competitors have excellent products, those products still don't do that well without appropriate software.\n\nIn gaming terms it's like when a game favors one or other vendor, except that the impact is way more massive.\n\nI strongly believe that eventually competitors will catch up and customers that now are just focusing on getting products out as quickly as possible will eventually start looking at their costs. Nobody wants to buy hardware you know you're overpaying 3/4/5/6 times what you would otherwise, and those companies have massive budgets to improve drivers and software to speed up the same things on different hardware that fits their use case.",

It's not about having the best hardware, but having the best performance per $, and best performance per watt. That's what matters in cloud. These big customers don't like to overpay for hardware and have the capabilities to write their own hardware too.\n2. Number #1 is important but irrelevant now. Because right now the most important thing is to get products and models as powerful as possible, release and get market share. To Microsoft it's more important that it gets thousands of people everyday on Copilot, Copilot for desktop and all those things than looking at their hardware bill.\n3. Nvidia's lead isn't as important in hardware as it is in software. Nvidia has been the only vendor that cared that their GPUs played well when machine learning started being a thing a decade ago or so. They contributed a lot both to software and their own drivers. This led to a very powerful effect where software was written and tested mostly on Nvidia, thus making Nvidia GPUs faster and further giving reason people to buy Nvidia in the field. Not only that but Nvidia was generous with research labs, open source contributors, etc, to make sure relevant people in the field made sure software run on their systems.\n4. If you understood number 1, 2 and 3, you can see why Nvidia has a huge lead: Nvidia has the best offering, that runs best in a market that values launching products over sparing costs.\n\nNow, let's get back into Intel:\n\n5) Intel definitely has the capabilities to make very good GPUs for AI. In fact there isn't really that much magic here in transformers: you're doing matrix multiplication on huge arrays in parallel. It's not really rocket science, you're taking matrixes with weights and do matrix math on them. It's not even important that they are the fastest, they just need to be more either cheaper, or draw less power, or be immediately available. But lacking in software integration, right now, Intel either has to catch up on software (anything from Pandas to whatever), or collaborate with a huge customer to make sure their hardware works fine for the customer's use case. E.g. Microsoft by now, may have clear what are their needs to run Copilot for developers and start looking into optimizing the software and hardware bundle to run it.\n\n6) Intel is trying to retake their role as a great foundry, where they have been doing bad for 10 years. Having your best hardware built at TSMC is embarassing. But their 1.8 nm node samples have been very good, in fact Nvidia's CEO has publicly stated that the sampled chips are promising. If Intel can keep pushing there and execute well, for once, avoiding the mistakes of their terrible 10nm node, Intel is going to be positioned in a wonderful position where they will not only be able to produce great chips for themselves, but also customers. So selling wood and iron to shovel makers, in the usual analogy.\n\n7) Intel has lots of assets and patents, the sum of those is likely not that far their market cap value.\n\n8) Intel is poised to receive tens of billions from US and other governments around the world, which will allow them to invest a lot, without spending a dime.\n\n9) Intel's price is severely depressed. Comparisons with IBM are imho a bit blind, the most similar situation at that scale is actually AMD's comeback 10 years ago. Where it was laughed left and right for losing their good foundry business and making a crap chip after the other, especially on CPU side. Yet, AMD executed well several plans and even got profitable and has a moderately good outlook for tomorrow. Intel has more turnaround potential than AMD so if they execute well on the foundry side and can find a good customer to work on with their GPU hardware I see no reason why can't they make a very huge comeback.\n\nNobody here has the crystal ball, I personally hold some Intel, but if I was sure they are a great turnover company i would have more. And I don't. So even though I think there's huge upside potential, I am quite cautious on it till I don't see more positive informations, at least on their foundry business.",
