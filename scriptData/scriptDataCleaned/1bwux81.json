Why the fuck wouldn't they? They know that in the US Boeing is a near monopoly. Everyone has no other option and Airbus is European. They know if Boeing go into hot shit the government will bail them out just like the government bailed out everyone in 2023, 2020, 2008, 2000, and whatever time the \"too big to fail\" needed it. C-suite shitters know most of Boeing is owned by index funds and whale asset managers who won't do shit as long as things look good on the surface, that impoverishing the worker for upper managing is the game, meeting the next quarter is more important than the next decade, and if shit went bad they won't go to jail but get a golden parachute. They just do what they can get away with just like how WSB degens will delete their app and not repay Robinhood for that -800K balance if RH allowed them to. Only real difference is no one dies, the American airline industry, and national security aren't at risk not at when WSB degens do it.\n\nTL;DR DO NOT give them the benefit of a clean slate due to incompetence or lack of effort just because our justice system will not charge them for murder, mismanagement, swindling of investors, and the betrayal of American society even though they've got the money in their blood soaked hands.",
