Few times a lady working at the western union would give him shit start saying I don't feel comfortable giving you this or doing the transaction, I'm calling my manager. \n\n I've only seen his winning slip for the $311k i always wondered what his wins and losses looked like the following month. He told me he was doing 50k to 100k risks on games. I'm sure he hit some pretty big plays in that month only to lose it all. Also back in 2014/15 he hit for around $70k and 5dimes gave him an option of cashing out 30k or so in bitcoin which he said no to. Crazy shit man",

      "body": "Hi. Not to one-up you, but I fucked up way worse than you did. Hopefully this makes you feel better. I invested $30,000 into cryptocurrency over the period of 2018-2020. I then quit my job to trade full time in May of 2021. \n\nIn November of that same year, my crypto was worth $2.7M, and I didn‚Äôt hit the ‚Äúsell‚Äù button. Like so many others, I thought January of 2022 was when it would top out. Little did I know, crypto had already reached its peak in November. \n\nInstead, I was forced to sell it off incrementally in Q2 of 2022 (when my crypto was worth a fraction of what it was in November), so that I could pay my bills. \n\nWhile it seems like it‚Äôs all fun and games making fun of people on social media for losing a ton of money trading, you never know what words can do to certain people. \n\nIn May of 2022, one night I rented a hotel room when my wife was out of town and I didn‚Äôt tell her. I sat on the bed, and held a revolver to my head for about an hour, and ultimately couldn‚Äôt pull the trigger. I was fully planning on ending my life that night. I rented a hotel room because I didn‚Äôt want my wife to be the one to find my body. \n\nIt took almost two years of therapy and medication to get my mind right and to just let go of what could have been. \n\nI now have about $5,000 worth of crypto. That‚Äôs it. My only hope is that this next bull run rips like crazy. If it doesn‚Äôt, I potentially missed out on literal generational wealth. But unlike three years ago, I‚Äôm ready to accept that as a real possibility. \n\nThere is *so* much more to life than money. You‚Äôll rebound eventually, and you‚Äôll forget this ever happened. \n\nKudos to you for taking a chance on trading. You are a very courageous person.\n\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts or a crisis, please reach out immediately to the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text HOME to the Crisis Text Line at 741741.

Technically if your good enough you could completely turn it around in another 6-8 months however again you‚Äôve only started and you‚Äôd need atleast 3+ years trading experience to get yourself out of that hole. Whatever you do when you trade, DO NOT listen to anyone on reddit or anyones trading advice. That is the best advice you can get. Learn stock market terms and through years of trial and error put little amounts of money in each time or paper trade until you become decently profitable.
