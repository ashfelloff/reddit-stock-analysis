  "selftext": "I know there‚Äôre hundreds of NVDA Bull/Bear posts. I was about to be take bear position too, giving the recent flat/negative days and stock has already ran up from last earnings. However- decided against and taking little safer bet. \n\nWhy: If NVDA crushes estimates again, it‚Äôll obviously pop up. I know there‚Äôre news of big players like AMZN awaiting for newer model chip,. In that case, NVDA will raise the guidance which may actually turn out better.\n\nIn other ‚Äúin-line estimates/guidance‚Äù use case, I believe Mr. Huang will pull a rabbit out of hat like stock-split(high time giving current price and last stock split happened last time during same cycle). \n\nDon‚Äôt see outsized move though and hence selling Iron Condor and call debit. \n\nGood luck either way guys!!
