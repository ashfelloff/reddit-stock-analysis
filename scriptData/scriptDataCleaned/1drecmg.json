  "selftext": "First their delivery numbers for Q3 will be lower than expectations, signaling continuing falling demand. This is after the price cuts, low interest rate offerings, and discounts. Demand just isn’t there and they do not have enough time to turn things around.\n\n\nMargins keep getting tighter and tighter, falling to levels similar to other automotive companies. “But but FSD and robotaxi”. FSD hasn’t had the perceived success they thought it would have - people just like driving their cars and the extra value isn’t there for the normal person. Robotaxi won’t be ready this year, I’d be surprised if it’s ready next year - this is the most obvious sell the news out there, especially based on Tesla’s track record of over-promising and hyping things up. \n\n\nThey currently have nothing in their financials but “hope” that signals a turnaround. Fundamentals clearly show TSLA is overpriced and I expect a tank in the near term. Oh and once the Delaware judge validates the attorney fees Tesla will have to pay those attorneys in billions worth of options which will almost assuredly be sold. Good luck to TSLA bulls but things aren’t looking good. \n\n\nMy position is 50 8/2 $180 strike puts .",

                          "body": "You might be confusing causation with correlation. People think TSLA sales are down because Elon bought twitter. That's just silly. The reality is the entire EV space is going through a cycle. EV sales are all down. Most of the companies are either out of money (PoleStar), reducing expansion plans (Ford, GM), being bought out/subsidized by larger players (Rivian/VW) or essentially on the verge of bankruptcy (Lucid, Fisker)\n\nThe basic facts: EV sales were pulled forward due to their new/fad adoption, free cost of money (0% interest rates), and EV subsidies which have mostly dried up. Most people that live in dense areas and/or could accept the charging/range limitations of EVs have purchased one.\n\nWill TSLA stock go down - maybe. But in a few years, TSLA will be one of a few dominant EV makers having survived this business cycle and will come out far ahead of the competition due to manufacturing processes, economies of scale, and charging network, software, etc.\n\nThis is typical of all nascent industries. As soon as one player discovers a new pie, other players rush in to gain a piece. In the end, almost all these cycles leave an oligopoly of a few powerful players that control the mainstream market. TSLA will be one of those, along with a few Chinese manufacturers. That, you can bet your life or money on. Most other companies will either go out of business (if they basically haven't already) or become niche players. Hell, in just a few years the Chinese have gone from 500 EV makers to under 200, and I'd bet a testicle that will be less than 20 by the end of the decade even with the insane Chinese government subsidies keeping them propped up.\n\nThis is why they should teach more economics in high school/college",

However my boy….. you’re speaking to a man who blew up his account trying to short Tesla during their disastrous cyber truck release, falling demand, loss as top dog to BYD, and more and more…. Tesla doesn’t trade on fundamentals. Elon is a god damn charlatan and will say whatever the hell he needs to say to pump his stock. He says “oh yeah!!!! We will focus on super chargers!!!” Cuts the entire team and hires them back at a higher price… “oh yeah we will put out a cheaper economic model!!!” A few weeks prior they scrapped said plans and laid off members of the production team…. He’s a punk ass liar tbh. He was funneling resources to his other start ups away from Tesla until they awarded him his massive af pay package. Everyone who works for him hates him. Yet his stock continues to rebound week after week. I don’t touch Tesla anymore even though I realize theyre fundamentally flawed. \n\nIf anything, your strike price is sound; however, I think August is playing it too closely. I’d opt out for a far LEAP asap",

Lowering, then raising, then lowering model Y prices seemed panicky / fear like. Rallying on shareholder vote passing was odd as most people don’t care to vote or not so brokers just defaulted to what BOD wanted. Diversion of Nvidia chips to grok ai seemed odd. Also why is grok AI outside of Tesla if Tesla is itself a AI play? Cybertruck has sharp corners and weaknesses to water unlike what people would have expected for a 100k price tag. Also why the heck was cybertruck prioritized over  mass transit/ typical cars that people want - like there’s no Minivan like competitor even though musk is for high birth rates and instead they chose to design a dumpster on wheels before mass transit option. Long term Tesla is probably fine but there’s reasons there’s a hit to growth lately.",
