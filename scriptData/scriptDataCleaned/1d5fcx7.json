  "selftext": "So today I bought 3x $SPY 527c 0DTE contracts. At 3:30 I got squared off on 2 of them but $HOOD kept 1 open. \nNow I slept and when I woke up I got this message\nFor fkn 160$ profit I now have to be on the hook for 100 $SPY till Monday on margin 😔. \n\nTLDR: don't smoke some and trade, rather have some coffee and Zyn. Caffeine n Nik is better 💅. \n\nAlso, some rockets for no reason. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",

The only contracts to my knowledge that don’t force you to buy shares, but work solely in dollar amounts are held by the $VIX. The way OP wanted to play them, you’re supposed to sell them before market close to pocket the value of the contract, but volatility (like the kind we saw on Spy today/friday) is a good example of how you can get boned unexpectedly when your contracts move into the money last minute. \n\nRobinhood will credit OP’s account for 100 shares of SPY on Monday morning, but it will still show that their account is negative. OP will then be able to sell the shares to cover the bulk of the account deficit, if not all of it. \n\nFeel free to correct me if I’m wrong because I like eating crayons as much as the rest of us.

Aside from all that, it's usually all at the discretion of a derivatives team (read: actual humans making real-time decisions with -your- money to minimize -their- risk).  This pragmatically usually amounts to you getting the worst, pun shamelessly semi-intended, options possible.\n\n\nAbsolute safest path, from a trader perspective, is to put DNE orders for any open contracts 15min prior to expiry. A ton of extra work, but I guess a pin can draw blood in the same vein as an executioner's axe, albeit in typically smaller volumes.",
