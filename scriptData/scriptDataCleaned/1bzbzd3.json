  "title": "Leaps on $ET, Potential 10 bagger as Oil Surges (DD)",
  "score": 204,
  "selftext": "**Leaps on $ET are dirt cheap right now.**\n\nWe have seen oil really ramping up in the past week and has gone up 10% in the past month. Tickers such as $PAA have seen big gains this week, especially the leap options that were trading at super low premiums. $PAA 1/17/25 20c was trading at $0.15 less than two weeks ago and is now trading at $1.25, an 8 bagger for those who got in at the premium. I expect to see this momentum continue as oil prices surge. \n\nNow, there is another potential 10 bagger waiting for its chance to shine while the oil sector becomes crowded. $ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in the united states, which transports oil and natural gas. It is the second biggest midstream company with a market cap of 53B. So far this year $ET has gone up 26%, and has beat earnings 3 out of the last 4 quarters. It has also increased distribution in every quarter since the start of 2022, with its quarterly distribution of 31.5 cents being higher than it was before they cut distribution back during covid. \n\n$ET will greatly benefit due to this increased demand in oil. The IEA raised its estimate in March for 2024 oil demand from 110,000 b/d (barrels per day) to 1.3 million b/d. Due to the Russian oil sanctions and other political issues driving oil and gas prices, the US has become the largest oil producer in the world and will continue to be. \n\nThe premiums on $ET leaps are still super low right now. 1/17/25 20c is sitting at a pretty $0.12 per contract. 1/16/26 20c and 22c are sitting at $0.30 and $0.17 respectively. Again, just so much upside to this play. With $PAA leaps already taking off, others such as $ET & $EPD will follow with this surge in oil during 2024. The upside for short term and long term profits are substantial. Also would like to thank /u/PuzzleheadedTear5969 for his DD on $PAA and inspiring me to look more into this sector. His DD has more information of the political climate sparking this surge in oil.\n\nI'm in for 120 contracts at $0.12 for 1/17/25. Considering adding 1/26 leaps as well tomorrow.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ajcjnkbf1ctc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=21d42ffe1a08009b56c342cdc9175f5c11b4b446\n\n Thank you for your time and wish you all the best of luck.",
