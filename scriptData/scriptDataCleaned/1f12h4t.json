Nobody is saying Intel is going to fail. The stock trades at 82x 2024 earnings, or 19x 2025, which is basically the market average multiple.\n\nConsensus basically implies that Intel is going to have this dramatic recovery from 2024-25 and then grow in line with the market average from then on - a pretty long way from people expecting it to fail.\n\nBut even ignoring that very few people actually think Intel will get to the point that it will need a bailout, it's also ignoring that a bailout can be a very painful experience. GM shareholders got zeroed when the government bailed it out. Split-adjusted, Citigroup is still down over 90% compared to before the government forced it to dilute shares as a condition for a bailout. Just because Intel will survive doesn't mean the experience can't be very, very painful for shareholders (the same applies for Boeing, which is the other company where you hear this argument often).",
