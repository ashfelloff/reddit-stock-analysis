If you see the filling, Berkshire moved the funds from selling stocks to short term Treasury, it's clear and easy move since rate has reached its peak. The Fed would lower the rate sooner or later and he would get easy profits while having lower risk than most of the market since stock market going up is currently really hard, if people make projection where S&P reaches 6000, stagnating around 5500 or going below 5000, most probably assume it would stagnate around 5500 after months of massive gains, unless there is massive change for real economy data in the market. So he is just going for lower risk easy profits which would be comparable to the stock market even if the market goes up to 6000, more profit if stock market stagnating, and massive profit if market goes down and then he would just buyback the stocks.",
