                      "body": "Sure. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency/store of value. No single entity owns it. There is a finite supply. There can never be more than 21 million (It was just made that way.) You can not alter it, because if you do, it becomes something else entirely (2017 Bitcoin Cash was created). It is unhackable. It is independent of government and banks, you own it yourself. (This comes with upsides and downsides, downside being security... If you fall for a scam, your BTC is gone etc)\n\nIt is a global currency. Money evolves over time with society... Money used to be items (goats, milk, rice, etc), then changed to precious metals/coins. Eventually it became bills. With the evolution of the Internet, most money is digital. There's only about 2.3 trillion USD in circulation... Bitcoin is the first ENTIRELY digital money. This is the main reason most people have a hard time grasping the concept, but over the past 15 years it's done nothing but grow. It's now one of the biggest 10 assets in the world. At the beginning, it was very possible for it to crash to zero, but it's too big now. It's too well established. Due to its limited supply and growing interest worldwide, I expect it to keep increasing in value.\n\nSo many people have a difficult time grasping the concept of this \"fake Internet money\". It's still very new in society. As more and more people learn about what it is, interest in it grows and so does demand. Meanwhile, the supply is dwindling.\n\nThere's a lot more to learn about it. I encourage you to approach it with an open mind. I'll admit it has it's flaws, it's not perfect, but I think cryptocurrency is the next phase in the evolution of money.",
