But letâ€™s be real, that is a very unlikely scenario. And in any case, If your play was to hold till expiration thinking it would be at $50, youâ€™d have been way better off without the spread and just calls. Calls would also have allowed you to exit early without taking a double hit on bad execution. Basically, doing a spread here likely turned this into a bad play, despite the current move in the stock. Youâ€™re going to have to sell at the bid and buy at the ask. \n\nRight now for example, you probably could only get $0.60 for a spread ($35 bid minus $30 ask). Which is $21,600. Execution may improve a little but itâ€™s never going to be good. You paid what for these spreads?",
