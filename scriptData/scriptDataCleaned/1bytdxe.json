They can just play the long game and \"win\" via taking over their political structure. China sees how easy it is to sway opinions in \"free speech\" countries, and they can do the same in Taiwan. 10-15 years from now they'll probably be a lot more pro-China voices coming from Taiwanese politicians.",

But if the government gives them money to offset the cost & they can accept that it will take multiple factories here to produce the output of a single factory there, it should be a long term win.  I would assume they can eventually implement more robotics & AI in the process & having those working around the clock will offset some of the disadvantages of using US labor.

People can't help themselves today, buying cheap shit from Temu and Shein. \n\nIf government force people to buy local the response will be \"what about freedom?\" \n\nWhen tariffs were introduced on China, everyone lost their minds. \n\nEven today, people support the message \"if you can't pay higher wages, your business deserves to close down\"\n\nIt's contradiction after contradiction. Every scenario, people will complain about the government. Free trade? Complain. Protection? Complain. \n\nPeople want stuff produced in US. US wages to be high. Goods to be cheap. If companies make a profit above zero, it's their fault. If they made zero profit (costs = sales) then they would never grow and attract no investors as investors are only in it for current or future profits.\n\nIt's easy to sit in front of a screen and complain about everything, there's no accountability for holding contradictory views. If you're on reddit, it seems like the government could push a button and solve every problem on earth, and they're just not pushing that button. In the real world there are trade-offs. Pros and cons. Competing interests from foreign nations. \n\nIf the entire world adopted free trade and the US was isolationist, it would not be the largest economy in the world today.",
