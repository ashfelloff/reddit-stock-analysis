So, they sell a 1 month put.\n\nIf the stock never goes to that price, then they just collect the premium.\n\nIf the stock goes to that price or lower, you then have to buy MSFT. But now you own it at a price you felt was a good deal. Of course, if goes a lot lower than your strike, you might have to wait a while to make up the difference.\n\nIt's all very complicated. Selling options is a safer way to make money than buying them, but it's also dangerous as hell.\n\nThe only strategy I would recommend for a beginner is to sell covered calls. You buy 100 shares of a stock you like. Then you sell a call against it. If the stock goes up to the strike, someone buys the share from you at a profit, and you make money of the call you sold. If the stock doesn't go up, you keep the option premium and you hold the shares.\n\nIt's hard to lose money with covered calls unless a stock tanks. But if a stock tanks, you were going to lose anyway (and at least this way you got a little extra cash from the call you sold)\n\nThe only possible \"bad\" thing that could happen with selling a covered call is the stock rockets to the moon, and you don't collect any of the profit over your strike price.",
