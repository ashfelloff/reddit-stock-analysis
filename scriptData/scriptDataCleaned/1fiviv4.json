(so if you decide to break nvidia's monopoly by making a shim for cuda that works on AMD, you might get DCMA'd by... AMD themselves, this happened recently).\n\nSo, Nvidia somehow has today a monopoly on being able to do matrix multiplications fast with easy way to reference variables from memory and not a texture. Cuda isn't even that advanced in on itself, it just won because some academics started using it back in 2009, and they told other academics to use it, and then nvidia gave away some mid gaming cards to universities for free - it all happened by chance, it was not a planned victory, it's insane.\n\nMeanwhile AMD invested into open stards (OpenCL which would be something like Cuda but open an open standard), but the Khronos group boomers started circlejerking and missing deadlines, and making the spec more and more bloated, in the end OpenCL became an incomprehensible mess that would take the average person 6 lifetimes to decode.\n\nThen AMD investd into Vulcan which would be a multipurpose GPU programming solution for everything (mostly graphics but can do compute too, similar to Apple's lml METAL lml ). Vulcan likewise became a bloated 2600 page spec written by virgin monks who have not seen the sunlight nor a woman in the past 30 years. Case in point; in order to do a hello-world example in Vulcan you need 600 lines of extremely ugly and convoluted boiler plate code (I am not exaggerating). I know experienced graphics programmers (at unity for example) who gave up before even making any working code for the damn thing compile and started advocating against it with passion.\n\nI 've personally met some people from the Khronos group (responsible for opengl and other stuff) in 2019 when I was speaking in a conferrence about next-gen rendering solutions (don't want to give too many details because I will be recognized), and all of them were 50+ years old and were asking everybody at the conference for a job as they all wanted to abandon the khronos group. People who were in it for 15 years had nothing good to say about it. This is what truly made nvidia a 3 trillion dollar company.\n\nIt's a pity this real life babel's tower doomed open standards. Open stardards would be a lot healthier for the entirety of the sector, instead we 're stuck with a closed source proprietary solution guarded by armies of lawyers from hell. I don't know exactly what went wrong with Khronos.\n\nI don't know since many big companies participate in it if they all sabotaged it in order to go and do their own closed garden (apple did metal for example, microsoft directx, google webgpu etc) - or it was a case of academics being dicks to one another and trying to poke holes on each other's specs so they can get their name higher up on the list, eventually ending up with a gargantuan incomprehensible mess that has to detail every little bit and byte and delve into excruciatingly low-level details. The funny thing is that probably most of it was not even written by said academics but by their high off their minds students on low quality grass.\n\nSomebody should make a documentary on the failure of these 2 standards, it would be super interesting to see.",
