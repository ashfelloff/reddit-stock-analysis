          "body": "For interest rates being cut. Many investors use bonds as a defacto for a \"risk free rate\" (I prefer the term near risk free but it is what it is) so they affect discounted cash flow analysis for valuation of companies. In other words the higher the risk free rate is, the lower the present day value of the future cash flows would calculate out to.  So bonds start to look more attractive at the same time present day value of stocks are dropping and thus the risk free rate of return starts inching closer and closer towards the expected return of an index like the s&p. Stocks are typically riskier, assuming you are able to hold bonds until they expire, so the market demands a premium expected return compared to bonds, when the spread between expected returns of stocks and bonds are close, many investors will choose to allocate capital towards bonds over stocks. Lowering interest rates tends to have the opposite affect so bonds tend to go down and stocks go up. These are just in general terms and is not guaranteed.",
