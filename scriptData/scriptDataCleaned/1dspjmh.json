For example, SOXL (semiconductor ETF) hit RSI 30 a couple weeks before NVDA had earnings. All the big tech companies had just had earnings, and they all said that even though they had spent a ton on AI, it wasn’t nearly enough, so they needed to spend dramatically more. So NVDA was poised to kill earnings and guidance and boost SOXL, by proxy. Went in big on SOXL at $30, and it hit $60 within the month. Same with Apple. RSI at 30, but the WWDC was eminent, and they were long overdue to lay out their AI plans. Bought $200 options for $1.60, and the stock zoomed to $216 within two weeks.
