  "selftext": "I have a few NVDA options 850C, 860C expiring June 21st and 750C expiring Jan 15th. Doing well on the profits and am happy about it. Thetas are pretty low. With the split coming up, I was wondering when would be a good time to close them?\n\nI have already considered the following options:\n1. Closing the options after hitting a target profit.\n2. Rolling it out.\n\nI was wondering if you regards have any other suggestions for me?",
