  "selftext": "Cybersecurity remains one of the fastest growing industries. However, it is also a very fragmented space. After a big pullback due to Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reporting disappointing results, the whole sector took a dump and then has traded in a narrow range, trending down slightly in the last month. This has created an interesting buying opportunity, if you pick the right names.\n\nFirst a little history lesson on PANW's earnings call that turned the tide. In its FY23 report, PANW unveiled a \"new platformization strategy\" - essentially bundling products, which is a trend we've seen across various industries (Progressive to FedEx). However, the results so far have been underwhelming with PANW seeing a significant decceleration. Then more recently in its Q2 results, PANW cited \"demand fatigue\" to justify a significant deceleration in its own product sales. This in turn had a negative impact on its cybersecurity peers.\n\nThe reality check:\n\n1. The \"demand fatigue\" narrative was not borne out, as peers like ZS, CRWD continued to grow at 30%+ clip, while PANW guides for just 2-4% growth.\n2. The price action initially was correlated, but has now started to diverge as active investors shift dollars from PANW to other players they believe will win. Given PANW's brand recognition, I suspect we'll see more allocation from sidelines than a shift from PANW.\n\nKey names to consider:\n\n1. CRWD: Crowded trade, higher risk. Hold.\n2. PANW: Thrown all the bad news, price action reversing. A \"must own\" cybersecurity stock, also bought by Nancy Pelosi. Buy.\n3. ZS: Had a good but not great quarter. Historically, ZS beats sales by 5%, but the beat was only 3%. Stock has traded sideways, but on top of larger Fed deals, Zscaler is poised to recover towards $240 as it beats earnings. Hot buy.\n4. FTNT: Appears cheap, but not in the same league. Sold off after a recent cyber event. Sell if you own it.\n\nOverall, the cybersecurity space presents an interesting opportunity, but pick the right names. ZS is my top pick. PANW next.  Skip the rest.",
