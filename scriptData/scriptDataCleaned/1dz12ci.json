  "selftext": "I’ll admit that I used to like using Etsy for gifts and whatnot, then stopped sometime around the pandemic. I’m intrigued by this strategy (and more importantly, the marketing of this strategy). Earnings coming first week in August. Its down 30% ytd and ’m not sure I want to catch the falling knife before earnings- but I think this could be a decent play going into the fall/winter sales cycle. \n\nI haven’t been following Etsy’s stock price closely- anyone have thoughts?",

      "body": "It’s a tough jam for Etsy\n\nThey tweaked the definition of ‘hand made’ which unleashed a wave of cheap ‘made in china’ goods which were in many cases knockoffs of better brands\n\nThe original craft sellers got their asses kicked because they couldn’t compete\n\nAnd the quality of the items on Etsy fell, because it was knockoff junk from china instead of the handmade stuff. This meant that Etsy was basically the ‘quirky’ Amazon. \n\nSo now Etsy is trying to reach out to the artisans to bring them back to the platform. \n\nIt’s a lot easier to sell a generic camera bag for $25 than a craft made artisan camera bag that might cost $100. So the velocity of sales might decrease because the price of items on the platform might rise. \n\nI just feel like Etsy is a fine business but the business model is tough - hand made items inherently cost more, sales velocity is inherently lower, and financial results would be inherently constrained. The hand made, artisan goods market is a much smaller addressable market.  If you open the floodgates to allow manufactured junk, you are nothing more than a quirky Amazon, but the addressable market is much larger. \n\nIt’s really hard to compete against Amazon, Temu; Shein….\n\nI wouldn’t invest \n(I’m not saying it’s not a decent short term trade idea, but I like buy and hold)",

You used to be able to go to a fair and the people selling from stands would have homemade jewelry, crafts, art, and so on. Not 9 out of 10 stands are just drop shoppers selling stuff they bought for dirt cheap online at a 500% mark up. And most of its plastic. \n\nIt’s easy to blame China, but they wouldn’t have a market if it weren’t for our obsessive consumerism. It’s not like they woke up and decided to make a bunch of crappy polyester clothes and fidget spinners and convince us to buy them…there’s a cult of materialism being pushed everywhere…all these “look whats in my purse” or “my kitchen” or “when I get home” social media reels where people are just showing off their hoard of stupid objects. Commercials for everything. Music promoting materialism. Our identities are tied to what we have. \n\nChina has just made it cheap enough for the average western poor to be able to hoard crap and flex as well. I love when I hear some conservative bitch about China’s increasing power as 90% of everything they own is from there…they’re sending all their money to China, voting for politicians who do nothing for domestic investment and development, and then whine about China’s growth. The cognitive dissonance is unreal. \n\nAnd that’s capitalism’s aim. To keep us working so we can buy crap so a handful of people can get richer and richer while we’re high on our newest purchase that will hit the landfill a few months later.

Go on YouTube or Facebook instagram/etcc and it’ll be about a million videos of *GET RICH QUICK!

Whoever said they shouldn’t have gone public is right. The thing is, once you go public you need to keep beating and raising guidance and the only way to do that short term is chase the easy arbitrage and middle man dollars of slinging vast volumes. They can say they’re going to clean up all they want but the stocks cooked if they do that. It’s also cooked if they don’t because why would someone buy drop ship trash from Etsy for +60% the price paying a bunch of YouTube middleman instead of just getting it directly from the source?",

              "body": "Excluding Etsy, my efforts are Shopify>Amazon>Ebay\nMy expectations are Amazon>Shopify>Ebay\n\nEbay is helpful but not super scalable for everyone. Depends on your niche.\n\nAmazon is king, much as I hate corporatocracy. Look up data about market share trends in ecomm, Google search volume, etc. Think about your own spending habits and how likely you are to go straight to Amazon without even considering learning about brands at large. Personally, unless it's a pricy/hobby item worth researching before buying, Amazon has my business.. sometimes Walmart for the uber-cheap household items.\n\nShopify because I don't trust ANY third party marketplace with my customer relationships. Thieves, liars, manipulators ALL. Etsy taught me that lesson the hard way. With my own .com, I control my brand narrative, my marketing strategies, and most importantly, my customer's attention. Remarketing, increasing AOV, LTV, things like that actually matter when you own your own storefront. The conventional wisdom is that marketplaces are to get your foot in the door and enough revenue to build a real business.. until then, you're somebody else's bitch. Unfortunately for me, I'm only at 20%ish revenue on .com/Shopify. Yes I realize Shopify technically has similar leverage over my customer relationships, but I can walk away any time and keep those relationships, that email list, those people who Google my name instead of stumble upon my listings on Etsy.\n\nUltimately, I think ecommerce is too vulnerable to society/politics/technology, and I see WAY too many brands being swept away by wildly unfair shit like Google's recent castration of organic traffic/SEO blogs. Not only that, but I'm 28, and compared to my innate understanding of internet business that I had when I was 22, I'm virtually aged out like a pro gamer. It takes WAY too much time to ride this elephant of an industry, and I want more passive income. As soon as I possibly can afford it, I'm going brick and mortar local - a niche I can be undisputed master of - a revenue source that can buffer me against tumultuous industry shifts online.",
