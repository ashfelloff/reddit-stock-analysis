All that translates to ~$450M Adj. EBITDA\n\nA lot of stuff still on the come but feeling like thereâ€™s progress on the turnaround. Still holding\n\n",

          "body": "Ya know there's several reasons why Petco has been able to compete effectively against pure online companies and mass retailers (omnichannel retailing, BOPUS, unique merchandising, vet & grooming services).  That's well documented in their [IPO prospectus](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1826470/000119312521009268/d62974d424b4.htm#toc).\n\nBut instead of trying to convince you why these strategies can win, the most convincing proof is Petco's 18 consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth run.\n\nYes, eventually that run ended in 2Q 2023, but it wasn't because of ecommerce.  It was because Petco had a merchandising strategy that focused heavily on premium brands / fresh frozen food.  When inflation kicked in, pet owners traded down on pet food  ([WSJ: Pet Owners Resort to Cheaper Food as Inflation Weighs on Wallets)](https://www.wsj.com/articles/pet-owners-resort-to-cheaper-food-as-inflation-weighs-on-wallets-a164333c). and Petco's premium merchandising strategy was caught flat footed.  Moreover, Petco's management was slow to recognize that, unlike the 2008 recession where pet spending continued to grow, this time was different.\n\nPetco last year started introducing budget brands into its merchandising strategy.  To quote Ron Coughlin last year when justifying the shift in merchandising strategy,\n\n>Simply put, we can't improve the health of a pet whose pet parent doesn't walk through our doors or shop with us digitally.\n\nSo to sum up, (1) Petco has an array of strategies to compete against online and mass retailers.  (2) Those strategies are not theoretical but have a track record of effectiveness.  (3) Petco's current troubles, instead, stems from a wrong belief that premium merchandising would withstand an inflation-challenged consumer spending environment",
