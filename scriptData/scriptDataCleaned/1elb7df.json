Welles Wilder, is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. The RSI oscillates between zero and 100. Traditionally the RSI is considered overbought when above 70 and oversold when below 30.\n\nIt’s literally was designed to signal overbought and oversold markets. Every technical reads that SPY is a strong buy in the intermediate term/long term. Maybe not great for Calls but solid over all.",

RSI in the short term (1M, 5M and 30M charts) resets by money sideways but on the 1 day and 1 week charts like I mentioned, it would take significant movement to substantially change the RSI. The long the period out the better it because. But it’s not great and predicting a change in momentum which the MACD and Stoch indicators do a better job at. \n\nMy main point is OP is saying the market was overbought when every indicator I use shows it’s not if anything it’s oversold.
