It would take centuries to produce enough EV's to supply 30% of the driving population. Even if you add all 5 top EV manufacturers (excluding asia), it would still take centuries. Theres also about 500 dif models of EV already, talk about dilution. EV is not the future, it shouldnt even be a whole sector, it should be just a type of car.
