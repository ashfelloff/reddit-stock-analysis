Check out this hard-on of a growth chart, thanks to Google's search engineers:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5y3orvlywhvd1.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba80aec2dd27a78d6909c600983d6c2ef6d9e3fe\n\nThat’s **500% growth in a year**. FIVE HUNDRED PERCENT. Reddit is straight-up snorting Google's algorithm.\n\nThey're now pulling in **1.1 BILLION** users a month from Google. That's B-ILLION with a 'B'.\n\nGoogle’s so cucked by Reddit they’re basically making them their side piece. How do you pull in that much traffic and NOT back up the Brinks truck to the front door?\n\n# Sundar and Altman are Reddit's new sugar daddies 💰🤖\n\nSo why is Sundar simping so hard for Reddit?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ww81b72xhvd1.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8841cbbfe29f34e5883f66d1985656750de11f8d\n\nAI is popping off, and Reddit is sitting on a fucking gold mine. The new winners of the AI era won’t just be the chip makers. It’s the **information gatekeepers** like Reddit who are set to win.\n\nAI is only as good as the data it's trained on. And UGC on Reddit is GOLD for AI training.\n\nGoogle and OpenAI already snaffled up the open web like a pair of greedy truffle hogs, but [they need more data](https://youtu.be/8_2yFCm5sSM?si=ane2hsnlq9Q-7lOD&t=319). Current events, trending topics, and hot takes? That’s Reddit folks, and the upvote system basically hand-feeds AI models what humans like. **Reddit = training wheels for AI**.\n\nIf you’ve left Reddit lately you might have noticed the open web is dying. Big tech platforms are building closed ecosystems. Google is killing off independent publishers through their ‘Helpful Content’ update (which is a huge misnomer).\n\nAs this gets worse (and it always gets worse) the only creators left to make deals with AI Platforms for FRESH data will be the large publishers that survive, the big social media firms and…Reddit.\n\nAnd Sam Altman’s packing a 9% stake in Reddit? Of course he is. Mmm backroom suck jobs for everyone.\n\n# Too many AI cucks spoil the broth 🍆🥣\n\nHere’s where things get extra spicy: Reddit’s already in bed with the big boys. [Google](https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/expanded-reddit-partnership/) and [OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/openai-and-reddit-partnership/) hit Reddit up first like they were sliding into the DMs at 3am.\n\nReddit’s not dumb—they know they’re sitting on that sweet, sweet data juice. So now [they’re cock blocking](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205244/reddit-blocking-search-engine-crawlers-ai-bot-google) any AI models or search engines that won’t pay up. **You want the goods? You gotta pony up, bitch**.\n\nThese deals are small fry right now, but give it time and Reddit will be swimming in licensing money like Scrooge McDuck.\n\n# Ads on Reddit are getting better 🤑\n\nUntil now? Reddit’s ads have been served up like cold McNuggets. Gross and disappointing. BUT—things are changing.\n\nThey just hired some **Google vet** who helped monetize Google’s ad empire. This pro knows how to turn clicks into cash.\n\n[Google veteran now at Reddit? Yeah, that happened](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/reddit-hires-google-veteran-ad-product-development-post-ipo/715901/)\n\nAnd here’s the kicker: Reddit’s data on YOU is next-level creepy. They know your kinks, your hobbies, and probably that you ate crayons for breakfast. So once they dial in their ads, we’re talking **precision targeting** that makes Facebook look like it’s throwing darts blindfolded.\n\nWith cookies on their way out, traditional publishers are screwed. But Reddit? Nah. They’ve got you on lock with that questionable account history. Ads are about to get hella smart, and when they do, advertisers are gonna throw big bags of cash at them.\n\n# Reddit is a traffic monster that just needs to learn to make it rain 💵 💦\n\nReddit is now the **6th most visited website on Earth**. And they’re still sitting at just a $12b market cap. Let that sink in. Oh, and they just launched their machine-learning translation into 35 new countries, so the user base is about to go GLOBAL.\n\nThey haven’t figured out how to properly monetize yet, but when they do? It's over. These guys are gonna print money.\n\n# Earnings are coming 🔥\n\nQ3 Earnings are due **October 29th**.\n\nEstimated 50% YoY growth to $310m? Nah, try 86% or **$385 million**.\n\nI have no idea how I pulled those numbers out of my ass, but trust me, they’ll probably hit.\n\n# TL;DR\n\n🚀 Reddit’s traffic from Google has gone full YOLO with a 500% pump in the last year.\n\n🚀 AI companies are thirsty for Reddit’s data, so expect fat licensing deals to keep rolling in.\n\n🚀 They just hired a Google ad wizard to fix their garbage ads and make them print money.\n\n🚀 With cookies dying, Reddit’s ready to serve laser-targeted ads straight to your fucked up browsing history.\n\n🚀 If they figure out how to cash in on being one of the top sites on the planet, they’ll be swimming in green.",

It's so germane right now that only brand-oriented businesses are really considering it - once they build out machine-learning audience and bidding optimizations I think advertisers will flock to it.\n\nI'm pretty bullish on RDDT long",

              "body": "Yesterday’s price action of Netflix was extremely indicative of a positive ER and price action. I’ve been watching Netflix closely because whenever it gets close to its 52 week high it seems to crater down below $700. It also seems to move I dependently of tech / index / market.\n\nSo yesterday when Netflix was going down to me it signaled a very positive earnings. It isn’t uncommon for stocks to go down the week leading up to what the market already knows unofficially to be great earnings. Regards and retail are kidding themselves to think the market is getting this news the same time we are lol. Those numbers are known at least a week before release and absolutely no way they aren’t leaked in some sense to people who have much deeper pockets than us.\n\nSo…..I think Reddit will have a great ER. It is also not far from its ATH since it just IPOd this year. So I would guess a correction is in order leading up to earnings where it will perform well.\n\nThe problem is IV is so high that even though I was confident about Netflix pumping with earnings, the contracts were pricy. Even $700 calls had a breakeven around $722 and that’s a lot to wager considering the close is today. If earnings were great but stock price muted you basically lost your whole investment. Netflix didn’t go up or down 20% so options holders were a little hosed there",
