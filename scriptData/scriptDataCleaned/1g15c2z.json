      "body": "\"Why and why not?\"\n\nI think my concern with China is that the last 5 years or so have seemed like a cycle of: 1) new regulation/crackdown (largely on tech, which is where I'd be primarily interested), 2) stocks go down, 3) China walks back regulation/offers stimulus, 4) \"China stocks are so back\" and after enough of a bounce the cycle goes back to 1.\n\nAnd while these names have had a good run lately, looking longer term Tencent is now almost back to the 2018 peak. When I think about names in China that I'd most like to own long-term that's certainly at or near the top of the list, but it's also clear that the government does not like the sector - and they can do what they want but there's other places to invest. \n\nI'm looking for at least medium and preferrably long-term holdings, optimally; Tencent is a good, well-run company but I feel like investing in China is - and maybe things will change at some point? - trying to time the #3 part of the cycle above and sell before #4 is over and the cycle starts again. If say gaming is going to be something that's going to continually encounter regulations in China, I'd rather look at a TTWO still around the level where it announced the GTAVI trailer and which is above 2018 highs. \n\nI'm not against China and great to anyone who did well with the recent move (although some of the BABA discussion in particular feels like a fair amount of this, given how many times people have tried to call the bottom in recent years: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FQrex8kVIAE4N3w?format=jpg&name=large - even after the recent move it's still down 36% over the last 5 years while AMZN +115%.) \n\nSo, I'm not \"super bearish\" simply because I'm not super bullish - just disinterested and looking elsewhere.\n\nJapan actually has a fair amount of great tech companies, but is little discussed.",

I mean look at Starbucks China comps last quarter down 14%.  There's also the VIE risk with China stocks which has always been a risk and remains a risk but I think because there hasn't been an issue over a long enough time people have gotten kind of complacent about it. \n\nI'm open to the idea of investing in China at some point - I like having the largest possible universe of investment ideas to consider so it's not \"I'm never investing in China again\" - but in the meantime there's no shortage of other things to focus on.",

Right now they're facing deflation, which made a lot of countries drop to their knees. \n\nI think the only country that survives insane deflation  is Switzerland, it did not push them to recession that time.",

But in the last 30 years, every big mouth analyst and their mother has been saying to invest in China saying insane things like their economy will zoom ahead of the USA by 2020 and so on. Of course that date keeps getting pushed forward and in reality, they fell behind the USA since 2000. The mania was real and it keeps coming back every few years only to thud again. \n\nThe stuff you are seeing on their street today is tech creep. Creep has been rather brisk the last 30 years. It wasnt China specific. Pics of high growth USA cities over the last 30 years are stark but if you want to see something like China, check out Panama, Thailand, Singapore, Qatar, Dubai, Brazil, Malasia, and im sure we can find many more if we try. All of them had huge leaps forward thanks to tech advancement and creep. That in itself, if not remarkable. Its the history of human civilization.",
