  "score": 368,
  "selftext": "No pun intended but this will be a short and simple DD on why you should be shorting NVDA leading up to earnings. \n\n\n1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen’s scheduled sells. This matters because volume has been pretty low based on NVDA standards. “It’s only 250k sells though. He has 99% of his equity left”. It’s been 250k sells everyday since June. You do the math. \n\n\n2) Look at the chart. NVDA reached a double top over the summer - a double peak always results in a sustained decline until it finds consolidation for a period of time. This is exactly what’s been happening.\n\n\n3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is a big deal. In the past NVDA has hit on all cylinders. A trustworthy company yet this delay is a chink in the armor, a crack in the foundation, like seeing blood after your hero gets a paper cut.\n\n\n4) Institutions aren’t buying. There is too much uncertainty with the broader market and it serves MMs well to depress the price in order to allow big money to buy in at lower prices. You all are trading amongst yourselves and buying Jensen’s bags. It’s that simple.\n\n\nMy position: 8/30 100 $90 strike puts. Good luck to me.\n\n\n\nEdit: assessing the sentiment in the comments I’m confident I made the right decision.\n\nEdit 2: I’m getting cooooooooked",

On Monday nearly all purchasing was done by institutional traders; they pumped that stock up from a low of 93 to 103 and retail was overall selling in panic that day.  Volume is much too high to be retail; average volume last week was 326 million per day - retail can't sniff a number like that, that's almost all heavy hitter institutional investors.\n\nMaybe you're right about not being so bullish on the stock; but you are wrong about MMs.  Overall they want that price to be at least 103.",

TSMC revenue, Taiwan export volumes, SMCI rev guide, SK Hynix revenue, and hyperscaler capex all clearly point to very strong demand over the next year. Yet your whole premise rests on the fact that investors don’t recognize that coming up slightly short of lofty expectations this quarter is pretty meaningless with the broader backdrop in mind.\n\nI don’t know how earnings will go – I have a bunch of $120 calls for next June that I bought when it dipped into the $90s – but your whole premise rests on TA (lmfao) and some major recency bias in terms of the slowdown in institutional buying, which of course is slowing down until they report.\n\nHonestly, you’re just chasing the action of prior weeks. You might get lucky, especially with volatility in the weeks ahead, but your confidence is based in pretty much nothing. Your DD isn’t actually DD.
