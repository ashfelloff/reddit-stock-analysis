  "selftext": "Many of us have learned from famed investors that the best companies usually have moats around their competitors, but are there any industries you won’t touch because nobody seems to have that moat?\n\nFor me, it’s autos and airlines. Not only is competition fierce, but one little slip up is all it takes for their stock prices to tank. Not to mention: due to how they’re forced to operate and market, their profit margins are usually razor thin compared with other industries. Such instability isn’t worth the headaches of riding the price waves.\n\nYou?",
