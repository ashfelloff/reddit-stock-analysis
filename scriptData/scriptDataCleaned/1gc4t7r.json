                      "body": "Yeah it’s called a poor mans covered call (PMCC) or a call calendar spread. In order to sell an OTM call we normally need 100 shares, but that’s super expensive. An alternative is to buy a call that is ITM or a least less out of the money. If you do that at the same expiration date it’s just a regular spread. But if you buy a long dated in the money call you can use it as the collateral repeatedly over the course of that long dated calls life. We call long dated calls like this LEAPS (long term equity anticipation securities). Now when selecting a LEAP it’s important to take into mind the delta of it. You want the delta to be somewhere around .70 or .80. Maybe 0.6 if you’re stingy and don’t want to pay a lot. Now fundamentally a long dated call like this is a very bullish bet, because you are hoping this call will go up in value. \n\nHalf of my portfolio is a single SPY call with 1/17/25 exp at strike $435 that I bought for $6500 and is now worth $14900. With that SPY call so in the money I can sell OTM calls against it at shorter expirations. It’s recommended to sell something between .16 delta or 0.3 because you want them to have a very low likelihood of ever getting in the money. I personally have been sticking to the lower end , 0.16, because the market has been so green lately that on some occasions I’ve had to buy back my short calls. The nice thing about the big delta spread between the short and long call is if the stock goes up you the money you make on the long call offsets the money you lose on the short call to a greater degree. It only digs into your gains, rather than is a loss. This can change though if your long calls delta is too low, and the acceleration of delta on your short call (charm) outpaces that of your long call. But if you set it up smart you will only lose money if the underlying stock tanks and your long call loses lots of value. This is what I do on most stocks I am bullish on. I have spy, nvda, tsm, aapl, TJX, NTRA, RTX, EAT in my portfolio.\n\nOh another thing is the short calls your selling, its best to sell them 30-45 days to expiration because that’s when theta decay accelerates the most. Just be wary of earnings or any other events that can affect big price movements",
