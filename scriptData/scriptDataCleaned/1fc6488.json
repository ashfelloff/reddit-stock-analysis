So if you buy TLT, it behaves like a long term bond now, and in 20 years it'll still behave like a long term bond.\n\nIf you buy an individual bond, it'll get shorter and shorter in terms of duration (and therefore volatility due to interest rate sensitivity) as time goes on and the maturity date approaches.\n\nIf you're using bonds to diversify a portfolio of stocks, it usually makes more sense to use a bond ETF (or manually roll individual bonds periodically) to keep the duration roughly constant. Since bonds are somewhat negatively or imperfectly correlated to stocks, the bond volatility is generally advantageous.",
