  "selftext": "* Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares¬†fell more than 6.5%¬†on Monday, the third straight session in which the semiconductor giant has lost ground.\n* The losses cumulatively add up to roughly $540B in lost market cap, placing Nvidia firmly behind Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the race for the most valuable company on the planet. The Jensen Huang-led Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company¬†earlier this month.\n* Year-to-date, Nvidia shares¬†are up 145%, buoyed by a surge in data center revenue amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n* Separately on Monday, Taiwan news outlet UDN¬†reported¬†that the GB200 GPU is in short supply.",

I bought late in 2023 after their earnings and the stock boomed to $520 (pre split) in the after hours. I bought around $510. The stock proceeded to tank for a month-month and a half, and I stupidly listened to this sub:\n\n\"Why not let the stock go to 50 trillion, might as well with your logic\"\n\n\"You bought at the top? Lol\"\n\n\"You really believed the stock was worth $500?!\"\n\nEtc etc.¬†\n\nI sold like an idiot around $420 for a loss. If I would've held, I would've been up by about $28,000. But no, I listened to Reddit Stocks.\n\nIgnore the comments from people on this sub about:\n\n\"I knew the top was in because blah blah blah\"\n\n\"It's going to keep going down\"\n\n\"It's overvalued\"\n\nEtc etc.¬†\n\nLook at what the price targets are (ignore Reddit when they tell you price targets don't matter, they're not perfect but they're better than Reddit).\n\nBetter yet, go look at your own workplaces 401k account. Look at the holdings in your 401k portfolio. Nvidia is now in the top 3 holdings of most retirement plans, including the famously Reddit spammed VOO (because Vanguard is apparently the only brokerage with an S&P500 tracker I guess, and don't say it's the lowest expense ratio because my SWPPX has it beat).¬†\n\nNvidia previously has not been in the top 3 holdings of most retirement portfolios that most Americans are using - It now (recently) is.¬†\n\nBig money has shifted towards Nvidia and again, don't take my word for it, go and look at your retirement portfolios.\n\nAnd something to make you feel better - Summer months are traditionally bad for the stock market. It's okay if the stock dips during the next few months.¬†\n\nDo not listen to snarky Reddit. Keep holding Nvidia and buying the dip. When your 401k's start shifting money away from Nvidia, then it might be time to think about cutting losses. Until then, hold, buy the dip, and ignore Reddit at all costs.¬†",
