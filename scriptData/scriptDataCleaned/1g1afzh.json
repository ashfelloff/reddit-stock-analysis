Robotaxi has always been his go-to pump the stock narrative. There’s a reason there were NO specifics (price, range, battery, release date, sensor suite) only vague BS about “ohh I bet it’s under 30k (lol)” and “hehe maybe 2026 but that’s elon time lulz “ . Then roll out the van with a skirt down to the pavement to hide any and all mechanics (it was a prop) and have dumbass robots serve drinks being controlled by people in headsets behind a curtain.
