Simply stacking ETF's on a regular basis and ignoring your account is the best thing you can do. Stop gambling, get a good paying job. When you have a house, an emergency fund and are maxing your 401K, HSA, IRA then give some thought to trading options or other more risky strategies. Personally, real estate has worked well for me after all of that and I don't trade options. Its the slow boring way to wealth but you should be able to retire in the top 2-5% net worth without a huge amount of risk.\n\nMy r/wallstreetbets advice...\n\nDon't be a quitter now, you could be in Lambo territory before you're 25, have a good cocaine addiction by 26 and be homeless giving out $10 handies behind the Wendy's before you're 30.

If I can make 200-500 bucks daily it’s a big win. It adds up believe me. Margin forget it , unless you’re experienced do NOT use it. Margin calls are real and they do hurt it’s not worth it to risk it. This is just my opinion and how I do it. It’s worked very well for me. Good luck. Just some words from an old fart.
