They didn’t sell, and now it’s 9:34am and you realize you forgot to set stops. 9:45am hits and you finally fully exit the position for a r/wsb worthy failure lossporn.\n\nNow comes 1:45pm. Traders are all back from lunch and have colluded to sigma-fuck retail. Ohio toilet. You have perfectly timed the bottom and liquidated. Legendary meme material. It’s 2:45pm and the price of your dumbass dumbness shit fuck position it up 36% in last 4 hours. \n\nSo you go get the gun and throw on some Korn. Shit slaps. \n\nFOMO has long since set in. They simply cannot stop thinking about her. It’s 3:04pm and you line up a 0dte that expires in like 30 mins, you send it. \n\nNaturally the option appreciated in value, as if to say “This is a test. First one is free. Everybody gets one. Don’t be a lazy greedy douche and we good.” reaching 19% gains. But this stubborn motherfucker wanted 20% because his brain said “I much prefer round numbers.” \n\nPoor sod never hit 20% stop. 3:55pm…. aaaand it’s gone. \n\nIt’s 7:55pm and the degenerate “options trader” freakshow starts scanning the markets for his next target 🎯 \n\n7:58pm is when he became acutely aware that he was gonna be at least a half hour late for his shift at Wendy. He has clients that depend on him, and to fuel the coinflip trades he depends on for his serotonin dump session, he cannot afford to disappoint. Anyone. \n\n6:48am brings the idea that maybe he could start a dumpster swapping business between different Wendy’s locations on some regional rotation. And I totally get it. I don’t like looking at that same  dumpster everyday either! Preach. Imagine the possibilities! Colors, textures, accessibility options, materials… customizing your Wendy’s dumpster value menu experience is an honor and a privilege. Good business is good business. It’s all about the repeat customers. \n\nOne thing I know with absolute certainty is that quantity and quality of Wendy’s “employee” is on the rise. You have to think outside the box.",
