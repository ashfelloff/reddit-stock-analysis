If it doesn't it won't correct by going sideways though. Max risk is clearly defined.\n\nGoing with options instead of common stock ownership also frees up a lot of capital that can be deployed otherwise. Think of it this way: the price of one contract gives you exposure to 100 shares of NVDA. He paid $4859 to get exposure to around $13000 worth of shares. That's like $8000 he can use for other positions.\n\nDepending on your personal preferences and situation this kind of position can absolutely be the correct way to go long NVDA. It's a sensible expression of a long position and that this sub dislikes it is a strong argument in favor of it.",
