I don't think Apple is asleep at all, I think they are being strategic about their play and there is a reason they are in the top 3 most valuable companies in the world. One last thing, Apple bought around 30 Ai startup companies in 2023. Something big is in the works.",

          "body": "If we talk about Neural Networks as AI, then it is a large dimensional mathematical problem, the issue is the large dimensionality that means you need a lot of processing to be done in parallel, yet CPUs are capable of multiprocessing only a small amount of things, yet GPUs since their initial role was to calculate the whole screen picture (1920x1080 pixels = 2M parameters) can do a lot more at the same time.\n\nThis is why Nvidia is so good for large language models, their silicon can run models with lots and lots of parameters more efficiently than any CPU in the world. If Apple wanted to catch up they would have to develop a brand new GPU aimed at only running tensor operation at the highest speed they can,then they would have to fight Nvidia for the fab space, and get it shipped. And even if they did all of that, most of the AI frameworks like Tensorflow are optimized with something called CUDA that's proprietary to Nvidia, so good luck then getting all the AI devs to move to your new chip any time soon. \n\nIt's like all those portable battery drills where they keep you in their brand because the batteries are not compatible within each other but in a much more larger scale and much more expensive scale.",

The only available access to it is CoreML where I found it kind of annoying to deal with model conversion.\n\nSecondly, MLX, apple’s ML framework programmed based on on-chip GPU and base CPU is too slow for local model training compared with torch paired with CUDA support. The inference is fine and ready to use, I have tried several Stable-diffusion models and some 7B llms locally on M2Max, fine, good enough for user’s daily usage. But considering training, even light-weight LoRA tuning, is damn so slow. I tried to tune the Unet with LoRA locally with a tiny personal dataset with a batch size of 1, the gradient computation is around 40s per sample which just would totally drive me away from using MLX for training or tuning locally.\n\nApple has a long way to go to be competitive in this AI market.",
