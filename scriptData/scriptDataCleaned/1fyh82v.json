  "selftext": "\n\nman man man. not too sure what happened this year, shit just feels like a blur tbh. \n\n2021 - 2022 i worked really hard to climb out of debt from gambling addiction. it wasn’t much at the time, around 20k or so in various loans and cc debt from gambling. i slipped up a few times in 22, but it was nothing major and i stopped myself before making any big losses.\n\nfast forward fall of last year, i finally have money in my savings account for the first time in my life-20k or so. i was investing half of that into tech stocks for a couple months and was making some nice, chill gains. well, that shit was so fucking boring seeing +$50 a day or some shit like that.. i needed that thrill and excitement back in my life and this wasn’t cutting it. that’s when i moved back into 0dte options and that leads us to where we are today.\n\nidk what it is, but something about 0dte’s and watching your money move up and down so drastically is some different shit. i pretty much payed my bills and lived pretty frugally and threw everything else into options ever since and continuously losing and blowing any gains i get. i find myself always fantasizing living some lavish life and how i could get that life from the next trade if i can get a 10 bagger. that’s when i lose it all and idk, it stopped feeling like anything after a while and if anything, it was kind of relieving and satisfying in a way.\n\nso here i am, currently in ~60k of debt, stuck in this cycle of continuously trading any money i get.\n\nmuch love guys. just felt like sharing tbh and hopefully you guys don’t follow my path! much love.",
