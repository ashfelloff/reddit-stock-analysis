  "selftext": "So this is how the story of most regards here goes - Put in some money - Get some ape first timer luck gains and try and replicate it for the next trade. Fail spectacularly but keep trying - End up losing most of your capital. Complain that you cannot afford any more SPY calls and REFILL your account. \n\nSee THATS your problem. Don't refill. If you're really good (and/or getting better as your ape brain is telling you), you should be able to convert $1 to $2. $2 to $4. $4 to $8 - You get the drift. You were dumb enough to lose the first 10k you put in. Now that additional 10k that you refilled is not giving you additional brains. Go and play with the leftover $3.5 and earn your way back up. And if you can't then thank me that your all time loss is just a fraction of your net worth as opposed to your entire net worth + all your + your wife's + your wife's boyfriends maxed out credit cards.\n\nI am not sure whether to flair this as discussion or meme. Mods please guide me. Thank you for coming to my ted talk.",
