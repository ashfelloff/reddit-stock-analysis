I understand you're referring to LLMs specifically, as opposed to AI in general, but even in that case we are witnessing just the beginning with LLMs. Most customer relations tasks will be performed by LLMs, multiple forms of education & learning tasks will be performed by LLMs, modern videogames will incorporate LLMs, etc, etc. Few areas of business or industries will remain untouched by LLMs. In fact, any AI system that needs to interact with everyday humans will necessarily have a LLM interface. See the holographic AI girlfriend Joi from Blade Runner? Yeah, it will need a LLM interface.",
