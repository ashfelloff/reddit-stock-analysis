HYG is hiatorically really good at setting series of lower highs before stocks top out for a period of time. It's not doing that yet.\n\nUnusual that VIX is showing a sort of warning but HYG is not. I'm going to ride with the BTFD crowd for the time being, though... until HYG or something else shows me things really are taking a turn for the worse in the economy and stocks.\n\nInitial jobless claims are still within the low range. I expect a spike next week due to hurricane Helene, possible that rattles the market for a little bit, but as that normalizes some again, it will be party on into the end of the year. We'll see what we have at that point.\n\nI'm expecting closer to $6,055 SPX EOY. We'll see if that proves to be the top or not, see what the trend in jobs data looks like at that time, as well as if HYG has then started to show bearish divergences. \n\nWe may have some chop heading into the election, then once the decision has been made, almost no matter what the outcome is, I expect we go up towards that 6,055 level.",

People believe what they hear without verifying all the facts for themselves. How does your bank account look? How does it feel paying interest on all of your credit card debt? How does it feel spending at least an extra $100/week on groceries? How‚Äôs it feel earning most likely the most money you‚Äôve ever made but yet still feeling like you‚Äôre going backwards????
