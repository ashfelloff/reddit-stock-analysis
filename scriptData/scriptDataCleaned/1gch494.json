If shit hits the fan and a significant war breaks out tomorrow, then China is absolutely fucked.  That oil, for the most part, comes by sea which is surrounded by semi-hostile nations that can shut that shit down in minutes.  So.. they are subsidizing the absolute shit out of EV's to avoid that reliance on oil. \n\nUS also likes having an automotive infrastructure and manufacturing capacity.  The US and Russia are currently the only countries on earth that can tell the rest of the world to fuck off and basically live as if nothing happened with the exception being semiconductors.   US wants to protect the automotive industry to as part of it's national defense strategy.  \n\nSo.. fast forward to right now, China is subsidizing past WTO standards in the industry and with recent slowdown in China, they're \"dumping\" cars in other markets.  The US wants to prevent that as it'd cannibalize it's own industry and potentially put them out of business.  China wants to dump cars because it needs to sell them since holding inventory is good for no one and has their own interest in seeing the industry succeed to ensure they aren't held captive by oil imports.",

The CCP, unfortunately (we're all victims in this bs), kinda really really screwed up capital outflows and that scared away a lot of potential investors + future investments.   That combined with the issues in real estate put it in a really tough spot.  China has a really strong interest in dumping goods and everyone else knows it.  \n\nThe US is basically playing the waiting game and hoping it works out.  Given the current trajectory - it probably will.  \n\nSadly, me as a US citizen and you a Chinese citizen are the ones who suffer in this bullshit.

Promoting a system that hollows out and destroys diversity of labor domestically has serious run on effects for the US economy.  We've witnessed its effects over the last 20 years.  A tariff might not be necessary if the Chinese workers had the same pay and rights as the US workers and the factories had to abide by the same environmental regulations, but they don't.  And if we're talking about tariff's on EV's, in addition to what was mentioned previously, a tariff might not be necessary if they weren't heavily subsidized by the Chinese government.  Their goal is to establish market dominance so they can run out the competition by undercutting.  Then they raise prices and we can do nothing.",

If you're actually trying to learn then you need to go educate yourself on how tarrifs work from a mathematical and economic perspective and how they're not an adequate replacement for revenues, not even close to enough to consider as a source of revenue because your description of how you believe things would play out tells me that you don't know what you're talking about.. Trying to replace global supply chains with local is something you only believe works when you don't know how logistics actually function or work which is what people who seem to like tarrifs all have in common, that their country is the center of the world or something.\n\nYou can't control nature and be God, but you can try and it will be a waste of time and money and backfire.",

They’ll just move those plants from China to another cheap country without the high tariffs. China made this really easy because China often doesn’t let American companies build their own plants there, they typically need to work with a local manufacturer, so changing to another country doesn’t hurt the US manufacturers significantly because they do not own those manufacturing plants to begin with.\n\nI think China’s big worry is that those manufacturing plants will go to neighboring nations they are on bad terms with. China has awful relations with many neighbors, seeing those nations both flourish economically as theirs decline, and those neighbors become more economically tied to the USA would significantly hurt their regional influence and power, while strengthening the USA’s.",

They've made some progress and a couple companies can compete with Tesla now.\n\n(These are facts, not open to debate) - In 2017, in response to this and other things, the Republicans helmed by DJT imposed tariffs of around 7% on a plethora of things coming into the nation.\n\nA tariff is a tax on an import by the government that the people pay. The businesses won't eat this cost. They'll pass it on to us.\n\nSo if any business in America buys chipsets from China, it's got a 25% earmark on it right now.\n\nMeanwhile, America has started to build its own chip fab places and ramp up investment there. Tesla is clearly the winning company for EVs worldwide. Etc.\n\nSo China is concerned over tariffs because America is China's biggest consumer and American tariffs are an effort to make Americans consume American things rather than Chinese things.\n\nIt sounds great and all, but the American steel industry isn't doing well. In fact, none of our industries are doing very well besides entertainment and cutting edge tech. Anything older is dead in America or dying.\n\nSo we're talking about the competitive edge of a nation.\n\nIt's good for America, bad for China, bad for the US consumers, and bad for the Chinese consumers. America first at its finest.\n\nHope I don't get banned for bringing you the answer to your question. \n\n\"We ban people for being overly political\" has been below this comment the entire time I've typed it, but this is your answer.\n\n^(ban people for discussing political things in a stock trading subreddit as if political things didn't impact stock prices?
