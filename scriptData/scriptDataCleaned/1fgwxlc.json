There's not a limit on the number of years you can do this, other than physical limits, so if you live forever you may eventually break even--assuming you make enough money to actually need to be concerned about tax write offs. \n\nI honestly don't know what the limit is for corporations. I recently heard that Jeff Bezos is still using write offs from when Amazon was burning money as quickly as possible. I assume there must be a limit, but no clue what it actually is.",

A number of them became paper millionaires (I met one of them) as the share price hit £15.\n\nBut then the share price started falling. If it had been me, I would have used a 20% trailing stop loss, sold at £12, and paid the capital gains tax.

Overtime can often make a single paycheck fall into a higher level tax bracket, leading to a paycheck that is not a whole lot bigger than it would normally be. I've had discussions with people who did not want to work any overtime for this reason - the perception is that the overtime is being stolen by the tax man.\n\nHowever, just because an automated system calculated your tax bracket higher for a single paycheck, does not mean that is the tax bracket you will be in when you file your taxes. So any extra taxes paid that week will be returned in their tax return. Still - they have to wait until they file taxes, so they don't see the benefit immediately.",
