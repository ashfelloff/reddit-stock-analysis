Still a huge market and wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia will dominate this because of their resources (hype AF market will think the same) - they will bring Macbook speeds / efficiency to windows. \n\nThey are doing this together with MediaTek (will be absolutely huge for them - but couldn't buy this stock as its Taiwanese) but they are only starting to rise substantially today so I think the rumor is not fully priced in. \n\n2nd of June would make perfect sense IMHO. \n\nx10 Leverage nvidia and sell after the announcement.",
