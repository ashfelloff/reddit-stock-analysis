  "selftext": "Gold is just starting to break out from almost 4 years of consolidation and 15 years of resistance. Gold can go up parabolically in almost any scenario. Rates get cut gold goes up because dollar goes down. Inflation goes up good rises because commodities do well in inflationary environments. If we have a war gold goes up as a safety trade. Even if none of those things happen and the market continues higher gold has proven that it can also go up with bull markets. Just look at 2020 and during the 2000s gold went parabolic. All in in all I am very excited about what the future holds and my leaps. ",
