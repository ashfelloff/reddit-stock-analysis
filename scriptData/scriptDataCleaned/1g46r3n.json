  "title": "The Future of Netflix: No Moat, No Margin - Like an Airline?",
  "score": 180,
  "selftext": "NFLX will report its Q3 results on October 17. Revenue and operating income are likely to meet or beat estimates, but future guidance looks risky in my opinion. \n\nIt looks like Netflix has reached its limit in terms of new subscribers and price increases. Daily active users are down in all three months of Q3, and that's the first time that's happened since late 2021, when the stock was also falling (source: BofA research note, 10/7/2024: Internet/e Commerce September app data: Mixed trends with Amazon DAU acceleration a bright spot).\n\nWith Netflix trading at 38 times estimated 2025 earnings, there isn't much of a \"margin of safety\". Today, the streaming industry is a bit like the airline industry: the players are fairly interchangeable to the customer, with not much to differentiate them. Aside from the content (which I think is declining in quality), Netflix's \"you can cancel at any time\" service literally has no moat. \n\nThe first streaming company spends 10 billion on content, the next 20 billion, and so on, while there is a clear ceiling on the prices they can charge. And Amazon is giving away its streaming almost as a free bonus to its Prime subscription... In the long run, it's the customers who win, not the investors.",
