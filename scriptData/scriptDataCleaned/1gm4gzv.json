  "selftext": "Fellow regards, longtime lurker breaking the silence to YOLO $32K to save the family farm.\n\nGrandaddy died in April this year leaving a 3 generation farm, (fully paid, no debt) to my parents. Mom never worked and my dad‚Äôs income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.\n\nI would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It‚Äôs where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. \n\nI‚Äôve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it‚Äôs an idiot move but it‚Äôs the only chance I have at this point and I‚Äôm 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. \n\nThe farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I‚Äôm willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. \n\nWould happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. \n\nBefore anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won‚Äôt sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. \n\nTLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun. \n\nThanks in advance!

Agree that if/when interest rates from banks approach the interest rate you are paying them, you'll buy them out with a standard mortgage loan from a bank. The 1.5 month payment for renting the tillable land pays for taxes/maintenance. And aren't there some government subsidies for agriculture - grab a little from that $30B handout? They get their upfront money from the $25K in your Robinhood account ($32k - taxes) and your current equity in your house upfront ($xxxxxx.xx) to splurge like the regards they are. \n\nIf they are greedy or the interest rate would need to be negative to afford it, just move onto the farm with wife and claim squatter's rights.",

Comments and DMs from those who have gone through something similar with their family‚Äôs farm have truly been uplifting.\n\nMany have asked about my current positions. Seems like I can‚Äôt attach multiple pics to one comment so will add screenshots of them under this comment. Have not traded anything since before posting yesterday. Have several contracts expiring on the 15th and will probably ride those out a bit before making additional trades. Please feel free to hate on my regarded positions, I know full well these plays look like they were picked by a sentient colostomy bag. Jesus only had 12 friends and one of them was a hater so if the good lord needed that on his team I probably do too.",
