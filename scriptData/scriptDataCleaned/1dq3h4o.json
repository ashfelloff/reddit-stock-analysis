Best example I can give is while I love the look of Nike cleats, when I played football Nike cleats would tear up week 3 of practice. On the other hand my ugly Adidas cleats that a senior gave me my sophomore year lasted me through most every practice of high school. Nikes look cool, unless you’re a sponsored athlete that can get their stuff brand new before each game they aren’t worth it. (Two exception they do make some pretty good basketball shoe lines that are sturdy, and their golf shoes have lasted everyone I know years).",

I don’t think the weakness in China has anything to do with Adidas — as much as it’s to do with the emergence of Chinese premium sportswear brands.\n\nThere is also some evidence that Chinese consumers are shying away from mainstream western sportswear and liking niche western sportswear brands much more.\n\nLululemon, Vuori, and HOKA are all western sportswear companies that have gained marketshare from Adidas and Nike.\n\nThis indicates that it’s less a quality issue and more of a “Nike is too mainstream” issue.\n\nThis happens all over the world, so it’s really not surprising.",

Adida,  on the other hand, constantly updates it's shop and in all the Taobao promotions.  The Adidas brand is so successfu that  the official Adidas shop on Taobao is the highest revenue shop in the world for Adidas.\n\nWhen I was in UK I bought like 50% Nike 50% Adidas but since working in China I have bought 0% Nike and became an Adidas fanboy.  Like 80% of my casualwear is Adidas.  Their range of options, constantly refresh of their goods and cheaper price make the brand so much better.\n\nNot sure why Nike is trying to promote their brand as a premium brand when they are the same quality as Adidas.  When China is having a slow down, people are going to be more price conscious, Nike is gonna suffer with their artificial prices.",

It's really hard on cleats, lots of cutting and running, in a two day tournament you could be clocking 20-30 miles depending on position. Plus practices 2 or 3 times a week. \n\nI destroyed several pairs of Nike football cleats over the course of one season. Switched to Adidas and regularly get 2-3 seasons out of each pair - it's night and day. The Nike cleats are comfy and performed well before they get obliterated, but when Adidas is cheaper, lasts way longer, and perform just as well the choice is obvious.",

I am bullish on Nike because they signed Caitlin Clark, someone who transcends sports. She's fourth in draw power, only behind LeBron James, Stephen Curry, and Tiger Woods.  All those athletes are on the decline in terms of their athletic peak, Clark could be #1 on this list in 3-5 years. \n\nNike has seen success with Sabrina Ionescu and the Sabrina 1, a popular WNBA athlete, but nowhere near the level of Clark's fandom and brand power.\n\nThe Clark Effect could be the equivalent of Taylor Swift. Every young basketball fan girl will buy her signature shoe when it is released. Like Air Jordan, the Clark Shoe could be a $1-5 billion brand within Nike. Clark's name could evolve into lifestyles and propel that business segment.\n\nAll this for $28 million over eight years? She could easily be worth $20-30 a year! Nike likely got a steal. \n\nBarring Clark suffering a career-ending injury, Nike can easily benefit from Clark's meteoric rise. It would be hard to mess it up. Nike has proven time and time again that they know how to brand and promote great athletes.",

They go from no inventory to too much in a month meanwhile they double in price since covid. Before you have a whole outfit for less than $60. Now your spending nearly $100 for just a hoodie and shorts. People are also extremely brand focus now. They won't just buy one nike hoodie and the rest Under Armor. They might like Nike more but they rather buy an entire fit of just UA if it means they are all from the same brand. Nike needs to dial back the inventory, lower their prices, and focus on the products people want which is redesign shoes and apparel. Not the same hoodie but in a different shade of orange with a $5 increase.",
