If Zuck will be loading up on Blackwells, then I’m loading up on NVDA while it’s cheap. He already said Meta will load up on 350,000 H100s but B100s look like they’ll be part of Meta’s 2024 infrastructure strategy now as well. Yet another example of how the market overreacted to SMCI and how there likely will still be excess demand for NVDA this year. ",
