              "body": "This. What kind of assassin takes ESOP, does 9-5, or works corporate? \n\n\"Professionals\" are usually freelancers and contractors who are at best part of a worker's union. Services are paid per job. Health insurance is not a thing cause they pay out-of-pocket to their underground medical practitioner. Maybe a few work for syndicates but those aren't tied to corporates and the syndicate workers are closer to AI kill drones than actual humans. Working with white glove service syndicates is the scrub move that 2nd/3rd gen trust fund babies would do cause they are too scared to hire from the black market mean streets. They'll get overcharged, want to pay by check so they can deduct if on their taxes as \"business expenses\", and ultimately get fucked like the scrubs they are when Feds raid their books and follow the record trail (Escort services with ex-porn stars listed as \"consulting expenses\". Shut-up bribe money listed as \"legal expenses\". And killing off inconvenient folks listed as \"pest removal expenses\".)",
