  "score": 498,
  "selftext": "* In the last quarter(s), the big five have raised Capex spending on AI, and their guidance shows even higher Capex spending on AI infra.\n* There is a race to capture AI offerings between Google, Microsoft, Amazon, OpenAI, and other upstarts. Neither can give up that race, even if it means more infra spending. For example, Google's stock fell 20% over a small bug in their AI offering. \n* The LLM model sizes are increasing multifold, requiring more/better GPUs, which means more business for NVIDIA. The previous models are mostly useless.\n* Assemblers like SMCI have projected a doubling of sales in their recent earning, even with lower margins. \n* Nvidia keeps an insane margin and keeps raising it. Their ability to tell a story around the lower cost to operate, including net energy and compute has been bought by the market. Huangs says it is cheaper to run AI operations with a million-dollar Nvidia chip than a free chip from a competitor. \n* There is still no competition to either Nvidia chips or the Cuda programming and libraries that almost everyone uses for GPU ops. Nvidia has a 10-year lead on GPU programming and open libraries.\n* **A reversal of this trend would have telltale signs. None exist.**\n\nTldr: Nvidia will beat the earnings and raise. The trend will continue for a few more quarters until a recession hits and Big 5 can't spend on infra. We will have bigger problems than Nvidia stock if that happens.",

I think even if the they beat earnings but raise the prospect that things are slowing down then you will see a massive drop; so instead of trying to predict what the the price movement is going to be focus more on forecasting what the market will be like, but honestly unless its a full time job of a team of expert ( even then its just guessing) just buckle up, get some popcorn and just hang on imho.",

Google does not buy that many GPUs from Nvidia, they build their own tensor cores, Apple too uses Google Tensor for anything ML and AI. Nvidia isn't the only player around the space, and many things will evolve. Betting on Nvidia staying market leader at the start of this tech boom isn't different than betting on many others that have been market leaders in tech before, and aren't anymore. Sure, Cisco and Intel made great products and money, and yes, computing and internet were indeed good things in hindsight, but if you bought McDonalds or Costco 20 years ago instead of those two you would've made more money, because they were hella expensive.\n3. Companies that shell tens of billions in AI, but show little to no return for it (pretty much all of them), will have to face cost cutting and looking for the alternatives. The money shelled now is only there due to hype and because there's a race to capture a market (without even knowing how to monetize it), but this isn't gonna last forever.\n4. As you can imagine, at the already insane prices, in a cyclical market like tech, there's more risks than gains to be found by betting on Nvidia\n5. Logic matters little, companies go down with good earnings and outlooks, or go up when they face tragic earnings, so any logic argument is still potentially detached to short-mid term market movements.",

Azure has been growing rapidly, typically posting revenue growth rates of around 30-40% year-over-year.\n\nThe countries significantly investing in Nvidia include the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Japan, South Korea, United Kingdom, Germany, and Canada.",
