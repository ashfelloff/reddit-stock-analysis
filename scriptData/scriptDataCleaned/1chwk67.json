I’d prefer if cars were sold the same way as a gallon of milk. I can over pay at Whole Foods or pay less at Pathmark. What I don’t want to do is have some 25 year old try to work the ‘ol 4 square and run back and forth to their sales manager pretending to work. Car salesmen produce nothing and create nothing. \n\nThey act like they are like real estate agents but they essentially do nothing but try to collect a commission. Buyers are dumb, but they are smart enough to know that they are getting the run around strictly to extract more money. At least real estate agents can facilitate connecting buyers to sellers, but with cars the buyer is doing all of the searching themselves and knows what they want. Buyers seek out the specific car they want and they want to buy it, but then it turns into a whole thing…..\n\nIf I was king for a day and I would mandate all car manufactures in America need to service and sell all of their own new and used cars for a single sticker price. You can run promotions when a certain model sits for too long, but the sticker is the price. End the fuckery and just move cars. Saturn had the right idea back in the day with their no haggle pricing, but their products sucked.",

Also see how they ADD together the GPU-s of retail, wholesale and other instead of weighed average to get the GPU number they love to use in the PR.\n\n2021 pump they did almost the same thing, except there they divided the total gross profit of retail, wholesale and other by the number of retail cars sold only, only retail. To get the GPU number. Didn't include the number of cars sold wholesale and other at all :)\n\nI've seen all kinds of schemy ways to cook books but not as blatant is this, TWICE.
