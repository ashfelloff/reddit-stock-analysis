Every dollar spent on the military will not only be burnt in the atmosphere but will upset  people through news, and it will also be used to  make fewer people. People make money.  Less people less money to be made. Simply less labor force. \n\nJust look at russia. Some old guy wanted more land and gas. And now their military budget is going to be 30 percent of their yearly budget. They have to offset every dead person in the workforce by paying more to people outside of the military. All of the money spent on war ammunition,  war tech is designed to be wasted. Their GDP numbers are high, but what is the use of gdp  if the product is wasted. Now, they are trading lentils for mandarins with Uzbekistan. Good job.\n\nNow look at China. For a country of billion people, their army is very small, moderately well equipped. Less than 3 percent of the budget spent on the military.",
