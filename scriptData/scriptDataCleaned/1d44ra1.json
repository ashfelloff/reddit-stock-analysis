  "score": 570,
  "selftext": "HPE is definitely the red headed step-child in the server market. However, at this point its valuation is becoming attractive.\n\nMy bullish case is:\n\n1. They haven’t really participated in this AI rally yet like SMCI or DELL.\n2. I think they finally are getting their shit together and actually bringing compelling (or at least viable) products to market. At least all of their marketing messaging seems to be all in on AI.\n3. Shares and calls are cheap.\n4. If Dell does well on earnings, I think HPE will also get a lift. You can play it more risky by getting in today, or safer by getting in after Dell ER.\n\nSo, I’m just hoping for the “me too” effect here next ER mostly.\n\nPosition: 200 $20c for 6/7 and 200 $20c for 9/20.\n\nEdit: Hey Mods, can I get a flare... like \"WSB Tech Anal-ist\"",

The network components alone can impact a super computer pod by 7-10% in CAPEX.\n\nHPE Cray XD670 is a white label of Gigabyte’s G593 platform. It’s superior in almost every way except a few imo which are the server management features as well as a bump in power consumption because of the air modules needed to cool down the server.\n\nSuperMicro is selling metal where Dell and HPE are selling total solutions for data center, systems and networking from the time you plug something in to the time you spin up an application. SuperMicro is way over valued imo.\n\nHPE is a leader, next to Lenovo in water cooling. Dell is trying to go OCP for their water cooling form factor and it’s a long long ways away.\n\nLook I think all three provide a ton of value, all three are going to be big winners, but HPE is going to be the next big big winner this cycle.
