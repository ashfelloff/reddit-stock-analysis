Don’t think of the S&P 500 as this static thing that represents the same thing it did 30, 40, 50 years ago and now investors are just happy to pay more for a dollar of earnings.\n\nIn the 1950s, 60s, 70s, the largest companies in the S&P were GM, Chevron, GE, etc. Companies with low margins, low growth, hugely capital intensive, etc. Now when it’s lead by companies like Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, etc. who grow earnings extremely fast with huge margins, of course the valuations are higher. It’s common sense that fast growing, high margin, capital light businesses get higher valuations than slow growing, low margin, capital heavy businesses. That’s always been true.",

There’s no reason that is true. At the end of the day a company is its earnings, and the PE ratio just relates price of the company to its earnings stream be it current or expected. You can buy your earnings for a higher price in your capital light, tech companies, but eventually those ratios will come down as their revenue stream matures and their business matures and the product they provide loses its novelty.

              "body": "Yeah, there were 60% or so odds of a .5 bp cut this morning, so the market got what it expected, and selling on the news is never unexpected. There was a pop at the start of Powell's speech but when reporters kept pushing Powell to forecast the pace of future cuts and he slapped those questions down, indices started to drop. \n\nI heard a stat recently that 50% of the time a market hits its yearly high, it happens in December, and it's weird when we don't have a Santa Claus rally, so it's not contrarian to call a year-end rally. Of course, the last 2 weeks of September are the worst weeks of the year. I have a little cash on the sidelines, as I doubt it's straight up from here with all the unexpected drama and investor/algo jitters we have from now until Nov. 4. I want to be 100% invested by the time tech earnings start. \n\nThe only thing I'm mildly concerned about is that the BOJ will probably raise rates again. As far as I can tell, absolutely no one knows how much money is involved in the Yen carry trade, though it seems a lot of that is invested in AI-oriented megacaps. I am keeping an eye on the Yen, which is at least off its lows. Oil, another canary of weakening markets, is also off its lows. Some people are crying about a looming year-end crisis in corporate real-estate when debt is refinanced, but I don't see evidence of that happening now. \n\nIn general, I'm really optimistic about the next year, because I think rates will go down, though not as fast as most people think. Tech has never performed this well in a high-rate environment, and usually a low-rate environment is needed for a tech bull run, but the tech stocks that are dominating have never had so much money. So, I'm looking forward to lower rates but hoping for at least a small pullback between now and the next rally.",

If they don't act in line with the US with their rate decisions, then yen carry 2.0 will most likely appear. That's trillions to balance on a very sensitive to change and irregular market. They did not fully unwind all that, not to mention the trillions in unrealized losses the banks are still sitting on.

      "body": "Could be right. The options flow nerds I've listened to have said to expect a decent amount of uncertainty/choppiness through into the election, but after that, buckle up.\n\nIt does bear saying that normally rate cuts are an indication that the federal reserve has recognized that the hike cycle has finally started showing adequate slowing in the economy to justify the start of cutting. These cycles take substantial time to play out for the effects to truly be felt through the economy, both in terms of lowering rates and raising rates.\n\nMore often than not, especially with a BIG hike like we just went through, it increases the likelihood of a bigger fall. There's been a small uptick in unemployment %, but initial jobless claims aren't showing a substantial up move yet. This morning's number was lower than expected and on the low side of normal, even, which bodes well for the economy.\n\nNon-farm payrolls have been steadily dropping from the peak of re-hiring post COVID, but even though we're near the lowest NFPA since COVID, the number is within the average range of 2010-2019... It has not yet had a monthly report come close to 0 or below.\n\nHiring has slowed, but the fed says their feel is that there are not impending lay offs that are about to occur. Maybe we do get a slight uptick in unemployment in the next year, but they aren't expecting anything drastic. Maybe the mythical 'soft landing' does infact happen.\n\nJust keep an eye on those numbers. Also, a great product that often shows a series of lower highs prior to the major stock indices hitting their all time highs for the cycle is $HYG. High yield corporate bonds ETF. $HYG has recently continued to set new highs from the sell-off that happened in 2022. It's not showing any bearishness at all yet.\n\nSo yes, I would argue that for the remainder of the year at a minimum, stocks keep going up. But, the rate cut segment of a cycle needs to be treaded through carefully, because historically the economy does tend to have a bigger downturn that ultimately causes a prolonged stock bear market of a year or more.\n\nMy advice is to be on your toes and keep watching non-farm payrolls and initial jobless claims at a minimum. Initial jobless claims are nice because we get those numbers every week. Total unemployment % and the non-farm payrolls are once a month numbers. You will absolutely see a big upwards divergence in initial jobless claims well before the rest of the numbers start to move in a worsening direction significantly.\n\nFor now, the market is assuming the soft landing is on the table, but it can't be absolutely certain about it. The data they all rely on is \"so far, so good.\" So yeah, let's keep rolling with the bulls for now. Just be vigilant because we're at that time where it can suddenly be the start of a bear market if significant worsening of the economy starts to show up in those numbers.",

      "body": "The hole in the US balance of payments is slowly widening, in the second quarter the current account deficit reached $266.7 bln, over the last 4 quarters it amounted to $0.95 trillion. A large deficit of $1.1 trillion a year in goods is partially offset by the services sector (+$288 bln). The revenue situation continued to deteriorate (-$144 bln y/y). \n\nOne of the problems here in recent years has been the fall in US net investment income to 0.09% of GDP, which had been as high as 1-1.5% of GDP before 2020, but rising interest rates and a relatively strong dollar have brought it to near zero. More and more debt has to be paid, in this sense the dollar is a fundamentally unstable currency that if rates fall too quickly (risk-adjusted of course) will come under pressure due to reduced capital inflows, if rates remain elevated will remain strong in the moment but will continue to face further current account degradation and problems over the long term horizon. \n\nEspecially given that the commodity deficit is only growing so far: the last 4 months have averaged around $100 bln monthly, i.e. approaching ~1.2 trillion annualized levels. And this is despite the fact that over the last 15 years the US has shifted from being a net energy importer to a net energy exporter, but everything it has saved on that has been spent on something else. \n\nTotal external liabilities on the international investment position rose by $7.6 trillion to a record $57.1 trillion last year, while assets only rose by $3.2 trillion to $35.8 trillion, the net international investment position is negative at -$21.3 trillion, or 75% of GDP.

Based on annual data composites, at the end of 2024, the Dow should be at 39,500, the S&P at 4900, and the NASDAQ at 16,800. We are way past that. Everything regresses to the mean based on a time tested commitment to exercise risk up to a certain level before some 'news' causes retraction.  That is why, for the last few decades, the Dow averages 8.6%/yr vs the S&P at 10.5%, and the NASDAQ at 13%.  But for the last decade, it has been higher, largely as a catchup after the great 2008 meltdown.\n\nTake this with a grain of salt with the following caveats.  1) Your mileage may vary. 2) These indexes have fluid components and 3) if AI actually does fuel GDP, then all average returns will increase.  This has already been an excellent year, better than we should expect.  \nFinally remember that a lot of that 6 trillion is tied up by an aging boomer population intent on surviving at low, very low risk even if it means stuffing it into a mattress.  And, when their descendants inherit those RMD linked IRAs, it will be a slow dribble to unlock them, pay the taxes, and reinvest or more likely, buy new toys.",

      "body": "While the optimism presented is understandable, there are several key counterarguments to consider regarding the potential for a massive market rally into year-end.\n\n1. **Earnings Strength May Not Last**: While current earnings reports might appear strong, many analysts are concerned about future earnings sustainability. Economic indicators suggest a slowdown in consumer spending and potential margin compression as companies face rising costs and tighter margins. If earnings forecasts begin to decline, the current bullish sentiment could rapidly shift.\n2. **Bearish Sentiment is Justified**: The high levels of bearish sentiment amidst all-time highs (ATHs) could indicate more than just a contrarian opportunity; it could signify real underlying concerns. Market sentiment can be a reflection of fundamental issues. Investors may be cautious for a reason, such as geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, or a looming recession that could disrupt the current market euphoria.\n3. **Rate Cuts Don’t Guarantee Growth**: While the Fed’s decision to cut rates can indeed provide short-term relief and liquidity, it doesn’t automatically translate into economic growth. The effectiveness of rate cuts is often mitigated by existing debt levels and the fact that consumers and businesses may remain reluctant to borrow and spend, particularly in an uncertain economic environment.\n4. **Cash on the Sidelines**: The notion of $6 trillion in cash on the sidelines might be misleading. This cash includes savings in high-yield savings accounts and money market funds, where many investors prioritize liquidity and safety over risk in turbulent times. When uncertainty is high, it’s more likely that cash will remain on the sidelines rather than flowing into equities, especially if investors feel the potential for a downturn outweighs the risks.\n5. **Election Year Dynamics**: While it is true that election years can bring positive market movements, they can also introduce volatility and uncertainty, particularly with a highly polarized election. The unpredictability surrounding policy changes and potential shifts in government control can lead to market jitters rather than a clear rally.\n6. **Valuations Are Misleading**: The forward P/E ratio of 22.5x may appear attractive historically, but it’s crucial to consider the context of interest rates, inflation, and the economic environment. High valuations relative to historical averages can signify overextension, especially if earnings growth does not materialize as expected. The market can remain overvalued for extended periods, which can lead to sharp corrections.\n7. **AI Hype and Reality Check**: The perceived \"dead\" AI hype might actually reflect a more sobering reality. Companies that over-promised on AI capabilities may face significant pressure to deliver real results, and any disillusionment in this sector can adversely affect broader market sentiment, particularly if major players report disappointing outcomes.\n8. **Uncertainty Abounds**: The current economic landscape is fraught with uncertainty—whether it's supply chain issues, inflationary pressures, or geopolitical tensions. These factors can undermine confidence and dampen any momentum that might otherwise drive a rally. History shows that markets can react sharply to unexpected events, leading to increased volatility rather than stability.\n\nIn summary, while optimism can be infectious, it’s essential to maintain a critical perspective on the underlying economic realities. The combination of potential earnings challenges, justified bearish sentiment, the limitations of rate cuts, and the impact of broader uncertainties suggests that the path ahead may be more complicated than the rally narrative implies.",
