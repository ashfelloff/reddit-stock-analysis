It happened within the last five years or so.\n\nEdit: I gave ChatGPT4 all I could remember and asked for the details and it said:\n\n“The billionaire you are referring to is Xiang Guangda, the owner of Tsingshan Holding Group. In March 2022, he found himself in a significant short squeeze in the nickel market. As nickel prices surged dramatically, Tsingshan faced massive losses. Xiang Guangda negotiated with the London Metal Exchange (LME) to cancel billions of dollars in trades, effectively resetting the market to the prices before the spike.”",
