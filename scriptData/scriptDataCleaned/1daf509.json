For folks not familiar with /ES that means E-mini June 24 futures contacts have to come back down to 5251.25 for him to break even (he still has to pay commissions on those 160 contacts so real BE is a bit lower). To trade one /ES June 24 contact the margin requirement is $11.8k, he shorted 160 contracts, 160 x $11.8k is approximately $1.88M in margin requirement plus cost of commissions to open this position. The market has been going up the past week, explaining the negative P/L on his short. \n\nYou know it not out of the realm of possibility that this could still turn around for you in the next week or two but I‚Äôm curious do you have a stop somewhere?
