In the early days of call center outsourcing, one bank gave customers the option to connect to their US call center for $3/mo extra, or connect to a Filipino call center for free. 80% of customers took the free option.\n\nI have no question that call centers will be automated with voice synthesis, I have no question it'll be worse than humans, and I have no doubt that end users will ultimately put up with this cost-cutting measure anyway. In fact, I think voice synthesis is where the money's going to be at with this chatbot mania. \n\nBut there's a limit to how much support the chatbots can provide, because they don't actually comprehend anything. They just imitate text patterns from Google searches, and your support can't get very complex with that.",

It's probably easier to think in terms of tokens per support call, or maybe support calls per million tokens. 10,000 tokens is maybe a bit low, but 100,000 seems way too high. So let's say 10k tokens per call, or 100 calls per million tokens.\n\nWhat's it cost to pay a person to do 100 calls? Let's say it's $25/hour after payroll taxes, healthcare, etc.. We'll say they can handle a call in 5 minutes on average, so your cost per call is about $2. So a million tokens in a system that can replace them is worth $200-ish, if you believe some random dipshit on reddit (me).\n\nMy company pays OpenAI for an enterprise license to the API. I don't know how many tokens we're getting, but it's a *lot* more than 100M. Devs get a personal budget of 20M per month for experimentation and code assistance, on top of all the other stuff we're using it for (can't talk about it).\n\nSo the value proposition of a $2k/mo subscription is definitely there if it's got reasonable token limits. I don't know that they're gonna pony up for better code assistance (unless it's *way* better), but this could be the death knell for call centers that are late to the punch on LLM integration.\n\nPuts on...somebody look that up for me.

So it will just make the expression of an intelligent answer. They are limited to the data they learn from and because these data is provided by humans the LLM's will never be more intelligent than the average human being - so not very intelligent. And they fake answers they don't find. Nevertheless in my opinion they will make boring tasks like coding far more accessible for non programmers which will increase business productivity.",
