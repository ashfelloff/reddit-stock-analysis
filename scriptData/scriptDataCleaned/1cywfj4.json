Earlier this year, the post earnings price peaked 2-4 weeks later (February 21/March 7/March 25).\n\nIf it gets there before August earnings, that's when I would have a decision to make.  Get out at that point with $50k profit, or hold through late August earnings expecting further gain.  I don't know that holding through earnings at that point would be worth it...probably would mean another $10-15k profit.  If it goes wrong though, it could lower the profit to $35k.  I'd probably get out before earnings & not get too greedy.\n\nIf it isn't there before earnings, I'll definitely hold through & live with the outcome either way...\n\nI think the main thing is to set a profit target & get out if you reach it.",
