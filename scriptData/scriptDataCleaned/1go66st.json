          "body": "They provide personal loans, car loans and HELOCs to prime and sub prime borrowers. Their model (i am intentionally omitting the word AI model because some people disagree with that) analyzes credit risk based on different factors and provides a lower risk to return. They have limited loans on their books and they originate on behalf of banks/ credit unions which justifies their valuation as a tech company. With lower interest rates and better credit risk model, they are coming back to growth. Lessor bank regulations in trump administration will help and Upstart has a huge potential market to tap. More than 90% of their loans are automated which is a big advantage from cost perspective.",
