This is in line with that.   \nI always trade leaps, even for short-term swings, to avoid as much theta decay as possible and be able to absorb unforseen volatility without the trade going bust.\n\ni didn't always trade this way but after some serious post-trade analysis of my trades over the last three years I found that I've always made more money trading leaps. More of my trades end up being profitable and that just compounds to a superior return even if the profit per trade is on average lower. Having fewer losers is a lot more advantageous.",

So the return will also exponentially grow the more the stock keeps moving higher. This is necessary to counter-act the the theta decay.\n\nIt's comparable to trading with 2-3x margin, but without the risk of liquidation. The risk instead is time-related.\n\nFor example, if you had bought NVDA shares at $130 using 3x leverage, you would have been liquidated and lost your entire position by the time that NVDA bottomed in the low 90s this Monday.\n\nIf instead you owned leaps ( calls that expire a year out ) you would have still lost a substantial amount of money ( around 50% of your position ) but you would still be in the trade and you can still claw back those losses as price recovers.\n\nSo in this sense I see leaps as a superior form of leverage, especially for medium-term price moves.
