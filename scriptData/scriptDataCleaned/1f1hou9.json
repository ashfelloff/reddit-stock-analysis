  "score": 167,
  "selftext": "It seems that Morgan Stanley has finally seen the writing on the wall.\n\nMorgan Stanley said it is slashing its position in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock, citing a “continued slowdown in the auto industry, intense competition among electric vehicles (EVs) and reduced consumer preferences” for EVs.\n\nTSLA has been a part of Morgan Stanley’s model portfolio since March 2021, with the position increased in both September and December 2022. However, the stock was reduced in November 2023.\n\nSince the last stake boost in December 2022, Tesla has delivered a 15% return, trailing the Russell 1000 Growth Index (RLG) by 46%, Morgan Stanley strategists highlighted.\n\n“While we continue to hold a position in TSLA, due to the optionality of its various nonauto assets, we see an attractive opportunity to reallocate some of the position to other, less-volatile stocks that are not as economically sensitive and may have less pricing pressure,” they wrote.\n\nDespite Tesla’s status as the leading electric vehicle company in the U.S., with potential growth avenues in robotics, AI, and energy storage, the strategists have decided to reduce the position to make room for stocks with higher earnings viability such as Spotify (NYSE:SPOT).\n\nEarlier this week, the European Union announced that it would reduce planned tariffs on Tesla vehicles imported from China, lowering them from 20.8% to 9%. The EU is also cutting planned import duties for several other electric vehicle manufacturers.\n\nThese new tariffs will be in addition to the existing 10% duties already imposed by the EU on battery electric vehicle imports.\n\nIn June, the EU indicated it would impose higher tariffs on Chinese electric vehicle imports, arguing that these vehicles \"heavily benefit from unfair subsidies\" and present a \"threat of economic injury\" to European EV producers.",

                      "body": "“a worse carbon footprint.” Elon is fleeting, the environment is forever.  Some of us have to hand it over to our kids. But hey, gotta date and cars matter for that in some circles. I know zero women who have an opinion on Elon musk, but I know several liberal women who drive Teslas. Doesn’t affect the TAM in any meaningful way.\n\nI should hope that when you say “go F yourself” and you have “F you” money, you would spend it using the legal system to harass the people you told to go eff themselves.  I would and I often fantasize about using the legal system against the people on my list.\n\nAs for dating dem or repub, well, it sounds like you and these women are firmly rooted in a two party system - which is why it will always be a two party system.  I’m not convinced that everything hinges on politics outside of the coastal areas of which you speak and unfortunately for the rest of us, that area seems to think they are the gold standard and all else exist at their pleasure. The rest of the world does want the best car.  Again, not impacting the TAM much.\n\nI hope you know that in today’s political climate social liberal/fiscal conservative has turned into socially vocal liberal/conservative voter. Places like Reddit and (elected?) mods ban one party and not the other for the exact same things, it’s a bias that amplifies one party’s ideologies and silences the other. This is not unique to Reddit. What I mean to say is, I understand why people might think that many, many people are dropping from Tesla’s total addressable market, but I’d wager people have just figured out that if you sound remotely non-liberal, you’ll get either banned by a (elected?) moderator or instantly downvoted if someone quaffs even a thimble of non-liberal speak. Similarly, if you are not anti-Elon you will be called a fanboy or a simp and downvoted - that is fact on the Reddit of today.\n\nI know that you know that coastal liberals are a small fraction of the human population of driving age and with the means/desire to purchase an EV.  You probably also know that coastal liberals are a subset of liberals and hardly indicative of the feeling of all of the liberals - the coastal are just the most vocal and receive the most press (aren’t the “news” organizations located on coasts and owned by…liberals?)\n\nOn those lines, certain groups love to scream about controversies. Isn’t it the reaction to a statement that determines whether it is a controversy? I mean, the group receiving the statement and allowing words to hurt them and then repeating them while looking for validation of how wrong it was, that’s the controversy. Do you really not think that Elon calling Biden a damp sock puppet had serious consequences from liberal leaders and news outlets? Not so damp now, eh?\n\nIf EVs were more feasible in terms of range, charging, and price, demand would not be dropping. If demand were not dropping, sales would not drop.  See above sock puppet comment for why the decrease in demand for teslas is reported as being due to Elon and regurgitated throughout the corners of the internet as gospel.\n\nI’m a hardcore liberal bleeding my heart out for the environment, but because I want to date liberal women and because I don’t like the CEO, I will buy an inferior car.\n\nNot even an American car. To me, that’s the hardest part to swallow. People who advocate for that party but then buy foreign.\n\nThe elaboration helps, but the logic of bleeding for the environment and touting liberal ideals while buying an, by your own admonition, inferior foreign car, is, as stated sarcastically earlier and again now, stellar.\n\nBTW, calling someone the wrong name is a power move. Try it, if they don’t correct you they are afraid of you, and a lot of people won’t correct you. Or at least that has been my experience.",

The house I was staying in for the week didn’t have a charger and I had to charge it three times at a Tesla Supercharger, each time taking around 25-30 minutes. (I was in the Hamptons so driving around to Montauk, East Hampton, South Hampton etc)\n\nIt was great driving it overall but having to rely on the chargers was definitely a hassle compared to ICE. \n\nI’m strongly thinking about an EV for my next car but I’ll admit I’m road trips it’s more of a hassle. Around home though, great. And I have solar and a home battery so it makes it a no brainer.",
