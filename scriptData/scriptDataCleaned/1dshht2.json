  "title": "Nvidia Just Getting Started: Stock Heading to $150 and Possibly $200 by year’s end",
  "score": 1053,
  "selftext": "A lot of people think Nvidia is overvalued or a bubble, but I think Nvidia will easily get to $150 by the end of July or beginning of August and $200 by the end of the year. \n\nAI, and Nvidia along with it, are generational investment opportunities. Nvidia has a first mover advantage in which they’ve continuously blown expectations out of the water in earnings reports but they don’t settle for just that. They constantly innovate with new chips such as Blackwell coming out that will be even more efficient and economical.\n\nYes, Nvidia’s stock valuation of $3T is high but at one point $1T was unthinkable. Then Apple crossed that line and they didn’t just stop with iPhones - they expanded into services. Nvidia can do the same such as in: self driving cars, human robots, weather forecasting, safety whether in manufacturing, complex companies or industries, medical diagnosis or cures for diseases will be a huge boom for the stock going forward. The possibilities for AI are exponential. Whether we like it or not, trillion dollar companies seem to be becoming the norm - of which Broadcom could be the next of what has been an exclusive club until now.\n\nEvery time there have been investors saying Nvidia couldn’t possibly go up anymore or beat earnings again, Nvidia shatters expectations and the stock goes up. How many times have there been articles saying AMD would take Nvidia’s place or had a Nvidia killing chip - yet after years that hasn’t happened and Nvidia’s only gotten stronger.\n\nThat’s not to say over time Nvidia won’t lose some market share or have a down year or miss an earnings report, it’s not always going to be 100% rosy or smooth sailing - after all it is a chip stock fundamentally. There are risks such an economic downturn, human caused climate change, regulations, demand on the power grid that all threaten AI. At the same time, I just believe that at the end of the day AI will play a large role in the future and with that Nvidia is at the center. Chips are in so many things and the potential for AI to change the world really could just be the start of the next Industrial Revolution.\n\nPlus given how bloated the valuations of every stock are right now - and how much Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple are increasing their valuations - Nvidia is far from alone with high valuations. I don’t think AI is a bubble but I do think that Nvidia and the market as a whole can get ahead of themselves.\n\nOverall, this is likely just the initial first stage - not the end - of Nvidia’s growth story.",

Someone did it. Seems obvious that even though the projectile or aircraft may be moving too fast for an audio signature to tell you directly where the object is, you can project where it will probably be pretty tightly.\n\nSomeone start working on a submersible drone aircraft carrier.",

Your argument seems to be that because it’s not rational for a stock that has gone roughly 10x since it is unlikely to go higher. This is absolutely not at all how the market works.\n\nYou’re going to have a rough time if you try to force rationality onto something governed by fear and hope. Because people can both fear missing out on a rally and hope their investment continues to skyrocket, the odds of NVDA 20xing are even higher now that it has 10xed than if it had only 5xed.\n\nThat’s because once a stock reaches a certain level of notoriety it sets things in motion: skyrocketing stock makes the media cover the company, media covers the company making other business owners and decision makers and investors aware of the company, the new awareness drives sales and the stock price, the skyrocketing stock price and earnings feedback on itself  generating more news coverage including Huang signing the tits of some teen. \n\nOf course, none of this is rational. But this irrationality is what makes trading possible. \n\nSoros describes this phenomenon as “reflectivity” and wrote a book about it called The Alchemy of Finance.",

They were trading at such an over-value that it made no sense at their current time & future growth.\n\nMost big name tech stocks today are trading at fair value today with earnings and forecasts to back it up. The prices makes sense when looking at company's reports.\n\nNvidia's stock only doubled and then some but their revenue was 6x that in the same time period with very optimistic prospects. Competition is a concern but if that was the case, we probably would have heard something from AMD by now, and we have, but AMD is selling chips on different AI technologies.\n\nAside from their own chips, Nvidia is selling proprietary server racks which are only compatible to their products. They also have really good software, which is also part of the \"walled garden\". So its unlikely that Nvidia can be surpassed anytime soon today, and even if competition arises, they have a wide moat and few levers to pull.\n\nAs a PC enthusiast, I thought AMD would take the win when they were releasing last gen GPUs but lo and behold, Nvidia pulled out the 4090 that peaks at 450W. They just refuse to lose and are willing to push their silicone to the limits just to hold onto the title of being the fastest. Bringing the same attitude to this segment of business where they basically print money, they are likely to try even harder to maintain themselves as the leaders of AI.\n\nthat being said, im still not invested in nvidia but soon",

But not everyone has a GPU dedicated for their personal AI assistant, yet, and the demand for that is still being figured out (either in the cloud or in private hardware)\n\nApple has their app store established, Nvidia has nothing similar right now? (My suggestion for Nvidia is to have a standalone AI unit to sell customers that can promise more security with private data than cloud providers, then an AI-app-store for that device, allow it to be more flexible than a TPU would allow)\n\nProbably priced in, but I do see more continued growth potential for Nvidia hardware and customer base, Apple seems to be becoming a financial services company for their growth focus? (Apple monthly pay)\n\nAm I missing significant parts of Apple value? Nvidia value isn't customer facing any more, so it's harder to know the true current and future scale (??? == Profit!)",
