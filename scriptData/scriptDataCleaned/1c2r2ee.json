Thatâ€™s why I was a firm believer that the recent lawsuit is just noise.\n\nAlthough Apple isnâ€™t as revolutionary as it used to be, they still make a lot of profit, theyâ€™ve released their new VR Headsets and they have a cult-like following. \n\nI guess itâ€™s a little easier evaluating a blue chip tech stock compared to penny plays, because those fucked over my portfolio a few years ago.
