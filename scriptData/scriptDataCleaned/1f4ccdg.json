  "score": 425,
  "selftext": "Dell reported quarterly results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations, powered by an 80% increase in server sales. The stock rose more than 5% in extended trading.\n\nHere’s how the company did for the fiscal second quarter vs. LSEG consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: $25.06 billion vs. $24.53 billion expected\n\nEPS: $1.89 adjusted, vs. $1.71 expected\n\nNet income climbed 85% to $841 million, or $1.17 per share, from $455 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Revenue increased about 9% from $22.93 billion a year ago.\n\nDell typically provides investors with a forecast on its analyst call. Earlier this year, the company told investors to expect revenue between $93.5 billion and $97.5 billion for the full year, up from $88.4 billion in the prior year.\n\nDell has emerged as a top vendor for servers that can handle artificial intelligence workloads, especially those based around Nvidia chips, as demand skyrockets from cloud providers. Earlier this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called out Dell founder Michael Dell as the person to contact to place orders for systems that include the company’s new chips.\n\nDell shares are up 48% so far this year, but have slumped 34% since the company’s last report.\n\nAI sales are in the company’s Infrastructure Solutions Group, which makes servers and systems for data centers. It’s the company’s fastest-growing unit. Overall ISG sales rose 38% to $11.65 billion, ahead of StreetAccount expectations of $10.44 billion.\n\nThe standout in Dell’s report was Servers and Networking revenue, which includes both AI-oriented servers based around GPUs from Nvidia and AMD, as well as more traditional servers for older applications. It’s part of ISG.\n\nThe unit reported $7.76 billion in sales, rising 80% on an annual basis, and beating StreetAccount expectations of $6.37 billion. Dell said $3.1 billion of that was AI server sales, up from $1.7 billion in the May quarter.\n\nDell operating chief Jeff Clarke attributed the increase in revenue to server demand that continues to rise, and said in a statement that there was an increasing “backlog” of $3.8 billion in AI server orders that haven’t been fulfilled yet. There’s also a multibillion-dollar “pipeline” of AI server deals from enterprises and cloud providers that haven’t been finalized.\n\nHowever, Dell’s storage business, also part of ISG, fell 5% to $4 billion in sales.\n\nDell’s Client Solutions Group, which focuses on PCs and laptops, declined 4% on an annual basis to $12.41 billion in revenue. Consumer sales fell 22% to $1.86 billion, and the company’s enterprise PC business was flat at $10.55 billion in sales.\n\nDell said that it spent $1 billion in the quarter on share repurchases and dividends.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/dell-earnings-report-q2-2025.html",

This growth is indicative of Dell's strategic positioning as a key player in the AI market, particularly with its partnerships involving Nvidia's technology.\n\nInterestingly, while Dell's overall revenue reached $25.06 billion, reflecting a 9% year-over-year increase, the margins have raised concerns among analysts. The net income increased substantially, yet the overall profitability seems constrained, leading to discussions about competitive pressures in the server market.\n\nFor those interested in the broader context of public SaaS companies and their performance metrics, you can find more detailed [Public SaaS Companies Insights](https://publicsaascompanies.com/) on this topic.
