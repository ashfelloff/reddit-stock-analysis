  "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying I live in a HCOL area in a major city. These observations are indicative of what I believe to be generally high earners that live in a wealthy suburb with median home prices >$1MM\n\nI was in the drive thru behind a 2024 Escalade and had to repeat my order 3 times because this motherfucker’s brakes were sending shockwaves all the way to the fryer. She couldn’t have been going more than 3 mph and the squeak emitting from her vehicle was severely disrupting my order.\n\nNow this can only mean one thing:\n\nSuburban mom’s are cucking themselves out of new brake pads because the damn grocery bill is too high. Thus, their husband won’t be able to afford their new boyfriend’s rent. This is a serious issue that could lead to the total collapse of the middle class in America.\n\nI need you to observe how much squeak you hear on the roadways this weekend. I fear we’re reaching peak squeak. Brake pads are the perfect middle ground between disposable income and necessity purchases and when they go we know what’s next.\n\nFear the squeak. 25 SPY 570p 10/31",
