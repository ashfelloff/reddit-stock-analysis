  "selftext": "Alright, guys. Consider this a follow-up to my last NIO post. I bought some Nio call earlier and its printing, I’m selling off some of my other holdings to ride this trend when the market opens.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wxiodau6fvrd1.png?width=387&format=png&auto=webp&s=3159fc1099c782241a38b2018765a9c94eab7255\n\nIt might sound crazy, but hear me out—here are 8 reasons why I’m YOLO-ing into NIO right now:\n\n**Fed cutting rates** – The Fed’s already cutting, and they’re likely to drop another 0.50 at the next meeting with inflation coming down (real or fake numbers, who cares). The golden rule: *Don’t fight the Fed*—when they cut, the market goes up.\n\n**China stimulus** – The Chinese government is throwing out stimulus like crazy. Look at their index—stocks are limit-up every day. This bull run won’t be short because China’s economy is so messed up, they *need* this boost like nana blessing. And the 3 trillion yuan aid package hasn’t even fully kicked in yet, use your imagination bro.\n\n**Chinese economy recovery** – Like I said, this isn’t a short-term bull. It’ll probably last a year or two. China’s economy will improve, their purchasing power will go up. I’ve seen posts from Chinese forums—some people are making crazy money, like 600k RMB in a day, others upgrading their cars. This will keep happening before the next crash.\n\n**Chinese stocks are dirt cheap** – Everything is on the floor. Check your charts and you’ll see how ridiculous the prices are right now.\n\n**NIO is even cheaper** – NIO is way down compared to other big Chinese stocks. It’s been shorted and tanked for so long that even a 50% jump from last month’s price is still a bargain. And let me remind you, despite being a loss-making company, NIO’s sales are beating BMW, Benz, and Audi combined in China.\n\n**NIO just got new funding from Anhui state** – The last time Anhui invested in NIO (April 2020), the stock shot up from $2 to $60 in a year. This time, even if it just doubles from $6 to $12, it’s a piece of cake. [https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models](https://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/3280434/unit-chinese-ev-maker-nio-gets-us471-million-fresh-funding-new-models)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rg906zosfvrd1.png?width=1835&format=png&auto=webp&s=44ed8692cd07ecf9284499d91ba068552d23f8cb\n\n**NIO’s next two earnings are going to be huge** – They just launched a sub-brand called 0nvo, and rumor has it they've already got close to 60k units booked for the 0nvo L60. The CEO promised all orders placed this year will be delivered by Chinese New Year, which means the next two earnings reports should look pretty sweet.\n\n**A turning point is coming** – If 0nvo’s sales continue to pop off, and NIO maintains their current numbers, they’ll scale production and cut costs. They’re also planning to launch a mini car brand next year. If all three brands take off, NIO could finally turn a profit. Remember how Tesla skyrocketed once it became profitable? That’s the kind of potential we’re talking about here.\n\n------- Adding another reason here -------\n\n**Strong reversal pattern** - Read the self-explanatory screen shot below, $10 is doable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5w47bzucawrd1.png?width=1219&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc3b04db0ce14f133b98013a70a30e6c5e2b0265",
