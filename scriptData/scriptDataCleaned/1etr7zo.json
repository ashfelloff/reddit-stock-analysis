I had that happen to me last quarter when I held calls past June 18th because I had a price target of $145 post stock split...  I still made a lot of money on those, but it could've been about double if I sold when the stock was at $135-140 range for that 1 day.\n\nAbout holding through earnings - I won't believe that they will miss on earnings until I see it happen.  \n\nAll of the cloud/hyperscalers who reported recently are getting dinged for major overspending on AI infrastructure...& most of that money goes straight to NVDA.  The Blackwell delay is supposedly already accounted for, but they could still get dinged on that if they confirm it on the call.  But who knows, they may even announce that they solved the Blackwell problem with TSMC & there won't be a delay (which could ROCKET the stock higher).  \n\nAFAIK, they've never actually confirmed the rumors of a delay up to this point.  If they get on the call with a beat, raise AND they announce that's there's no Blackwell delay - that's when it could get really interesting.  I think that would be needed to push it past $150 & into $160 range.\n\nI'll be holding through earnings & living with the result either way...I haven't risked anything that I can't afford to lose.  But yeah ideally if they beat & raise, I'd like to hold until 2 weeks after for peak price (which is around 9/11)...but with the jobs report on 9/6 I don't know if I'll have the guts to hold past 9/4 or 9/5.",

I think absolute best case scenario is $165 about 2 weeks after earnings (9/11), but his expiration is 9/6.  The next jobs report is on 9/6 also, so holding beyond 9/5 comes with huge risk given the reaction to the last jobs report.\n\nIf OP sells at $155, he’d have about $165k in profit & would owe about $50k in taxes.  I’d set aside the $50k for taxes, wait for another big dip to buy & hold $100k worth of shares, & still have $15k left over in cash.  You are risking having to hold the shares through a recession if one happens though, that’s a potential downside.  I don’t think there’s much doubt that the value of the shares should end doubling (or better) in 5-10 years, but yeah you can’t panic sell if a market crash happens.",
