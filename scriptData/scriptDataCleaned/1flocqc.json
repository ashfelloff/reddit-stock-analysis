  "score": 349,
  "selftext": "Waller reiterated that the economy is strong and the aggressive cut is due to core PCE running below Fed's target.\n\nHe goes through a brief explanation [on this video](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/09/20/fed-governor-waller-says-inflation-softening-faster-than-he-expected-put-him-in-half-point-cut-camp.html), which is worth watching.\n\nI'm curious:\n\n* Do you buy this version of events? \n* If you didn't believe Powell's story that \"economy is fine\" does anything Waller say here change your mind?\n* How will the stock and bond markets react?\n\n# Source: [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/20/fed-governor-waller-says-inflation-softening-faster-than-he-expected-put-him-in-half-point-cut-camp.html)\nCiting recent data on consumer and producer prices, Waller told CNBC that the data is showing core inflation, excluding food and energy, in the Fed’s preferred measure is running below 1.8% over the past four months. The Fed targets annual inflation at 2%.\n\n“That is what put me back a bit to say, wow, inflation is softening much faster than I thought it was going to, and that is what put me over the edge to say, look, I think 50 [basis points] is the right thing to do,” Waller said during an interview with CNBC’s Steve Liesman.\n\nBoth the consumer and producer price indexes showed increases of 0.2% for the month. On a 12-month basis, the CPI ran at a 2.5% rate.\n\nHowever, Waller said the more recent data has shown an even stronger trend lower, thus giving the Fed space to ease more as it shifts its focus to supporting the softening labor market.\n\nA week before the Fed meeting, markets were overwhelmingly pricing in a 25 basis point cut. A basis point equals 0.01%.\n\n“The point is, we do have room to move, and that is what the committee is signaling,” he said.",

If the economy was going to stay exactly like it is. Of course there's no reason to cut. That's not how it works. The economy is very dynamic and the general direction it is heading is absolutely slowing. It's worth noting that it's going to continue to slow for the next 200 basis points or so. In my opinion that gives a upside risk scenario to the Fed having to cut 75, do emergency 50s, this all took place in 2001 mind you. Things slowed a lot more than they expected after all those hikes and we just had a huge series of hikes. The idea is to prevent unemployment from going meaningfully higher. Promote business confidence. The election will soon be behind us and we will know what policy will have. I would not blame someone for being 100% in TLT or a mix of TLT and some of the shorter dated bonds if they were extremely risk adverse. I think the risk of the economy slowing more than expected is far far higher than inflation reaccelerating. 50 was absolutely the right move but more importantly, what are they going to do moving forward? If there's any hint of things slowing more than expected they have to keep cutting 50 and get us down to about three and a half percent by spring to summer of next year. Maybe 3%",
