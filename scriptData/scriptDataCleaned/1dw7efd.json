  "selftext": "If SEC staff have severe restrictions and rules on personal trading (managed and enforced by a small staff of ethics professionals for a work force of @5,000 employees), why can't Congress have similar rules and just have SEC ethics staff act to clear permissible trades? \n\nAn add-on for Congress might be to require pre-clearance requests be made public on a central website 24h hours before being allowed to execute, if granted permission to trade by SEC ethics staff.\n\nSEC staff have outright bans on options and many individual stocks, holding period requirements, required pre-clearnace of trades, etc., all of which extend to staff members' spouses and dependent children. \n\nThis isn't rocket science.\n\nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2012-title5-vol3/xml/CFR-2012-title5-vol3-part4401.xml\n\nUpdated recently...\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024-25\n\n",

          "body": "Honestly that should just be its own constitutional challenge\n\nThis isn’t an agency deference thing because these are actually codified rules, nothing ambiguous\n\nThis court will delete them and the SEC like Thanos, but thats the point of having laws that only subject one class of people to them: the people affected and with standing are too poor to do anything about it, and the rich people dont even know about it\n\nThe government will argue that it only affects *margin* accounts under $25,000, you should argue that it chills your expression under the first amendment and cite citizens united that money is speech. You should throw additional arguments at the wall like that it subjects the court of federal claims to many cases unnecessarily, denies equal protection under the 14th amendment, is arbitrary and capricious towards brokers under the 5th amendment, is corrupt as shit because the SEC merely mirrored FINRA regulations to turn them into federal law.",
