There’s a 50-60% upside in the near term, half of which we have in the price today.. if you got into this stock at much higher levels ie 2,3 + yrs. ago, I’d assume you have been selling it off taking the tax loss, making gains elsewhere and buying the stock back at under $90 if you’re a true believer, which has been possible for a year and a half now. The stock is indeed cheap and is indeed sitting on a mountain of cash plus they have an active buy back program, but… I reckon the stock will slope back into the 90s, could even be into the $80s, as the stimulus news slides into the old-news rear mirror and very ordinary quarterly results return. $400+ is an historical dream, $200 requires a sustained reacceleration of the Chinese economy over the next couple of years. But, another stimulus announcement could give it another 20% pop, but that can’t be coming soon, and from what level if they do at some point in the next 6 months? I reckon there’s 15% to the downside before a sustained growth can be realized.",

Including the covid lockdowns, and all the US anti China's bullshit sentiment. (Even though most of the products here are from there).\n\n\nThere were so many things making this stock a hated company. Not one of them was based off of lower earnings. As their earnings are exceptional. And actually better than any other US company.                        Leverage makes stock buying much more difficult because it locks one in to a time restriction. It HAS TO happen in a certain time. Stocks just don't behave that way. I would be leery of using leverage. ",
