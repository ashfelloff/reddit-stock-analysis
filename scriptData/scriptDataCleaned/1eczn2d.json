Can you specify what you mean by drawdown (the term itself is somewhat self explanatory, but the devil is often in the details).\n\n  \nIntuitively I feel like the AI bubble is very similar to the dot com bubble of the late 90s, in that they are both based on very real world changing technologies, but without hindsight it's impossible to know what will stick, what won't, and how to realistically capitalize on the technology; not to mention the necessary infrastructure and societal changes needed to actually realize the impact of said tech.  If we assume there is an AI tech bubble that will behave similarly to the dot com bubble of the late 90s, what does your graph predict in terms of investment strategy?",
