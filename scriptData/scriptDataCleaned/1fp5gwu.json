I fall into this group; I don't got great liquid savings right now, so if I lost my job I would have cash flow problems for sure.\n\nBut I own a house worth nearly a million and have plenty of equity in it and a decent 401k. And I own three cars outright. And that's to say nothing of other illiquid assets like the 20k in tools in my garage that I ain't selling, but that I could if I needed to. \n\nI guess what I am saying is apparently you should stick to English grammar lessons on the Internet and leave the economic analysis to others.",
