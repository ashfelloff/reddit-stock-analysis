I did hear I was very popular with the Arabs and there was an underground network to get my films into their hands. I appreciate they risked their lives to see my Frat Boys series.\n\n\nAnyway, great job on the calls... oh and fuck you.",

                                  "body": "Word of advice, risking it all is pretty much like going full regard and you never want to go full regard. The amount of money you put into a trade should be based on how much you‚Äôre willing to lose and how much you believe in a trade. For me, I started off with $2.5k so I would break my trades down into two categories. I believe in this trade ($250) and I really believe in this trade ($500) \n\nReason behind this. $2.5k can be broken down into 10 $250 trades or 5 $500 trades. And out of the $250 and the $500 I only risk 20%. So if I drop $250 and it goes down $50 I take my loss. If I drop $500 and it goes down $100 I take the loss. If it reverses then oh well. Cut your losers and let your winners run. But like I said this works for me but it might now work for you. It‚Äôs up to you to find out what kind of trader you are, how much risk you‚Äôre willing to take on, and what trading style fits your lifestyle best",
