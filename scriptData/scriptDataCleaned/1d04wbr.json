  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Any thoughts on ULTA? This is a five year chart but it looks like it‚Äôs at a bottom with earnings coming out on Thursday. Looks like on top of earnings, it has a lot of catalysts going for it. \n\nELF earnings (dif brand, same industry) made ELF stock jump from 162-190. ULTA has offering expansion with doordash, and a forward P/E ratio of 14.24 vs the industry‚Äôs average at 12.51.\n\nDespite this, there‚Äôs also some bearish news like the fact that it‚Äôs double topped and CEO claims a decrease in market demand for the cosmetic industry. \n\nI can‚Äôt tell where it swings so thinking about a straddle? It either breaks resistance or pops back up right? deep ITM puts and deep OTM calls? I can close one leg after earnings and just watch price action on Friday to confirm a trend.",

If the delta is big, it means your balloon flies higher with just a little bit of air. If the delta is small, you have to blow more air to make it rise just a little.
