Therefore, we can probably estimate that call option writers are in control of the market.\n\nAdditionally, the current max pain is $225. \n\nThe current price of MDB is $226.30\n\nThe highest open interest call strike is $225 with 2,677 open contracts. Higher strikes also have plenty of OI.\n\nTherefore, we can surmise that option sellers will attempt to manipulate the price below $225 by next Friday's expiration in order to ensure that the highest number of call option contracts expire worthless.\n\nI do not yet have a position but will be looking to open a $240/$242.5 call credit spread with a 7% return on risk for expiration on 6/21.\n\nIf you have bigger balls, you could choose strikes closer to the money for higher returns. I will look out for a nice pop to get an entry.\n\nEnjoy.",
