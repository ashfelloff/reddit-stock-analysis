If it goes above the higher call you get (Premium - call spread). If it goes below put your break even is (strike price on put - total premium).\n\nCompared to a traditional covered call you lose gains on the upside, lose some in the sideways trading event, and hedges on the downside. You have to consider if you already own 100 shares, in a covered call you're lowering the cost basis but the profit declines once you start going under your cost basis (you still own the stock though). And in the Jade Lizard if you're doing it like this (no underlying stock) you don't start losing profit until that put strike price or above that lower call strike, and you don't start actually losing money until under that breakeven price.",
