  "selftext": "Nvidia and the market are like a rollercoaster right now. It's just relentless selling pressure where it seems like we can't sustain a rally despite analysts saying earnings will be good. There's good and bad news right now but seems like all the bad news is getting much more attention to the point where it's just sell out of fear or because everyone else is.\n\nThat and knowing that SMCI, while they dissapointed on earnings (again) did actually raise guidance is good for Nvidia?\n\n\nThe selling and talk of $800 and $700 stock prices in the same month earnings should be great is just odd",

That is you, the insurance seller, gets paid for this.  I personally think this stock selling is a combination of irrational fear of long Blackwell delay and economy fear.  (Further, the news about a so called design flaw is really go questionable validity or usefulness.). If a stock goes below the strike price the option seller will typically find they automatically bought the underlying stock at the lower price.  One of course picks up a premium for selling this insurance policy.   It’s a great way to generate extra cashflow similarly to covered calls.  One typically sells puts when they would mind owning the stock anyway but also wants guaranteed cashflow.",
