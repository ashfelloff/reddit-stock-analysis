Since this put option has a strike price of $29, and INTC is trading at around $23, that’s currently $6 in intrinsic value per share, or $600 per contract.\n\nExtrinsic value is based on all of the Greeks. Theta, Delta, Gamma, Vega, Rho. But I’m not going to go into that, since it’s a whooooole other boondoggle.\n\nTo put it simply, an option is the sum of the intrinsic and extrinsic values.\n\nhere’s a good article to get you started\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/09/buying-options.asp",
