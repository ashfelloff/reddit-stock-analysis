Halifax PD hasn't ruled out that she was intentionally trapped in there, and if that's the case, then someone is getting a murder charge and Walmart will likely use insurance to pay out the family. \n\nThird, even if it was truly accidental and Walmart is liable, they make 4.5 B per quarter in profit. No payout is going to be large enough to really have any impact on the company's bottom line. \n\nReally sad, feel bad for her and her family. Hope if it was intentional the killers get caught.
