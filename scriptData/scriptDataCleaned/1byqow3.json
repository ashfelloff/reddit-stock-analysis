          "body": "You can suppress demand all you want with high rates, none of that is going to fix the supply side. It might even discourage companies from investing in real estate, effectively snowballing the supply side and raising prices even more. The housing prices will stabilize when thereâ€™s an influx of new home builds. When that happens the supply side will get fixed, demand will be met, and youâ€™ll see prices return to an equilibrium. To get this influx rates need to come down to encourage home builders. While rates and prices are high thereâ€™s too much risk for home builders.",
