  "selftext": "Hey, I just sold off 60% of the Nvidia position I've had since 2022, and I am now looking for a new good value-good growth company. Most of my holdings (around 65%) are in ETFs but the other part is in companies, which at the moment are Eli Lily, Microsoft, Rio Tinto & NVidia (Nvidia got trimmed because it got too dominant in my portfolio, and I wanted to take some profits).\n\nDo you guys have any advice on which companies or sectors to look at? This Sub gave me multiple ideas in the past and most of them have worked, so I am curious about your current opinions.\n\nedit: if you have any arguments for your opinion pls share them",

The Canadian Index might be the best steal of a deal on the market right now. I'm personally going to DCA into the TSX for a 10% portfolio weight between now and July 2025. Your USD goes a LOOOOONG way in CAD right now as well. Might offer some nice exchange rate upside as Canada slowly recovers from the decade of Liberal rule.",
