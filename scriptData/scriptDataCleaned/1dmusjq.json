I realized my mistake so bought 207.5 calls at 15:59 and the market closed with those calls down from 2.8 to 2.55 and the puts I sold now worth over 5.0 each.\n\nToday I woke up and sold those calls over 4 each, bought back the 210 puts for a profit and somehow everything worked out.\n\n![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)",
