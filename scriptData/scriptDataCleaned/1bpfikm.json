What happened to the tech-like valuations of the auto manufacturer? Was something not ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù?\n\nBeen saying for years. Tesla‚Äôs reversion to reality was always a matter of time, and it‚Äôs still not there yet. How much time is anyone‚Äôs guess, but this is what competition does. If Tesla had a powerful brand as many had been saying in the past, then prices would not need to come down. The fact is, their competitors always had economies of a scale to leverage, and would eventually catch up. \n\nThe same can be said for all the AI chip manufacturers. Industry peers don‚Äôt sit on the sidelines while one company makes cash hand over fist in highly price competitive industries. Margins will erode as peers compete on a basis of lower prices.
