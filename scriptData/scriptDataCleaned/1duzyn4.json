  "title": "AI already uses as much energy as a small country and this is only the beginning.",
  "score": 40,
  "selftext": "In January, the International Energy Agency (IEA) issued its forecast for global energy use over the next two years. Included for the first time were projections for electricity consumption associated with data centers, cryptocurrency, and artificial intelligence.\n\nThis usage represented almost 2 percent of global energy demand in 2022 — and that demand for these uses could double by 2026, which would make it roughly equal to the amount of electricity used by the entire country of Japan.\n\nWe live in the digital age, where many of the processes that guide our lives are hidden from us inside computer code. We are watched by machines behind the scenes that bill us when we cross toll bridges, guide us across the internet, and deliver us music we didn’t even know we wanted. All of this takes material to build and run — plastics, metals, wiring, water — and all of that comes with costs.\n\nAs the world heats up toward increasingly dangerous temperatures and with governments agreeing on net zero targets we should be able to capitalise on a market that I think will be probably booming relatively soon.\n\nWe should look at companies with strong fundamentals and well positioned to gain access to a market that is definitely going to become massively profitable.\n\nThis is a great time for us investors.",

Energy that likely won't be generated by wind or solar.  \n\nThen again, they don't scream too loudly about China and India polluting.
