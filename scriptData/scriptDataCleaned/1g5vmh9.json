  "selftext": "So I work as a housing counselor, trying to help first time home buyers purchase homes.\nThis last year I’ve been seeing ridiculously high mortgage payments clients getting approved for. Well above the standard 30% Housing Ratio, 44% DTIv ratios conventional mortgages demand.\nSpeaking with a lender today, turns out Freddie/Fannie have really relaxed guidelines around Housing Ratio. So people are getting conventional loans with up to 50% Housing Ratio! (Which means 1/2 of someone’s Gross monthly income is going to their Mortgage).\nThis reminds me so much of pre -2008. These loans are totally unaffordable. I’ve seen clients making less than me taking on payments $1,000 more than my Mortgage. And I’m not wealthy or crushing it by any means.\nBottom line- there’s going to be massive foreclosure rates coming in the next 1-5 years. Not sure how best to play it at this time though.",

Banks have learned from 2008 and the old lending practices was to take a house as collateral and then sell it as soon as they foreclose to get back as much as possible. This is what crashed the market in the first place. \n\nFrom that you will realize that banks have started changing their practices. Before banks were not in the business of owning houses. You will notice that has changed, one of the big buyers of residential real estate today are funds and banks and they are renting them out. Corporate home buyer ship is up overall. \n\nSecondly if you have been studying the market over the years you will see that foreclosures are down, that does not mean that defaults were always down, starting about 2010 the banks realized that if they dumped inventory onto the market they lose money so they started keeping shadow inventories of things and allowing people to stay in their houses longer. Banks are not doing this out of the kindness of their hearts, somewhere along the road they realized they could recoup their money by controlling inventory and selling at a more opportune time, and they realized probably during this time they could rent out the inventory which lead to above.\n\nSo while you may see some easing I doubt we will have a 08 collapse again for those lessons learned from corporations especially banks.",

I'm a lender), the massive appreciation we've had in the last 5 years due to limited supply (see above) and loose fiscal policy (see the deficit) means that even with 0 down loan programs it's pretty easy for an average consumer to have enough equity in the home to be able to see value in selling the home vs walking away. It was the rampant negative amortization that made foreclosure an easy choice for many borrowers.\n\nAnd even if someone forecloses, you have banks willing to hold homes (which retains surrounding property values), corporate investors looking to buy homes, and regular consumers wanting to buy due to historical low inventory. Until the inventory gets back to reasonable levels, you might see a slowdown in appreciation, but you won't see a bubble.\n\nIn layman's terms: If Wendy's has 67% less burgers to sell, and 12% more customers that want to buy them, they will end up throwing less burgers away in the dumpster at the end of the night, so you might go hungry next time you look there for food.",
