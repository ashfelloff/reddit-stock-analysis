  "selftext": "Google’s payments to make its search engine the default on smartphone web browsers violates US antitrust law, a federal judge ruled Monday, handing a key victory to the Justice Department.\n\nJudge Amit Mehta in Washington said that the Alphabet Inc. unit’s $26 billion in payments effectively blocked any other competitor from succeeding in the market.\n\nAntitrust enforcers alleged that Google has illegally maintained a monopoly over online search and related advertising. The government said that Google has paid Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and others billions over decades for prime placement on smartphones and web browsers. This default position has allowed Google to build up the most-used search engine in the world, and fueled more than $300 billion in annual revenue largely generated by search ads.\n\nThe case is the first antitrust trial pitting the federal government against a US technology company in more than two decades. \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-05/google-loses-doj-antitrust-suit-over-search\n\nGoogle will face another antitrust trial September 9th, this time over ad tech. The company will face off in federal court against the US Department of Justice in Virginia, after the DOJ claimed in January 2023 that Google violated US antitrust law by illegally monopolizing the digital ads market, allegedly boosting its profits while raising costs for advertisers. Google has said the DOJ’s reasoning “would slow innovation, raise advertising fees and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow.”\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/2024/2/5/24062497/google-will-face-another-antitrust-trial-september-9th-this-time-over-ad-tech",

While it is true that they are likely to release their own version, they will not want to add to their offences in their own lawsuit by making their own search engine default. If the DOJ prevails in that case, Apple will likely not even bother because they would be forced to provide equal ground on their devices. If Apple wins, Google is in trouble.",

The current lawsuit highlights Watch Integration and Digital Wallets in the Apple Case. That is, Apple keeps crucial API's private to other developers but use them for themselves resulting in Apple Watches being able to send messages while other smart watch devices can't. Even more indictful is that these API were public before Apple released Apple Watch. \n\nA possible flashpoint for this issue with regards to Apple Search is integration with AI. We've already seen other browsers moving in this direction like Microsoft Bing with ChatGPT, Google with Gemini, Brave Search with Leo, Opera with Aria, ... But Apple as a device maker has the opportunity to take this to the next level with further integrations with the search. This can create a completely broken playing field for search on IOS if these APIs are kept private (Apple Only). Before the current crop of lawsuits and antitrust actions, I would have been 90% sure Apple will go in this direction. But with this new developments, I am sure they will be wary of further antitrust scrutiny and might want to lie low for now.",
