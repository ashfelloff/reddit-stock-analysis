Additionally, TikTok contributes to the economy by paying taxes to both state and federal governments.\n\nUnlike state-capitalist countries, the U.S. embraces competition by allowing foreign companies to operate freely even when they become dominant in the U.S. market. Take Luxottica or ASML: these foreign firms dominate sectors like eyewear and photolithography, yet there is no outcry for U.S. companies to have similarly strong footholds in Italy or the Netherlands in these sectors. This is because the global market doesn’t function on strict reciprocity. What matters is the value that businesses bring to the local economy.\n\nIn the case of TikTok, it has stimulated competition and economic activity and has been a net positive for the U.S. economy. Banning TikTok would be economically harmful overall.",

Googles failure with Google+ deprived them from search advertising in Facebook and Instagram like user content websites. Their failure with chat let WhatsApp and others take over and lose that potential search advertising category\n\nRegardless what I don't like about Google has been their media content strategy to compete with Netflix and Spotify. They should be way more significant with how widespread Android and YouTube are. Stadia fumble was a major long term screw up in my opinion with Geforce Now and Amazon Luna trucking along. If Amazon didn't fumble and give up after one Fire Phone, I think Googles grip on Android microtransactions would have been way worse.

If it needs to be scientifically accurate it's less useful because you need to confirm the data with the source (which CGPT provides). Still, it sends me right to the citation, as opposed to me having to sift through the results. I've found the answers are about 70-95% accurate depending on the topic, and I simply confirm the data with the citation when I need accurate figures.\n\nMaybe a better way to describe the value for me is that it has sped up my process for finding and vetting and using information. However there is also an additional layer to this, which is functionality that Google doesn't provide. For example, I can ask CGPT to generate graphs and tables for me to quickly visualise data which might be difficult to consume at a glance. I can also ask it to generate custom images, which I use in presentations. They can even be used without copyright issues for corporate purposes. By taking a picture, CGPT can also summarise ingredients on packaging and medications and tell me if I might have interactions, given my medical history. It can provide tailored meal and exercise plans, and help me track progress. There are lots more examples of ways it has surpassed what I can do with Google.\n\nI don't mean to sound like an evangelist. It's only over the last year I've come to feel this way, and it's possible it's a fad. So far, so good.",

Pretty much all just press release websites, AI generated clickbait and making articles about what a few people on Twitter said for ragebait\n\nDiscord killing official forums. Official product forums were pretty high tier Google content. Discord search is awful but there's no other way to search in there\n\nNot just Discord.
