Then try trading them with $200 and see how fast it goes away (or grows??). \n\nBuying options is like buying a lotto ticket that's on fire, burning away. Every second of every day, it loses value just for the stock doing nothing. If the price doesn't go high or low enough by your expired date, your option expires worthless and you have nothing left except proverbial ashes in your account. \n\nAlso, if the price moves against you, your losses are magnified, possibly losing up to 20-50% of your value within minutes (or gaining). This is not a game you should be playing if you've never traded, it's gonna mess you up in the head, my friend. Cheers! 🥂",
