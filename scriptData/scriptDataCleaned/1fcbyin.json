So you fraudulently gained access to selling options through your brokerage and then write a post about how big of a mistake that was with information that barely even quantifies as the bare minimum? \n\nDid you not think that maybe there’s a good reason as to why doing this isn’t just open for anyone to do? Using chatgpt to answer the questions isn’t a viable strategy in life if you don’t understand what it’s spitting out. \n\nThis is such a massive fuck up on something so extremely basic that you should really consider limiting your account and only buying index funds. The severe lack of knowledge you’re detailing and your terminology such as ‘like a boss’ and ‘diamond hands’ should be a wakeup call to yourself that you aren’t and will never be good at this.

Now, if you don't already have the stock, you have to buy it since you can't simply back out of your promise.
