People have so much hubris they end up convincing themselves that they're more capable than the 10k people who specialize in optimal estimation and stochastic modeling. It's even funnier when it comes to derivatives. If someone buys derivatives for any reason outside an effective cash flow hedge, 50 to 1 odds that they're either incapable of reading a financial statement or they just have a degenerate gambling addiction.",
