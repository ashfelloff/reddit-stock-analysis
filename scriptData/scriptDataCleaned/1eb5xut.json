That puts you a couple percent above treasuries in returns. Do I believe that Google can grow faster than inflation for a couple more years? Sure? \n\nDo I believe that it has a lot of risks because it currently starts stuffing ads into their products and actively fuck up search to the point where people might actually switch off and go to alternatives? Also yes. Huge tech companies like IBM and hp sooner or later reach a point where they don't innovate anymore and well then they don't go away but provide stable revenue and profit. And have a p/e of 9-13. \n\nThe point is not that Google has that point TODAY. But again at a p/e of 27 and with a profit growth rate of even 15% that point can be in 7-8 years.",
