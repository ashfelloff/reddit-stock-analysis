Class A shares with voting rights and Class B shares with no voting rights. A holding company called National Amusements holds 80% of the class A voting shares. Shari Redstone owns National Amusements. However, National Amusements is in financial trouble and needs a bailout.\n\n**Current Situation**\n\nParamount Global entered exclusive talks with Skydance and are working on a 2 step deal:\n\n1. Skydance bails out National Amusements with a $2 Billion cash payment\n2. Paramount Global acquires Skydance giving Skydance $5 Billion in equity, thus dilluting current shareholders by about 50%.\n\nThe deal must be passed through a special committee with fiduciary responsibility to all shareholders. However, 4 members stepped down. Those 4 members are rumored to be against the merger.\n\nShari Redstone is doing all she can to save her holding company National Amusement while screwing over all the other shareholders -- almost exactly how she forced the merger of ViacomCBS.\n\nMultiple Common Shareholders have begun threatening lawsuits against Shari Redstone: \n\n* Gabelli Asset Management \n* Matrix Asset Advisers \n* Aspen Sky Trust\n* Ariel Investments\n* Blackwood Capital Management \n\nThe \"r/p\\\\a\\\\r\\\\a\\\\m\\\\o\\\\u\\\\n\\\\t\\\\g\\\\l\\\\o\\\\b\\\\a\\\\l\" subreddit has now gone private, for what I assume is them preparing to create a class action lawsuit. Before the subreddit went private, many of the members were also spamming investor relations with threats of lawsuits if the merger went through.\n\n***WINTER IS COMING***\n\n**P.S.** For you option gambling regards: The question is how can one make money off from this situation -- the stock has been extremely volatile and probably will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.",
