      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

                  "body": "just gonna copy paste from my previous posts\n\n  \nI strongly believe NVDA will continue going up and then eventually lose 75% of its market cap. This is not at all an investment, just a momentum trade for me to capitalize on companies attempting (and eventually failing) to capture AI gains.\n\nOne year, two years, or five years down the line, NVDA will fade as companies realize their large investments in GPUs will be for nothing as it's just not possible to make money off generative AI. I will never short NVDA, but I'll never hold it as a long term investment. I expect NVDA to do 160b in revenue in the next fiscal year with a 50% net margin. At a 50 PE which will give it about a 0.5 PEG which is extremely cheap imo, that gives it a valuation of 4.0T or $162/share which is my exit price. I will sell at 140 and 150 a share and finally fully exit at 162- I don't believe this revenue growth to be sustainable and fully expect the cycle to bust once people realize AI is impossible to monetize. MSFT is losing money for every subscriber, META has no monetization strategy, and GOOG/AMZN's cloud growth numbers are exactly the same pre-capex.\n\nI derived 160B in revenue based on TSM's revenue forecast. They expect to do almost 90B in revenue with half of that being attributed to NVDA. NVDA has a mid 70s gross margin, call it 70 for simplicity. By working backwards, we can get 150B in revenue from data center. We also have about 20B revenue coming from other segments of NVDA. I then subtract 10B to account for discrepancies in my assumptions.\n\nAm I wrong? Most likely. But that's my thesis and I encourage everyone to have their own.",
