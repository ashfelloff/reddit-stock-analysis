That one stock mentioned has been his focus historically. The other stocks are running outside on RK’s focus on one stock. Because of this those meme stocks are likely to get dumped when considering who is pumping them and their motives. There really is no hope in those meme stocks futures and because of this you know the dump is coming up real quick. If youre green take your gains and count yourself lucky. Nobody knows what RK’s chosen stock will do over the next few weeks and perhaps months or years. Obviously, everyone is an analytical genius at dichpering his memes right now, but the exact answer is uncertain. The question is, do you want to dive into that stock on faith in RK and that he has some wisdom that you don’t and your best interests in mind or do you want to watch front he sidelines? Sidelines comes with no risk of loss, but might come with regret. Diving is a gamble and everyone should assess what is safe for then to gamble before doing so. I chose to gamble. I discussed with my husband what number we are confortable with losing. We both agreed to a number. Right now, only 10% of that number is in the stock RK likes. On Monday I will decide if we through another 10% in this week or sit tight. RK’s memes are fun, but this has never been the Davinci code, because he’s always been crystal clear on which stock he is behind so don‘t let the darker corners of the internet become toxic to you.",

It was a swansong, that he also possibly made a shitload on? (he would have to confirm this). Hopefully you did too, because you will never again.\n\nHowever, there is another persona that was never referenced, Deep Fucking Value. In fact several of the tweets allude to split personalities or multiple personas for Keith Gill,  the movies Split, Fight Club, the Usual Suspects, Me Myself and Irene, and Black Swan, Walter White has two personas, so does Batman, Spider Man and Moon Knight (all were referenced). \n\nAlso, in several of the tweets including on Friday he showed a symbol, which I originally thought was the symbol for power off. But, it's really the symbol for logging off. He was logging out Roaring Kitty. \n\nMods, pin 📌 it. We may have seen the last of Roaring Kitty for a while, but DFV is just getting started and will be signing in.",
