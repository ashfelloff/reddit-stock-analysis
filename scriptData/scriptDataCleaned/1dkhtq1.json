Important smaller indexes/ETFs hit their upper bound in terms of price and RSI: -SOXX at 256 hit two trendlines, and daily RSI14 75 above which it gets only once a year or so, -PHLX SOX hit RSI 78 at which it always corrects -XLK hit major TL since X 22 and rsi of 80,5. Strangely Accenture results must have thrown it over the edge. -Nasdaq Composite: upper bound of a recent trendline (since mid May) and RSI of 80 at which it has always corrected except 2010,17,18 in the last 15 years.\n3. XLK rebalancing > selling the news (it's just 12% of average daily turnover and I see many people misunderstood how it's spread)\n4. AAII and II sentiment indicator became borderline\n5. Too many brag posts about NVDA on WSB/IG/random news.\n6. For too many data center/semis stock the same indicators became way out of line or right on the extreme edge (MU!)\n\n6B. Also many tech stocks, esp. those more volatile and the whole Communication segment was in downward trend for a few weeks/months now\n\n7. Ten year yield is below it's trendline since X 23 > ready to rebound\n\n8. Crude brent got above it's resistance at $84.25 / rsi 60 -> ready to soar\n\n9. DXY Dollar index could go either way the day before but decided to go upwards.\n\n10. Very interesting if you looked at the open interest in the morning how artificially the price was held up at 139.9x and then... boom!\n\nPersonally was hoping for NVDA to get maybe to 1499, therefore sold at 137.75 to 139.\n\n  \nHe's shit was too random honestly",
