Maybe xai tries to buy Tesla at some point in the future, if Tesla share prices continue to tumble.\n\n\nA side note: the wednesday vote also aporoved proposal 6 which gives directors one year terms.\n\nConceivably, Musk could be out of the position regardless, this time next year.\n\nI am curious how that affects his actions, too.",

However, that in and of itself is not illegal and addressing such stuff falls to the board's sphere of responsibilities (the obvious thing would be to stipulate that the CEO may not involve himself in dealings with related parties unsupervised - but at Tesla, the board put in place no such guardrails). Under the business judgement rule, all he has to prove is that he reasonably believed that this move *could* (no matter the result, theoretical possibility suffices) benefit the company. The obvious argument to be made is that in the current situation (down cycle, inventories piling up, up-front costs for layoffs) it was advantageous to preserve working capital by postponing taking delivery of chips (which as a consequence will not have to be paid) and that finding a third party to assume the delivery slot was a way to do so without further liability to the seller.\n\nIt cannot, under any circumstances be \"theft\", since Tesla never acquired ownership of the chips  from Nvidia (before it could, the shipment was redirected).",
