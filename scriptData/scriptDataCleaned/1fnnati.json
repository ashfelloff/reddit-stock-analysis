Those land developers need investors for the money to build real estate and the lease payments to the government. Those developers need more money for the construction and lease payments but the only way to get more money is to get more investors which means they need to lease more land so they can offer new properties to the new customers.\n\nThe other issue is the mindset of the Chinese people. They see real estate as only an investment. The booming real estate market in other countries is an effect of people wanting to live in those areas. Yes, there are investors that also buy properties but people still want to live in those properties so they can be rented. The people who buy property in China do nothing with their properties but they still expect to be able to sell their poor quality property for a profit after some number of years.\n\nReminds me of NFTs actually.",

Australia has the same land leasing policy, and their housing market is still massively inflated.\n\nYou're mixing it up. Australia has land leases but YOU OWN your land, a house, or an apartment in Australia when you buy it. Here in the US we also have \"right to lease\" that folks sometimes purchase in commercial RE, but folks buying those know they aren't buying the land/building/suite.\n\nChina is a **COMMUNIST** country. So ***NO ONE OWNS LAND EXCEPT THE STATE***. That means everyone could only \"\"\"buy\"\"\" AKA LEASE land for 50-100 years, build apartments/condos on top of those lands to \"\"\"sell\"\"\" AKA LEASE to tenents, and those have all been pumped to insane prices where folks have to take a 3 generation term mortgage to buy a fucking \"\"\"home\"\"\". \n\nEven then folks WERE pumping cash into the RE market like it's fucking WSB because China's stock market is so shit Shanghai version of the S&P500 peaked in 2007 and hasn't been near the top despite, Hong Kong's peaked in 2017, Chinese bonds get inflated just like US ones, and foreign investment is not allowed. At least the rich could pay the RE casino, but the poor had to prepay for homes until the market collapsed and now they're left with half build empty apartments.\n\nThey don't own shit. You can lose your lease when it comes due if Xi didn't like a meme your kid posted, if your local provincial leader has different ideas for your apartment complex, if another apartment complex company bribes a local official so they could build a newer bigger apartment where yours is, etcetc. \n\nSure the US has eminent domain and could take your land from you, but the US generally follows the rule of law and folks will be compensated. China under Xi has only proven that it's whatever Xi's whims followed by the CCP top brass, and then provincial/city/local fatcats with their business friends. The small folks are at the bottom getting railed.\n\nAt the core, the Chinese RE market is worth little more than crypto shitcoins because you're not actually buying anything but a lease assuming that the CCP will keep renewing that lease. Slightly because you COULD technically live in those apartments if you bought them in a good location, but most of the rich couldn't afford that, many others were just trading, and the poor overpaid for junk just so they could have a place to live. It's just renting with extra steps that got pumped just like crypto did. It's fucking great that China was acting like it's some fucking gold mine and restricted access to the rest of the world cause now it's mainly China getting fucked by their own shit.",

This will become the reality if inflation reheats and they have to raise rates again. \n\nI think Jerome “Premature Victory” Powell is going to pull a Volcker and have to double dip. Just a guess",
