                      "body": "I'm expecting the stock to go to at least 9$ if it jumps again later in the year and possibly higher due to FOMO by people who didn't get on it in February. Ever since then the stock had pretty strong support at 5$ and only recently broke through it which is really a blessing in disguise because you can load up on cheap 4-5$ strike price calls. 20th Dec or 17th Jan '25 are pretty safe. You can also get 6-7$ strike price for even more contracts since it'll most likely blast through those as well. \n\nThe only problem is low liquidity so not that many to go around and it's also why it's a bad idea to try to wing it by buying shortly before the launch date, one because launches are constantly postponed so a short term call might get fucked, and also because there just might not be any, though I do expect more volume as we near September.",
