  "selftext": "I applied for level 1 options in early March and it was going well. I was up over $10,000 at the peak of my account value. After that it all went downhill. Over the last few months I lost around $23,000 and my account had less than $1,000. I‚Äôm currently holding a goal to reach a positive realized gain by EOY, meaning I need to reach around $16,000 account value due to around $3,000 worth of deposits throughout this year. I‚Äôm on my way back as my account is almost at $7,000 and I am only trading options to try to recover my losses from trading options. I will update on my progress at the EOY.",
