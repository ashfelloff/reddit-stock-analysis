They don‚Äôt just run for no reason. \n\nASTS is sitting where they are right now mostly because of the announcement of the contracts with AT&T and Verizon. We basically knew about AT&T all along because of their investment positioning with ASTS, but Verizon was a big surprise and sent the stock flying and was followed up by people starting to learn about the stock for the first time. \n\nMy question is, what‚Äôs the next catalyst?  We‚Äôve all known about the launch, it isn‚Äôt a surprise. The launch is also a very risky event that doesn‚Äôt necessarily de-risk because it made it to space. Unfurling after it reaches space is risky by itself. \n\nI‚Äôve already made good money on ASTS because I bought in right after their last capital raise, but now I‚Äôve sold again because this isn‚Äôt free money in my opinion anymore. \n\nAnyway, good luck with your investment. I hope they make you a lot of money.",
