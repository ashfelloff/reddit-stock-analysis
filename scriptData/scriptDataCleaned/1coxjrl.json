  "selftext": "Seriously this is the most unstoppable,  thing ever. It will actually never go down. Sure you might catch an occasional red day here of there (or even week), but it will ALWAYS be met with a guaranteed instant V. \n\nIt doesn't matter what the fed does, doesn't matter what inflation is. Same stupid jawboning every day will they cut rates (which they won't). Who even cares at this point. \n\nThing is literally controlled to go up and up and up, rip V shape moves and there is nothing that can stop it. None of anyones silly charts or any crash/doom fantasy matters. This thing is going to continue to go up and up and up. \n\nCall me a regard all you want, but you know I'm right. Who cares about that silly red week 3 weeks ago, instantly wiped out by a V. By the time you even realize, QQQ will be 460, SPY will hit 560",
