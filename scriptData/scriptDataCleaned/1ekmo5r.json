      "body": "The thing is, the yen carry trade is 2 parts. 1 is a consistently weakening yen to the US dollar, the other is a very low interest rate for Japanese bonds creating an environment where you can borrow very cheaply.¬†\n\n\nYes we are seeing the yen strengthen, so that is bad for all these carry trades.\n\n\nBut we are also seeing Japanese bond yields drop like crazy. Japanese 10yr yield is now in the 0.7% territory. Low yields being the cause for yen weakness to begin with as money exits Japan and goes to us dollars to seek higher yields in US treasures and other foreign assets.\n\n\nWith yields this low, this actually sets up a continuation of the yen carry trade as investors will prefer higher return of US treasuries over Japanese bonds, sending money back out into US dollars to buy US treasuries.¬†\n\n\nVery interesting to see what gonna happen at the end of all of this¬†",
