I really donâ€™t think TotalEnergies would have loaned them $200M or so in February 2024 if they didnâ€™t think they could execute.

So I think there are just fewer and fewer shares available and more and more bulls for this stock.\n\nIf they restate their financials w/ earnings and guidance to still be profitable in H2 of this year, any short positions would probably look to cover and quick.  So it's a big bet on earnings and filing, but my theory is that Total Energies wouldn't have loaned so much capital in Feb if they didn't think SPWR could achieve their business plan. Still a bet with risk that they can't achieve their plan, but at least an informed bet with several institutions agreeing.",
