The whole point of buying bonds at high interest rates is 1) the bonus of a nice little return if you want guaranteed income and 2) a big payoff if you’re expecting interest rates to fall significantly. \n\nThink about it this way: if interest rates are at 3% or 2% (or imagine if they go back to unusually low rates like the last decade or so), and you have an instrument that guarantees the owner 5% for x years, how much do you think people will pay? Answer: between slightly less and slightly more than the initial cost of the bond + %rate it accrues on that value over its remaining years.",

Think of it this way: the stock market (and perhaps the economy) is a plutocracy controlled by major players in the game, of which the Federal Reserve is the main player.

Remember: the United States is currently holding $31 trillion worth of debt that's financing the game right now. Buffet's outlook is ALWAYS long term (he's an investor), and he believes that what's going on right now is unsustainable (which it is). So it comes down to: Buffet & Co VS JPow's BlackRock Fist.

                  "body": "You're asking me to write multiple chapters of a textbook, literally.\n\nT-bills is short for Treasury Bills. US Treasuries (US government bonds) come in two categories: the bills (the short term bonds, which mature in one year or less) and the notes (the longer term bonds, like the 2-Year, 10-Year, etc.). They are how the government raise money, how the Federal Reserve (the Fed) performs quantitative easing, the backbone of the repo market transactions between banks and financial institutions, the main ingredient of the money markets, and I can keep going. I can't write about all that here, and there are many more aspects of the financial system where Treasuries are a key ingredient of their plumbing that I'm not even very familiar with, because the global financial system is vast and growing/mutating every year. That's why anytime you hear someone say X currency will replace the US dollar as the global reserve currency very soon, you immediately know that they have no clue about the global financial system.\n\nI suggest you learn about the various aspects I mentioned above on your own and keep exploring from there. You can't do it in one sitting. It will take time.\n\nThe aspects most relevant to Buffett's move is that short end of the yield curve (that is, the yield on the short term Treasuries) will collapse when a recession hits. This is because in the normal structure of the yield curve, the short end is lower than the long end (that is, the yield on the long term Treasuries). But when the Fed raises the Fed funds rate (same thing people are referring to when they say the Fed is changing the interest rate, but there are many other things that are also called \"interest rate\", so I'm using the precise name here to make it easier for you look up more of this), the short end of the yield curve rises (this happened in 2022). Unless there are other factors forcing the long end to also rise as much as the short end, then you end up with an inverted yield curve. It's not easy for the Fed to influence the long end of the yield curve (that's what quantitative easing tries to do, but the market for the long end is so deep and liquid).  When there is a recession, the Fed is forced to reduce the Fed funds rate, and therefore the short end of the yield curve drops faster than the long end. This means anyone that buys up the short end (what Buffett's company has been doing) will rake in so much money. If there is no recession, you can still just hold those bonds to maturity (the yield on them are 4–5%) and the only loss is in the form of opportunity cost (i.e., missing out on better returns elsewhere).",
