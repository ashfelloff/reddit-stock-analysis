But it's just a domain name, a \"dot com\". how does having a website for your company given them value? \n\nSo naturally people started making businesses, registering a dot com name, listing on the stock index and got rich quick as investors poured money into everything that ends with a .com\n\nheck people even started buying every domain name just to resell them at a higher price. \n\nWhat value does holding on to a domain name give? (Hence the name dot come crash). Nothing really. \n\nNo one knew how to take advantage of the internet to increase value. it's not until decades later when e-commerce and cloud computing took shape.\n\nThis AI gravy train is the same. yes \"AI\" has its uses, but no one yet knows yet how to create value from it. everyone is just at the stage of buying \"Domain names\" right now.",

I don’t understand what your question is- the reality is that they have achieved price to performance cheaper with AMD chips than NVDA chips. Further scaling out GPT to more users will not make a difference to NVDA sales for training, but it will make an impact to the amount of compute they need for inference, in which case they likely would choose more AMD chips. As an aside, you are much safer buying the Hyperscalers and Apple rather than any of these chip plays because they are all eventually replaceable (see TPU).",
