This way you will have exposure to safety technology/self-driving-tech in the car industry.",

It tends to be cheaper to buy from a high volume supplier making items for many companies, like mobile eye. \n\nSome companies like Tesla and Rivian will do their own thing but not all of them. \n\nMy (probably wrong) theory is that mobile eye is struggling because a glut of inventory at car companies after the chip shortage. They over corrected. Demand for new cars is down with high interest rates. \n\nI think/hope that mobile eye will surge during the next big cycle.",

I could be wrong but it just makes sense in my mind. \n\nMobileye’s next few quarters imo will be very telling. Again maybe I’m being delusional but with how much $$ Intel is burning it wouldn’t shock me to see them sell more of their stake of this business. I know car sales are slowing down but I feel like if Tesla or some of these other car companies make a push to sell their own data/lease out their tech to other companies Mobileye’s sales will crater.",
