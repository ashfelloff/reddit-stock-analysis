To cover the whole of the contiguous US you would need coverage over probably >90% of the world's population fwiw, so that's a pretty wide area.\n\nEdit: to make this a little more number based, a rough calculation shows that the contiguous US makes up about 4% of Earth's surface area at latitudes at or below it. Satellites spend more time at higher latitudes, but each satellite probably has <10% chance of being over the US at any one time (cba to calculate it). Plus, satellites will only be capable of providing connection within a range comparatively small compared to the contiguous US.",
