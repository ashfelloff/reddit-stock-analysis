The companies can add a clause saying they only start applications after 3 years of working for them. They pay them below market rate for above market rate pay (they are used to working more than 8 hours). \n\nSource: I’m Indian but I decided I hate money and work in aerospace instead. My parents immigrated to mUrica. \nIndia literally found a hack to be rich as fuck and it’s getting as many people over here to send back billions annually. And they will always work for cheaper than Americans….",
