I think tesla will bring out cheaper version of Model 3. Not sure what and how much. Could be a car with say 150 miles range(30kwh battery) and some equipment cut to get it to say 30K and say that is the low cost model. If its M3 based then it has to be out of Fremont as Austin does not produce MY. I am not sure if they can get cheaper MY at 30K price point. Something smaller has to be a new model.",
