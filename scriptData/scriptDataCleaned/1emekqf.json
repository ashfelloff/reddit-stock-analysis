  "selftext": "https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/07/business/boeing-ntsb-hearing-alaska-airlines-door-plug/index.html\n\nAfter 7 months of investigations Boeing has declared they are unable to find the suspect who deliberately removed the parts that led to an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 door plug to blow out. The 737 was delivered without four bolts needed to keep a door plug in place. The necessary paperwork for that temporary door plug removal was apparently never created. So when workers replaced the door plug temporarily, other workers were unaware that bolts needed to be reinstalled, said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes. \n",

Make Boeing pay the FAA the cost for hiring and maintaining that FAA inspection workforce so that taxpayers don’t have to shoulder the burden. \n\nBoeing has proven over and over and over and over and over and over and over again that safety just isn’t in their top ten priorities.

The amount of times I've been presented with incomplete paperwork and am told \"just BS it\" is also way too high. A lot of management at other companies just don't care because the necessary papertrail requires a ton of time and slows every aspect of production down.\n\nWe get audited annually but the audits don't do any digging. They ask for a random batch of jobs and as long as everything is filled out they assume it was done properly (meaning the individual process and inspection steps on the travelers are filled out and complete *prior* to that part moving on to the next step.)\n\nPeople are lazy and don't care and since there is no accountability it's becoming common work culture to just BS the papertrail.\n\nFAA parts have such high requirements that if a door fell off a boeing jet 5 years after it was built the FAA should be able to reach out to boeing and know within a day exactly who had hands on that part, for what step, and at exactly what time, from the first ply of material to the last nut and bolt every single aspect of the manufacturing of that part is supposed to be recording. The FAA expects to be able to point a very accurate finger at the exact person responsible for that step anytime something goes wrong. For example if I forgot to install a bolt the papertrail would say that and myself and the QA inspector responsible could potentially be sued by the FAA or criminally charged for not adhering to their policies. The fact they can't provide this is insane to me. We've had failures that the FAA has reached out to us about and within a few minutes of pulling the paper work we are able to tell them every single piece of information they want. It's an obnoxious amount of paperwork and a real hassle but when it comes to commercial aircraft it's pretty fucking necessary. The FAA needs to know which exact person in the company was responsible for the failure so they can hold that person and the company responsible.",

So when workers replaced the door plug temporarily, other workers were unaware that bolts needed to be reinstalled, said Elizabeth Lund, senior vice president of quality for Boeing Commercial Airplanes.\n\nIt sounds simple enough. We need to fix these rivets, door plug is in the way, remove it and do the work. Why in the hell they decided to 'not my job' putting it back right is bonkers to me. I get torque specs, etc, but they should have just left it out no? I mean, it's not their job to install it right, but they totally can remove it since the door plug team was completely unaware and did not do it for them.

The actual MOD/MRB engineers that do the analysis are understaffed but typically have to be on call whenever a plane is grounded. The Damage tolerance team is on call basically 24/7 with rotating shifts and regularly gets woken up to handle shit. There is not enough organization in documentation and SOP to do the repair according to a manual. Especially when every airline has their own manual that they want you to download from airbus world but the manual is just a scanned pdf with no ctrl+f capabilities whatsoever.\n\nEveryone is just out for themselves, trying to do the least amount of work as possible, while goofing off, and just caring about blowing their next pitiful paycheck on some fds or something. This creates a culture of keeping your head down and not caring about documentation, and definitely not trying to improve something when there is a deficiency in accountability. So there likely never was any paperwork made, the person that did the install likely doesn't work there anymore due to turnover, and the manager probably was never even aware that this person existed.",
