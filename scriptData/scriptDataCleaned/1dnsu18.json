It is a business, it should act like a business, not a charity or non-profit organization.\n\nOn your point about Waymo, that is also hot overhyped garbage. \nAccording to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2024/06/17/a-robotaxi-business-is-a-dream-for-elon-muskbut-already-a-reality-for-waymo/) “After 15 years of R&D, more than $8 billion of investment and multiple pilot programs, Waymo’s robotaxis have become a business, booking more than 50,000 rides a week in the three cities. Assuming an average fare of $20 per ride, annual revenue should top $50 million this year. It was less than $1 million in 2022, according to a Pitchbook estimate”.\n\nAfter $8 BILLION IN R&D?!? They are still not making any profit?!?\nWaymo will be ended by regulation in its states and after it hits and kills people like all of the other self driving cars. (Uber, Apple, and countless other huge companies have died on this hill.\n\nAnd on your point on generative AI, every single generative AI model hallucinates and they are all wildly unprofitable. Microsoft is taking a huge loss on ChatGPT, it actively loses money and has and will never be profitable. The same goes for ChatGPT-lite (AKA Google’s Gemini). Google has consistently lost billions of dollars on R&D and GIVEN UP on the products they used the R&D for look at (look at [killedbygoogle.com](https://killedbygoogle.com)\nThey have abandoned Stadia, Google Hangouts, Google Cardboard, Google Glass, their VPN, and countless others just to name a few. \n\nNo, it is not a matter of “when” movies and TV shows will use Google’s generative AI. And even if it is a “when” instead of an “if” they use it, Google will be wildly unprofitable like they are with any of their other “passion projects”. Being unprofitable is STILL better than giving it out TO COMPETITORS FOR FREE (like Google DeepMind does so often).\n\n\nYes, Google should fire Sundar Pichai. He is a terrible CEO with almost no vision or passion in what he does. They need to have Eric Schmidt or Larry Page back if they actually want some more growth instead of inevitably waiting to be broken up by the government whilst wasting billions on non-profit R&D. \n\n“How does Google make so much money?” They are a crappy ad company. They use their monopoly power (that will soon rightfully be broken up by the government) to advertise. Google is used by most people in the world (they only have EVERYTHING to lose).",

I'm not sure if we're going to see 80 plus percent down on the NASDAQ like we did in 2001 and 2002 but we definitely could see 50 and what would cause it would be a massive global deceleration in tech.
