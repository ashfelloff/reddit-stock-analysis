Just like seeing things be made and learning how they function. We explained it to him and he was fascinated. Made sure he knew Nvidia was the best.\n\nFast forward to just shortly after his passing, I come to learn he has had shares of Nvidia since six months after that incident in 2010. His advisor thought they would grow between the data and other factors. I inherited about 4000 shares of Nvidia among some other things such as Tesla and Amazon.\n\nI'm all in, regards.
