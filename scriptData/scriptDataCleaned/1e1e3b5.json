At UBS, a Neutral/Hold/Market Perform rated stock would probably require a price target +/- 10% from where the stock currently trades.\n\nSo in this case for example, Joseph had a Neutral rating and a $147 Price Target on a stock valued at $240\n\nThis means his price target was about 40% below where the stock was trading. At UBS, this automatically means the stock is a Sell, not a Neutral.\n\nSo what happens is the bank forces the Analyst to either:\n\n1. increase his Price target so it reflects the appropriate price band, so if he wants to stay Neutral, the price target would need be something like $220 to $260 per share (+/- 10% from current trading range)\n\nor\n\n2. downgrade the stock to Sell, and make sure his price target is aligned with that rating.\n\n**Anyway, I am not trying to say Joseph's argument is invalid. I'm just trying to give behind-the-scenes context about why professional investors will perceive this as a bullshit call, and are likely to ignore it.**\n\nThis is a prime example of an Analyst who missed a huge stock run, and was forced to adjust his price target while also lowering his rating as a consequence.\n\nYes there can be a valuation argument here as this stock is trading at crazy levels, so I'm not trying to completely discount his analysis or valuation framework.\n\nSource: I recall my EA downgrade being laughed at by the anchors on CNBC for this very reason",

If the data without sex and weight is not enough for your study, then start over with a new AI model and new data. Old data is insufficient and worthless.
