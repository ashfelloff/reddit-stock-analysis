      "body": "I am going to go out on a limb and say there will be two rate cuts this year. Here is why…\n\nCPI - if we walk through the cpi line by line we see that the essentials are basically now back on track. There are various components which are not but they largely fall into the category of “nice to have” and not my life depends on this component. So if someone were in a pinch they could likely skip these “luxuries” and still be ok. \n\nA few things are dragging things higher. First energy, specifically electricity has gotten more expensive. This is an essential and rate hikes don’t make this better, they make it worse.\n\nFood out - still really expensive and getting more expensive. Specially small meals out are way out of line. Can confirm this with an insane bill at the airport for a sandwich and a salad and some chips. They have you hostage though and know it. However, I didn’t have to buy this… and next time I will plan differently. \n\nShelter is of course more expensive- why? Rates are up so it costs more to carry homes, rents go up b/c land owners need to pay the bank. This is not fixed by higher rates.\n\nThere are some other odd ball items but overall the “important” items are under control. \n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.t02.htm\n\nStrolling over to the American income statement we see that there has been a pretty strong compression in disposable income in the last 12 months with non mortgage interest payments rising significantly (21%) which has limited the average disposable income. This is eventually going to cause problems in consumer spending and may end with a recession. It doesn’t have to though because a rate cut would have a meaningful impact on this item.\n\nhttps://apps.bea.gov/iTable/?reqid=19&step=2&isuri=1&categories=survey#eyJhcHBpZCI6MTksInN0ZXBzIjpbMSwyLDNdLCJkYXRhIjpbWyJjYXRlZ29yaWVzIiwiU3VydmV5Il0sWyJOSVBBX1RhYmxlX0xpc3QiLCI1OCJdXX0=\n\nOn to the balance sheet - there is still about 5 trillion dollars of individuals money sitting in banks to be spent that was not there before covid. There was a huge saving event at the onset of covid and balances have continued to rise. About 1 trillion has been spent but there is still a ton of cash out there. According to the fed about 70% of the M1 demand deposits belong to individuals in 2022. More money has shifted into cds and money market funds and some has been spent. Overall there is still a lot of cash lying around. I am not really sure higher rates fix this either because it will also generate income for the deposit holders.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WM2NS\n\nLooking carefully signs of trouble are present … charge offs and delinquency rates on credit cards has been on the rise and right now are approaching the historic average after being quite low. The current slope though shows no meaningful signs of slowing down so my guess is that people in trouble are turning to cards to finance things but the rates are so high that we have debt payments now showing up on the personal income statement. Most other loans seem to be ok.\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRCCLACBS\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORCCACBS\n\nMy guess is that there is a spilt - the people who have savings and those who do not or don’t have enough. The people who do not are starting to have trouble and the people who do are still paying for discretionary items. \n\nThis situation will disproportionately affect those people in a pinch - they will be less likely to repay their debts. They eventually will be unable to purchase discretionary goods and services. Over the next few years this will also make them less socioeconomically mobile especially if these events make them a credit risk.\n\nIt is possible that no one really cares about them but my point is that raising rates does not fix the current sources of inflation - the people who have cash are going to continue to spend and it will take a bunch of them losing their income to meaningfully reduce their savings. This is not a good out come for the economy as a whole. \n\nThe answer then is to begin to slowly reduce rates so that the income statement shows a bit more free cash flow. The people who are piling on debt can then pay it off and the economy continues upward.",
