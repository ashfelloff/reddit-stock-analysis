Sold it on Wednesday @1.83 made 90% gains and the damn call exploded to a high of 6.80 the next day\n\nNow I am all in on NVDA July 5th Call with a strike of 128. Hope this explodes like Amazon.\n\nNot selling till I see a minimum of 250% gain! I am expecting Nvidia to rally to 135 next week.\n\n\n",
