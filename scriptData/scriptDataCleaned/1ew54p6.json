It doesn‚Äôt mean much until they get the aircraft type certified and the FAA creates a more comprehensive implementation plan for advanced air mobility. \n\nGood news is they already have an I28 document published showcasing what implementation should look like by 2028. They‚Äôve already stated that no designated air taxi routes will be in place by then. All air taxis will have to fly VFR, just like most personal aircraft do currently. And that‚Äôs with a pilot on board. Autonomous commercial flight for air taxi will be at least a decade from now. \n\nSo the path forward for Archer and all the other EVTOL companies is there. But it will be a slow development and the stock price will probably mimic that until we actually see people paying for flights. In other words.. it‚Äôs on sale",
