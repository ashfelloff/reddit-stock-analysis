And even if it ends up being a huge waste of money (I've seen literally tens of millions spent in Palantir products for something that was absolutely useless and nobody needed, but you could always sell the idea, that all the useless data you gathering would give you some insights on business or security). \n\nAnd if your managerial head is cut off because of the many money you convinced your Acme Corp to spend, don't worry. Get us the multi multi million contract in your company and we can guarantee you a cushy job at PLTR in the future if things go south for you at Acme Corp!\n\nThat's how these companies work. But you know jackshit and talk as if they had some magic data and intelligence tools that others don't. It's not like that. And I despise every second I had to work with their tools like Foundry.",
