She does a decent amount of trades. Some of them in hindsight were not smart choices.\n\nWe don't even know why she sold the stock or how much she has left. That could have been 5% of her position and she still has 95% of it. Maybe she needed cash for something and for whatever reason decided to sell visa. Maybe visa did really good recently and she sold a small bit to rebalance her portfolio\n\nShe has sold shares of visa like 10 times in the past several years. Nothing crazy like lawsuits happened in the other 9 sales. Visa has done amazing the whole time shes been selling.
