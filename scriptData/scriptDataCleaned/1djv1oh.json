The Jan 21, 25 puts are selling at $5 for the $100 strike.  If NVDA, and the tech market, crack the next 6 months, NVDA will definitely drop below $100 which is $1000 pre-split.  I imagine it could even fall back to where the rally started around $350 (now $35).  So there is a lot of upside if the market breaks.
