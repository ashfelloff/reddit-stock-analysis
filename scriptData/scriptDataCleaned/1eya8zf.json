Savor it, breathe deep and for a moment pretend it was your own self who fucked up your life so hard like this. Imagine it was you, and this was your reality, really feel it. \n\n...\n\nNow, wake up, come back to your life. You feel that? Feel how good you feel knowing that massive fuckup is not yours to own? It's like having a dream where you're being subjected to non-consensual aggressive butt stuff by a male relative - and then you wake up in your cozy bed, unviolated and totally fine. Still got sphincter grip like a vice, and all is well in the world. That is true relief, pure joy and bliss knowing you are still OK, still doing relatively well in life compared to this poor soul. \n\nYou just did 8 weeks of intense therapy in like 5 min. \n\nOP is a saint for allowing us to heal.",
