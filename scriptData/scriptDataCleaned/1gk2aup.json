And giving the mega rich a massive pass on income taxes. This is only possible because Trumps supporters are so loyal - and the self serving rich see this and are taking advantage of it. Both sides are not the same.

He is someone who would never get top secret access because of his conflicts of interest, but here he is about to potentially be reelected, more in debt, facing actual criminal charges - stakes could never be higher for him, and he will sell influence at any cost to whoever can move the needle on his election. He is a Trojan horse for the executive branch of the US, and whoever can offer him the most personal enrichment will be who runs said branch.

It completely fucks up the non-partisan nature of our federal officials. Not to mention loyalists are typically not the best for the job, the best folks for the job are… the best at the job.

Also just “income tax collected” is such a poor measurement of wealth inequality. How about total tax burden compared to total assets? Billionaires pay multi million dollar tax bills but it’s less of a burden than the .1% paid in the 60s. Also capital gains are where literally all the separation is created. With logic like this why bother with words like pejorative and deingrate? Learn the basic stuff first.",
