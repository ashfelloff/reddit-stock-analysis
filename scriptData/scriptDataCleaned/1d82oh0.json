Below it is the price of the currency he bought/sold or vice versa, the first number being entry, second after the arrow being exit. It tells you if it's long or short because it says BUY or SELL next to the lot size. The right side shows the profit or loss in blue and red. The amounts are in dollars. I don't feel like explaining a lot size too detailed, probably easier to Google that one. But basically a lot is worth an X amount of dollars depending on the currency pair, and when you trade currency, you usually calculate how many lots of that currency equals 1% of your portfolio. This is a standard amount to risk on each trade.\n\nExample numbers:\n\nSo if one currency pair costs $2000 per 1 lot, and you have $100,000 in your portfolio, you would want to buy 0.5 lots at a cost of $1000 to only risk 1% of your portfolio on that trade.",

By the looks of that data in the screenshot, OP is gambling over and over again. The last two trades on the top looked like it went in the right direction, and sold off on the first pullback out of fear of losing money again.\n\nForex trades at a leverage of x100, there is plenty of money to make if you know what you're actually doing. OP didn't use any risk management and never calculated the stop losses. This is how you trade at a casino.\n\nA real Forex trader only risks 1% of the portfolio on a trade YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN based on analysis and deep understanding of a single currency pair. You calculate the lot size of the currency pair to equal 1% of your portfolio, and you set the stop loss exactly at that point. So if your analysis betrays you, you will only lose 1% of your portfolio on that failed trade.\n\nOP is not showing the size of the account, but I'm willing to bet that a $500 loss is not only 1% of OPs account. Given the fact that there are losses much smaller than that previously, the size of the account would be smaller, and 1% would result in a smaller total loss per trade. Instead they increased, which means there was zero risk management here. Also probably zero analysis. A seasoned Forex trader doesn't have consecutive losses with random amounts like that.",
