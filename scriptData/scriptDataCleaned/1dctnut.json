When it comes to WSB, I think my positions might be considered conservative (I tend to buy ITM to have easier breakeven points) with the exception of the current meme put I opened this morning. I also just opened up the AAPL leap because I don‚Äôt expect they will continue to stagnate as they have and are due to start reaping some of the rewards of this AI rally as they start to incorporate gen AI into their products. Interested in hearing people‚Äôs thoughts.",
