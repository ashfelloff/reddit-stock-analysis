  "selftext": "SPY closed +0.42% and fell slightly after hours by -0.05%. Trading volume was up by 10.6% when compared to the average. \n\nScared money has left the market. Anyone in the market now is bracing for earnings reports and election results, these are risk seeking individuals/institutions. These are the type to double down when a position goes south, rather than cut losses. Otherwise, they would've sold already.\n\nThe market will continue to bounce around and ultimately, dips will be bought. Once election results are final and there is no more uncertainty, lots of cash from the sidelines will flow back into the stock market, causing a rally.",

It drops to like $40 a barrel  by mid next year, but I can't remember the exact high volatility weeks, so it's hard to option play, and it's hard to enter a high leverage short, again, because there will be some weekly upswings which will close it out unless you could remember the exact ideal entry dates . Defense in general does well briefly, but trump actually manages to bring some peace at the start of his term, so defense goes sideways in the end. Crypto does okay, theres some good meme plays, but bitcoin, already at 1 trillion, can no longer do the 10-20x it used to. The stock market is the sensible play, though, more than doubling over the next 3 years. Nvidia goes at least 5x from here, and I think even higher. But it's pretty volatile along the way. Best bet is probably a 5x sp500 play. You'll make about 15x your money over the next 3 years. I don't remember DJT, I know it did well, but I never payed attention to it, so have no clue exactly where it goes. I don't think it does anything crazy like 100x from here or anything.",
