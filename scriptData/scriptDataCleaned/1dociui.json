Elon Musk purchases the company and steps in as new CEO, stock price falls to $68 and Elon Musk held in confinement after NVDA chip quality mysteriously begins to degrade as multiple user's machines catch fire and explode when NVDA chips installed. AI neural networks under increased scrutiny as AI art image models begin only showing Joe Rogan videos and what appears to be Elon Musk defeating Mark Zuckerberg in ringside combat. Musk claims total innocence as hospitals using NVDA components complain biomedical equipment begins displaying ads instead of medical information, leading to thousands of deaths.
