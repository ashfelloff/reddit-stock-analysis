I've had a couple really big swings this year I had an 18 fold return and I sold early if that sounds terrible it went up significantly more and an option that I bought for a leverage ETF nail. And I got smacked really hard on the way down back from July 5th to August 11th in soxl. I had huge profits enormous amounts of profits and every day I was getting chipped away the crazy thing is that I see where I made the mistake and I don't mean I should have taken profits or I should have put a stop loss in will you listen to all these bobbleheads of what I call him on TV and they tell you that the Thursday before the Black Monday in August was when you had the Japanese trade unwinding and that's absolutely not true because when you look at the Japanese yen versus the dollar it all started July 5th. So that's part of investing is in addition to your core positions you have to learn when is enough and when to take profits and that's the most difficult thing always has been for me and I'm still learning despite all these years later\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nk8b4r2ad3rd1.png?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f9fb712dbe6494f620684f6211119151e8854b73",

Buy your mom/dad/brother/sister nice smalls gift too. Spread (some of) the wealth but don't tell anybody you made that much. I've lost a few friends who couldn't stop begging me for 'loans' when I told them how much I made this year.

I had a very low cost basis of about 31 and a half dollars on 30,000 shares.. I had a Target exit price of 60 I got it I didn't sell because I'm an idiot and then it retrace and then it pushed higher and I'm thinking I'm a genius because I held it and then I said I'm going to sell it 65 and I did not and it fell and yet it bounced and went over $70 and I'm looking at all of the charts I have and I'm like you know what I think in 6 months it will be over $100. And then July 5th was the first day when you look at the dollar yen that the trades started unwind it wasn't on the Thursday before the Black Monday in August like these bobbleheads on TV talk about. And sadly I only looked at my mistake after the fact it's always easier in the rearview mirror to identify what you did wrong then in real time. So tech stocks got butchered I don't need to tell you you can look and see what Nvidia did and micron and you go down the list AMD they all got hammered and I kept waiting for the bounce that never happened I kept waiting for by the dip mentality but it didn't happen because the selling coming from Japan as a result of their margin calls was so great that it offset every bit of buying effort of retail in the United States. So while this trade looks great and I'm happy I got kicked in the balls hard and I lost a lot of my profits for the year in soxl. I lost a lot of my profits in Nvidia. I had 2000 shares pre-split that I watch go all the way up like everybody else that turned into 20,000 shares. And then Nvidia got cracked on the way down I did sell half of my Nvidia and I bought AMD leveraged ETF a mdl between 9.0 and 10 and 1/2 with all of that money. So I make mistakes just like everybody else it's there's a lot of zeros behind my mistakes when things go bad. And today is a good day where AMD is ratcheting up Nvidia is ratcheting up s o x l is going higher.. and micron obviously well we can see where that's going to be opening at shortly",
