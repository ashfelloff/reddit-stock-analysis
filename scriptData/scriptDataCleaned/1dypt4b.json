I just donâ€™t understand are these gainz all tax free???\n\nThere has to be a catch \n\nI donâ€™t have the money or time to seek a real financial advisor, plus there are plenty on here. \n\nThank you ðŸ«¡",

You can read up on this by simply Googling.  Ive had a Roth for years, made a lot of money in it, have not withdrawn a thing, never paid taxes on a trade cause it all still in the Roth..",
