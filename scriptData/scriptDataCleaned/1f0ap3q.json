The Sounion is Greek Flagged, and is owned by [\\~Delta Tankers\\~](https://www.deltatankers.gr/).\n\nThe crew was rescued before the tanker was blown up, they were 23 Filipino, 2 Russians, and 4 security personnel (nationality not stated).\n\nThe M/V Sounion did not request an escort when sailing past Yemen, despite the fact that two other tankers also owned by Delta Tankers were attacked by the Houthis on Aug 7-8; the [\\~Delta Atlantica\\~](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:214176/mmsi:636018765/imo:9419101/vessel:DELTA_ATLANTICA) (161,762 t dwt) and the [\\~Delta Blue\\~](https://www.marinetraffic.com/en/ais/details/ships/shipid:713774/mmsi:636021700/imo:9601235/vessel:DELTA_BLUE)(158322 t dwt), both Liberia flagged.\n\n*So why did these ships not request an escort?*\n\nDelta Tankers allegedly operates part of the [\\~Russian \"Dark Fleet\"\\~](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/issue-brief/russias-growing-dark-fleet-risks-for-the-global-maritime-order/), a [\\~fleet of \\~1,300 tankers\\~](https://windward.ai/knowledge-base/illuminating-russias-shadow-fleet/) owned by dozens of unscrupulous oil shipping companies carrying illicit sanctions busting Russian crude oil around the World.\n\nIn 2022, [\\~Ukraine added Delta Tankers\\~](https://nazk.gov.ua/en/news/the-status-of-five-greek-shipping-companies-was-restored-in-the-list-of-war-sponsors/#:~:text=Therefore%2C%20the%20NACP%20restored%20their,Minerva%20Marine%3B%20TMC%20Tankers%20LTD) to its \"International Sponsors of War list\" for carrying Russian oil (\\] though they were removed from the list in Aug 2023 after they appeared to prove compliance; however given their recent odd behaviour, i.e. not requesting escort, switching off their AIS (this is why they are called the \"dark fleet\"), travelling to the Red Sea rather than their advertised destination, I suspect they were up to something).\n\nThe same company was previously involved in smuggling Iranian Oil to Venezuela, despite U.S. sanctions (this is from 2020):\n\nDelta Tankers is smuggling Iranian Oil despite U.S. sanctions: [\\~https://www.ifmat.org/08/07/delta-tankers/\\~](https://www.ifmat.org/08/07/delta-tankers/)\n\nSince 2020, Delta Tankers and others shifted to carrying Russian oil.

Russia supplying them with arms doesn't suddenly enable them to actually direct them, and even if there was some direct communication with Houthi leadership, the lack of strong, centralized authority and a proper chain of command makes it very easy for local clusters to attack targets thay they \"shouldn't\" without necessarily realizing that the higher ups would have told them to hold off.",
