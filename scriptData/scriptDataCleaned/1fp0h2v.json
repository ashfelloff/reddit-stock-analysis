  "selftext": "Let me try to explain the situation to you regards as simply as possible:\n\nGerman arms manufacturer Rheinmetall lost 7% last week after a Bloomberg article about possible peace talks amidst Western allies. (btw Putin has already stated that Russia will not take part in these negotiations)\n\nThe market is waiting for a sign as to whether the West will continue to provide money for future arms deliveries. Zelenskyy is presenting his “Victory Plan” to the UN today and will talk to Biden tomorrow. So we are going to get a new point of reference in the next few days.\n\nSo far Ukraine's allies have taken the position of supplying the country with enough weapons to prevent a defeat. However, they are not supplying enough for a victory either. (basic american strategy: defeat the conventional russian armed forces with as few (american) losses as possible. also don't escalate into WW3 lol)\n\nThe worry now is that the West will give up and force Ukraine into a ceasefire...\n\nThat's *not gonna happen.* America wants to slowly bleed Russia dry and has successfully implemented this strategy over the last two years. Nothing will change, because letting Russia win would only lead to bigger problems and show countries like China that you can get away with pretty much anything in the long run. Besides, Russia is facing more and more economic and personnel problems. So an end to the war in which Russia “loses” is also in sight.\n\nI'm sure that Zelenskyy will get new concessions on arms deliveries and aid packages in the coming days and worried investors will be reassured.\n\nRheinmetall is set for the next few years even without further orders for Ukraine. And the upcoming war between Israel and Hezbollah is not yet priced in either. Germany is a close ally of Israel and may also supply weapons.\n\nBesides bears love RHM at the moment:\n\nPE 32  FwD PE 20  Earnings Growth 28%  Sales Growth 20%  Price Target +27% 610€\n\n\n\nPersonal position: 23k 458 Call, 3k 471 Call",

But from an US perspective, I can understand it, because the prices some medications were and are going for is mental. And the public image of pharma is also quite bad considering how much humanity profits from the development of new medication. So I guess I can sort of understand it, but I wouldn't lump them with Tobacco companies or Weapon manufacturers, whose products literally don't provide any benefit to humanity and only bring about harm.",
