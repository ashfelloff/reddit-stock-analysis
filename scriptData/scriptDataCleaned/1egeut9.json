From \n- ordering a burger at a drive through \n- doing data transformations\n- simple proofreading and verification  of contracts or other documents. Controlling etc. \n- low level law jobs that sieve through tons of docs \n- call centers. \n\nMost of these things will ACTUALLY go away in the next decades. These models are powerful enough for these. While the metaverse well it is a nice to have and needs much better tech and much better software to really take over a huge amount of our time. But to be fair the internet had the same trajectory. From idiotic hype to crash to the foundation of our economy.",

If money gets tighter as we see in the results of McDonald's and Starbucks the first two things to go are:\n\n- investment in infrastructure like fancy new ai services that may or may not bring results \n- ads\n\nMuch harder to cut back employees or buildings or factories. So I am curious. Still plenty of money sloshing around and plenty of AI hype but well a little recession would fix that and we seem to be getting there slowly. Growth is going lower borrowing seems closer to maxxed out with defaults rising above prepandemic levels finally unemployment inches up on a low level. No apocalypse yet but still...",
