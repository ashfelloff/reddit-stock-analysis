          "body": "IBKR, the adaptive order type basically means 8.5 or better but instead of something like a ‚Äúlimit/market if touched‚Äù order you leave it up to IBKRs algos, tbh its usually not that much better. To get my sale at 9.85 I canceled that adaptive order and waited until EXPO started running. The only time I find it helpful is when I‚Äôm in a rush and the bid/ask is moderately wide (eg pre earnings options). For very illiquid options where the bid might not even exist it usually gets confused and gives you a bad fill, for those I‚Äôd recommend setting the bid manually until you are filled. \n\nThose lines are just bbands and moving averages, one trick I learned is if your chart doesn‚Äôt show you quote midpoints and only trades (it will give you a choppy chart like most options) you can set a MA line with period 1 to follow the quote midpoint instead, then you can see where the option price moves. Maybe that‚Äôs only an IBKR issue tho",
