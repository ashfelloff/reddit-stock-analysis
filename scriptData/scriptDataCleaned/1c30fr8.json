For the MAG7 just wait for any of them to be up/down more than 2%, buy the inverse of it maybe a week+ out with close to ATM strikes then profit. For SPY wait for the $3-4 drop/rise and inverse it 2-3 DTE out. I’ve targeted 20% on these and made more than that in < 30 minutes and also seen it drop another 40% before it opens the next morning up my 20%. Rinse and repeat. \n\nThe market the last few months is not in an indication of the future, but the trend has been this: there are never 3 consecutive days green or red, there are sharp reversals both directions, and when 5 out of the 7 is going one direction, you play that direction on one of the other 2 and it follows.
