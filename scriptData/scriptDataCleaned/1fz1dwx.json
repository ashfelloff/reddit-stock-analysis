  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "After a brutal 3 years and an even more brutal summer of allegations against Dr. Wang (ex-scientist collaborator for SAVA), we have finally completed dosing for the first phase 3 trial.   Another couple of months and we should have the answer to this multi-year mystery of Alzheimer‚Äôs.  This is the last chance to invest in this promising drug before the potential rise despite the mainstream allegations against this company. Strap yourselves in, this is a long one. Jump to conclusion and tldr if you‚Äôre impatient.\n\n**Allegations**\n\nOn June 28, the DoJ announced charges made against Dr. Wang  for scientific misconduct and fraud that gained him NIH funding. Here‚Äôs why I believe Dr. Wang will be found innocent. Back in 2021 a citizens petition was filed by ‚Äúwhistleblowers‚Äù to the FDA led by Dr. Bredt, a neurologist who had history with Dr. Wang back when Wang did work for Johnson & Johnson. Turns out they were not whistleblowers at all and were actually short sellers, and in the case of Dr. Bredt, a competitor.  Dr. Bredt, with support from Johnson & Johnson, founded RAPP Therapeutics that is developing small molecule drugs that follow the same mechanism as Cassava‚Äôs drug simufilam.  Ironic right? And he filed an IPO the same day the FDA rejected the citizens petition. What a coincidence right? Thru this citizens petition, Journal of Neuroscience posted an expression of concern for scientific misconduct and fabrication of Dr. Wang‚Äôs research data. Following this expression of concern, Dr. Wang submitted all the original data and blots to JoN in which they concluded there was no evidence of manipulation.  However, thanks to some motivated PhDs on Twitter, who lack any impactful research papers of their own, continued harassing the editors in which JoN issues an expression of concern and will defer to CUNY (that is a whole another fiasco with massive conflict of interests).  Recently the SEC announced settlements made with Casaava, its ex-senior executives, and Dr. Wang.  In Dr. Wang‚Äôs settlement, the SEC provides data which Dr. Wang could have unblinded himself in a reanalysis of a small 28 day study measuring biomarker changes in patients who received simufilam vs placebo. Now the only problem with their allegation that they settled for, the data they provided MATCHES a concurrent plasma biomarker analysis from a third party, independent and industry known company, Quanterix. I should just stop my post here but I will continue. After 3 years of senseless investigations by the DoJ and SEC, this is the best they can come up with. Hey this minor 28 day study of biomakers reanalysis could have been made up EVEN though quanterix data matches it. On top of all this, the biomakers in question were of a 28 day study. When they began their phase 2 cog study, they performed csf biomarker analysis after 6 months which showed 98% had a positive effect. There was never any question on this more significant biomarker analysis. There was never any question of the quanterix data.  It is without a doubt if there was even a hint of manipulation there it would been used to crucify Cassava. \n\nWhy I think with all these allegations Cassava still has a high probability of success? Because I look at it as pieces of a puzzle.  There are many pieces involved in this mystery. Firstly and most importantly, there is the 24 month open label Adas-cog study that shows patients especially mild  have NO cognitive decline.  This has NEVER been heard of.  Additionally there are multiple independent sources of research that supports simufilam and the importance of Filamin A (the protein simufilam targets) in neuropathology including prestigious Yale. Yale even patented simufilam use for epilepsy. Included in the supporting research is the TR-Fret study that uses the most sophisticated assay (far superior than WBs) to prove simufilams MoA. Additionally there are the biomarkers from quanterix, the more important 6 month biomakers NEVER questioned, insiders suspiciously increasing positions earlier in the year, and the almost 90% of  patients choosing to continue in the open label extension of the Ph3 to stay on the drug and demanding to extend even the open label extension for early patients. I will post links to the research below.\n\n**The Stock**\n\nThe float of this stock is almost 50% shorted and many big suits are involved imo. Can you see why they are trying to destroy the company. If this drug proves itself, this stock will be worth at the very least $50 Billlion in market cap and that‚Äôs without factoring in short interest.  Why they will not be successful in bringing this company down? Because there is a strong investor base made of doctors, PhDs, pharmacists, and engineers who have done multiple years of DD and will not be shaken.  As long as the data continues to impress, people will not be selling.\n\n**Conclusion & Approach**\n\nSomeone said to me that if Dr. Wang lied about the biomakers then all of it is lie, which is absolutely true, and also can be said about the shorts.  So my approach to come to my conclusion is looking at all the independent pieces to this puzzle. The puzzle pieces all fit perfectly with Dr. Wangs preclincal research and biomarker analysis being correct. They do not fit with Dr. Wang committing fraud. To date Dr Wang has NOT been found guilty of fraud, only allegations.  Could ALL the independent institutions be lying about simufilam and Filamin A?  I think the DoJ will eventually drop the case or maybe slap on the wrist for record keeping issues.  Now let‚Äôs look at the shorts, the very first statement was a lie. They lied about being whistleblowers and they lied about being short sellers. Dr. Bredt lied about never hearing of Cassava when he had history with Dr. Wang, and he lied that he thought the science was nonsense.  Why do we know that‚Äôs a lie, because he literally started a company that is pursuing the same kind of small molecule targeting receptor associated proteins such as Filamin A.\n\nSo ask yourself, do you believe the shorts, the doj, the sec who we know for a fact are not retails friend? Just look at the madness in 2021. Or just maybe there is more to this story than what‚Äôs being reported by our wonderful mainstream media.  Just look at the state of this country and the influence of media. I really don‚Äôt care for anyone to invest but more to put the story out there. At this point it‚Äôs either the moon or the grave (not literally).\n\n**TLDR:** Phase 3 is done will answer ALL questions with no doubt left, Too much independent research on simufilam and Filamin A (too many pieces of the puzzle fit perfectly together with Wang being innocent), SEC twists data to make it look bad now out the way after settlement. Ph3 data comes out by year end and stock will rocket if our thesis is correct by over 20X. Almost 50% of the float short is just a cherry on top. In other words SAVA to $500 if data good and $1,000 or more if amazing. If fail then no doubt 0 but I am highly convinced of success.\n\n**New Positions:** 6,000 shares with avg cost $24(Don‚Äôt try it shorts I‚Äôll just add more) 10 $15 call leaps. First invested in 2021\n\nNot financial or medical advice, do your own DD\n\n**Links** of additional research on simufilam and Filamin A and there is much more than this. Do note some of the papers ‚Äî not all ‚Äî has wang as a author, but he **did not perform the experiments**,  it‚Äôs just his research being investigated by other scientists.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10531384/\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32075941/\n\nhttps://eo.bioscientifica.com/configurable/content/journals$002feo$002f2$002f1$002fEO-22-0055.xml?t:ac=journals%24002feo%24002f2%24002f1%24002fEO-22-0055.xml\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10339288/\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33197/ **Parkinson‚Äôs potential**\n\n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39164108/ **Autism potential**\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9132466/\n\n\n\n",

Remi Barbier, the founder and former CEO, resigned in July 2024 amid ongoing scrutiny from the SEC over misleading statements regarding clinical trial results for their Alzheimer's treatment, simufilam. Barbier, along with former Senior VP of Neuroscience Dr. Lindsay Burns, agreed to pay over $40 million to settle these charges‚Äã(\n\n[SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/files/litigation/complaints/2024/comp-pr2024-151.pdf))‚Äã([Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sec-announces-40-mln-settlement-cassava-sciences-over-misleading-alzheimers-trial)).\n\n\n\nAdditionally, Dr. Hoau-Yan Wang, a consultant for Cassava and a key figure in the development of simufilam, was also charged by the SEC for manipulating clinical trial data‚Äã(\n\n[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/sec-announces-40-mln-settlement-cassava-sciences-over-misleading-alzheimers-trial))‚Äã([Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/cassava-sciences-announces-changes-executive-leadership-enhanced-corporate-governance)). As part of the management shakeup, Rick Barry has been appointed as the new Executive Chairman while the company searches for a new permanent CEO‚Äã([Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/cassava-sciences-announces-changes-executive-leadership-enhanced-corporate-governance)).\n\n\n\nThe situation has raised concerns about corporate governance and transparency, prompting Cassava to commit to higher standards and more rigorous clinical trial protocols going forward‚Äã(\n\n[Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/cassava-sciences-announces-changes-executive-leadership-enhanced-corporate-governance)).\n\n\n\nFor more detailed information, you can check the full reports from the SEC and news updates on the changes at Cassava Sciences.",

The SEC fine was justified and the SEC forced SAVA to get better management, which I'm honestly happy with.\n\nNone of those mistakes were ultimately material in the data presented and had far more to do with governance and transparency.\n\nThe SEC order on Dr. Wang calls into question one part of the P2b data, but ignores the fact that Dr. Wang's biomarker results were contemporarily replicated by a fully independent 3rd party lab at the same time (Quanterix). Dr. Wang also has plausible explanations refuting the SEC allegations, though ultimately that's not going to be resolved until far in the future with the DOJ trial.\n\nCritically, not a SINGLE ONE of the SEC issues raised affects the P2 OLE data or the multiple and independently confirmed MoA studies, nor does it in any way affect the soon-to-complete P3 trials.",

Also the main lead doctor leading the phase 3 trials, Dr. Kupeic, is more excited than ever. You should hear this doctor speak, his brilliance and clean motivation (not in it for money) is easily observable. They have made settlements with SEC and there is no longer an investigation. The best the sec could come up with was disclosure issues for a small 28day biomarker test after 3 years of investigation. Not to mention dr wangs analysis matches quanterix. The issue was with the disclosure. If you examine further, you‚Äôll notice SAVA was putting out all their impressive phase 2 data and additional research supporting MoA with an ACTIVE SEC INVESTIGATION. In essence the SEC indirectly and inadvertently put their stamp of approval on ALL data following 2021.",
