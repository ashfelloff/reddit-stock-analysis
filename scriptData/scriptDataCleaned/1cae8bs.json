      "body": "I used to think TA was horoscopes, too. I still may even. But recently I have delved into the subjects trying to learn it, see if there is any merit to it, sort the bullshit from the non-bullshut, etc... and it seems to have some merit.\n\nE.g. on Friday I saw a breakout as a possibility after the last low on friday finished higher than the previous swing low of the night. Then almost right before the breakout the swing low again finished higher than the last one. Meanwhile the last three swing highs were each successively lower than the last one. Meaning there was a wedge, indicating either a possible breakout into either direction or continued sideways trading.\n\nSo one could see the breakout to the top as a possibility. Still not a guruantee of course but through technical analysis I saw it as a possibility at all.\n\nApart from people talking a lot of bullshit to sell courses, a lot of people also don't have consistent rules how they draw stuff.\n\nImho, a swing high or low should always be followed by a swing point of the opposite. And a trend line should always be drawn from the previous swing points. You cannot just skip one. Also a trend line should have at least three swing point touches or else its not a trend. And last but not least the swing point doesnt need to directly touch the trend line to be valid as long as its very close, and you should avoid cutting through candle bodies (wicks are sometimes okay though).\n\nSo yeah its kinda just vibes, but it should be consistent vibes.\n\nAlso people think TA means a definitive yes or no on the direction the price will take. But TA is just a tool to help you manage risk and weigh the possibility of the price taking one direction or another.\n\nBut again I am only at the start of it and may do things wrong or come to the conclusion that yes TA is bullshit. But to evaluate that I'll keep charting and observing if the price action roughly followed what I charted.\n\nThis is how I have the SPY futures (I dont trade SPY futures but I use those as the basis for my option plays instead of SPX since the futures are trading 24/5, so you have a more consistent and accurate view of the market) currently charted, as of 15:45 Berlin time or 15 minutes after actual trading started:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0t139h8ri8wc1.jpeg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ea81e109dde39e708df8983da1a32a8394d3d42",
