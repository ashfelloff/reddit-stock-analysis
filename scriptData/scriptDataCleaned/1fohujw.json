      "body": "So here's my suggestion I don't have much regard for the CEO of Intel under his direction shareholders have lost at their peak it was just under 80% of equity since he took over. The decisions that he made some inherited but his forward decisions from when he first took over we're all wrong. Gelsinger has paid himself at this point over 120 million and shareholders well they've taken it in the keister \nSo now you have this report two weeks ago people started talking about the sum of the parts what if they divested what if they sold off some of their acquisitions because gelsinger is under this cost cutting control now. So the rumors start and it's confirmed Qualcomm did speak with them at some point in time very very recently.. and obviously today more news about $5 billion dollars possibly being invested from another group that put it up 11 billion for them to build a foundry in Ireland \n\nOkay so you heard all that this is old had what would you do if you believe that Intel in the next 4 years 5 years because realistically the foundry's under the chips act will not be operational probably late 28 early 29 that's a long time from an investment standpoint there's a lot of opportunity costs that you're missing potentially going into other stocks that have better management.. but let's suppose you're content holding it I would tell you take your initial investment out leave all your profits in the company and then look for another opportunity with your original principal and let gelsinger try to write the ship that he sunk or let it take over happen because a bid assuming 50% stock 50% cash would put it probably around 35 to $36 if was all cash you would probably be 31 if it was all stock it would probably be around 40 to $41.. so that's what I would do if I were you congratulations you made a profit I would take my principal out leave the profits in and play with the house as chips if you believe gelsinger is not going to continuously screw up going forward like he's done since he's taking over cuz there is a definition of insanity in there doing the same thing and expecting a different outcome. \nThat's my two cents I wish you the best of luck",
