Our precision tends to be low on a weekly/monthly basis, higher on quarterly, but we’ve achieved 90%+ accuracy on year long projections. \n\nThere is a massive difference though between forecasting something like sales versus the stock market returns, because forecasts can have an impact on the return itself (self-fulfilling prophecy). \n\nIt’s much better (in my opinion) to create more narrow projections and model outcomes based on other indicators. For instance, what return can we expect from QQQ if Google and Apple both miss earnings.",

The results for the past and the future predictions ARE NOT DONE BY THE SAME MODEL.

I've trained models on historical SP500 data with external social media features, and other index data, and it always looks like this, regardless of whether you're using something from ARIMA to TFT style modern attention models. And when you backtest them, they all look like shit. The stock market is simply too stochastic to model well, and if it wasn't, we'd know.",

Feel like a lot of us aren’t crazy gamblers and just want our money to slowly grow over the years as we grow ourselves and this is telling me my shares in the S&P are going to grow so whether that’s 20% or 7% or whatever over the next 5 year I mean, I’ll take it. Yeah maybe I’m not maximizing my returns this way but I’d really have to commit time learning more about the market in order to do so and I mean I have a full time job that pays pretty well so I’m not willing to take time away from that timo learn how to improve my growth rate. As long as I’m growing I’m happy. If you can show me something that I can put my money into that’s more likely to grow over the next 5 years than the S&P 500 then be my guest, I’m all ears.",
