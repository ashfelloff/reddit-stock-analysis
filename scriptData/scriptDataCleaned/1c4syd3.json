It makes no sense to diversify with low amounts as you're risking next to nothing if you fail, but if your first few positions are very lucky, you're giving yourself a chance to leverage the beginner luck a bit, if it happens to you.

They did so “strategically” in hopes they were going to produce and deliver more vehicles. Then comes inflation and the Fed. They didn’t think they would need the extra capital raised to continue with their plans, otherwise they would have raised that capital and took the stock hit one and done. Instead the dragged it out. \n\nThey didn’t factor in the Fed raising interest rates 500 basis points. Nobody did but others did position themselves just in case something more drastic had to be done by the Fed coming out of 2021. \n\nI want to invest in Rivian. I think it is the next closest in public appeal (in US) to Telsa. Their products are pretty cool and look really nice but they don’t have the same experience operating in different macro environments as Tesla has. \n\nTLDR: Rivian should have raised capital when their stock was lofty (like Telsa in 2021). Now it’s a toss up if they will have to raise additional capital at a depressed share price or can survive to R2.",
