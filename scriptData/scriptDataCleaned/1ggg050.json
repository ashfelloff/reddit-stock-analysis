  "selftext": "Got really lucky in September with Smci puts and tripled my account. My main strategy is to swing trade against large stock movements, expecting a reversal. \n\nGambled the rest away this month, its been a continuous lose streak and I‚Äôm back to $200 left in my account. \n\nMy main positions: \n\nGains\nSMCI Puts (~10k)\nASTS Puts (~3k)\n\nLosses \nTSLA Puts\nHUM Puts\nAPD Puts \n\nLost about 7k in total on tesla puts, kept revenge trading at first since I couldn‚Äôt believe why the stock kept rising and my losses mounted. Did the same for HUM and APD (still have no clue what those companies are about), which I lost about 3-4K on. \n\nI‚Äôm still a student, and got life-changing money by luck and squandered it away. \n\nI‚Äôm still pretty unfazed by the losses still and will ride or die with the remaining money in my account. The gambler‚Äôs high is everything to me, and I‚Äôll playing in the casino for the long haul and will keep adding more money when I build up my savings. Wish me luck",
