  "selftext": "Why is everyone so bullish on NVIDIA? They would need to be the biggest company in the world for their stock to hit these astronomical predictions. 99% of the value is based on hype and bullshit reminiscent of the days when the Cyber Truck was announced. \n\nHow many of these GPUs have they actually delivered? How many gpus do these big tech companies actually need? What makes NVIDIAs GPU immune to being copied by competitiors?\n\n AFAIK their bread and butter is the software/drivers allowing the chip to do it's magic and there are rumors of people working on allowing it to run on other GPUs. It's only a matter of time before a competitor releases something for a fraction of the price. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong but I can see the hype dying down when these Blackwell GPUs actually get delivered and the orders stop, anyone that actually works in a data center can attest they don't upgrade their servers every 6 months, they don't need to buy new hardware every year either.  \n\nIf and when it does go down the entire market will be a blood bath, the magnificent 7 stocks are practically a meme at this point and the only thing holding the S&P together.",

                  "body": "They don’t need to 10x their revenue if they can improve their margins. That’s why everyone will be watching margins and guidance. Those are the two most important factors. Walmart makes a 5B profit on 161B in revenue. JPM makes 13B on 40B in revenue. It’s entirely about the margin. Apple isn’t NVidia, and NVDA isn’t AAPL. I see no reason why Apple’s market cap shouldn’t be smaller than NVidia’s if they not only continue to drive revenue higher but improve margin as well. \n\nNVDA is 29x the average forward earnings, which is in the middle of the 25-34x historical multiple. Every single quarter the company grows into those expectations. That’s why we’re at the place that we’re at. \n\nThey’re going to top revenue expectations, without question. They’re going to offer super positive guidance. Jensen is going to showcase everything they’re working on and it will seem like he’s offering you the year 2050, especially if he says anything about AGI within the end of the decade. All of that will be enough to push $1,000. But, if they have above average expansion on the margin side, that’s what will absolutely explode the price upward tomorrow night. There’s a good reason to be bullish NVDA, and even if the market has priced a lot of this in and we see $850 Thursday morning, as long as they can continue to improve margins and overcome some of the bottleneck issues seen at AMD, ASML, AMAT, etc., then NVDA will take Apple’s place within a year. As a trade, I’ll wait to see what they have done. But I think the assumption that this company shouldn’t have the highest market capitalization just because they don’t equal the revenue of Apple is more than missing the point. If NVDA were running AAPL’s revenue at NVDA’s margins, NVDA would already be twice the market cap of AAPL and it wouldn’t even be close.",

      "body": "NVDA is priced more reasonably than CSCO was at the height of the dot com boom.  Their moat is much larger than Apple’s and the questions you’re asking are really the wrong ones.\n\nNVDA is focused on chip design and building out a whole GPU based platform.  NVDA outsources the manufacturing which is why you see TSM and ASML move in sync mostly.  Competitors using their platform would be amazing as it would solidify their moat as THE platform which would help them collect additional IP royalties potentially and would ensure their platform is the one companies go for (and need enterprise support for).\n\nThe big data centers will need to churn these cards between 18-36 months depending on how heavy loads are maintained and how well they want to maintain the cards.  Right now the big data centers are wiping out direct to enterprise by volume creating a vicious cycle.  A company can’t quickly direct order GPUs and build their own racks so they go to the big public CSPs for on demand capacity, which then leads to the CSPs buying more and keeping it further way from direct enterprise.  There are still times when you’ll run into on demand capacity issues in CSPs given all the compute is in use - it’s kind of wild a cloud provider can actually not have demand.\n\nThe real questions are:\n\nDoes TSM and ASML have any real capacity to support a competitor? (They currently really don’t)\n\nDo the CSPs see any slowing for GPU based resources? (They aren’t)\n\nWhen is the growth cycle predicted to slow and get into a maintenance cycle? (This is really the TBD everyone is trying to suss out)\n\nThere’s going to be a fine line between too much capacity and too little capacity.  Nvidia understands that very well which is why their software layers are extremely important.  They’ve done a good job of staying ahead of problems.\n\nPersonally I don’t like direct exposure to NVDA. It’s weighted heavily in SPY and QQQ so no need to pile any more on top.  It’s not Cyber Truck hype at all though.  Tesla is a car company trying to be a tech company so they need all the noise they can. NVDA is a tech company that does technology.",

      "body": "> What makes NVIDIAs GPU immune to being copied by competitiors?\n\nDesigning GPUs is hard. The lithography equipment to produce the very top-end chips are exceedingly expensive and only comes from a couple companies. These chips can basically only be produced by TSMC, and they don't have a habit of allowing their fabs to be used to knock off the designs of their best customers (they have an interest in costs staying high).\n\n>It's only a matter of time before a competitor releases something for a fraction of the price.\n\nSee above. The barriers to entry are *huge*. It takes years and *billions* of dollars to build a fab capable of producing high-end chips. This is literally the most complex manufacturing process ever devised by humans.\n\nIs this a bubble? Absolutely. But it won't pop because high-end AI chips suddenly start being produced en masse in Bangladesh or Vietnam.",
