Modern planes but pack 'em in like sardines and charge extra for every little optional thing, like desiring to breathe or exist while on plane.\n\n787 is 20% less fuel consumption due to weight savings due to composites construction, so it makes sense that an ultrabudget carrier might choose it.  I love flying on 787s because I get altitude sickness and the higher cabin pressure in a 787 is way more comfortable for me.",

The implication is that longer flights fudge the stats, especially so considering longer flights tend to be larger planes and so deaths per passenger mile drops. \n\nIt’s not really the whole story though, there’s several bodies keeping multiple lines of statistics for deaths and accidents. Current IATA fatality rate is 0.11, meaning a flight every day for around 25,000 years would equal a 100% chance of dying in a plane crash, and about 1.21 deaths per million flights. It’s difficult to compare to cars directly, but there’s about 160 deaths per million cars, or 170 deaths per licensed driver per year.",
