Nvidias is increasingly likely and not built on hot air.  \n  Being a bubble doesn’t mean you can’t invest in it. It just means a lot of growth is already priced in. Apple has been a bubble for 10 years. It’s my biggest holding and my biggest gain. I was thinking of leaving when the Vision Pro was underwhelming and they lost top spot in the world. Now the new iPhone16 with a real Siri has people excited again so I’m holding a bit longer.  \n  A bubble is just an expression of excitement. I like to ride excitement.",
