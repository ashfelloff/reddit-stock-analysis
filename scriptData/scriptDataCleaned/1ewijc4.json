It had a SPAC IPO around $10 years ago, and dropped to around $2 this spring when it looked like they’d have to dilute. Over the past few months the landscape has changed dramatically. They now have a proven technology, customers, it doesn’t look like they’ll have to dilute, and the satellites are going up soon.   \n\nDoesn’t seem that crazy that it’d triple its initial price from a few years ago, given this. It was always going to either go to $0 or $100. This spring it looked like $0. Now it looks like $100 🤷🏼‍♂️",

      "body": "Just a thought…legging into complex option spreads\n\nYou could leg into diagonals by selling $50 Feb ‘25c against your current position. Looking at ASTS after hours price they will probably open at least at $11.00.\n\nThat means you could lock in $400k in gains and still have a great position. \n\nIf the stock moons and puts both options at intrinsic value then the spread still nets you another $724k when both legs are exercised.\n\nIf the stock continues rising but doesn’t hit $50 in the next 6 months then your short $50 calls expire worthless and you lock in $400k while retaining all your Jan ‘26 calls. \n\nMoves you can make with that $400k\n\nAt open you can probably another $30 Jan ‘26c for every 2 $50 Feb ‘26c you sell. Increasing your long position by 50%. If it is at $50 or less by Feb ‘26 then you increased your long position by 50% for free. If it closes anywhere under $70 by Feb ‘25 then you can still close your short $50c for a profit. For example if the stock price is $60 when the short legs expire then they will be worth 1k each where as the $30 Jan ‘26 calls you opened will be worth $3k + theta. So you sell a maximum of 2/3 of the calls you bought to close all the short $50c and keep the remaining 1/3. At $70 you close the position at exactly 2:1 and retain your current number of calls. \n\nIf it’s passed $70 it will begin to slightly diminish potential profits of your current position. If it just absolutely skyrockets to $85 by Feb ‘25 then you’ll close out all the $50c using the new calls and half your original calls leaving you with $724k + 50%. That’s about 1.72 million vs 1.99 million or about 86% of your current position value at the same stock price. \n\nIf it doesn’t hit $50 by Feb ‘25 but does hit $85 Jan ‘26 then you have 50% more calls that would be worth about 2.99 mil. If you just held your current position then the stock price would have to hit $112.5 to match that.\n\nYou don’t even have to stop there. If the price is rising and you don’t want to lose value on the $50c you can keep rolling them up and out until they get to Jan ‘26. Then you greatly increase your max profit and greatly reduce your loss of potential profits vs current position.",

This stock will hit 300 by the end of 30 and I suspect it will be much sooner. 6 years for a 10 bagger hell yeah I'm in. \n\nBig Firstnet meeting tomorrow around 1145 ET. There is an expectation they will be committing money for the build out. \n\nSpaceX has a 120B valuation mostly off Starlink. I suspect this will be same or bigger(100Bish) thats 400 a share . Starlink does not truly compete just like ULA doesnt really compete will Spacex. The Starlink to phones will not be successful IMO.",
