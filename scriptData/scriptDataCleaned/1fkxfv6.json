Basically all truckers use them, especially long haul truckers.. and the amount of data theyâ€™ve collected on a large segment of the population is amazing. They essentially know what every trucker buys inside a truck stop, which convenience stores pay millions for. They also act essentially as a bank and payroll service.",
