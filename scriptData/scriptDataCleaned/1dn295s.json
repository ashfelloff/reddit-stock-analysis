That combined with the tech selloffs expected this week make me think it might get as low as 200$ (and stay there). WWDC hype is over so feel like this news could be extremely problematic. \n\nI have 12/20/24 225$ calls I’m starting to get worried about. I’m debating whether or not to sell at market open tomorrow. Curious what everyone thinks.\n\nThanks ",

      "body": "Short term I don’t see much movement in the stock price. Apple is delaying most of the interesting AI features in the WWDC until 2025 anyway. Even when they launch, it’s yet to be determined if they’re any good. Even if they are, not everyone cares about them. I think it’ll have a modest impact to sales in the EU at best, and only by the end of next year. That downward pressure would be mitigated - at least in part - by upward pressure in the U.S.\n\nLong term, however, is very interesting. The EU recently signalled an intent to investigate multiple potential breaches of the DMA. The DMA permits fines of up to $1B per day for non-compliance in Apple’s case, and/or 20% of global revenue for individual breaches. There is no technical reason to prevent third party access to at least some of these new features, which means Apple is attempting to sway public opinion by maliciously denying access to new features. Which is *not* a breach of the DMA.  Both sides have therefore signalled an escalation in the conflict, and both sides have enormous stakes to win and lose. If Apple loses, they must permit third party developers to distribute their apps to customers without notarisation or fees. This could meaningfully dent Apple’s App Store revenue in the EU. *That* would hurt their stock price and growth. It also wouldn’t end with the EU. If they settle on a workable solution, other countries would initiate similar legislation. Countries like Japan are already doing so.",

How is making a better version of their current phone which is already the market leader going to significantly increase revenues? It may make them harder to compete with, but guess what, the only companies competing with Apple are basically Google who has their own LLM and can probably integrate AI into their phones even cheaper than AAPL can.\n\nMy point here is that these \"tech-opolies\" are not going to take more market share than their current 99% share even if they make a phone that is 10x better.

It’s not like they don’t have lawyers on the payroll.\n\nPeople like to pretend the USB-C thing was forced on Apple but forget Apple was involved in the USB-C spec. It was partially their idea, and on their roadmap before the EU was even looking to standardize.\n\nWhat happened was the EU wanted to look powerful so it made it look like they were taking Apple to task for something already on their roadmap.  The EU outdid Apple in public policy. Apple marketing had no way to counter and not break a law \n\nApple however couldn’t switch off lightning earlier than they did because they previously promised lightning would be the standard for a decade during the lightning announcement and if Apple abandoned it earlier the EU would have went after them for making false claims.  Something the EU would easily win and sanction Apple for.  Then still make it sound like they made a standard.\n\nEither way the EU wins the publicity war here.  Apple’s only recourse was to stay to the original roadmap.\n\nLawyers are one step ahead.",
