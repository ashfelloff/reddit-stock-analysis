That’s the lesson. Now if you can learn it without losing all your money that would be something.",

      "body": "So one of the big things I've been dwelling on yesterday afternoon is the idea of sticking to a plan. Because this whole sub is based on wild gambling, I know it sounds lame, but even amidst degenerate bets, try to stick to the plan and not suddenly and impulsively deviate. At least ask yourself before you make a buy or a sell, does this make sense? Why am I doing this?\n\n\nI fumbled around 10k in the span of 1 hour yesterday. I bought 14 444p on QQQ during it's low volume boom and I was sure, damn near positive it would dump just like it did the day prior. Yields have still been steadily climbing. \n\n\nI started scaling out of them early in the dump, selling 1 at a time every 10 or 15 minutes which has been working for me so I don't get insta bagged if it changes direction. Then for some goddamn reason, probably due to how the market has groomed us, I bought into 442 calls expiring the next day (today). That wasn't a part of the plan and I utterly fucked myself as it continued to dump. \n\n\nIf I had stuck to my plan, the worst case would have been making a decent profit, missing out on some big gains and having more dry powder to make a measured degenerate decision at a later time. ",
