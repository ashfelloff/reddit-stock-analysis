All of my ER play nowadays are neutral direction, as you can see the strategy in the screenshot, my profit increase each day doesn’t matter where the underlying price is and it has a almost 80 dollar wide (from 110-190) range for me to close for a 50% minimum profit.  I can’t advise you on that. But seeing what I see on almost all of my MU er position right now with all of them being neutral, I won’t lose profit unless the price go above 175 at least, so that means very small chance the price will go above that because the math is telling me it’s already priced in. I don’t know man, I don’t keep my strategies open thru ER. The math won’t look the same after 26th. But take advantage of that (will be the same until close of 26th). If I was in your position, just looking at the calculation I would keep the position open. See where the underlying price is right before close of market on 26, then sell a calendar call of 150 against it and be done with it, just remember to close the short out on Friday afternoon. Maybe you end up with a free 150 6/28.",
