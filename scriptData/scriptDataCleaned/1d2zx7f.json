  "selftext": "I don't know about you but that sounds insanely cheap to me. It's getting cheaper as NVDA beats and guides higher every quarter too. We know NVDA will finally hit $3 trillion and surpass AAPL tomorrow but that still seems quite undervalued. According to my valuation models, an 80 p/s ratio is easily achievable setting Nvidia at $6 trillion market cap by the end of the year. And that's only \"fair\" value. Given the bullish sentiment and the options flow, we should see it fly past $6 trillion and settle around $10 trillion as it consolidates for the next cycle upturn. To put this into context $10 trillion is only around $400/share after the stock split so that's still pretty cheap in my honest opinion. Upside target is $500/share post split if we're being realistic and somewhat conservative.",

I started studying Nvidia a number of years ago and really had a sense that it was the future. I was actually on vacation – standing of all things in the parking lot of a former Goldmine that was open for tourists – frrruuuuuustrated with my broker because we couldn’t seem to put the trade through and I wanted to buy just a few shares of Nvidia that day. Which I finally did. If things go the way that they’ve been going, that wasted time on vacation and those few shares will be worth six figures tomorrow or the next day. it’s admittedly an unusual situation and set up but it’s hardly the only stock that is up in profitable. Patience research and fortitude will help you pay the bills any day.",

Well were you gonna jump ship then or stay? If you stayed, what if 10 year rate continued going up to 5%, MSFT + GOOGL + AMZN had mediocre earnings, NVDA continued dropping to -40% or half before earnings, and then report a bad outlook forecast (while still beating earnings estimate), and the stock tanks even more? You gonna sell before they report, or are you gonna hold through a -50%?\n\nI'm not gonna bet against NVDA because I have to pay interest to hold through my position, but I don't see the risk/reward for NVDA being that attractive.
