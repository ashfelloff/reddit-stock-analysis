  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nSome stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on _____?‚Äù or ‚ÄúIs ___ a good investment?‚Äù will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: Soft US CPI Seen Tempering First-Quarter Inflation Scare\n\n- [QS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=QS&p=d) - Strikes deal with Volkswagen on solid-state batteries.\n- [DAL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DAL&p=d) - Delta reported record revenue for 2Q but also net income fell 30%. Forecasted adjusted EPS of $1.70-$2 a share, short of $2.05 estimates. Other airlines down as well in sympathy.\n- [SOUN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOUN&p=d) - Announces integration with Stellantis automaker, will have cars with SOUN voice assistant built in.\n- [TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - Same thesis as yesterday, has been on a tear for the past few days- still have bearish bias. Trading out of line with Mag 7 (which is expected due to car sale numbers), but will be looking for appropriate places to short if they occur. If we spike off the open then I‚Äôll try to be agile and short/cover where appropriate.\n- [AMZN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d) - Took advantage of the CPI spike and exited out half of part of my AMZN position, will hold rest back to a stop at 199. Other than that, still holding half. We DID open at a lower low today (but that can partially be attributed to CPI). Will likely remove this after today.\n\nEarnings: None I‚Äôm interested in\n\nIPOs: None I‚Äôm interested in\n",

              "body": "Before the VW deal, it was very clear to investors that Rivian will have to raise capital by selling shares (diluting investors) to sustain operations, this was priced in and the stock tanked to $8 (down from $25 in Dec 2023). After the major news of the $5B investment from VW, these fears as well as bankruptcy fears evaporated as Rivian now has the capital needed to grow, innovate, and and ramp up production without having to heavily dilute investors. The stock is now re- calibrating. On top of this, Rivian has been receiving a lot of positive media attention, much more than in the past.\n\nThese are the biggest factors I think, of course there are other smaller factors too.",
