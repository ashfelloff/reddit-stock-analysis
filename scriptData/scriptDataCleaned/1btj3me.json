  "selftext": "You regards probably have seen the DD about PAA, Enterprise Product Partners (EPD) is another midstream energy company mentioned in that post. EPD owns over 50,000 miles of pipeline and is engaged in the transportation, storage, and processing of natural gas, crude oil, and petrochemicals, being the largest company in the midstream space by market cap. EPD itself is a solid company, especially when considering the associated financials. \n\n# Financials:\n\n(Source: [Deep Dive Into Enterprise Prods Partners Stock: Analyst Perspectives (5 Ratings) | Markets Insider (businessinsider.com)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/deep-dive-into-enterprise-prods-partners-stock-analyst-perspectives-5-ratings-1033196474#:~:text=Revenue%20Growth%3A%20Enterprise%20Prods%20Partners%27s%20revenue%20growth%20over,a%20substantial%20increase%20in%20the%20company%27s%20top-line%20earnings.))\n\n**The Good:**\n\nRevenue Growth: Enterprise Products Partners revenue for the quarter ending December 31, 2023 was $14.622B, a 7.12% increase year-over-year\n\nReturn on Assets (ROA): The company demonstrates effective utilization of assets with an impressive ROA of 2.16%.\n\nDebt Management: Enterprise Prods Partners adopts a balanced approach to debt management with a below-average debt-to-equity ratio of 1.05. \n\n**Areas of concern:**\n\nNet Margin: Enterprise Prods Partners's net margin falls below industry averages with a net margin of 10.38%\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE): Enterprise Prods Partners's ROE is below industry standards with an ROE of 5.54%. \n\n# Industry: \n\nThe US oil industry is experiencing a significant boom in recent years, and this trend is likely to continue. These previous DD’s do a great job explaining the positive factors associated with the midstream sector in detail:\n\n[Drill baby drill!

The premium for these options is extremely low, with an IV of around 7%. The IV is similar to what it was for PAA before regards started to buy in droves lmao. I see this stock getting to $35 well before 2026, and the 1/17/25 $35 calls @ $8 per contract could be another option. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rl5vopn48yrc1.jpg?width=338&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2d27632794511118b977b9639290038f5674024b",
