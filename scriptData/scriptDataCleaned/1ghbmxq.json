  "selftext": "Ive been investing since 2017, got into options mid 2021 since I became more confident in stocks, and then I quickly made around 25k, I was so excited getting so close to 100k (my peak was 88k) and that is where I lost the ball. I thought that stocks such as Alibaba, Paypal, Lemonade, Enphase were undervalued since they had already fallen about 20-30% so I decided to spend half if not more of my portfolio on buying call Options. By then, it all went downhill. I would say to myself to get out of the market, but I kept buying more and more, hoping I would be able to make my losses back. \nThats how I lost all of my saving. Now Im trying to climb back, but its damn hard. All I can do is slave my self to work and make it all over again. \nI surely have a spot in the  “Regards hall of Fame”",
