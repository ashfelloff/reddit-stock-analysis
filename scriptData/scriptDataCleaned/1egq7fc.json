  "selftext": "NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE\n\nUDMY will crush earnings after mkt close today.  They have been beaten down by Gen AI fears but once they show they are growing rev WITH their new ai features (ai assistant / instructor) the narrative will flip.  I am expecting a large move similar to COURSERA’s 50% jump last week (which actually values coursera higher than udemy which is insane)\n\nPlus they reduced the instructor take rate from 25% to 20% in Q1 and revenue still grew yet the expected EPS is the same.  They are also actively buying back shares with tons of cash in hand.  I am bullish.\n\n\n3PM edit: Less than 1 hr till ER and my asshole is extremely clenched.  Good luck to all you regards and may the odds be ever in our favor.  You can still buy in but the IV has blown up so the R/R may be different now.  My position is up $5,000 so far today but I am hodling…\n\nAlso, Earnings call at 5PM: https://investors.udemy.com/events/event-details/udemy-second-quarter-2024-earnings-call",
