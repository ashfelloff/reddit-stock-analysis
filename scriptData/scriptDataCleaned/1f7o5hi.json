That would be Sept. 20. But even if DJT shares tumble further, and plunge below $12, Trump is allowed to start selling six months after the completion of the deal. That would be Sept. 25.\n\n[Sauce](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/djt-stock-has-tanked-and-trump-can-soon-sell-shares/ar-AA1pB7t1).",

They merge X and DJT and this allows Trump to disentangle his name from the failing company. X isn´t worth more than a symbolic Dollar these days either, but if Trump and Musk offer to sell ooff all their shares \"to give free speech back to the people\", it would at least in theory have a chance to recover. That might lead to a pricing well above anything DJT could generate for Trump. And it would offer both a way to sneak out of their financial disasters with their \"reputation\" somewhat protected.",
