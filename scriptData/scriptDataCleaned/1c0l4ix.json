          "body": "Currency trading is another animal. Inflation is high so you’d think the dollar should be losing value against the euro. Long term probably. But because inflation is high, interest rates likely won’t be cut at the next FOMC meeting. High interest rates make dollars more valuable. Why? Because u.s bonds will pay better comparatively to foreign bonds, so people buy dollars to buy bonds. In other words speculation: this might happen so that should happen so this should happen so that will probably happen near term and presto - higher dollar",
