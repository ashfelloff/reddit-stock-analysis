              "body": "The Great Depression was actually really bad for most rich people. \nMany got wiped out or took big hits. \nMost of them were not like Joseph Kennedy or Bernard Baruch. \nAlso some were right too soon and effectively lost money because they pulled out early and didn’t get the right assets to profit off the depression. \nThe people who benefitted the most pulled out 1-2 years before the crash and invested in real estate. But it had to be the right real estate, like someone who bought land in Florida or Oklahoma got fucked, while someone who bought land in California made off like a bandit. \nThere were also people/families who took hits but survived. This was common for people who were able to stay afloat during the depression and ended up in a good position to profit off the war. Henry Ford, Howard Hughes and Henry Kaiser did that. The New Deal helped keep them going and then business from the war made and revived many fortunes.\n\nThe Great Recession and COVID were a very different story. The bailouts, ZIRP, and the recovery acts caused the K-shaped recoveries that followed.",

Really what's happened is we had an unnaturally low inflationary period starting around 2005 which couldn't be contained and we are bounding back to more normal levels. Inflation through the 70's and 80's was generally way high than it's been recently.\n\n>Employment numbers were proven to he underrepresented, and it's accelerating upward. It's already at 5%\n\nThese numbers are *always* estimated and then revised when actuals are available because there's not a national employment registry. That said, the near constant upward revision is concerning. However, 5% isn't some magic number that means anything historically. For example, we reached 9%+ in 2010. Really, the numbers to watch or non seasonal employment rates Q4 along with retail sales. That will really be the sign to watch. Strong Q4 means \"soft landing\" was a success.\n\n>GDP growth rate is falling.\n\nThat absolutely depends on the window. Compared to post covid explosion, sure. Q2 2024 was at 3% which looking back to 1990 still looks solid and beats all 2022 and the first half of 2023. If we see GDP contract to less than 2% in Q3 2024, then some red flags will certainly be showing. But again, Q4 is the actual litmus test.",
