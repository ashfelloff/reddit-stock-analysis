              "body": "I was quite interested in rivian after studding for quite some time  other EVs stocks aside from tesla, to me it was probably the startup with better prospects, since all are burning cash and the contract with amazon seemed to me a proof that the company could grow, but, the panorama on the evs market is complicated, the commercial war with China, the dependence of western auto makers on chinese batteries, and so on, (also the lack on investment from traditional automakers, specially the european ones, lobbying for synthetic fuels) still I think Rivian has  good prospects after providing amazon with delivery evs, but, that seems not enough and as all ev stocks are mostly speculative at the moment, because the market is not moving, nevertheless, Warren sold a big chunk of apple, probably he has Ford in his portfolio and not rivian...by the way, I sold my rivian stocks long ago, and has not moved much since I did...and I do not plan to buy any ev stock until I see what's going to be the market direction, but I would go probably for any big car maker like ford or Toyota, which are paying dividends. I think makers of hybrid cars will have still better sales and margins than those of 100% electric vehicles. The only way that the ev stock could explode would be with massive governmental aids for acquiring evs, but, since the western industry is really behind on that, with very little models at still high prices, the only ones that could gain from that would be the massively subsidized chinese industry (which are making better cars and this info I got from a Daimler exec) that even with the 20% tax that they will get, they will be still competitive, therefore, the market won't move, cuz west 0 china 1 and ursula won't like that......(there are other reasons, but that's to me the main one)......",

People are slowly getting used to subscriptions for everything, over the last few decades. Imagine having a car that works perfectly with your phone and smartwatch, and I mean perfectly, not just apple carplay level, but some next level shit. You want to keep using all that? Simple, just make sure your phone is always an iPhone, you car is always an apple car, and keep paying the monthly subscription for some service. \n\nHardware wise all smartphones are basically the same, except tech nerds on the internet, nobody cares. The real differentiating factor is services, and pretty soon all electric cars are going to be basically the same as well. There is only so much you can do in the future with a wheel and 3-4 screens in a car, the differentiating factor is going to be entertainment and software. A lot of people already wouldn't buy a car without android auto or apple carplay, and once design settles in the current age where we have touch screen for everything, and performance is adequate and pretty much the same for each brand in each segment, what is left is brand recognition and entertainment/software experience, and apple is number one in both of those.",

There are some problems though.\n\nThe article says:\n\n* 75% of EV purchases were by men\n* 87% of EVs are owned by white people\n\nNow, one question you might have next is what are the demographics of car purchases overall, and what are the demographics of the US.\n\n* 60% of new car purchases overall were by men\n* 71% of America is white\n\nSo that takes quite a bit of steam off your numbers. It doesn't mean you're wrong, it just softens the strength of your argument. But that's actually not my main point. My main point is that your argument brings race and gender needlessly into a conversation about cars. What is your reason for bringing that up? Why exactly does it matter if white men are more likely to drive an EV than black women? And why is it that you give a shit-stained sneer toward the people who do buy EVs? \"\"White men can pretend they care about the environment.\" I'm sorry, but is your claim that Chinese women care more? How about Indians? What's Africa's record on environmental protections?\n\nYou're doing what has become fashionable and shoehorning race and gender into everything while shaming people for no reason at all. It's annoying as hell. At the same time, all your numbers show is that people with more money (making over 100k per year) are:\n\na) More likely to buy a new car (the used EV market is shallow)\n\nb) Has enough money to actively make sounder environmental choices\n\nI'm not even a great fan of EVs. I don't own one, and in fact I choose not to own a car at all. That said, I don't shame people for owning them, and I sure as hell don't boil it down to their race or gender.

      "body": "Rivian makes sense for Apple as it fits their way of thinking.\n\nRivian makes an attractive EV but the company is failing and lacks the cash to get to production of future models. Apple has plenty of cash.\n\nApple goes to Rivian and makes them a deal with the devil. We buy X amount of cars or fund you Y amount of money so you can survive and in return we get to do this or that with software and you we get all the profits and then some should anything work out.\n\nLucid is not an option for Apple as they are still well funded and have the Saudi's backing them, but Rivian is running into trouble.\n\nFor investors in Rivian this may be good in that it avoids Rivian going bankrupt but on the other hand Apple will take every penny of profit they can.",
