Most people will prioritize their car payment over their mortgage or rent payment, and both of those are prioritized over unsecured debt like credit cards. You would need to see a big uptick in CC defaults and mortgage defaults before believing current auto loan paper is in trouble. Rates dropping increases the value of the auto loan portfolios too. \n\nAuto sales being down is somewhat of a good sign for disinflation, it just has to be monitored and managed well through monetary and fiscal policy and automakers are going to have to rise to the challenge of controlling costs to protect margins, rather than just raising prices. There will need to be some technological innovation and effort to provide real value to the consumer for automakers to stay competitive.",
