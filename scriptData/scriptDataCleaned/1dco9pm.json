They're not streaming it in constantly from their customers, and the data they do have isn't as useful for training as you might hope. It's all sourced from a single sensor class and unlabeled.\n\nThat's not to say that it isn't useful, it's just that massive quantities of raw footage doesn't really equate to massive gains in autonomous driving performance.\n\nTesla doesn't have the best-in-class autonomous driving AI. Not by a long shot. Better algorithms and training regimes would get them a lot further than sitting on real world driving data.\n\nNVDA's Omniverse is a synthetic data generation platform used for training a wide variety autonomous robot scenarios, including vehicles. It's far from the only one. Other vehicle manufacturers haven't crippled their platforms with a single sensor class and have data that is more useful.\n\nNone of that really matters compared to advances in training methodologies and network designs. In that department, TSLA is lagging hard.",
