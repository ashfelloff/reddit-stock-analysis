  "selftext": "Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) shares tumbled 6.5% in extended-hours trading on Wednesday after the memory chipmaker issued guidance that was in-line with estimates, overshadowing a stronger-than-expected third-quarter.\n\nFor the period ending May 30, Micron earned an adjusted $0.62 per share as revenue jumped 82% year-over-year to $6.81B. Cash flow from operations for the period was $2.48B, below the $3.24B estimate, while gross margin clocked in at 28.1%.\n\nA consensus of analysts expected the company to earn $0.53 per share on $6.67B in revenue. The company attributed much of its sales growth to artificial intelligence, with AI demand driving 50% of its sequential revenue growth in the data center. Micron also said that AI-demand has caused tightness in leading edge nodes. \"We are gaining share in high-margin products like High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), and our data center SSD revenue hit a record high, demonstrating the strength of our AI product portfolio across DRAM and NAND,\" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said in a statement. \"We are excited about the expanding AI-driven opportunities ahead, and are well positioned to deliver a substantial revenue record in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nLooking to the next quarter, Micron expects to earn between $1 and $1.16 per share on an adjusted basis, with revenue expected to be $7.6B, plus or minus $200M. Adjusted gross margins are forecast to be between 33.5% and 35.5%, with the estimate at 34.5%.Analysts were expecting the company to earn $1.02 per share on $7.58B in revenue.The company will host a conference call at 5:30 p.m. EST to discuss the results.",

They’re smart, have guts, and most importantly now, profit and capital.  Those of us who are still earning their money day to day get nervous, rightfully so, and then the train passes.  We don’t get on until it’s too late.  Then we see the little increases, and plateau for a long time.  Many get out, and then miss the next train again.  Know what you’re comfortable losing, but be ready to take some risks. Tough balance for the average Joes and Janes.  Good luck!",
