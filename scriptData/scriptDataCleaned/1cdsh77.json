There's few companies that go from meeting the requirements to be in the S&P 500 to bankrupt in a matter of months. There are companies that hit a serious rough patch (see: COVID) and return to profitability when it's over. \n\nAnd while some companies get dropped at their worst and then recover, some companies get added at their best and then shit the bed (see TSLA).",
