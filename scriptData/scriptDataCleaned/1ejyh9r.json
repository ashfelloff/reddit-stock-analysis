In their current state, they’re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.”\n\n> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**\n\n> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”\n\n> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. \n\n> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “\n\n> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”\n\n> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”\n\n> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”\n\n> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”\n\n> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”\n\n> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”\n\n> “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”\n\n> “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. \n\n> “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”\n\n> “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”\n\n> “Apple’s effort still **feels like a response** to the AI revolution being advanced by Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft Corp.”\n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-04/apple-intelligence-early-preview-in-call-recording-safari-summaries-new-siri-lzfk2949",

          "body": "The fundamental problem most r/stocks users don't understand is that very capable LLMs require a huge amount of computing resources. It's estimated that it takes around 50 Nvidia H100 GPUs clustered together just to fit GPT4 into memory.\n\nGPT4 is reportedly 1.7 trillion parameters. Apple Intelligence's local model is around 2 billion parameters because that's all a mobile device can do in 2024. In other words, GPT4 is 850x larger than Apple Intelligence's local model.\n\nIt's obvious to anyone who understands AI that Apple Intelligence is a many years long roadmap that will have exponential improvements each year. We're in the baby years of AI.\n\nThis notion that \"AI doesn't meet marketing hype\" is silly. It's not a feature you build once and it never gets updated again. It's likely a very long march towards a true AI digital assistance like Jarvis in Iron Man.\n\nIn the past, people upgraded their iPhones for various reasons from faster CPUs/GPUs, faster modems, better cameras, bigger screens, better battery life. All of those have reached maturity and are reaching diminishing returns. Apple now has a new lever to pull. \"Buy iPhone 17, it's 4x more intelligent than iPhone 16\". \"Buy iPhone 18, it can now run a 20 billion parameter LLM\". From here on out, Apple Intelligence should get better exponentially.",
