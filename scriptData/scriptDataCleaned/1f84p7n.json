That's why market is selling off on nothing other than it being the 9th month even though we know it's rate cuts by the end of the month.\n\nAnyways, 🌈🐻 and OP will be lame like that. I built up to over 350K in cash last month. I wouldn't have done that if I wasn't moving that into a RE purchase. Markets are likely going to rally after cuts and definitely will rally more post-election. \n\nAnd don't get it twisted. I don't mean the REAL BEARS who do the DD to come up with a play, have shorts/puts, and show us those. Those guys have balls of steel try to win the hard way. It's always the 🌈🐻s who are always lame fucks. They were saying \"GUH\" during the 2020/2021/2022/2023 dips while bulls were buying. Now bulls doing real shit with their winnings while 🌈🐻s just keep talking shit and doing nothing. Most of these talking 🌈🐻s don't even short the market like real bears do. All talk with no walk. That's why OP doesn't post their fucking positions, DD, or plays. They've got none. It's as if they subsist on nothing more than talking shit, fear mongering, dragging others down with them into not making money, and predicting 42069 of the last 2 recessions.",
