But it's not all lucky, because I believe it comes from what my mindset was at that time, my upbringing and my passion.\n\nI don't know your age, but back in the early 2000s the internet was blossoming. And usually young adolescents are typically early adopters of the next revolution. It may be some innate, natural stake in the future of your life. Nonetheless, I was one of those kids, playing games in this early adoption phase. I became intrigued by it and I knew Amazon, Yahoo, Microsoft, etc. were growing companies in this space. As time went on, their growing popularity validated it. They felt almost invincible.\n\nI was passionate about tech early in my life and it grew into adulthood. While I do not work in tech, it gives you a perspective about my intuition.\n\nSo, yes, did I get lucky that I got involved in tech stocks early on, sure? But, I think a lot of it is going with disrupters. Thinking about how they play into the future and go with your gut. My best example of this is Netflix. I use to get their DVDs. You have no idea how much of a pain it was to have to wait. It annoyed me. I also hated going to gas station to rent DVDs at RedBox and have to bring them back. Maybe it was my short attention span? When streaming started to become popular, I thought how nice is this. People can just watch it on demand, pay a service price and get what you want. The early Netflix didn't have much of a selection, but I liked it more because I love to watch movies. When they started getting new releases, I felt it in my gut that it would be a hit.\n\nNow, if you want to talk about losses, yes, I have some bad ones, like Intel, Yahoo, General Electric, Robinhood and many others.",

My most recent job had fees that essentially cut my returns to lower than I would have received if I had been paid and let the money sit in a bank account. \n\nEven though it was pretax and the market went insane this year, I still made less than 5% after everything was included. Investment fees, distribution fees, transfer fees, etc. \n\nYou may legitimately be better off just reducing your contributions and putting it in a savings account getting 5%. It's insane and infuriating that you can be required to put your 401k in funds like this.",

Essentially think of yourself as a longterm owner and partner. \n\nA lot of people have made money in US equities because it has been in a 20 year bull run. Other countries haven’t offered such advantages, so one has to do a lot of research about the company and the economy. Even right next door, in Canada, they may have produced one tech company that kept growing for the past 20 years, while the US has many. Figure out your long term investment strategy based on your own assessment of greed, fear and rationality. Research and valuation will always be the most important pillar. \n\nInvesting and philanthropy is all that I do. In a bad year I make enough in dividends to retire, in a very good year I make enough in paper wealth for my next generation to retire, but sadly they’ll have to share it with the underprivileged.\n\nI love what I do, I am grateful for this skill and the lessons the experience has taught me.

Its better to buy as stock like MSFT or WM or ADP, etc.. at a 2% current yield but grows the dividend/distribution historically @ close to 7-10%/per year...  vs.  AT&T, Duke, or Verizon growing historical distributions at lest than 2%/year.  If you have a long horizon (long time till retirement) than the best buy and hold strategy in my opinion is the one with long term dividend growth stocks that have a long history of paying and growing distributions (i.e. dividend champions or contenders list).  Once ones reaches the magical $100k portfolio the compounding effect goes much faster than before.\n\nThe key to long term investing (not day trading) is being consistent with depositing money to your account on each paycheck and buying additional shares just like how your employers 401k takes out a % of your paycheck to deposit to the 401k.

Well most of it was basically two companies, NIO and GME.  I bought NIO with all of our money when it was trading at $1.5-3 in 2020, when literally every media site wrote that they will go bankrupt in two weeks. I have read their financials,  I have seen that they easily have enough money for like a year or two, also the chinese government backed them. In a couple of months I 10x-ed my money, and the Tesla hype definitely helped a lot in it.  \n\nThe other was GME. I bought it roughly a year before the ape movement started, though my main thesis was really similar to theirs: the company was already shorted over 80% of its outstanding shares, they had net cash 3 times as their market cap and they even had a new management (no, not Ryan Cohen,  he was nowhere at the time. But they hired Jim Bell,  who was a retail veteran and Reggie Fils-Aimé,  who was a legend and former Nintendo America president). Oh, it was also already known that the new cycle will have DVD/blu-ray players (whoch only became partially true though), so I booked on a final squeeze in this cigar butt. It went much-much higher than I ever anticipated thanks to the apes, and I and my wife have made generational wealth (well, at least for us. We were able to buy a home and haven't needed to work since).  \n\nI have made same huge mistakes too, the biggest mistakes were when I underestimated the possible losses. A have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars witb a single GME option strategy. I expected that it will remain low, I sold calls (though bought higher strikes to mitigate possible losses), just before DFV announced his return on reddit :D  \n\nI also lost a lot of money in chinese companies before I watched the 'China Hustle' movie. After that movie I have sold all my chinese stocks (roughly 50% of my portfolio at the time) and I havent bought a single chinese company since then... So far it turned out as a good decision.  \n\nSo, right now we are living from our investments, hopefully we can retain this lifestyle as far as possible. I really-really love investing.",
