  "selftext": "Why I believe the China govt is setting up BABA for a pop in price. Here is the sequence:\n\n1. Aug 15th 2024 JP Morgan release new price target for BABA $106. (Why the sudden re-rating?)\n2. Aug 21st 2024 Alibaba, ill upgrade its status on the Asian exchange to a primary listing, becoming a dual primary-listed company. Giving Mainland Chinese the opportunity to purchase shares in BABA.\n3. Sept 9th China mainlanders will have access to BABA shares to purchase.\n4. Sometime after this Govt will announce ANT Financial IPO approval which will be the catalyst that drives BABA stock higher and will be used as a political move to try and give confidence in the China economy.\n\nReason: Current China gov't leaders need to make some senior military and other political factions happy and satisfied or the knives will come out for the removal.\n\n1st Level of resistance is around $100, 2nd level is around $120",
