  "selftext": "The Biden administration announced on Monday that it would award Intel up to $3 billion to expand the company’s manufacturing of advanced semiconductors for the U.S. military.\n\nThe program, called Secure Enclave, aims to create a trusted source of computer chips for the U.S. government. It will be funded out of a pool of money from the 2022 bipartisan CHIPS Act, which lawmakers passed in an attempt to reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign sources of semiconductors.\n\nMuch of the world’s semiconductors are currently made in Asia, particularly Taiwan. China claims the island as its own territory, a position that Taiwan rejects, and American officials have long had concerns about the consequences for the U.S. economy and military if China were to invade Taiwan.\n\nIntel officials said on Monday that the company would help “secure the domestic chip supply chain” and work with federal officials to “enhance the resilience of U.S. technological systems.”\n\nThe announcement comes about six months after the Biden administration awarded Intel a grant of up to $8.5 billion to help the company fund major construction projects in Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico and Oregon. That money, along with the award announced Monday, stems from a $39 billion pot of CHIPS Act funding intended to encourage companies to build and expand semiconductor plants across the United States.\n\nFederal officials also awarded Intel up to $11 billion in loans, and the company is expected to claim federal tax credits that could cover 25 percent of its U.S. expansion projects, which are expected to cost more than $100 billion over five years.\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/intel-chips-semiconductor-grant.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/16/us/politics/intel-chips-semiconductor-grant.html)",

They are very advanced in ways unneeded by commercial ics and require immense r&d expense.  Trusted dod fabs are further highly secure and require personnel security clearances and monitoring and tracking that are sometimes absurdly extreme.  I highly doubt that Intel makes much $ out of this.  It’s a huge commitment and difficulty.  They probably agree to do this as opposed to want to do this.
