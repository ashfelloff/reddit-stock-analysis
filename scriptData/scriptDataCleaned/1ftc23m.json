  "title": "AI chipmaker Cerebras files for IPO to take on Nvidia - But 87% of its revenues have come from the UAE-G42 and U.S. Now Allows Nvidia Chips",
  "score": 61,
  "selftext": "The Middle East wants chips badly but US restrictions prevent the US most powerful chips entering into certain geographical areas such as China and the Middle East; this entails the UAE. Nevertheless, the UAE wants in on the GPU chips craze and is apparently willing to pay anything to enter into the chip bonanza. \n\nThe UAE can't get Nvidia's, AMD's, or Intel's best GPU chips so instead they are investing heavily into alternatives such as Cerebras. There is nothing inherently wrong with this but it's also the biggest red flag as an investment opportunity. If the agreements for Nvidia chips open up in the Middle East and specifically with the UAE that could be a crushing blow to this aspiring startup. \n\nSpecifically, Cerebras Systems reported a net loss of $66.6 million for the first six months of 2024, on $136.4 million in revenue. For the same period in 2023 it has a net loss of $77.8 million on just $8.7 million in sales. 87% of this revenue for the first half of 2024 was directly from the UAE G42. \n\nThe other red flag from this startup is the way in which they promote their business. It's all seemingly smoke and mirrors and conveniently based on outdated GPU pricing and throughput information; which is very publically available. \n\nFor some reason, Groq and Cerebras love to keep using memory to unlock speeds on small/tiny models which is impractical and inefficient for a scaled system; or a system that is a large foundational LLM. As well, they have no clue what models will do next so it's a major after the fact architecture that uses llama because they have access to it. [https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed.](https://cerebras.ai/blog/introducing-cerebras-inference-ai-at-instant-speed) A prime example of this is OpenAI's GPT-o1 model that uses reasoning in coordination with its model capabilities. Because they are not being used on the forefront of this technology they don't know how or when a model's size, function, or needs will evolve into the future. \n\nAll of this plus the pricing from OpenAI and Microsoft is coming down exponentially. \n\n**For Example**:\n\n1. They are referring to a 70b param model that shoves an entire model onto memory.\n2. They are going up against h100's which is a very old technology at this point. They make no reference to h200's let alone blackwell\n3. Because they are referencing such a small model the pricing model they suggest would be radically different for a 400b param model and forget about trillion param models which are coming next.\n4. They're not being truthful about tokens per s. As of today this is Azure GPT 4o and GPT 4 mini tokens per minute\n\n# gpt-4o & GPT-4 Turbo global standard\n\n|Model|Tier|Quota Limit in tokens per minute (TPM)|Requests per minute|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|`gpt-4o`|Enterprise agreement|30 M|180 K|\n|`gpt-4o-mini`|Enterprise agreement|50 M|300|\n\nAs you can clearly see 30 million tokens per minute is 500k tokens per second and mini is 833,333 tokens per second. So i don't know why they are referring to 20 tokens per second or their 450 tokens per second seems way off. maybe they mean million. Even if that is the case and 70 b would be more like mini it is way higher than their limit.\n\nOn pricing which they lay out a 3:1 input versus output is fine the price would be for mini which is a comparable model is roughly .10 cents (input) +  .20 cents = .30 cents. Per million.\n\nfor regular 4o it would be higher and let's face it GPT 4o is a far superior model than llama 3.1\n\n3.33 dollar + 5 = $8.33\n\n**Source:**\n\n[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/)\n\nFrom this information what I can tell you is that what we just went over is pricing. it is not some guarantee for what a model produces per second. That shit is very random. What I can tell you is from GPT 4 to GPT 4 turbo to Gpt 4o the speed is dramatically better. GPT 4o mini is damn near real time. Take that for what it's worth.\n\nI am not saying they're being dishonest here but I am saying they are being very cheeky with how they advertise things. \n\nThe company is currently being primarily supported by the UAE, with investments worth roughly $900 million for new AI supercomputers known as the Condor Galaxy series. Any growth here is singular to this source of investment and not driven by organic growth or usage. This is not a competitor to Nvidia but rather a temporary solution in the Middle East until chip embargoes are alleviated.\n\nThe media here loves to use sexy headlines on non-technical verifications of what it is they are actually comparing. I.e. H100's are now old, or The fact an entity may need to serve millions of clients... No they are instead reporting self-prompting headlines from Cerebras that say things like our chips are 20x faster than Nvidia. \n\n**Live Update:**\n\nAs I am writing and researching this topic it has just been reported by Reuters that the U.S. is setting a new rule to allow chip shipments to the Middle East including the UAE which is a boon to Nvidia and Microsoft. \n\n# [US sets new rule that could spur AI chip shipments to the Middle East](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-sets-new-rule-that-could-spur-ai-chips-middle-east-2024-09-30/#:~:text=Public%20Policy-,US%20sets%20new%20rule%20that%20could%20spur,shipments%20to%20the%20Middle%20East&text=WASHINGTON%2C%20Sept%2030%20(Reuters),centers%20in%20the%20Middle%20East)\n\n**Here are couple excerpts:**\n\n>WASHINGTON, Sept 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday unveiled a rule that could ease shipments of artificial intelligence chips like those from Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O), to data centers in the Middle East.\n\n>G42, a UAE-based AI company with historic ties to China, has been a focus of those concerns. In April, Microsoft Corp. [(MSFT.O), opens new tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/MSFT.O) announced that it would invest $1.5 billion in the company, with plans to provide G42 with chips and model weights, sophisticated data that improves an AI model's ability to emulate human reasoning.The deal drew scrutiny from China hardliners in Congress, even though G42 said in February that it had divested from China and was accepting constraints imposed on it by the United States to work with American companies.\n\nLOL you can't make this up. Literally this just got reported by Reuters today 9/30/2024. This completely aligns with my argument above regarding the UAE-G42. \n\nWith chips now entering into the Middle East from Nvidia and potentially others I don't know how this startup IPO makes it off the ground. I don't mean to be bearish but I don't think this is the time for them to raise an IPO without showing more progress. I could be wrong. As of now, I don't plan on buying any shares. \n\nInstead, I will be adding more shares into Nvidia because now this is bullish news for Nvidia.  ",

I think it’s a legitimate concern and will probably be the main reason for a fall in share price after ipo but I myself am not particularly worried by it.

I am a pre-IPO investor in a similar situation as yourself and I try to get as much info as possible.  My guess on that video is that it was deleted because someone thought it revealed too much (too late, I guess). But I could see myself deleting it too, why give everyone a complete roadmap of your proprietary tech. Sure, they could figure it out anyways but let them spend the time and resources.\n\nYou nailed the main risk on the company, the customer concentration is enormous, that is something they will need to work to rapidly alleviate, but part of the problem here is there aren't that many entities that can write these checks and need the product bad and Nvidia has a lock on the 4 or 5  regular joes stateside, and those guys aren't gonna turn to a startup for many good reasons.\n\nSo it's either you take on the rare big elephant when you see it, or you remain in little league. Nvidia, which is orders of magnitude the size of Cerebras also has high customer concentration. Perhaps as inferencing becomes a bigger part of the AI process there will be some changes on that in the sector as smaller players buy a bigger share of the sector output.   \n  \nBut for Cerebras the combo of  just 1 customer at the scale that is relevant for the IPO + the geopolitical risk of that customer is too high to waive off.  I think as investors one just takes known facts into account, pick spots not get too greedy, you know.\n\nThe OP didn't understand many things. The idea that if US reduces export controls this is good for Nvidia and bad for Cerebras is incorrect.  Actually, for G42 in particular, which is not just a customer but an investor in Cerebras, it likely accelerates Cerebras sales. People need to do their DD before spending a lot of time writing stuff.",

In a way it is expected throughput as well. Here's what I mean.

But you're right that workloads are shifting more towards inference. That said, the models doing the inference still need to be trained. Training is time-based, while inference is an ongoing, aggregate usage over time. As chips get faster, training times will drop, and inference will grow. But with future data and models being larger and more complex, who knows how training will pan out. At some point, training will be 'good enough' and modular training will come into play, allowing real-time updates, while inference handles the queries and keeps adding to that long-term memory.",
