  "selftext": "Not a blind Elon hating post, I promise. \n\nElon now has made several commitments that he's failed to deliver on. The robotaxi reveal on 8/8 not happening should not have come as a surprise to anyone that pays attention to current FSD performance and capabilities. Even to me, a totally naive investor, Elon's commitments aren't worth the paper they're written on (or computer they're tweeted on, I guess). Yet, so many investors with real money are \"disappointed\" when Tesla misses estimates or delays a launch. \n\nWhy does this happen? Do you guys have any faith in the commitments Elon makes?",

      "body": "I feel like you’re just beating around the obvious points: he made a few companies large and successful in a short amount of time, so he has clout from that, probably will have it for many years to come. He also has made numerous claims on the level of Peter Molyneux, stuff that wow’d us initially and got our collective imagination aflame. And in a couple of instances they even delivered the goods (some of the stuff SpaceX does is quite impressive, and Teslas went from niche to mainstream in a relatively short amount of time). After the dates for the bigger promises passed us by numerous times we all realized he’s a serial over-promiser, either because he’s too excitable and naive or because he’s trying to keep his stock prices afloat (maybe both at times). Either way, the public perception for most has now shifted to skepticism. Some people still take him at his word, but that group is shrinking.\n\nThe elephant in the room is that he is CEO and big cheese at several high profile companies. So naturally people take what he says with the gravity of that position. If he decided to cash out and hand over the reigns to other company heads, his words would begin to have much less gravitas.\n\nIn a similar vein, Donald Trump said a lot of bullshit all the time. And those statements are one thing when you’re a rich guy tweeting them out from the comfort of a Trump hotel. It’s an entirely different thing when you’re the actual President of the United States tweeting from the Oval Office. Suddenly your words have meaning and consequence. Many people wanted to ignore the crazy things he said every day, either to downplay his craziness or because they just wanted to get back to a reality where the President’s voice is a meaningful background noise to American life. But in either case we just couldn’t ever totally ignore it, because of the position he occupied. Elon occupies a similar area being one of the richest men alive as well as a CEO of some of the biggest companies.",

America also tends to forget that the biggest fortunes are built on breaking rules and stepping on other people -- something Elon is very willing to do, and which he is good at.",

They improved battery performance, and more. He hired a LOT of great engineers to make these dreams come true. \n\nHe then wanted to fill the dream for space. A bigger dream. He put in a LOT of money and a LOT of great engineers to make SpaceX work. \n\nIt is easy to admire someone who make a lot of dreams come true. \n\nHe is like a homerun hitter in baseball.

He can't get everything perfect every time, but he does a pretty solid job all around.  When people are upset that they aren't seeing the results they were anticipating, he is feeling the same way.  He also generally seems to give a shit about the continued existence of humanity, so he also has that going for him.",
