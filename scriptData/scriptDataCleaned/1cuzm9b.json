Those are not the core universal WANT but the individual subjective tastes. \n\nThe core universal desire is ***FREEDOM*** but most folks here are too regarded to self-reflect or accurately express their desires (bitches can't even bother to read DD before YOLO gambling their life savings). \n\n**FREEDOM** is not free though. Especially America, not matter how much they lie to you FREEDOM is NEVER FREE. It is *anything but FREE*. You are paying from the moment you are born, debt is put on your ass in the form of taxes and social security number, soldiers die to maintain our world order, government inflation and debt is a tax on everyone, and 99% of Americans live their day to day as slaves waging to pay their bills. Whatever freedom you is more of an illusion than reality if you don't have ***MONEY*** to grant your wishes/desires be it something as simple as taking a day off to catch some sun while eating ice cream at the park or spontaneously going to Ishigaki island in Japan for the beaches just cause you felt like it.\n\n>How does one even buy freedom? 🦅🦅🦅\n\n#MONEY \n\n#MONEY IS FREEDOM\n\nAnd in that sense China is selling their US treasuries [at a massive loss](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TLT). But they have the FREEDOM to do so, because they have MONEY. They are choosing to give up their US MONEY to prop up their devaluating Yuan in hopes of keeping the USD-CNY peg and propping their failing economy ([a failure they themselves created](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/16hespq/bankers_40_pay_cuts_show_the_china_dream_fading/k0hc4m5/?context=3)).",

Impossible for ground to absorb all of that.\n\n> Unless the US will blockade every SE Asia country, goods will continue to flow. \n\ncongratulations, you figured out the plan that's been in place since 1950s. Those SE Asia countries HATE china so they will easily help blockade. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_chain_strategy\nAnd blocking the straights between malaysia and indonesia and australia is enough to cut off most of trade for China\n\n>A blockade will provoke a nuclear attack imo \n\nHave you ever even thought what nukes mean? I'm starting to think you're just making shit up as you go along without putting any thought behind your responses. No one is going to use nuclear missiles. If you have the power to control a country, your highest priority is to survive. Shooting a nuke just means another nuke is going to drop on your own own head. And no country right now can reliably stop a nuke attack. Nuking someone is both political and actual suicide.",

That was enough to get Britain to pull out of the war.  Having your bonds sold en masse leads to higher interest rates.  So mortgages and auto loans will get even pricier.  \n\n“The government has to find creditors to meet its huge borrowing needs, and it casts a wide net.\n“If that pool of people is just restricted to U.S. households, then the government is gonna have to pay a higher return on that debt in order to be competitive,” said Smetters of Wharton.\nThat would push interest rates higher — including those on home loans. So as long as they stay interested in our debt, Japan and China could be saving you money on your mortgage.”",
