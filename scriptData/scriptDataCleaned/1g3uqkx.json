Open one with ur broker and max it as quick as you can every year and buy just SPY until you have 100k and can throw half on solid blue chips like what you can see happened with NVDA, then do yolo like you see with extra money outside the ROTH. If you were creating a character this would be the body, the most important part. THEN go risky with extra besides the 7k and do plays not too far otm or close to exp, preventing you from losing your year or paycheck day 1, those are for advanced strats with specific plans",
