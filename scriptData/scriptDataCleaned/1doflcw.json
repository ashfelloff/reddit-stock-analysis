  "score": 1083,
  "selftext": "Volkswagen is taking a $1 billion stake in electric vehicle startup Rivian, which has been seeking to cut costs and shore up cash amid slower-than-expected adoption of EVs.\n\nThe companies announced the deal after markets closed Tuesday – two days ahead of an investor event for Rivian, which has been under pressure from Wall Street due to its cash burn and significant losses.\n\nVolkswagen is now the second legacy automaker to take a stake in the California-based company. Ford Motor was among Rivian’s largest stakeholders, at roughly 12%, alongside Amazon when Rivian went public in 2021. The Detroit automaker sold a majority of its Rivian shares by 2023 after walking back a plan to codevelop EVs with the company.\n\nRivian reported a loss of $1.45 billion during the first quarter of this year, as it retooled its plant in Normal, Illinois, to launch updated versions of its R1T pickup and R1S SUV EVs ahead of its next-generation vehicles in 2026.\n\nThe company has been on a cost-cutting mission for months. It has trimmed staff, retooled its Illinois plant to increase efficiencies and paused construction of a new multibillion-dollar factory in Georgia. That last measure is expected to save more than $2.25 billion in capital spending, including the impact of starting production of Rivian’s next-generation R2 vehicle at its plant in Illinois.\n\nRivian reported $7.86 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to end March, with more than $9 billion in total liquidity.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/volkswagen-rivian-stake.html",

They aren’t losing that because of bill of materials of the car. \n\nThey see how much money company loses per year and divide it by number of cars sold. That’s nonsense. So if suddenly Rivian starts a new team to build a new car, and spends $100 million on it this year, the existing cars’ “money lost per car” would go up. That means nothing.\n\nWhen Apple spent billions of R&D of the first iPhones and shipped the first gen, nobody said “Apple loses $400 per iPhone sold” because it was upfront r&d to start a new product line. Same with Rivian and other EV companies. \n\nMost financial “analysts” have no idea how tech companies work and even less have any idea how hardware companies work.\n\nThe thing with hardware is that cost will drop exponentially when scale increases. So it’s well worth spending a fortune on R&D upfront if you can make something people like. Cost will fall off a cliff once you start scaling.\n\nA semiconductor chip if it costs $15 a pop if you buy 20,000 a year. The same chip will cost like $5 if you buy 1,000,000 a year. It will drop to like $2 if you buy 10,000,000 a year. Most people don’t realise how much cost can be saved if you have a good product that people like, once you start scaling.

They can profit from IT, because that’s Volkswagens largest problem right now, especially in theirs VWs, Audis and Porsche, that’s constant news in Germany. \n\nRivian has been going up and down, while all they needed was 3-5bn to build the plant for their second generation. If Volkswagen wants to see this investment thrive they can easily and cheap provide Rivian with industrial expertise as well as the gate to other markets such as Europe\n\nIf all of this doesn’t happen it’s sad, but no one gives a shit because it was like 1-2% of annual investment.",

Much like how GameStop funds their business today. Equity financing during a lucky sale period.\n\nTesla did it because their business is far more vertically integrated and cost cutting was their #1 priority since inception since it was primarily funded by Elon. They had to cost cut to survive so that pretty much became their biggest focus. I've been following EV's for a decade now. Rivian will NOT be profitable any time soon. There's a reason why outside of Tesla, other EV makers have been unable to do so. You think Ford hasn't been trying to be profitable with EV's? That Rivian is somehow capable of doing it by selling premium vehicles with declining and/or stagnant sales?",
