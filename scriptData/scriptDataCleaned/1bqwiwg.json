                      "body": "In addition, LBJ is one of the trickiest Presidents when it comes to quotes since he was notoriously brilliant at playing both sides to come out on top.\n\nFor instance, the 1957 civil rights bill was the first civil rights bill passed since reconstruction and LBJ’s playing both sides was fundamental in its passing.\n\nHe would go speak to those opposed to the bill, often southern Dems (he himself from Texas), and tell them how the civil rights movement is gaining so much steam that something needs to be done. He’d then approach using their way of speaking from the position of someone on their side and say that the bill wouldn’t actually change much but that it would relieve the pressure for a more impactful bill.\n\nAt the same time, he’d be talking to people who wanted the bill to go further and tell them that he understands it doesn’t go far enough but that they needed to get a foot in the door in order to pass more impactful legislation, which he later did.\n\nRobert Caro, inarguably the greatest LBJ biographer and imo one of greatest biographers generally, has an article on the Smithsonian website about the 1957 bill titled LBJ Goes for Broke. I’d link it but I’ve had a lot of Reddit comments auto removed for including links.\n\nIf anyone wants a conversational intro to Caro, Conan O’Brien is a massive fan (I think Caro was his #1 dream guest) and Conan has an interview with Caro up on YouTube.",
