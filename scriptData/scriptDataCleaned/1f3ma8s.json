  "selftext": "Nvidia stock is crazy. Down 7% after hours. Result were extremely strong. But, of course, the expectations that they have to contend with are completely insane. So, they beat the street, but they didn’t beat as much as a company like Nvidia is expected to. Who do they think they are? They beat the expectations but the real expectations were to beat the expectations by more than the expectations. Now it’s going down faster than a Thai hooker on an american tourist. \n\n50b$ in share buybacks? What kind of stingy bullshit is that? It should have been 250b$. Cheap bastards. \n\nAnd the growth is decelerating at an alarming rate, down perhaps 30% quarter over quarter. It should have accelerated. \n\nWorst of all, the most complicated chip ever to exist won’t be ready when they said. Lying shits! \n\nPuts on Nvidia! \n",
