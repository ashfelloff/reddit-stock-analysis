I’ve noticed right at open with volatile openings, the premiums fly with it regardless of it being out of the money, and you can time a good buy/sell with that happening.\n\n\nHappened a while back too when I bought NVDA 1300s I believe back in February and turned 300$ into 1200$ back whenever it spiked after Nancy pelosi announced her buy in/something else happened. I’m a regard and get super lucky at times cause of shit like that.\n\nTo also add, on these two examples they were dated for 3weeks to a month from the week of the earnings data",

These chips are used by all the major networking companies to make data center Ethernet switches, so AVGO is an AI play for multiple reasons. The AI play is already considered in the price of NVDA, but not nearly as much in AVGO.\n\nDELL is an example of an AI affected company that, even though they were doing layoffs and experienced other challenges, the stock rose after earnings. \n\nAVGO and DELL are similar in that they are part of the AI play, weren’t already inflated by the AI hype, and so both will / may rise even more.",
