The dual circulation would maintain economuc stability for US and its Allies.\n\nThat's why we have had the SAAS and AI bubble.  US wanted to move away from petrodollar to semiconductordollar (excess profits from tech recycled back to Treasuries).\n\nHowever, China is accelerating its semiconductor and tech sector and will be self sufficient within 5 years.\n\nQED within 5 years, they will be another global financial crisis as the semiconductor and tech bubbles collapse.\n\nGold is a hedge against a collapse of the post bretton wood system.",
