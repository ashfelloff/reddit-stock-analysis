      "body": "GAP/Banana Republic/Old Navy are coming back because people are moving away from the low quality garbage from Temu/Shein and back toward value--they are realizing they can get exponentially better quality for a fair price. It's becoming apparent because a lot of influencers are focusing on high quality clothing hauls, and which brands are \"worth it\". It's not luxury-focused, and it's not cheap-focused--it's value based. I'm constantly on the fashion/beauty channels, and audiences are eating it up and hungry for more info on value based brands. \n\nMy only concern is that despite the better than expected earnings, the stock market won't reflect this unless more people know about it. GAP is slowly coming back, similar to what happened with Abercrombie.",
