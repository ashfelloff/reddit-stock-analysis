I dont mind holding a tech behemoth for years but for me weedstocks, crypto and other high risk spaces have much shorter cycles and investors never really know where it’s going to end. \n\nEarly in weedstocks I decided to focus on the big players. Early on I had CGC, Aphria, aurora, cronos and canntrust… look where they are now it’s been a massacre. Now if you took the 5 top techstocks five years ago say: apple, amazon, nvidia, microsoft and google… it’s a different story. \n\nFortunately I was taking profit whenever I was in the green and I bought back in 2020, sold most in 2021 for a small profit and bought back in mostly MSOS last summer. I’m not saying im a market genius, I never predicted anything. I got burned on a few plays, I just see clearly when a sector is beaten down, and I also see clearly when I’ve made a lot of profit in a short time, I never push my luck. I also never regret selling early. \n\nI dont think too much of old waves I missed, I look into the ocean of stocks for the next wave to ride.",
