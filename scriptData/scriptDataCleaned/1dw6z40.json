Price - Their P/E is below SP500 P/E and about the lowest its been for ACN in years\n\n3. History - long history of profit growth and increasing dividends every year\n\n4. Technicals - a bullish increase on the options chain started building after recent earnings\n\n5. Hedge funds have strong net inflow right now (they clearly like what they see)\n\n6. No one here is talking about it (yet). Options are cheap.
