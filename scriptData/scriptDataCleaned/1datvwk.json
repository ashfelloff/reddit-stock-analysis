At this point I don't really care about SI, I just think there's value in the long position, and it's kinda funny watching Cramer get triggered every time it jumps. The bull case to me essentially boils down to a bet on the competence of the management to transform the business with the cash pile they've amassed thus far.\n\nThe sheer amount of cringe, soapboxing, butthurt, and tinfoil in that sub is very fucking stupid, there's a new conspiracy or \"decoding\" of some hidden message in someone's cereal bowl every 5 minutes.

I'm not brave enough to throw more than a small amount of my money on the plays since the cycles can break at any time, especially now that I think a lot of the cultists are waking up over how their leaders are the only ones selling and diluting.",
