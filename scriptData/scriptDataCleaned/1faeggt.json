  "score": 45,
  "selftext": "Hey WSB,\n\nSo, I’ve been watching pre-market action like a hawk (from Europe, where it’s at least a reasonable hour), and I’m wondering—does it really give you an edge? I see all these crazy price swings before the bell, but does that mean the stock is more likely to keep moving in that direction during regular hours, or can it totally reverse when volume kicks in?\n\nAs an EU trader, I feel like pre-market is one of the few times the market isn’t completely against me. Any of you legends got tips on how I can maximize my chances of beating the market, even from over here?\n\nHelp a fellow degenerate out! 💸",
