They can barely afford the ARM laptops they put out, and they're losing their main customers, Apple and Samsung. Their revenue is still way lower than Intel's when you use their BEST year of 40B. QCOM is a tiny company by comparison in assets, IP, cash, and revenue.\n\n> None of the companies trying to acquire can run a fab, and neither TSMC or Samsung want Intel's fabs.\n\n> Intel will not sell any part of their main business units.
