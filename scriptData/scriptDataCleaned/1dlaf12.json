Now they don't allow AirBnBs, and the places by the airport where they (also) do(n't) are 200+/night with a tiny footprint, plenty of noise, fees up the ass, and they tell you to sneak in and out so no one catches on to their short term rental.  \n\nIt reminds me of Uber vs taxis - taxis got so greedy an upstart could create a better service easily, causing pressure for taxis to get better, while Uber gets worse and tries to hit profitability.

Americans can be awful but it tends to be in patterns by state.  Floridians, Texans, and New Yorkers were the absolute worst.  He claimed New Mexicans and Coloradans were the best and he loved that folks from those states seemed to always know at least a little Spanish.\n\nThis all aligns with what I observed when I lived in Amsterdam for a few years.  The British tourists were consistently so bad that I learned pretty quickly to just avoid going to bars, clubs, and coffee shops on British bank holidays, Americans were a mixed bag and it did largely depend what state they were from (with NYC tourists being the absolute worst consistently).",

There were laws for landlords, but not for platforms. And the platforms didn't go out of their way to cooperate if there was no legal requirement.\n\n\n\nThus the municipalities had to investigate themselves. That position was extremely weak and it required sending investigators to apartments, ringing the doorbell, hoping there's a tourist there who will testify to staying there as a tourist, and then taking that basis to bring the landlord to court. Barely effective, very resource intensive, and only a tiny fraction of landlords faced such an investigation because of it.\n\n  \nThen laws were introduced requiring Airbnb to have the landlord register with the municipality, then record that registration number on his Airbnb account, and then provide all this data back to the municipality including all records of any stays. Around the same time a rule was implemented limiting airbnb renting to 30 days a year.\n\n  \nThis was super effective because essentially all the data is now with the municipality, Airbnb has to abide by the law, and the municipality can essentially just use a two minute Excel filter to see who is breaking the rules, bring it to court, win and indeed the fines are huge. It works well.\n\n  \nSo it all depends on whether there are local laws enforcing Airbnb to cooperate with sharing full data and implementing a license/registration system on their site. Cities that don't have this aren't effective at combatting enforcing local laws. Cities that do, are effective. Idk for Barcelona.",
