Add in the electrification of the auto industry and this equals more electricity at all levels. Nuclear isn‚Äôt the only answer but it‚Äôs cleaner than Coal and thus the .gov is backing loans to re-start Nuke power plants. \n\nI think the long term demand for Uranium is a safe bet. How to best take advantage of the trend I will leave to this thread to discuss as I am interested in the answer. i.e. buy the commodity or invest in Miners or invest in the energy companies themselves?  I don‚Äôt have the analytical background to weigh those options properly. But I certainly don‚Äôt see a future that I want to live in that doesn‚Äôt include Nuclear as an option.",
