I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.   \n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap.

Yes it can do cool things like solve equations we draw but I'd rather just have my personal information kept private.\n\nThere's already a lot of software that iOS uses that's AI (like the ML that looks through our phone to categorize people/pets) and even I'm personally uncomfortable with that.
