          "body": "I mean, there is always a risk. But the case for the upside is way way stronger. The main reasons prices are so low are that 1) Viceroy published several claims that Medical Properties Trust was engaged in fraud, and 2) their biggest tenant has filed for bankruptcy. Shorts seized those pieces of bad news and drove the price down from $22 all the way to $3 at the lowest. \n\nFirst, no fraud has ever been shown, and in fact MPW has continued to publish audited financials with full transparency. MPW opened a law suit against Viceroy in March 2023 and all discovery so far proves MPW is fully compliant and on the up and up. [Medical Properties Trust Files Lawsuit Against Short-Seller Viceroy](https://medicalpropertiestrust.gcs-web.com/node/15206/pdf)\n\nSecondly, in the last earnings report MPW showed that they can cover the dividend and then some with rents collected even without Steward rents (Steward is their biggest renter). And they have a reasonable path to recover a significant amount from Steward through the sale of their hospitals.\n\nAt this point anyone holding a short position is at a pretty significant risk of losing their shorts. They are paying a high interest rate, not to mention a dividend every quarter. Meanwhile longs are getting paid a dividend AND sitting on a stock that could go 2x, 3x, or even 4x from here. And when the shorts are forced to cover there is a good chance for a big olâ€™ spike.\n\nYou other longs out thereâ€¦ anything I forgot?",
