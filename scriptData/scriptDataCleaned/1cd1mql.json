This is a strong sign they are near their floor, and on top of that Intel has stupid money being pumped into it to compete with companies like TSM. You might not make the bag this year or even next year, but stocking up over the next couple years on Intel is going to 2x-3x your investment before the turn of the decade.... assuming the whole country doesn't collapse but hey your money has no value regardless than. \nNot a bag holder either I only just now bought in off the news of their 100B dollar foundry, I waited until after earnings to buy because anyone should have seen the dip coming. They told us this was gonna happen a month ago.",
