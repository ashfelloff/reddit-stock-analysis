  "title": "Why November fed rate decision is more important than Sept",
  "score": 167,
  "selftext": "Since Sept federal rate decision is already priced into the market and the 0.5% rate cut seems improbable, the major kicker will be the November rate decision. If Fed decides to hold it depending on election results (though Powell keeps saying he is an apolitical decision maker and he pretty much lying there) and the rate are held steady instead of a cut, I expect a deep dip in the market. Hence I have short term calls on SPY that expire September and ling term puts that expire December. \n\nNow you might ask why would fed hold it steady in November - my calc says we have not stabilized inflation and job market will remain strong due to holiday season with seasonal labor increase and extensive spending during the holiday season. There will be no metric that will help Fed lean towards the 0.75% to 1.25% rate cut expected for all of 2024. It will be a debacle. The next rate cut is in 2025 folks. \n\nI would really like to be told why I am wrong. ",

      "body": "Cutting rates by 0.25% at each of the 3 meetings left in 2024 is the most likely outcome in my opinion.\n\n1. This lets them significantly reduce rates relatively quickly without appearing to \"panic\". \n\n2. A Fed rate of 4.25-4.5% is still well above the current inflation rate, so it continues to put downward pressure on inflation.\n\n3. If they have overshot on inflation, and the job market is weakening, 0.75% in cuts by the end of the year is fast enough to probably provide a bit of relief, maybe spark some refinancing activity. If they have not overshot and inflation is still sticky, they won't have cut too far and can probably just pause for a few months. \n\nI think 3 cuts of 0.25% will basically thread the needle perfectly for them.",

          "body": "The whole point of the federal reserve is to allow for the creation of money without causing inflation. \n\nIf the government just printed all the money it wanted to the dollar would be worthless, \" why pay taxes if we can just print money\" has always ended in toilet paper worthless currency.\n\n if the government never created money we would have economic paralysis as people fought over the dollars that were in circulation and the money would go up in value because as we add population to the currency users there would not be enough money for everyone to conduct trade. \n\nIf there was 100 dollars in circulation and only 100 people, it would mean people would have to trade ther goods and services for one of the 100 dollars, but when the population reaches 1000 people and ther was only 100 dollars the dollar would raise in value because people would be fighting to get currency they could easily store or trade instead of the goods they made or labor they sold. \n\nBut if we slowly create more money as we add population we can create money without overvaluing the curancy or devaluing it.\n\nSo the entire job of the fed reserve  board is to create money without causing any inflation , so 0% is the only acceptable amount of inflation and anyone who denies it is a bootlicktard. Inflation is theft of the money you worked for. The real inflation rate is about 20% and they lie so they don't have to increase retirement benefits and saleries for public workers and social security they are obligated to pay. If you only got a 3% raise this year really you took a 17% pay cut.\n\nSo what is wrong with America? Well not only is the government printing too much money but we allow banks to loan money they don't have creating fake money they don't have , you would go to jail for fraud if you did what they did and wrote  and cashed checks and spent money you didn't have when you just planned to write and cash checks  from someone else tommarrow.\n\nAlso no one talks about the fact when the government tells the fed reserve to print money, then taxpayers pay it back with interest, the fed reserve puts the money in their pockets tax free and they are not audited. They don't put the money in a wood chipper, they keep it and use it to bribe politicians, and buy the majority stock in every company, they own every politician and every CEO and board of every company. they are the secret royalty of america, and the first rule they don't talk about how rich they are and never talk about owning the federal reserve.\n\nYou are ther free range tax slave, you want food, housing, medical care, clothes, power, entertainment? Sure work and they get ther cut. Cause all the slaves on the plantation have to pay their masters a cut, even if you leave and go to another country your income is taxable.\n\nThe benefit of printing money should go to taxpayers and be used to make our country better not into the pockets of a private group of bankers.",
