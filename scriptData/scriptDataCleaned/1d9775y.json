Does this indicate anything about the future of investing in the markets? \n\nLess companies to distribute the investment $$ on means possibly more valuations, no?",

They change and economic influences change. Debt, interest rates, income growth, expense growth, labor productivity issues and cost, government legislation, etc. can all impact a companies desirability as an investment beyond earnings per share. As proof, a companies price can change dramatically during a period when the markets are closed to trading. Thus, the price changed during a time of zero supply and demand input.",

If enough of this is happening, then there's a functional shrinking of supply which will drive price up - this rather hilariously happened with gopro back in 2014.\n\nSo the net effect is that price grinds up for a period of time before dumping.
