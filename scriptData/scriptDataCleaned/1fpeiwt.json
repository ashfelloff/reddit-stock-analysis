Who else thinks we are headed for $130 by next week or sooner?  \n--------------------------\n\n# [Nvidia stock edges up as industry report predicts 'unprecedented levels' of investment in AI data centers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-edges-up-as-industry-report-predicts-unprecedented-levels-of-investment-in-ai-data-centers-172648847.html)\n\nNvidia stock ([NVDA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/)) rose more than 2% on Wednesday after an industry report projected \"unprecedented\" levels of investments in artificial intelligence, a bullish sign for the AI chipmaker.\n\nConsulting firm [Bain's annual technology report](https://www.bain.com/insights/ai-changes-big-and-small-computing-tech-report-2024/) published on Wednesday projects that companies will need to make \"unprecedented levels of investment\" in technology infrastructure to stay on top of the artificial intelligence boom.\n\n“If large data centers currently cost between $1 billion and $4 billion, costs for data centers five years from now could be between $10 billion and $25 billion,” the report said.\n\nThe firm's research also states data center operators and hardware suppliers will enjoy a short-term windfall as companies and governments splurge on computing capacity.\n\n\"Nvidia, for example, projected $10 billion in revenue from governments’ sovereign AI investments in 2024, up from zero last year,\" the report said.\n\nOver the past few months, Wall Street has been searching for clues about how long massive infrastructure spending will last and what the return on investments for AI chip buyers will look like.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia stock extended prior session gains after CEO Jansen Huang appeared to have finished selling shares for the time being.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e9988l72m0rd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fbe2c3f8f85a86831e361ff84cd7be8e6ad56b84\n\nOver the past few months, Huang cashed in on roughly $713 million worth of shares [as part of a plan](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ceo-jensen-huang-sells-713m-141338783.html) to sell 6 million shares by March 2025 — a goal he reached earlier than expected.\n\nDespite his stock sale, Huang continues to hold his position as the company's biggest shareholder.\n\nNvidia shares are up roughly 20% since Sept. 6. The stock has gained more than 150% year to date.\n\n[](https://stockstory.org/industry/saas?partner=yahoo&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=sass)",

NPS scores for these support processes are up because customers don't have to wait in queue and can do this in a self-serve manner. Every such call used to cost us 2$, which is money saved. By next year it's expected the CARE team will be cut to 1/3rd. This was unimaginable just a couple of years ago when chatbots were completely useless. If you were doing something routine, like retrieving information, making updates, and responding to queries that can all be handled with an AI agent using RAG models. Said that, for anything intelligent that is off the set pattern, you still need humans.\n\nThere are dozens of developer productivity tools made in-house in my company, although I feel most are dud. I would imagine in some time they will get better.\n\nThe coolest thing I have done so far is chat with an AI agent on Slack, which summarized an entire Slack summary with dozens of participants, explained the problem pattern, and \"recommended a solution pattern\" based on one of the hidden confluence pages. The last part blew me away. I think this whole AI thing is real, and growing.",
