(You can sell it at any time to take profits or exit losses, don't need to wait until time ends)\n\nSo you can pay a small fee,,,,like $1 per contract, and if the stock raises $15 in a day...you make 15x profits from a $15 movement.\n\nEvery option contract is for 100 stocks. So it's always 100x the movement(doesn't matter much for simplification, just 100x all costs and gains).\n\nYou can bet that the stock will go down,,,a Put option, and make profit if it goes down. Or bet it goes up, a Call option.\n\nThe option is Written by someone else, who is making the opposite bet. And they sell it to whoever, on creation. But they are on the hook until the time runs out, so it's extra dangerous.\n\nThe value of an option contains the (time value * the expected volatility)...15 days left is worth more than 2 days left...and if a stock is going +-10% every day(volatile), its worth more too. \n\nEach day you hold the contract, the value decreases(ignoring the value of the stock moving), trying to make money on this decrease is \"Theta Gang\".",
