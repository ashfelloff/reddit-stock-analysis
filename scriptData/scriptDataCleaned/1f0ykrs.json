          "body": "To be fair I would have considered Powell's rate cut speech to have been priced in ever since the recent panic. The market still rose when he announced it.\n\nNVDA is a total wildcard to me. Expectations are sky high but so is growth. I would consider 18% growth on revenue to be the minimum growth possible to send the NVDA up on the 28th because that's what we got in the q1 report. WS forecast is 16% growth from q1, so it's anyone's guess what 16-18% will do to the stock. Anything less will almost definitely sink the stock for the immediate future.\n\nPersonally speaking, it's a massive red flag that the company could have numbers approaching a 20% increase in revenue and earnings and we still don't know what the stock would do. The only certainty for me is that a lot of people are going to be rich on the 28th and a lot of people are going to be broke.",
