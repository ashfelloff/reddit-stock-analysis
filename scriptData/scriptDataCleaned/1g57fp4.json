      "body": "Buffett himself has come out numerous times admitting the flaw in his original indicator. It assumes companies only do business in their home country. In ‚Äò80s this was mostly true. Today, the top 100 US companies do nearly half their business outside America. \n\nFor the Buffett indicator to work as intended you have to normalize the value of the stock market to account for the ever-growing % of business that‚Äôs taking place internationally. When you do that, you find we‚Äôre well within historical ranges.\n\nThere‚Äôs also the 2 other common criticisms that:\n\n1) the indicator doesn‚Äôt take interest rates into account, so obviously it will look skewed when we‚Äôre sitting in periods of historically low rates compared to the 6-10%+ rates we saw throughout the ‚Äò70s - 2000‚Äôs.\n\n2) the indicator looks solely at top line revenue, which of course will skew it upwards as high margin tech companies dominate the market that was once run by low margin auto and oil companies. People will (rightfully) pay a premium to own Microsoft over GM because the balance sheet, margins, and cash flows are all much healthier.",
