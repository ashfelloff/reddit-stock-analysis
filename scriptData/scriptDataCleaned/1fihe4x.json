There's no mystery here. It's common af in the realms of retail trading.\n\nAlso, perhaps you don't have enough life experience. Family and spouses will never understand trading, some will ridicule/criticize you and always see it as another form of gambling even if you show them that you have a system or have been profitable.

The safety margin calculation typically discards the most catastrophic scenarios (statistical extremes), because that would increase the margin requirement to the point of no longer being practical for the investor.
