The one I'm replying to is the one who doesn't understand the difference between share price and market cap.\n\n>It's just unbelievable for it to become like 20% of US GDP you know\n\nThat's not how it works. If the US GDP is 29T and the stock's cap is 3T, that doesn't mean that Nvidia represents 10% of the US GDP. In order for Nvidia to represent 10% of the US GDP, they would have to have 3T **in** **revenue**. A stock's market cap is not equivalent to it's revenue. The market cap is a lot higher. \n\nSo while it is quite unrealistic for one company to represent 20% of the US GDP. That doesn't mean the stock doesn't have room to run. Keep in mind that people all around the world are buying US stocks, not just americans. 5-6T market cap is not impossible.",
