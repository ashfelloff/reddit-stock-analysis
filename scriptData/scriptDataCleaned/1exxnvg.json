  "selftext": "Snowflake (SNOW) is expected to release earnings results for its second quarter today. Right now people are expecting the company to report quarterly earnings at 16 cents per share, down from 22 cents per share in the year-ago period (down 27.3%). Snowflake is projected to report quarterly revenue of $849.7 million. \n\nI've looked at what other analysts have said about the stock, and all the points are summarized below: \n\n* Baird analyst William Power maintained an Outperform rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $165 just yesterday on Aug 20. \n\n* Stifel analyst Brad Reback maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** the price target from $200 to $168 two days ago on Aug 19. \n\n* UBS analyst Karl Keirstead maintained a Neutral rating and **dropped** his price target from $171 to $155 not that long ago, also on Aug 19. \n\n* TD Cowen analyst J. Derrick Wood maintained a Buy rating and **dropped** his price target from $230 to $180, Aug 19. \n\n* Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow maintained an Equal-Weight rating and **dropped** the price target from $191 to $146, same day as above.\n\nSee a trend? These are all analysts with reportedly high accuracy with their price targets (all above 75%). While all these new price targes are above SNOW's current price of 138, it seems like people are not as excited about the company. [Even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway just sold Snowflake stock *today*](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/21/warren-buffetts-berkshire-hathaway-sold-snowflake/). Why is that? They've been invested in them since IPO in 2020. \n\nSNOW has been suffering from challenging macroeconomic conditions, including persistent inflation, which have hurt customer spending patterns. On top of that, GPU-related costs as Snowflake aggressively invests in AI are expected to have kept margins very low. Moreover, stiff competition from the likes of Databricks and increasing pricing pressure. There are also open source options for what SNOW has to provide, from the big cloud providers. SNOW does have a technical advantage, but other cloud providers have caught up. Why pay premium for SNOW if I can just manage my pipelines with another provider that provides better proximity and efficiency? \n\nI've read a lot of bullish stuff tho. Progress in LLM, new offerings, acquisitions, and partnerships. Stuff that longterm investors want to hear about. But you know what I think is going to happen? Expectations are set so low that they'll beat, but the stock will drop anyways. Right now SNOW is up today, giving puts a bit of a discount. I'm gonna grab 8/23 130p @ 5.60 each. This is a bit pricey for an earning play, so it's reasonable to also sell the 8/23 120p @ 2.28. If the stock does drop, it most likely won't drop further than 120. This means you can get the put spread for $332, with a max possible gain of 3x *if* the stock drops about 10% or so. Which is the average move up or down that SNOW has made in the past. Good luck guys!!",
