In the military, the regulations state that computers need to be cycled out every 3/4 years, due to technological growth and security concerns. My state is straight up regarded and purchased batches of its computer authorization in excess of 25%, and then didn't upkeep them on the proper cycle. Eventually, most of the computers in the state could not be on the network because they didn't meet the hardware requirements to hold security software. Over a year I was asking for computers, until I finally initiated a contract myself. My HQ wanted me to expand the contract to get laptops for the brigade (it's the same amount of work, so I just increased the quantity/value of what I was requesting). $1200 a laptop, with software. Not terrible considering. However, once I sent the contract off, my S4 increased the specs of the laptops, and the contract ballooned to $4300 a laptop.    \nWorse, the next year they wanted me to repeat the contract. If I had actually done it, it would have put the new laptops on the same time frame as the first batch I did, meaning they'd all be cycled out together, wasting an entire year of budget.    \n\nWhen I first joined the logistics corps I was told I was a steward of the tax payers money.    \n\nSadly, not every one in government has that mind set.    \n\nSo calls on Boeing.

          "body": "Hopefully I can. I've billed hundreds, maybe even thousands, of engineering hours against programs for designing and certifying soap dispensers for planes.\n\nThe engineering difference is all in the engineering lol. The soap dispenser in your office's kitchen is probably nearly identical in design, materials, and construction to those used on aircraft. There's actually a decent chance the one in your office is \"better\" than on the airplane in every meaningful way. But did a materials engineer review that all the coatings and materials would work with that dispenser installed in your specific office? Did a stress engineer demonstrate to the FAA that the soap dispenser wouldn't throw off the center of mass of that office? A flammability engineer generated a report for all the materials used? Probably not, but they would for the one on a plane.\n\nThen there's the engineering and technician effort for actually manufacturing each dispenser. Anything installed on an airplane is required to be tracked basically from when it was taken from nature until installation, and usually lot tested and stored in special ways along the way. There's a lot of \"commercial off the shelf\" parts on an airplane - you may be alarmed to learn how much literal 3M Scotch Tape is on a plane - and the cost for the qualified version is normally dozens or even a hundred times more expensive than buying it through normal industrial suppliers like McMaster or Uline. Sometimes the very same supplier will sell an identical material with and without \"C of C\" (chain of custody) and the cost difference will be similar. It's just massively expensive to control everything to the standard required for aerospace vs general industry.\n\nI work in certification on planes still (no longer on soap dispensers) and let me tell you, there's even more dumbass examples than \"a fucking soap dispenser\". Every little thing on every single airplane gets evaluated by dozens of different flavors of engineers.",
