I'm not arrogant or ignorant enough to believe that's impossible. History, however, does not support this conclusion. History shows us that every single time asset bubbles are blown up, they return to mean. Nothing shown to me - data, technology, opinions - has made me believe we transcended this economic principle.\n\nI'm in the top 10%. COVID made my net worth skyrocket alongside everyone else's that owned assets. I do not for one second believe it is actual value, sustainable in any fashion or good for the nation or frankly, the world, and hedge myself accordingly. I ask myself, which is more likely? That the Fed and U.S. government printed a bunch of money, handed it out and everything is now awesome? Or is it more likely we were facing an inescapable crisis prior to COVID, COVID assured we could not escape and world leaders all hit the \"oh shit\" button to maintain status quo via ungodly amounts of illusory stimulus?\n\nMy money, and Occam's razor, favors the latter. I don't believe COVID made everyone more wealthy. I believe that is an illusion and one with a time limit and again, I hedge accordingly. I believe there's a massively vested interest in seeing as much money flow into markets from all over the world before the true correction/selloff/crash begins.\n\nHow long will that take? What will be the catalyst? Has technology truly changed the game and the spooky \"algos\" made it so the game is simultaneously unwinnable AND unlosable?\n\nI dunno. Massive hubris required to believe you do. What I do know though is in my entire lifetime, economic principles applied and nothing convinces me now they don't. My take really is that simple - I think the valuations are absurd and the system on borrowed time.\n\nUltimately, it matters little in my day to day because I have more than enough money to do what I want. Zero debt. Plenty of assets for retirement when that day comes.\n\nBut I'm also not dumb enough to believe any of that will save me if we stay on this present path of self destruction via income inequality and erosion of hope for the global population to have a better life. Without hope, humans get angry, fearful and usually violent. Not a great future for any of us if we don't right the ship we all have to sail on together.",

Now, I missed the opportunity of a lifetime to buy a home in 2021.  I had one at the time.  I didn’t need or want another.  I’d been there through the GFC, and never could recapture any gain on that home.  It was a net money drain for a decade plus.  Could have rented much more cheaply, and it would have been better because our HHI stagnated for that same decade.\n\nBut, like a god dam fool, and yeah I’m bitter about this, I sold in late 2021.  Took the gains, cleared the ledger, kept the majority, and I’ve added to it.  But this is all relative, as I owned and sold in a po dunk rural area.  Not that much money at stake one way or the other. \n\nAnyway, I decided, and had some reinforcement from that bubble sub, that buying a home was a bad idea.  I was right: our income dropped way the fuck off in late 2023.  However, if I had been willing to go into the bidding wars and paying above ask to “snag that rate”, the place would have been more affordable than today.\n\nI timed this economy and it bit me in the fucking ass.

I'm not trying to get wishy washy but here goes - fill your life with as many fun experiences as you possibly can and try to forget about net worth and money for a bit. That always helps me to get perspective on the bigger picture - our net worth is not the life we lead, the people we love or what we achieve in this life. It's no measure of a person anymore than their name is. What we do and how it impacts those around us matters far more than any account you hold.\n\nI do hope things improve for you, sorry to hear about the income loss, that genuinely sucks. It's going to be difficult I think for a while yet for the entire nation but until we annihilate each other in a nuclear holocaust, there's always light in the tunnel if you search for it.

After Bear got bailed by JPM in early 2008 my dumbass bought a bunch of Lehman bonds because I thought there was no way in hell the government would be dumb enough to let a huge i-bank collapse due to the deflationary spiral it would create. Wow I missed that one by a mile. \n\nI was at a college football game that weekend when Lehman collapsed and couldn't even have fun because I was so worried about Lehman and when they announced they were pulling the plug that weekend I couldn't sleep for like 3 days because I lost so much money. And it was a loss, not like \"just wait it out and it will come back\" - oh no, once they diluted AIG and killed Lehman I was cooked. I had 1400 shares of AIG that I bought at an average price of about $40. Guh.",
