If they do invade, they want to cause maximum impact to their advisories (US & western allies).\n\nSo by diversifying foundry locations, a Chinese invasion will have a lessened impact, but the negative sentiment towards China will be just as strong.\n\nAnd most importantly. Not all foundries are made equal. If China does invade, TSMC will nuke their Taiwan fabs to reduce the amount of IP China can extract as they try to establish their own foundries.",

They decided to build 5 new nodes in 4 years to ensure a high yield node and surpass TSMC in terms of leading edge. So far all signs point to 18a being that node and they are going big with their Ohio fab. In the next 2-3 years I suspect we will hear that AAPL and NVDA are having Intel manufacture their chips. Additionally, Intel server, desktop, and GPUs will be desirable. There are many catalysts that could get them back on track and beyond.\n\nIt’s a speculative play whether they succeed with those goals.",
