Tank was a real one. He got on the phone with his girl, and had her call my mom, and my mom later told me she wasn't going to answer but 'had a feeling' cuz she could see the area code was a strange one (this was like 10 years ago before every call was spam).\n\nMy mom was able to call the jaila fterward to put some money on my books so I could call her, and I got bailed out, this whole ordeal took place in Jacksonville, FL from a Friday night through Sunday night, so just a weekend. I was done there for work. I ended up getting fired for it and it was a whole bunch of bullshit.\n\nTo end it, I ended up getting a lawyer who had me plea out for a withhold of adjudication? Which is kind of like an Alford plea, I think? I had to admit guilt but I did not end up getting convicted of any crime or felony, so I can still vote and I can still own guns. They counted my weekend in jail as my probation period, and they fined me like $900 in court costs, and my attorney only cost $1750 so all in it cost me my job and $2,650, plus gas to drive from Iowa (home) to FL for court. lol\n\nedit: I was arrested for possession of cocaine which I got from one of the dudes I had trained in a prior training class in a prior trip (my job had sent me down there three times by the time I got arrested lol)\n\n  \nEdit 2: how the fuck am I top 10% commenter wtf",
