  "selftext": "\nAfter countless highs and lows, I'm officially tapping out of the stock market game. 😔 It's been a rollercoaster ride, but the constant stress and the endless learning curve have taken their toll.\n\nI've realized that not every play works out, and sometimes the losses outweigh the gains. It's time for me to step back and refocus my energy elsewhere.\n\nTo all the warriors still fighting the good fight: keep pushing forward, stay smart, and never stop learning. Maybe someday, I'll be back, but for now, it's goodbye.\n\nThanks for the memories, WSB. \n\n---\n\nHang in there, and remember—sometimes knowing when to walk away is the smartest move of all. 🧠💔\n\nAND NEVER EVER PISSED AGAINST THE WIND.",

Also, I've done extensive studies of people who actually break even versus actually make money in the stock market and it generally falls to about 20% of people who actually make even one dollar over a ten-year period of trading.  80% of people see minor fluctuations up and down and end up LOSING money, that's a fact.  I don't know the numbers of \"games of chance\" and casinos, but again, it seems like most people see less losses over a ten-year period of investing when compared to the stock market -- MAINLY BECAUSE they don't keep doing it.
