  "selftext": "I have invested 34k in NVDA shares in July since then I‚Äôm about -1,5%. Made it through the lows in begin of August without selling but now I‚Äôm questioning whether or not to take my losses and play it safe going into earnings. I was minus 30% in begin of August which didn‚Äôt feel great üòÇ I‚Äôm confident that earnings for q2 will be robust given capex spending of megacap tech - however unsure about the guidance for q3 and 2026. How do you see it, what‚Äôs your take on the earnings on 28.08.",
