They re still living in a dream that Intel is almost only x86 CPU manufacturer and fab owner, so they killed every other product that could even in minimal part decrease money coming from selling x86 CPUs.

They finally woke up in 2020 when they saw competition in server space. Up to that point process leadership combined with good enough architecture left the competition in the dust. AMD started to have server CPUs with good enough architecture build on process leadership, that put a big pressure on their margins on server segment. They are turning around since they hired Pat, but they did a second mistake by not moving faster and still keeping dividends. They should have cut dividends back in 2020, invest every cent they had and would have shortened the pain with at least 1-2 years. Now the pain will last until 2026-2027.
