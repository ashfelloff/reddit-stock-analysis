  "selftext": "The bulls are delusional. The fundamental reason why the market has been mostly going straight up in the past year is because the economy, in aggregate, has been doing very well. Data just came out suggesting that this might be coming to an end. This is not just a fart in the wind or a drop because Powell said something with the wrong tone of voice. It's a fundamental catalyst that will actually impact things. If the data is wrong, then sure, we might go up more. However, people that actually manage money will not ignore deteriorating economic data. They will sell stocks in order to try to time the market. If you're dollar cost averaging, then good for you, but the majority of people here (and on wallstreet) are trying to time the markets to speed up the process of making money. And you don't make money by buying a 5% dip after a 40% rally if you believe that a recession might be coming. \n\nPeople have been leveraging like crazy and are going through the 5 stages of grief now that the market went against them. Every time that someone complains that they are down on Nvidia, the most upvoted comment under it is \"don't worry bro, just hold because it will be at $180 in 6 months\". Anecdotally, it seems like everyone's uncle and inheritor of money is all-in on AI. For it to go even higher, someone has to be buying at higher prices. It also has to start making some serious money for the companies who are spending tens of billion of dollars on it. So far, Microsoft and Google are struggling to monetize it relative to the expectations that were being priced in. \n\nWe haven't had a recession since 2008. Covid doesn't count. The fed raised rates and the economy didn't give two shits. If the fed lowers rates, why is the economy magically expected to get better immediately? These are serious concerns and if you think buying the \"dip\" right now is a no-brainer move, then you have no brain. We were at all-time highs 3 weeks ago and deteriorating economic data doesn't flip overnight. Neither do the concerns about it. These last couple of weeks have laid out very important information about what the market as a whole cares about and will rally or crash because of. Lots of people seem to be ignoring this and sticking their head in the sand. Good luck.\n\nEdit: From the hundred or so comments that disagree with me, here's a summary of the sentiment. People think that a deteriorating economy is bullish because the fed will cut rates faster. They think the fed and government will pump money into the economy to keep it going and that's bullish. While I don't disagree with that, I also think that this is a poor argument to buy the dip at nearly an all-time high, especially if you're hoping for quick profits. Stocks will eventually go up simply because the value of the dollar will continue to get inflated away, but you can spend years holding the bag and being in the red. People will try to avoid this and sell their stocks to buy at a lower price later on. If a recession actually occurs, there will be lots of selling soon. Also, I'm not necessarily predicting a recession, I'm making a simple observation of the data and how the market has been reacting to it. For a while, the market has been ignoring bad data and rallying on rate-cut optimism. It is now doing the opposite. This is a very important observation if you want to make predictions.\n\nEdit 2: I've read every comment on this post and it's pretty clear that there is a substantial fear of missing out on the next rally. A lot of people are horrified at the idea of sitting out of the market for a while, let alone going short. This makes me more certain that we've topped out for now and that the upside risk is low. Too many people just NEED to be in the market right now, and they find ways to justify this.",

One of the Fed members even had a presentation at the beginning of the month about how they understand that the labour market is probably going to collapse if they don’t get it right and cut rates at the right time.\n\nThe Fed is 6 months behind its own cutting schedule, at minimum. They expected to have already cut 3 times by 4.3% unemployment. The Fed fucked yup badly here. And 4.3% is before the mass layoffs hit.\n\nTo put this in perspective, at the current linear rate we can expect 4.5% by Sept and near 5.0% in December. However, the Fed thinks that the rate won’t be linear and they could be anywhere between 5.5-6.0% if things rapidly deteriorate. Things rapidly deteriorate due to expectations, similar to inflation. Not cutting sets the expectation that the Fed is not on the ball and people aren’t going to hire other than the essentials if the Fed doesn’t cut meaning the lost jobs are gone.\n\nThere’s a reason that the Vix was up like 50% at one point on Friday",

Now WS is getting impatient and wants to see growth / ROI so market is in a weird spot.

People are starting to be logical/cautious which isnt good for a euphoric market so if it starts to go down we can see big selling. \n\nIve been shorting a bunch of bloated stuff but i close pretty quick because im cautious of rips now. it’s worked well all month but i got wrecked timing it wrong earlier in the year.\n\nI think this month is crucial for bulls to keep this party rolling.

Earnings have already come to show you this and when nvidia does inevitably beat on earnings again and their next quarter guidance looks bullish as hell you’ll hide away in ur bear cave. If AMD earnings went badly then sure go ahead but they didn’t so 🤷🏼‍♂️\n\nMaybe we are in a bubble but the bubble hasn’t bursted and isn’t bursting until the numbers stop adding up.\n\nBut you did point out something that is very true which is it’s healthy for a market to correct after periods of heavy green. But that itself only reinforces bulls bias because the market is now in good health.\n\nNvidia is now close to the price it was at nearly half a year ago but their earnings have been exceeding expectations since that time so in reality as the market currently stands we are growing at a very good steady pace.\n\nIf it was as easy as buying puts when a rate cut is imminent then we’d all be rich but the market moves irrationally as you said.\n\nyou aren’t predicting a recession because you simply can’t. \n\nAll I’ll leave you with is that if bulls are delusional then their delusions seem to be working as being a bear would’ve left you broke.\n\nbears really do like to hibernate",
