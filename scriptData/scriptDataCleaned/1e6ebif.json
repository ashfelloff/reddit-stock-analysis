  "selftext": "AMD is down roughly 15% as of right now. I currently just bought $2000 worth. It's possible it could go down further. However, I think it being down 15% is a good buy-in price. I think it is a better buy/value as of right now compared to Nvidia. This isn't me trashing Nvida still a good a stock just I believe AMD is a better buy as of this moment. Thoughts on this move? I might contribute more but undecided right now.  ",

All it needs to do is beat expectations from either the tech front or sales, and expectations are fairly low at the moment. \n\nRemember long ago when AMD's GPUs were considered trash vs Nvidia for gaming, and its CPUs were discount bin equivalent to Intel? Then from improving their products (but still not becoming the best) and gaining market share the shares became multibaggers. The people trashing AMD now for not being as good as Nvidia on AI applications would have been the same people trashing AMD stock back then telling you it's a terrible buy. Shares and the market are driven by expectations, not just by who does what best. \n\nI already trimmed my Nvidia position a bit a couple of weeks ago, and I've now stuck some into AMD after yesterday's selloff.",

When it comes to GPU’s I believe Nvidia still is better. But I don’t believe we are talking about a massive difference. But their GPUs are very well-priced when compared to NVIDIA. Yes, you can make the argument they are better but typically there is a price difference to make up for that so the value is there. I also much prefer a higher V-Ram in a graphics card over ray tracing. Would it be nice to have both? Of course. But in my opinion if I am going with a AMD CPU I will most likely try to pair it with a AMD graphics card for the “smart access memory”.",

This dangerously obvious outcome is why most people simply let a falling knife drop to the floor. The analogy with the market is that if you try to buy stocks that are in a sharp decline, you are essentially trying to do something stupid, like trying to catch a sharp falling knife with your bare hands.\n\n**Stocks can Become ‘Falling Knives’**\n\nThe term “falling knives” refers to stocks that have a precipitous drop in value, and in most instances such a sharp decline will likely continue, even if these stocks seem tempting to buy.\n\nStocks receive this moniker because they can cause real damage to an investment portfolio, if an investor continues to pour money into them during their ongoing decline, hoping for their recovery.\n\n**Doubling Up on Falling Stocks**\n\nAn all-too-common investment mistake is buying stocks because they have fallen a lot in value. After all, if a stock recently hit an all-time high of $100 per share and it is now trading at $60, it seems destined to return to that high price, doesn’t it?\n\nThe truth can be hard to hear. Just because a stock has hit a price at some point in the past is no guarantee that it will ever reach those lofty levels again. Many investors have wreaked havoc on their portfolios trying to chase these types of “falling knives” by doubling up their investment, as a stock continues to go down, down, and down some more.\n\nWhile it’s true that the market as a whole has always eventually gone on to make new highs after selling off, there are plenty of stocks that will never see their all-time high again. Never, ever buy a stock simply because “it is down so much that it now seems like a bargain.”\n\n ",
