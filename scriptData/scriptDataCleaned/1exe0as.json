We've had several de-risking events but c'mon... it went from $2.20 to nearly $40 in a little over 3 months. I get the previous ATH was $12-13 but c'mon.\n\nAll these regards buying Call Options that expire in a few months... good luck.\n\nI'm actually annoyed that you WSB regards pumped this up so much. The original plan was to hold until 2030 ffs. Unless you're buying at these prices with the understanding that you'll have to wait years upon years for it to potentially bloom, you're probably fucked... and this is r/wallstreetbets, isn't even 1-2 years like 50 years here?",

I own and operate a small to mid-sized construction business, and work with some of the biggest contractors in the country, and I don't think any of us from the ground floor to the CEO could foresee even more than 2 years out. Changes happen monthly, expectations get adjusted monthly too. I imagine the turbulence of wading past regulatory hurdles, literal rocket launches albeit by a company with a 99% launch success rate, concerns re: scalability of the technology to potentially billions, misgauging the potential market despite exposure to billions via their MNO partners, etc... are all at least concerns.\n\nMy friend who introduced me to the stock has nearly 50K shares and he still plans on holding all of it, and even he acknowledges all of the above concerns. He's actually advised our friend group with less than 5000 shares to potentially sell a majority of their positions as of yesterday. If you think this is just FUD, maybe it's a sign you're too emotionally invested in it; I fully acknowledge I could be wrong. He's someone who reads all of the DD's, news, read the nearly 200 pg. KOOK report several times, etc... and we've spent hours upon hours discussing them. I know just about all of the counterarguments and I sided with it but there's a price point where I have to at least divest a portion. Also, he's a high income professional, so losing potentially the whole bag isn't a life changing event for him, and he fully acknowledges this is a binary play.\n\nRisk benefit analysis friendo.",

All the major concerns re: operational solvency that \"we\" including you over at r/ASTSpaceMobile probably had over the past 2-3 years along with questioning Abel's leadership has now been somewhat solved.\n\nThe AT&T announcement is when the shares started surging in price too. I expected a major price increase but this is straight up parabolic. I'm hoping for a re-entry point later but if it keeps on rising, I at least still have over 3000 shares so I at least get some of the positive exposure. \n\nBrother, I have a Spacemob hoodie although the quality sucks ass which I'm sure you also know being a member of r/ASTSpaceMobile.

My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.\n\nThat is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
