They are very focused on  expanding their developer platform to compete with cloud providers expanding their reach beyond their traditional DNS, DDOS protection, and CDN offerings.\n\nIn the last few years they have built products including a key value store, a hosting service, a database, and an object storage service - products that are more in the vein of a cloud provider like AWS/GCP/Azure. They are continuing to invest in these and additional capabilities while focusing on keeping costs low for their clients as a competitive advantage.\n\nIt's going to take them some more time to build more of these products to be truly competitive with the big cloud providers but they are already competitive with the medium sized ones so I think its a great long term hold.",
