I was up to 75k in 2021, then I lost a decent amount on a SPAC play. I didn’t even know what IWM was and I didn’t notice IWM was already free falling even before the SPY crashed in 2022. Had I been as knowledgeable as I am now my down trend never would have happened. \n\nAnyway I ended up taking most of 2022 off and I got into software engineering. I actually self taught myself and then got a job within 9 months which is crazy. Then the tech recession started and I got back into trading. I started watching a lot of YouTube and I learned a lot specifically from Cem Karsan. \n\nI started trading SPY at the end of 2022. I did pretty well but didn’t trade much. Between 2022/2023 I made about 15k. Then this year I really got focused and that’s how I put together the risk to make another 31k. \n\nSo ya. That’s my story. \n\nI’m a 🌈🐻 btw. I trade down trends mainly.",

                          "body": "Just depends really. I’m a pretty emotional trader at times so I’d say my tendency is to scalp. I had a good run last week but I ended the week on a low note. Had that not happened I would have had more confidence today to let my position run. Instead I opted for a scalp. I heavily regret that as today was an obvious downtrend day. Similarly, back in April I faced a day just like today and let my position ride until EOD and made a lot more money. \n\nOverall, I’d say I don’t like holding positions overnight. My aim is to wait for clear down trend days. And I go in 100% of capital almost every time I open a position. I’m a firm believer in win big / lose big. \n\nI do occasionally play earnings but only with leaps. I’ve made a bit of money shorting both carvana and Snapchat. However, when I do open short on individual stocks I always make sure the overall market is overbought because I like to give myself the best odds when I short something.",
