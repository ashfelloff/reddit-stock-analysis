  "title": "If September is historically a bad month for stocks, is there anything stopping people from selling their stocks just for September?",
  "score": 324,
  "selftext": "I haven't paid attention to economics until very recently, so apologies in advance if this is a fairly simple question.\n\nAs someone who just started learning about investing ands stocks, I came across many people saying that \"September is the worst month for stocks\". So this got me wondering: if we know that September has had a bad history for a long time, what stops people from just selling all(or at least most of) their stocks for the month and buying them back towards the end of the month?\n\nThe possibilities that I thought of were:\n\n1. It doesn't matter for long term investors (wouldn't it be better to keep your number as it is than to have it drop a few %?)\n2. The past is not an indicator of the future (even though that does seem to be a strong trend?)\n3. You may miss out on a possible positive return (I think this relates to the issue of \"trying to time the market\" which I would find valid for long term investors.)\n\nAre there any other reasons for this, such as taxes or other complicated issues I am not aware of?\n\n  \nEdit: I didn't expect so many responses, but I read all of them and they were very helpful in answering my curiosity. It was interesting to learn a little bit more about investing, and it seems like there's still so much more for me to learn. Thank you all for the kind responses!",

The move doesn’t even have to be correctly obvious, just identifying that something will be “obvious” before others means making money.\n\nYour 100 shares won’t create price action the same way someone’s 10,000,000 shares will, so you need to identify what’s obvious before they do. Remember, it’s their job so they have more time, training, and experience than you do. Oh also, everyone has egos and makes mistakes so being “right” doesn’t really matter either. To make money, you need to identify what they will think is obvious to everyone else before they identify it.\n\nThat’s why it’s a casino.

Will it be October 1? Or October 15, or October 31? etc.\n\n[Taking 2023, for example, the S&P500](https://www.google.com/search?q=sp500+ticker&oq=sp500+ticker&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDUwMzNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) took a dip from September 1 and kept declining until October 27 (the trough), and didn't return to Sept 1 levels until roughly November 16. Even if you had correctly timed the downturn by selling out on, say, the last trading day of August 2023, how and when would you have known that October 27 was the bottom?\n\nAnd you would have missed the recovery if you stayed out of the market from October until mid-November, only a few weeks of time.\n\nDoesn't this mean that both September AND October are a bad time for stocks? Well, you can find data to support that in recent years, but not necessarily for every year over the past decade.\n\nSo, you can try market timing, and maybe you'll get it right, but most people get it wrong in the long term (that is, year after year over a decade or more). So, it's easier for most to not play the market timing game, and just stay in the market.\n\nThe cliches are cliches for a reason:  success is based on time in the market, not timing the market.",
