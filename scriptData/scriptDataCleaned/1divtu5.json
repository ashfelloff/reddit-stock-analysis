  "title": "Nvidia passes Microsoft in market cap to become most valuable public company ",
  "score": 2031,
  "selftext": "Nvidia, long known in the niche gaming community for its graphics chips, is now the most valuable public company in the world.\n\nShares of the chipmaker climbed 3.2% in mid-day trading on Tuesday, lifting the company’s market cap to $3.33 trillion, surpassing Microsoft. Earlier this month, Nvidia hit a $3 trillion market cap for the first time, and passed Apple.\n\nNvidia shares are up more than 170% so far this year, and took a leg higher after the company reported first-quarter earnings in May. The stock has multiplied by more than nine-fold since the end of 2022, a rise that’s coincided with the emergence of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nNvidia has about 80% of the market for AI chips used in data centers, a business that’s ballooned as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and others have raced to snap up the processors needed to build AI models and run increasingly large workloads.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, revenue in Nvidia’s data center business rose 427% from a year earlier to $22.6 billion, accounting for about 86% of the company’s total sales.\n\nFounded in 1991, Nvidia spent its first few decades primarily as a hardware company that sold chips for gamers to run 3D titles. It’s also dabbled in cryptocurrency mining chips and cloud gaming subscriptions.\n\nBut over the past two years, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed as Wall Street came to recognize the company’s technology as the engine behind an explosion in AI that shows no signs of slowing. The rally has lifted co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth to more than $117 billion, making him the 11th wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up about 20% so far this year. The software giant has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, after it took a significant stake in OpenAI and integrated the startup’s AI models into its most important products, including Office and Windows. Microsoft is one of the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for its Azure cloud service. The company just released a new generation of laptops that are designed to run its AI models, called Copilot+.\n\nNvidia is a newcomer to the title of most valuable U.S. company. For the past few years, Apple and Microsoft have been trading the title.\n\nNvidia’s ascent has been so rapid that the company has yet to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a benchmark of 30 stocks that’s historically included the most valuable U.S. companies. Alongside its earnings release last month, Nvidia announced a 10-for-1 stock split, which went into effect on Jan. 7.\n\nThe split gives Nvidia a better shot at being added to the Dow, which is a price-weighted index, meaning that companies with higher stock prices — rather than market caps — have outsized influence on the benchmark.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/18/nvidia-passes-microsoft-in-market-cap-is-most-valuable-public-company.html",

The internet was revolutionary.\n\n...And they all still had stock market bubbles associated with them.\n\nAnd none of them added trillions of dollars in market cap to companies (except for the internet post-2018 when AAPL/MSFT/GOOG/AMZN each crossed $1 trillion, but that was 20 years after the initial 1998-2000 internet hype bubble crashed).\n\nApple became the first company to hit $1 trillion in 2018 IIRC - after hundreds of years we finally got our first $1 trillion market cap company.

We are seeing insane hype and growth on a sector most people don’t even understand, and yet those same people are dumping money into it.\n\nI’ve definitely enjoyed the gains; I work in tech as well and use AI tools everyday, but my biggest concern is the monetization of these AI tools and features. Has any company other than NVIDIA really made money on these things outside of market cap increases? It’s all very speculative still, and while I think the value and potential is there, it’s definitely priced in and more at this point.\n\nEdit: as an add on, I’ve done a lot of research into what NVIDIA and other related companies do. I also work close to the semi industry. The amount of people I know who are investing in NVIDIA and talking about it nonstop don’t even know the difference between a GPU and a CPU. In fact, they don’t even know what a GPU is at all. They just think NVIDIA = AI which has been fine so far, but it’s a little scary IMO.",

That was the time to buy Nvidia. \n\nI'd say up through 2022, the only people that really knew about AI were tech workers that keep up with the news.\n\n2023 is when most people found out about AI, when ChatGPT provided a use case that appeals to the average consumer, and generative AI like StableDiffusion started flooded social media with AI generated content. You'd have to live under a rock to not know what AI is.\n\nThat's also when tons of companies decided that chasing AI at any cost is the business strategy.\n\nThe thing about AI, is at Nvidia's current pricing for AI chips, it's not profitable(for their customers) nor does it save companies money. Companies are only paying it because they're afraid of being left behind, so they pay it as a cost of R&D.\n\nFor AI to really take off, prices on AI chips will have to go down to make them feasible to deploy at scale. This would mean margin compression, and consequently, lower earnings.\n\nThe bigger risk is as a lot of these AI startups run out of investor money, a lot of that secondhand hardware will hit the market(or be available for lease onthe cloud), and it will pressure Nvidia's sales volume.\n\nSo I don't think its bullish for Nvidia long term. People forget  that hardware is cyclical. The best tech companies like Microsoft make money from recurring costs like software licensing. Nvidia makes their money from selling AI chips at insane markups.",

That's the equivalent of your NVDA returns going from up 500% to up 600%(Obviously I don't know what your actual NVDA returns are). If your new investment goes up 100% then that's the same as an 1,000% return from your initial investment. But people get so caught up in seeing large numbers on returns they don't understand compounding returns over multiple investments. I sold shares of AAPL that were around +800% in 2022 to buy shares of META that were way down. Those shares have now gone up an average of 200+%, many of the shares are up 300% to 400%. (Not exactly sure how to allocate which META shares to which money source) but that's an average 1,600% return on my initial investments from 11 years ago.

The other part is in AI training, where companies like OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft etc will just port their shitty pytorch models to run on something else rather than pay 10s of billions to line Nvidias pockets.\n\nLarge chip makers and tech companies will eventually not want to pay the Nvidia tax and will cleanroom reverse engineer the CUDA API similar to what happened with IBM.",
