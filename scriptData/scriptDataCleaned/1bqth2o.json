  "selftext": "Too many lil dipshits telling me I'm crazy for having this theory, so I took the time to break it down for those mongoloids.\n\nWe do not see the PCE report for the prior month until the end of the current month. On March 29, we only just now see February's PCE, but it is the end of March, and that subsequent report will already be just about finished. Institutions get to see those numbers weeks before us.\n\nHere's your proof:\n\nFrom July 28, 2023 through October 27, 2023, SPY dropped -$40.\n\nFrom June 1, 2023 through September 30, 2023, PCE stopped declining and ramped up hot at 3.198% to 3.37% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))\n\nKeep those dates in mind, and follow along with daddy:\n\nFrom May 2023 through June 2023, PCE DROPPED 3.96% to 3.19%. The June DROPPED PCE rate would have released to the public on July 28, 2023. This is precisely when SPY began bleeding out. At that time the bleeding began, it would have looked to Retail as though PCE was still cooling. However, at the time June PCE was being released to the public, July data was already in existence, and the July data was going to show that PCE was no longer cooling, and in fact was rising again.\n\nYou still with me? Let's fast-forward to the most recent climb, which began on October 26, 2023, which has preceded this most recent vertical line up.\n\nOn October 27, 2023, Retail was just getting the released September PCE readings. ([https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/releases/calendar?rid=323&ve=2019-12-31&view=week&vs=2019-01-01))\n\nAs you may recall, September's PCE readings were STILL GOING UP. On October 27, 2023, the public would still be seeing a rise in PCE. However, weirdly, the market began shooting up.\n\nGuess why...\n\nBecause the October data showed PCE significantly cooled from 3.37% to 2.95% ([https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/pce-price-index-annual-change))\n\nWeirdly, this cooling data from October was not available to the public until November 30, 2023, at which point SPY had already rebounded from $410 to $450.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's all. This isn't a conspiracy you clowns, this is real.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTl;dr, SPY price movements correlate perfectly with UNRELEASED PCE data, and contradicts the released data.\n\n&#x200B;",
