  "selftext": "Taking a look at current subscriber base of HIMS -  which is about 1.6MM \n\nFor a hypo - letâ€™s say 10% of their sub base decides to go on GLPâ€™s \n\nSo we have 160k using GLPâ€™s via HIMS at 1.99 a month. \n\n1.99 X 12 X 160000 = 380MM \n\nThis does not factor in new subscribers coming into HIMS and signing up for GLPâ€™s\n( who knows what that number might be ) \n\nThis also does not factor in new subscribers choosing other products like dick pills or hair loss and seeing HIMS as a one stop shop for bone dogs, losing some weight and getting some hair - \n\nCurrently HIMS forecasted to do about 1.2BB for 2024 and be in the black a couple hundred million \n\nIf they come out and say the growth rate is even at this level how does this stock not go parabolic ? Do we really think at that point HIMS continues to trade at 3x sales give or take ?\n\nThere are over 100MM people who are obese in the USA ( thatâ€™s probably on the light side ) \n\nSo we are basically asking for less than .2% of 1% of obese people in the USA to sign up for a product that is 80% cheaper than WEGOVY  ? \n\nI believe we are going to see some seriously explosive numbers that take this stock parabolic.  This name is mispriced for maybe the CEO and his comments , that short report, people saying there is no Moat and all that. \n\nBut when you blow your numbers out and show that type of bottom line growth that all gets thrown out \n\nThis is my favorite 2nd half of year stock play \nDYOR and Happy 4th !!\nLord Black ",

Maybe they do 1.3-1.5 billion in 2024 but it's hard to calculate right now. 1.9-2.1 billion in 2025 is my guess. \n\nAlso the glp shortage might end by 2026 and this could stagnate their growth. \n\nThe net income estimates are too low and also hard to calculate, but they spent alot on marketing this quarter (they made a glp1 add on YouTube and are buying millions of views) and I bet they beat by alot in the November er report. They did this last year if you listen to the earnings call in q2-q3.\n\nAlso another catalyst is jan 1st (new year new me) weight loss subscribers will be explosive. They will market heavily and if you look at the Google trends around that time for anything relating to diets, weight loss, or health it's always high.",

The tricky part is how many new subscribers this quarter. My estimates land in between 150k-350k, but it's impossible to know and I'll have a better estimate for the next quarter. \n\n\nIf they add 10k GLP subs at $1000, that's  an extra 10 million in revenue. They could even do and extra 20 million.\n\n And they could do this every month, which I think is a fair estimate of adding 30k-50k GLP subs a quarter on their usual 100k subs.",

It could go further if they assure investors they will be able to sell GLP 1 for a long time. If you look at Andrew Dudum's twitter, he retweeted an article saying HIMS has a long future selling off brand Ozempic.\n\nThis leads me to believe they know they can sell Semaglutide and it won't be off the shortage list any time soon, and it was literally one hedge fund that thought they were selling Eli Lilly products that sold off.\n\n  \nOne last tidbit for earnings is to keep an eye on marketing spend and EPS. On one hand, they seemed to spend alot on marketing this quarter. They made and paid for 12 million views worth of ads for their GLP 1 commercial on Youtube.  Marketing is usually 50% of revenue. But revenue accelerated at the end of the quarter, and GLP 1 seemed to blow past their expectations because alot of people are complaining about shipping times. So what if they have a blow out quarter of say 350 M, and marketing was only 150 M (50% of guidance). Then the marketing is only 43% of revenue, and EPS would blow past expectations.",
