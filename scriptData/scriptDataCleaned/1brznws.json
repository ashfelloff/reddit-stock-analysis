  "selftext": "Daily queries growth of 63% and 131% Net Revenue Retention (NRR) at the low end of the (non AI) cycle show just how much they sandbagged guidance of 22%. Both lead to future revenue growth. For comparison, they just achieved 36% annual revenue growth with daily queries growth of 73% and 158% NRR as the cycle was trending down. Now the cycle is about to trend up. I'd be surprised if revenue growth is lower than 27% this year.\n\nThe new CEO Sridhar Ramasway is better than Slootman in every way. Slootman was a has-been-MBA-suit cashing in on his cachet like John Chen at BlackBerry. Took extreme stock based comp for himself and kept selling shares nonstop, while not keeping up with industry competition. Tech expertise is essential for tech CEOs to lead their companies to a monopolistic outcome. Research on the economics of tires (Slootman), not so much.\n\nThe company is about to become relevant in the AI space due to this change in leadership. And web services companies are probably the biggest long term beneficiaries of AI. They have better economics (network, scale, incremental capital requirements). The new CEO expects several new product launches this year and he delivered one [yesterday](https://www.snowflake.com/blog/unlock-insights-with-snowflake-data-clean-rooms/). That's impressive after a little over one month on the job.\n\nBy now everyone knows the CEO bought $5m worth of shares as part of his compensation contract this week. However, what's actually more interesting is Mark D. McLaughlin bought $501k worth of stock above $165 this month without being required to do so as part of any agreement. He similarly added $300k early last year at a higher price. He's a director of Snowflake and Palo Alto Networks, and Chairman of Qualcomm. Definitely the kind of guy who has his finger on the pulse of the tech scene. So if he's buying more this year than last year at the same price, he is more confident in the company's future now.\n\nFor all the programmers who argue that Snowflake is overpriced vs Redshift, Synapse, etc. and how it is far behind Databricks, please read:\n\n1. [This technical merit comparison on Snowflake vs Databricks](https://twitter.com/convequity/status/1773722517330653337?s=19/).\n2. [This comment about Snowflake vs Synapse](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/11ybe2d/comment/jd78ksl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3/)\n3. [This comment from a couple years ago about how pros misused Snowflake and ended up spending too much](https://www.reddit.com/r/SQLServer/comments/ww2zbc/comment/ilk2aq7/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3/). My guess is that part of the decline in Net Revenue Retention and Revenue growth rates are partially due to this factor - people optimizing their use of the product for its true intent. The optimized processes still run on Snowflake after all. And there is more data and activity on Snowflake now. Most revenue is optimized, so the impact of that optimization wave on NRR diminishes. NRR rises again and converts $5.2 billion Remaining Purchase Obligations to revenue faster.\n4. Redshift is a dumpster fire according to many sources. [Like this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/12mw1yy/redshift_vs_snowflake//)\n\nThese factors mean Snowflake growth will start to reaccelerate this year. The non-AI tech cycle is about to reaccelerate naturally. Snowflake is about to become more product innovation oriented. That  product innovation will turn its sails to catch the AI wind. They were misunderstood by customers. So they experienced less rapid growth as a result of those customers figuring out how to use the service more effectively. The changes the company made to better compete with Databricks are effective whereas Databricks' attempt to copy Snowflake are nascent in comparison. As more people begin to understand this setup, Snowflake will go back over $400 by next year. Therefore, Snowflake selloff seems like it is a temporary accident.\n\nPosition: 142 x $165c 4/19 exp (check profile for proof post).\n\nEdit: I also found this update on the AI work at $snow from one of its top engineers:\nhttps://twitter.com/rajhans_samdani/status/1770903641630863646?s=19\n\nImpressive that they beat gpt-4 by a good margin when combined with Mistral. And they surpassed everyone but gpt-4 as a standalone.\n\nAlso here's a total cost of ownership post on Databricks vs Snowflake:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/u/moazzam0/s/DDDNMXDKKo\n\nSnowflake AI head pointed out that Databricks cherry picked outdated metrics from 2019 to measure their model's performance. Seems desperate. Must be feeling the heat from Snowflake:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/vivek7ue/status/1774172134732181732?s=19",

I’m finding it pretty amusing how bad succession planning in general has been the last few years.  Disney botching Chapek now seems more like the norm than an outlier.  An ex-Googler - Google being the company who seems a step behind and playing catch up on AI (not necessarily my belief but that’s how it’s being portrayed in market) - is now having to play catch up on Snowflake, makes for a really BAD PR story (warranted or not, it’s still bad that it exists).  I think Snowflake did it all in one shot with the announcement though given they knew the stock was going to get punished one way or the other on the ER.\n\nNow your technical arguments make sense BUT in large scale organizations you’re not accounting for how Snowflake is procured.  Redshift and Databricks have lower barriers to entry given their native access through AWS and Azure respectively.  Better technology be damned if you need to involve procurement and finance to get involved with getting a new product.  For both Redshift and Databricks, I can just spin up resources on my pre-existing agreements that have been blessed and go to town.  When you get Snowflake, you’re having to get your procurement and CFO to understand their credit system, look at an agreement with legal, get paperwork signed, allocate funding and budget, and then hopefully if everyone is in a good mood, get things signed in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe real issue for them is going to be the barrier to entry given the extra work to even get into a company. It’s not just readily available. I’ve worked on multiple Snowflake deals and while the technical people want the product, it’s back and forth with Finance to make sure everything is right that causes all the frustration and the technical people just giving up to using something with less onboarding friction.\n\nSnowflake’s push into the data market business is probably the biggest growth potential for them.  Their ability to be an agnostic data mart would streamline a lot of work and help smaller businesses from having to deploy expensive multicloud landing zones just for data connectivity. Given how much orgs can spend on data, if they can figure out how to reasonably monetize this and streamline it for technical use, they could create a very wide moat.",

AWS is the only competitor with a strong chance, but they’ll need to rework a lot of Redshift’s fundamental perception in the market to do so.

Alternatively if I chose the smallest warehouse possible, I would pay significantly less and my workload may even finish in the same amount of time.  This doesn't scale linearly generally though so basic recommendation is always to pick the smallest warehouse and see what your run times look like against your desired SLA... And scale the warehouse accordingly.",

There's also cosmos which is an Airflow operator for dbt that takes your dbt DAG and integrates it into your Airflow DAG.  You can also just trigger your dbt cloud job/runner from Airflow via API as well.\n\nHowever, if all you care about is orchestrating your transformations (separate of ingestion) then dbt is a great solution.\n\nI would argue in your situation Snowflake would be better for your use case as you could just provide the data to them via a share instead of having to do write back.  Less compute, networking, and faster data availability for your consumers.  That being said, then you need an ingestion mechanism into Snowflake.  There's ways to do this via UDF with external networking or just use Lambdas/Glue/whatever (assuming AWS)",

It’s a platform for buying ads, you don’t really need a sales team to lock in enterprise contracts and customer success teams to manage health of accounts.  Customers just go online and buy ads, and mostly on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n2. The product the customers are buying (impressions and clicks) is a commodity… It’s not something that requires getting feature requests and customer interviews to product manage.  Customers just care about advertising ROI (impressions —> clicks —> sales per dollar), and that’s the main driver of spend.\n\nI could be wrong.
