And for flight safety you can’t really buy any planes second hand and you need new planes for as long as we will fly. Which is for as long as we want a damn global economy of goods and passengers traveling the world. People are ignorant. Do you believe we will invent a teleporter for goods and vacations? If they do they believe in something impossible. Airplanes have transformed the global economy but people have an irrational fear of flying. Or just go back to boats and trains and se how that works?? The thing is that we are so irrational around flight incidents. Even when flying was more dangerous we weren’t this spoiled 100 years ago that we complained every time a plane went down which was often back then. Nowadays there are billions of flight hours per incident and people still make it out to be outrageous? \n\nOf course there should be a high standard for flight because a plane going down is certain death but still nobody complains about a 40 year old car killing a person, or loose bolts from new cars. There is no commission to investigate every car accident, it is just chalked up to human error. Which is also still what most investigations conclude even for flight accidents. \n\nDo people seriously believe there will ever be a zero death count from airplanes? \n\nHow is it that guns, tobacco or even medicinal drugs has nowhere near the policing or scrutiny by the public that airplane makers do? When the other industries have killed a cumulative / combined billions of people over hundreds of years and airplanes a fraction even if you count all deaths of commercial airplanes together? \n\nIt is simply spectacular news and people fear the fuck out of it",

Then you have Brazilian embraer and they simply don’t have the muscle to step in. \n\nHow easy do you think it is to build commercial airplane? You should educate yourself and watch any documentary about it on say discovery or similar. \n\nThe only two companies able to build it are Boeing and Airbus, which both build plenty of their bodies at Spirit, which split from Boeing 2005 and spirit is the company where most things have gone wrong in company culture, which is why Boeing is bidding to take back the company again to get better future quality control.\n\nThe problem here is that the demand is so massive that these two manufacturers have not even been close to produce enough airplanes fast enough which makes the damn backlogs enormous. And while they have tried to put even more pressure on their production lines and specifically the company spirit things have gone to shit. Thus the fall from grace.

More people literally die from tripping on a walk than flying!\n\nHow is it that planemakers could have stock growth when accidents were many times more common? \n\nIs the answer possibly internet, social media and stupidity? Zero tolerance the better things have become is ludicrous but a fact of life nowadays. \n\nPeople died to invent planes, to be pioneers and open the world to us getting anywhere in the world within a day, now it is a scandal each time something in a huge and complex process have gone wrong. The risk in the early 20th century was much much higher and now it’s probably as small as it ever will be because it will never be 0.\n\nYes the last thing you do can be stepping on a plane but entirely more likely it’s something mundane that does you in.\n\nReally the question why it’s not lower is stupid, planemakers can’t even keep up with demand!
