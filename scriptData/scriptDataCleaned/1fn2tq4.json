  "selftext": "This post is going to highlight the reasons I believe PLTR has the potential to keep its current momentum by focusing on some financials. I've been watching this company for a few years now and they continue to impress me. I know a lot of people will say the buy opportunity has passed given the stock is up 165.71% the past year, but I think you're incredibly wrong.\n\nBefore we get started, here is my position.\n\n[Yahoo Finance Portfolio Tracker](https://preview.redd.it/oy4ixcbrweqd1.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fda51980201096fffe0bc1a6475bb8bca39f34f)\n\nFirstly, we are going to view some financials from 12/31/2020 - 12/31/2023. Then we will dive into the two most recent quarters.\n\n**Income Statement** - (All numbers in millions) Year Ending 12/31\n\n**2020           2021          2022         2023**\n\nRevenue - $1,092.67 , $1,541.88 , $1,905.87 , $2,225.01\n\nCost of Rev. - $352.55 , $339.40 , $408.54 , $431.11\n\nGross Profit - $740.13 , $1,202.49 , $1,479.32 , $1,793.91\n\nNet Income - $(1,166.39) , $(520.38) , $(373.71) , $209.83\n\nTo summarize the income statement data in a chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1ui7ytao3fqd1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=52bac253bc37c9f7ed0910ad2cc736ff4e5c488a\n\nFor the income statement, I'd like to highlight the growth in revenue and gross profit compared to cost of revenue for all 4 years.\n\n**Balance Sheet -** (All numbers in millions)\n\n**2020            2021         2022          2023**\n\nTotal CA -      $2,257.43 , $2,863.26 , $3,041.58 , $4,138.62\n\nTotal LTA -     $433.08 ,   $384.20 ,     $419.67 ,     $383.81\n\nTotal Assets - $2,690.51 , $3,247.46 , $3,461.25 , $4,522.43\n\nTotal CL -       $603.82 , $660.07 , $587.94 , $746.02\n\nTotal LTL -      $564.13 , $296.36 , $230.87 , $215.44\n\nTotal Liab. -    $1,167.95 , $956.43 , $818.81, $961.46\n\n(I apologize for the messy data. Could not get excel tables to copy on reddit properly.)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n4tzb59t3fqd1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc55504810a7a695cc52d996e950d81cd10473d9\n\nPLTR has a very healthy balance sheet. Total Asset growth on an annual basis, AVERAGES 16.52% growth compared to Total Liabilities.\n\nThe most recent quarters have been awesome for Palantir. Now we will take a look at them and go over some key points.\n\n**Q1 2024:**\n\n* GAAP Net Income of $106 million representing a 17% margin. (6th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability).\n* Revenue growth of **21% YoY**, 4% QoQ of $634 million.\n* US commercial revenue grew **40% YoY**, 14% QoQ to $150 million.\n* US commercial customer count grew **69% YoY**, 19% QoQ to 262 customers.\n* Total commercial revenue grew **27% YoY**, 5% QoQ to $299 million.\n* Total government revenue grew 16% YoY and 3% QoQ to $335 million.\n\nThe commercial growth in my opinion has been the biggest catalyst for Palantir. There has always been a big question if they will be able to expand their operations outside of government contracts, well they sure can. I believe this is mainly due to AIP bootcamps that Palantir introduced late 2023.\n\n**Q2 2024:**\n\n* GAAP Net Income of $134 million, representing a 20% margin.\n* Revenue growth of 27% YoY, 7% QoQ to $678 million.\n* US commercial revenue growth of 55% YoY, 6% QoQ to $678 million.\n* **US commercial customer count grew 83% YoY and 13% QoQ to 295 customers.**\n* Total commercial revenue growth of 33% YoY, 3% QoQ to $307 million.\n* Total government revenue growth of 23% YoY, 11% QoQ to $371 million.\n\nAs you can see, commercial revenue growth is increasing at a ridiculous rate especially in the US. The same can be said for net income. **Net income for Q1 and Q2 in 2024 totals $240 million. Net income for the entire year of 2023 was $210 million.**\n\nData is the future. Palantir continues to expand their partnerships to leverage their position in the data market.\n\n[Source: Acumen Research and Consulting](https://preview.redd.it/0avmookb5fqd1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=34f8860a9ac58d6ad6af4064cd6e931a3899b848)\n\nSummary - Palantir is in a position to dominate the data analytics market for years to come. They have been able to gain a large portion of commercial business over the last couple of years, while simultaneously expanding their government business. While their revenue grows, they are able to keep a low-cost structure meaning more net income. The same can be seen with their total assets vs total liabilities. As they continue to partner with companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Oracle, they will simply continue to grow. At a current price of **$37.59**, I believe they are a buy and will be continue to be for years to come.\n\nMy prediction - $PLTR will be at a minimum price of $100 on 9/22/26.\n\nNOT INVESTMENT ADVICE.",
