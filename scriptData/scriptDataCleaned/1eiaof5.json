Posted on the subreddit and people were laughing and saying I hope you sold that piece of shit. As I'm trying to sell, the price drops and I lose like 25%. I lose another 25% on Apple.

They have memory on package now which they say reduces power requirements up to 40%. I want a handheld gaming device too. Maybe a windows phone again. Arm is horrible. \nI was waiting for lunar lake. This drop caught me by surprise. Who cares if they made 1 billion less. They are already priced super low to their competitors. Also tsmc is probably heavily subsidized by taiwan govt. how is intel supposed to compete. If you look at their earnings they are hemorrhaging cash on foundry side and that part is essential to US security so intel is doing us all a favor like it or not. China is dumping billlions into smic. So how is intel to compete.",
