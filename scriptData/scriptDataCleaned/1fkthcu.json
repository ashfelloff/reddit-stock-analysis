There’s no telling what other opportunities might be coming their way soon.\n\nI can easily see their valuation going 10x, especially as their revenue starts climbing. The 2025 revenue estimate is only $350M, but I think that’s way too low and we could see it much higher, which would push the valuation up.\n\nRight now, the price-to-sales multiple is super low and, in my opinion, the stock is really undervalued. As more people start to take notice, we could see a 5x+ price-to-sales ratio, which would send Intuitive Machines’ valuation soaring.",
