                  "body": "I have no experience with form 4, but I decided to take a look.\n\nFrom what I can tell, from the officers' submitted forms on May 17th, of which there are 7 for each various officer, I see only code A, F, and M transactions; F and M being the main focus here.\n\nFirst of all, none of the Form 4s have code S which is private sale of securities. So that's one major observation.\n\n- Code F is used when an insider pays the exercise price or tax liability by delivering or withholding securities. This could happen, for example, when an executive exercises stock options and either pays for the exercise price with cash or by surrendering a portion of the shares they're entitled to for covering the cost.\n\n- Code M represents the exercise or conversion of derivative securities, like stock options or warrants. This code is used when an insider converts derivative securities (which are based on the value of the underlying stocks) into actual shares of stock.\n\nThe connection between Code F and Code M often comes into play during a cashless exercise of options.\n1. An insider decides to exercise their options using Code M.\n2. Instead of paying cash to cover the exercise price, they use Code F to surrender some of the shares they would have received from the exercise to cover the cost.\n\nThis process allows insiders to exercise their options without needing to provide cash upfront, as they're essentially using part of the value of the options themselves to pay for the transaction. It's a common practice that facilitates the exercise of options, especially when the insider does not want to or cannot invest additional cash.\n\nSo, to me, it looks like they exercised a bunch of options using their existing shares as payment. You can see from the form 4s that there are significantly more shares under Code M than there are code F (marked disposed), meaning they came out of exercising their options with more shares, essentially making it a net buy... I think.\n\nEdit: I also noticed the remark on each Code F transaction which says \"Shares withheld by Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (the Company) to satisfy tax withholding requirements on vesting of restricted stock units (RSU). **No shares were sold.**\"",
