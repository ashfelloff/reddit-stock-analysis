So a price that shows $2.94 in this case, actually costs $294. Similarly, if you only have $20 to trade, you would need to find a contract worth $.20  as this would be equivalent to $20. Also, the farther out the date til expiration is the more expensive the contract is. There is a lot of more really complex stuff that goes into option pricing, such as the greeks and IV. I would strongly urge you to educate yourself deeply before trading options as it is a statistical guarantee you will lose money over the long run if you continue trading with no knowledge.

But assuming you understand that either of the IRA account is for retirement and don't withdraw until after retirement, with traditional, you pay income tax on how much ever you withdraw from each year when you retire. So even if the OP lets the current balance sit as cash, he'd be paying for taxes on the 5k when he withdraws. With Roth, assuming he really only deposited $20, he would've only paid his income tax on the $20 come next April, and rest of the 5k would've been completely untaxed.",
