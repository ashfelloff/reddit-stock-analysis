Like $35k “to learn” but in reality you’re abused for as many hours as possible over 1-2 years to get credentials from a hospital that only cared about having cheap labor. \n\nDon’t get me wrong great hospitals with great people train the next generation of great health care workers… but a lot of shitty hospitals take you for a ride where you make like $10/hr, maybe less lol\n\nI also didn’t do a residency but I’m a specialist in information systems.
