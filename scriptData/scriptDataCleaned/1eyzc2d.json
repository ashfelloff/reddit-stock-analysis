The crew called it the \"stripper sub\" because one of the biggest houses on a corner lot was owned by this lady who (allegedly) was a stripper. Fake tan, fake tits, long black wig like hair, tiny bikini always in her pool with her strippery looking friends. Always had tons of Biker dudes over. And the crown jewel, right in the front lawn She had a giant flag pole with a confederate flag and pirate ‚ò†Ô∏è flag flying high. I asked her about the flags once, and she said the HOA was fighting her on it, but when they wrote their rules  they never put anything in about what flags you could or couldn't fly so she was like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. My favorite part of cutting her lawn was 1. Watching the other suburban women in the neighborhood throw massive shade at her. And 2. Her neighbors on the one side were this couple in their 50s, and when the stripper was having a pool party I'd always see the husband next door peeking through a second story window at the happenings. Don't know what happened to her, hopefully after her stripping years she bought a Wendy's franchise.",
