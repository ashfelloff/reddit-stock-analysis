  "selftext": "Now that the earnings blackout is over and a September Fed rate cut seems pretty likely, Google very well could begin front running the cuts and buying back more stock, after their planned $70B buyback announcement in April 2024.  Supposedly ~40% of that has already been spent but I don't have a good source to cite on that (if you know how to confirm this information directly please let me know).\n\nGoogle also doesn't provide earnings guidance which keeps more speculative buyers at bay, so you have days like this week where tech is largely up and Google just barely limps along. \n\nHowever I'm still bullish through the end of the year and wonder what other factors make other GOOGL bulls bullish over the long term.

          "body": "Negative press from the antitrust could be an overhang for a year or two but they are cutting costs aggressively and pivoted pretty hard on the AI stuff. They are playing a good job of hiding AI spend and will be the first to cut when it doesn't pan out. I think they will probably catch up to the rest of the mag7 in terms of p/e ratio (excluding nvda) within the next year, two at most. But beyond 2 years I'm not super bullish, other search engines are starting to become a factor, even if only a percent or two of market share per year at present day, and the antitrust will almost certainly result in some level of educating consumers that they are using Google when they type things in to the safari address bar and the iPhone search interface.\n\n\nTldr: LEAPS till 2026 then gtfo",
