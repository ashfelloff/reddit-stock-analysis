They should see how the asset is moving and wait for an opportune time. Second, yes, like many other assets where no physical change would even be seen for a while this is more about people‚Äôs behavior as it relates to the sector or stock.

          "body": "This is a chat got response \n\nBetween FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS), both companies could face significant disruptions from an East Coast dock worker strike, but their ability to mitigate these impacts could vary based on several factors.\n\nFedEx (FDX)\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tGlobal Network and Air Freight: FedEx has a more extensive air freight network, which might allow it to mitigate some of the supply chain disruptions caused by the port strike. The company‚Äôs global express shipping business could see less disruption, as it is less reliant on ocean freight compared to UPS.\n\t‚Ä¢\tEast Coast Dependence: However, for ground and freight services, FedEx still has a considerable reliance on East Coast ports. This could lead to delays and increased costs as shipments are rerouted or delayed.\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tDiversified Shipping Model: UPS is more reliant on ground and ocean shipping, making it potentially more vulnerable to the port strike, especially on the East Coast. With less emphasis on air freight, UPS could experience greater disruptions in its logistics chains.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGlobal Sourcing and Flexibility: However, UPS has a robust global logistics network, and it could use West Coast ports to reroute shipments, although congestion and capacity limitations might still affect them.\n\nWhich Stands to Benefit or Do Worse?\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tPotential Advantage for FedEx: If the strike is prolonged and ground shipping via East Coast ports becomes difficult, FedEx‚Äôs stronger reliance on air freight could give it an edge in handling express shipments, limiting the impact on its operations. This flexibility might position FedEx to weather the strike better than UPS.\n\t‚Ä¢\tHigher Risk for UPS: UPS‚Äôs higher dependence on ocean freight and ground logistics could make it more vulnerable to port delays, especially if cargo needs to be rerouted to already congested West Coast ports. Thus, UPS may face greater disruptions and cost pressures during a strike.",
