      "body": "What to close the U.S. Treasury cash gap with?\n\nThe essence of the problem is very simple: \n\n- A background deficit of at least 2 trillion with the potential for unmanageable expansion. Current fiscal policy is not soft in the context of supporting the population, so any attempt to support consumer demand with a sensitive macro effect will inevitably unwind the deficit to at least 3.5 trillion.\n\n- In US government bonds excluding bills, the marginal funding capacity is estimated at 1.2-1.3 trillion, plus up to another 0.4 trillion in bills, given less than 0.3 trillion in reverse repos with the Fed, and all other available liquidity is already parked in bonds. This creates a hole of at least 0.6 trillion.\n\n- Current household savings in the US is only 0.6 trillion a year, acting as a major buyer of treasuries. The profits of the financial system are not enough to finance the budget deficit, and non-residents can overlap up to 0.5 trillion per year and that is close to the limit. \n\n- Private sector net savings are going into negative territory - there is no free money in the system, and the excess liquidity generated in 2020-2021 has already been distributed. \n\n- The US government‚Äôs cache balance is estimated at 771 billion as of September 5 - less than 4 months of deficit financing with zero net placements (red limit of operating cache around 200-250 billion).\n\n- Successful deficit financing since June 2023 (the start of active placements) is due to the use of about 2 trillion of excess liquidity in the Reverse Repurchase Program (RRP), parked in bills - this resource is no longer available.\n\n- In August, there were unplanned placements in promissory notes for 200 bln with virtually unchanged RRP balance (there was no demand for medium and long-term securities) and no direct interest of non-residents - this means the use of the ¬´last bastion¬ª, apparently, it is partly Buffett‚Äôs money after the sale of shares, but this resource is not dimensionless either (probably, it too was chosen to the brim).\n\nIn the current configuration, the system is relatively comfortably able to digest a budget deficit of 1-1.2 trillion per year, but not twice as much, with the potential for expansion to 3-4 trillion on the trajectory of entering recession.\n\nNow (after the excess liquidity is exhausted), anything above 1.2 trillion goes to the detriment of the private capital market (IPOs and corporate bond offerings), creating pockets of overstretch in the system. \n\nAlthough trejeris are a form of quasi-money, acting as the highest liquidity ratio in repo pyramids, this only partially covers the marginal demand for private sector financial instruments, but does not automatically create a perpetual motion machine.\n\nThere are two solutions:\n\n- Creating a critical overstretch in the private capital market by sucking liquidity out of stocks and bonds in favor of trijeris in a no-alternative environment of fear and risk aversion. This is only a temporary measure that may win a year, maybe two, but the further it goes, the more painful it gets.\n\n- Launching QE is something they know how to do, expect and know well. This scenario will create a drug-induced and blacked out mind effect, re-inducing imbalances throughout the system, creating a new wave of inflationary pressures, and undermining the credibility and importance of the Fed. This scenario is short-term effective, but long-term destructive. \n\nOf course, they will choose QE, but before that they will gut everyone to the ground, because in the conditions of the Fed‚Äôs failed inflation targeting, an attempt to take this path again is an admission of the system‚Äôs bankruptcy, i.e. the inability to conduct a secured policy from its own resources.",
