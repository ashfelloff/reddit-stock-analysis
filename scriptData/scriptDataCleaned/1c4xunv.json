  "selftext": "I am a bag holder myself, my regarded ass bought 4 165c calls at the Tippity top (149) and am now down something like 90+%. I was a firm believer in TSM and still am as a long term play, but as an earnings play? Nah, TSM will not, and I repeat will not hit even close 165 after earnings. Maybe they will swing up 4% but not even close to what us true regards that bought or not have super OTM calls need to break even or profit. It‚Äôs been a shitty ride boys but I‚Äôm ready to get off and leave it behind. I have accepted it, can you?\n\nEdit: For clarification a portion of my evidence is that the earnings portion is already priced into the stock price, now it's all about forward guidance, they have to announce something that would get ivensestors dicks hard and i do not know if I see that happening. Also, if you look at historical data TSM does not moon after earnings, it will have a small upward swing. Seriously, go look at the charts.\n\nI don't want to get to deep into it but TSM is not mooning after earnings, I'm already losing a ban bet so you wont see me for some time lmao.",

Nvidia needs every chip that TSM can make and they needed them months ago. For a company to make a decision to switch up IT infrastructure has to be incredibly compelling, I mean how many companies actually \\*want\\* to spend money in IT. None of them. So it's gotta be worth it. AI has obviously given companies the reason to invest in IT. Every company that makes a logic chip is going to try to capitalize on this opportunity. Intel just dropped their own chip. Google did as well. And more are on the way. Looking at all the news and their stock price, Nvidia's problem isn't money or marketing, it's just getting their chips into these companies servers and data centers. They have the best and they know it. But does it matter if they can't deliver the things for a year and intel can get it to them in 3 months? \n\nThe point being this puts TSM in the driver's seat when negotiating prices. If Nvidia wants to put a lock on data centers for the next decade they HAVE to get their GPUs in. And they're gonna pay to make it happen. It's basic supply and demand. TSMC's forward outlook is going to lead to a moonshot outside of crazy external factors. I think your 165 calls are pretty risky, but I don't think it's out of the probability to at least get your money back. What makes this quarter different for TSMC? Nvidia's competition. They didn't really have any until relatively recently and because of that Nvidia has started to lose negotiating power over TSMC. \n\nFWIW I'm throwing every dollar in my HOOD account into TSM calls right before earnings.",
