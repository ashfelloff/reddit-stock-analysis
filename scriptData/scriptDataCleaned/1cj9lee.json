There is no early withdrawal penalty on earnings after age 59 1/2, but you still have to pay income tax on the earnings if your account is less than 5 years old. \n\nIf you withdraw earnings before age 59 1/2, you will have to pay income taxes on the earnings AND 10% early withdrawal penalty on the earnings.
