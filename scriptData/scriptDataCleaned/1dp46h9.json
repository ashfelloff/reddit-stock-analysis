      "body": "I don't know that there is a growth story/theme that is \"underappreciated\" at this point and as a result I've been looking at quality slower growth/value names recently. WSC is an example. ODFL, which someone else mentioned. There's a handful of others.\n\nOutside of tech, I've liked TMDX for a while now but at $145 a share up 88% YTD, it's not underappreciated.  I've owned LLY for a couple of years now and there was incessant negativity about the obesity drug theme for a while, but not so much once it started passing $500-600 and is now not that far from $1k.\n\nThe industrial/utility AI beneficiary trade got overdone imo  (CEG, EME, PWR, VST, etc) and maybe they still do well over the next 5 years but I think you have to hope for a best case scenario - anything less or much less and those names could pull back significantly.  Commercial solar (NXT, FSLR) somewhat interesting pulling back, but still up a good deal YTD. One could bet a little on very rate-sensitive residential solar (ENPH) turning around...someday?\n\nSome software names have been obliterated. MDB, SNOW - but not without reason, and they're still not exactly \"cheap.\" I've nibbled on DKNG during recent concerns and EVVTY down a lot but I don't see either being made huge positions.  CELH bounce?\n\nThere's a lot non-tech that I like (and have liked) as long-term holdings but there's very little where it doesn't feel like a lot of people don't already like them as well/a good deal is priced in. There's scattered new/revisit prior ideas but not finding anything I think is worthwhile of making into a larger holding at this point",

Maybe find the feeder companies providing very necessary parts like sensors and gadgets.  IDK - I gave up on that space with Virgin Orbit (my only hope and went down with the ships that exploded over the U.K.)  Boeing is shitting it's own pants and there's not much else out there.
