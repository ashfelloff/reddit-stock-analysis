Power consumption sees much more modest increases. For example, the Hopper H100 performed at 1,979 Peak FP16 TFLOPs and consumed 700 watts. The Blackwell platform B200 has 10,000 Peak FP16 TFLOPs and also consumes 700 watts. That's an increase of approximately 5.05 times in performance with no increase in power consumption.\n\nI'm feeling bullish.",
