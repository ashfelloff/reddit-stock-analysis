White collar recession. Tech sector, that I'm in, is absolutely insane right now. Layoffs, outsourcing, and most importantly, lack of job postings. Guess what happens when white collar jobs are hit. It trickles down to everyone else because we're the ones that spend the $$.\n\nAll it takes is pretty much a single black swan event, or a collection of factors that all work together to bleed companies out eventually (such as high interest rates are currently). It's not that I'm saying the market doesn't go up long term, but what I'm saying is there is such a thing as \"collecting profits\" and \"cycles\" and there is currently quite a lot of profit to be made once the bigwigs sell. \n\nWe get so disillusioned by the insane endless stream of +1% days, that nobody is able to handle the circuit breaker days where it's just red after red. And forget that, there could be a third option, just stagnation. We could hover around 490s-low 500s for years.",
