Big banks with total asset control of 18 trillion are pledging support for nuclear, Microsoft dropped 16 billion on friday to revive three mini reactors to power a datacenter. The biggest hurdle for nuclear has always been initial financing it takes way too long to make your money back coupled with the risk of failure makes it a sub optimal investment. Seems like the big boys don't care anymore and there's enough here that some deregulation seems plausible.\n\n[At COP28, Countries Launch Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy Capacity by 2050, Recognizing the Key Role of Nuclear Energy in Reaching Net Zero | Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/articles/cop28-countries-launch-declaration-triple-nuclear-energy-capacity-2050-recognizing-key)\n\nBanks and financial institutions pledging support to meet the 2050 goal of tripling nuclear power production:\n\nBank of America, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Brookfield, Citi, Credit Agricole, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Rothschild & Co.

[Yann LeCun on X: \"AI datacenters will be built next to energy production sites that can produce gigawatt-scale, low-cost, low-emission electricity continuously.

I would be very cautious with any uranium gold rush forecast, especially some other players will be back soon (Kazakhstan?). And then you have the whole cheap solar/wind play that now adds giant batteries for night/low wind conditions and is extremely competitive already. I'd rather look for players in the battery space, not some FANG vaporware promises for a few data centers, as if the majority of all future power generation would be for genAI (hallucinating LLMs), which is hardly monetized yet..",

Electricity was a byproduct.\n\nUranium ore and metal are cheap, widely available, and not the bottleneck. its enriching it for small reactors that costs money. I think its inevitable that the UK and US will use weapons plutonium in their own SMR fuel. Both countries have got weapons grade plutonium coming out of their fucking ears, but they can't export it. They don't know what to do with it all. It'll end up in mixed oxide fuel pellets and get burned for energy, while poorer non-NATO countries will have to settle for expensive enriched UO2 fuel - supplied to them by the US, UK and France (who have the gas centrifuges for enrichment). \"The nuclear fuel Gulf states\"\n\nFor this reason I say forget about uranium investing. Large data centers will have their own little reactors soon. Guess correctly who will win those reactor contracts and you'll make your money. My guesses are Rolls Royce and Westinghouse (Brookfield Corp).",

      "body": "Betting on uranium because you read some stories that datacenters are going to use nuclear power is one of the most regarded things I've seen recently.\n\nYou realize that the overwhelming majority of the expense in a nuclear reactor has nothing to do with uranium, right? Famously, nuclear power plants don't use much fuel. The cost to build *one* nuclear power plant is about the same as the entire year's volume of uranium sales. The money isn't in the uranium, it's in literally everything else.\n\nBut let's say you expect a spike in uranium prices because of increased demand. Where does that demand come from? New and reactivated power plants, right? Well we don't have very many to reactivate, and it takes a while to do it. And building new ones takes even longer. So you're buying now and *might* see movement in like 5-10 years?\n\nWouldn't it make more sense to invest in the companies that need to build infrastructure to make this shit happen, instead of the thing that only becomes relevant at the very end?",

          "body": "That’s just extra sentiment. Uranium has a “simple” supply/demand model, and we’re entering at least a temporary trend where utilities are short on supply. They need to sign new contracts because they need to keep their plants online. If you look at the floor and ceiling price of these contracts, you’ll see buyers accepting a higher price range for uranium over the mid-term. A lot of reasons why. So AI is just a great catalyst to add speculative demand on top of already squeezing prices",
