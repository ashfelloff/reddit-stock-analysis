      "body": "When I bought the stock it was at $10 in 2021. I reloaded with all my spare cash as it fell over the next year, still believing.\n\nHad to sell 1790~ shares a few weeks ago at $16. Don’t regret it as now I only have around 10k of my own money left in the stock. Will be 100% in ASTS until at least 2027.\n\nEdit: as a 33 yr old man I want to give some of you young guys some advice. I’ve been trading since my early 20s and made almost no good moves. There were certain stocks I bought way back in the day like AMD and PTN that were good plays but required time and patience. I used to check every day, try to make moves etc with a grand or two I could spare. I ended up making little to no profits trading this way and took a break for years from stocks. I couldn’t emotionally handle trading and checking the gains or losses every day. I always had paper hands. Hell I had 82 btc @ $50/ea and sold at $110. Always trying to make a quick buck since I didn’t have much money.\n\nAs I got older and realized all the stocks+btc I had invested in early would have made me money long term, literally 95% of my buys could have made me hundreds of thousands to millions if I held for a couple of years. I decided to only buy things I believed in and HODL. Not playing options for a quick gain or hit, but long term thinking. Sure I may not spike to $5mil over night but this strategy is a lot less like gambling and more about securing yourself financially for the future. Hope you young guys can consider finding something you’re passionate in and holding it long term after doing proper DD vs all the quick moves. This is not financial advice and I’m just an idiot, this is what I’ve noticed from my experiences.",

So you gotta hustle to buy a home and build an emergency fund as quickly as possible. This is why starting from $0 is so hard. If you need a down payment for a house or car or something else in the immediate future you arent gonna be able to HODL the way you should be. But if you do it right you should be in a good spot in your 30s to do some real investing. If your parents set you up with a place then you can knock that back to your 20s and add 10 years to your investing timeline, this is why setting up your kids is so important.",

You can't just sell telco products in any country like bread.\n\nTelco is highly regulated and is linked to national security in many countries. There's a reason why they limit the number of telco licenses in every country.. furthermore, ASTS is a listed American company, do you think they're going to illegally sell SIM cards underground and recognize profits from the black market? \n\nASTS is considered a foreign company and will find it very hard to get access to many places in Asia. I can't say got Europe and the west as they may be agreements, but when the government doesn't have control over the network and communications within their country, you can bet that they're not going to get license to sell and operate in those countries. Just think of illegal channels streaming on satellite dishes, but worse because it's a 2 way communications.... 6 billion? Even starlink can't do that and get 6 billion people. \n\nAlso, telco and bandwidth auctions are a very big in Asia. It's a very big revenue for the governments and the rental of telco bandwidths in many countries are in the billions of dollars. What makes you think the governments will let ASTS take away business from the local telcos that pays billions in bandwidth rental every year? Is asts going to pay billions in rental of bandwidth per country? If the government needs control over the telco and block or censor the phone lines, is ASTS going to do that? If governments need to tap into lines and search for people or terrorists, is ASTS going to hand over control?\n\nDo you know how many hoops and considerations you need to have for each country? I work in telco and I'm just describing the surface issues here. There are plenty more other problems where it will be impossible for them to get licenses to sell telco lines, except in the west where the law and loopholes are more lenient. There's no such thing as the 1st amendment outside of the US.",
