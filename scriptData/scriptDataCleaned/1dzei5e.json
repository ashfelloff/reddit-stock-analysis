  "selftext": "Thank you for those who corrected the previous post.\n\nHello gentleman. \n\nFirst of all, the only DD that there is going to be in this post is in the tag. All information  here comes from trust worthy sources: MCD graphs and my confirmation bias.\n\nMcdonalds is at the lowest point in the past year. If you check it's graph you will find an interesting pattern: several arches of 245$ to 300$.\n\nLast earnings mcdonalds was expected to deliver 2.73 - 2.71 EPS, but only got 2.70. Obviously the stock has droped a 20% since then (lmao).\n\nThis is literally a train ticket to 300$ per share. Next earnings are in 2 weeks. If mcdonalds delivers their expections (duh) we can see a rebound from a 52W low by september / december. \n\nHuge value investing oportunity to just hold, or to play for earnings.\n\nIt literally can't go tits up üçîüçîüçîüçîüçî",

Diving into the financials and it looks even worse.\n\n2024 expected revenue is 26.6 billon with earnings of 12.18 a share so their net is about 8.7 billion dollars\n\n2025 expected revenue is 28.12 billion with earnings at 13.26 a share so net income about 9.5 billion\n\nSo the growth rate is slowing on revenue from 12 percent (23/24) down to 5.7 percent (24/25)\n\nIt has a market cap of 179 billion with revenue of 26.6 billion if they meet their numbers for a price to sales at 6.72 which is very high for fast food. Next throw in a nice 51 billion in debt on their books. Lastly throw in a nice divvy of 6.68 per share which is more than half of their net income per year given out to share holders . It does pay a decent dividend, however it's going to be the same as NKE / SBUX which is stalled growth. It's topped and that is why it's coming down. When sales go from average of 10-12 percent and start falling into that 5-6 range it has topped out. The real play might be to grab the Aug 16th 230 PUTS and see if Ronald starts choking on Grimace's ball sack.\n\nIf you don't believe me go in and buy one Big Mac with cheese. It will run you about $7-8 after tax depending on where you are. Open that up and notice how small the patty is and you will have the same look when your girlfriend first saw your cock. Where is the meat you will be asking ?? Next look how small the bun is... Is this made for a mini me you will be asking yourself ... Lastly remember how long it took to make your food and if it was just thrown in the box. They don't even care anymore / no effort. People are starting to turn away from McDonalds, Chipotle ect as the value is not there and quality declined.",
