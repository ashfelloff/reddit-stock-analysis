  "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.",

More specifically, that describes the investor psychology behind the people buying into it. Regression analysis showed a moderate, positive correspondence with the NASDAQ and stronger correspondence with Nvidia, Dell, Apple, etc. You could predict whether it went up and down on any given day if you knew the announcements and price movements of other major tech stocks.\n\nEmphasis on *showed*. The relationship broke down this week and reversed on some days - except for the 4th, it didn't correspond with the NASDAQ at all. Even though it was primed for a pullback with a RSI over 80, the violence of that pullback used to be dictated by whether there was good or bad news everywhere else. \n\nI suspect it's due to [market liquidity rushing from the bottom to the top](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1da6j8s/rstocks_daily_discussion_fundamentals_friday_jun/l7iyhb8/) in response to this week's news.",

I started backtesting mid-February when CLS' volume grew enough to see meaningful price swings. First I had to establish the beta then went up the ladder: individual announcements to check whether CLS' move on that day constituted a sigma event -> regression analysis against individual companies -> regression analysis against the NASDAQ composite and NASDAQ 100. Recalculate every weekend for the previous week, month, and timeline back to February to see if the correlations are fading or strengthening.  \n\n> Do you do this for specific tickers or track a few universes?\n\nDepends on the sector. Like we talked about elsewhere global shipping is affected by the same exogenous conditions, but the individual companies don't interact. So there I just track the universe indicators like change in shipping rates, etc.\n\nIn tech, it's a case-by-case basis. I did it for ALAR and CLS as they benefit handsomely from the successes of bigger companies that will be their future clients. \n\n> I've been adding flows to calculation commodity pricing to my trading engine lately (doesn't work), but operate on far longer time frames and haven't looked at volume or such technicals, besides e.g. reading Andrew Lo.\n\nFlows can be good if the program distinguishes between institutional vs retail. The former will act on inside info when investing in companies that don't have obvious appeal, making asset flows predictive.",

Yet the three major indexes have remained flat or slightly positive during the same period - in terms of percentage losses, the ratio has been between 6x-10x in their favor per day - while there's been no major incoming surge of outside liquidity according to the sources I use. \n\nThe most likely explanation is it's a fear-motivated rotation in response to this week's data. Investors are moving out of small/micro caps into large caps as a safe haven play (hence S&P, NASDAQ and Dow having no correlation in price movement with the other tranches in the market). This is further backed up by the drastic decline in daily volume compared to previous weeks on the scale of 60-80% compared to the 10-day average, as well as free-falling agricultural and industrial commodity prices. But the volume relocation is disguising those indicators: if one only looks at the major indexes, you'd conclude the market is indifferent to the recent news.\n\nIn addition, the price movement of some stocks I own and others I follow have completely decoupled from their historical market correlations. Especially CLS, which has detached from the NASDAQ and various A.I. companies and is plunging down. This is...alarming to say the least.",

          "body": "The hope would be that stocks would eventually gain the dividend back - if it's just paying a dividend and going nowhere or paying a dividend and the share price keeps eroding (see: almost every single mREIT and plenty of CEFs, for example) it's probably not a good company/ETF. The Superdividend ETF (SDIV) pays a huge dividend but is basically yield chasing odd little companies across the world. $10K in that in 2011 is now $7800; the weird bag of companies it owns solely because of the yield and (not a consideration towards quality) aren't outgrowing the dividend. How many people have invested in that ETF because \"look at the yield!\" and gotten obliterated?\n\nAlso,  I don't agree with an income emphasis and things like O when someone is in their 20's but I think the real thing that I dislike most is \"dividend above all else\" (\"I don't care what it is, just that it yields a lot and if it pays every month even better\") - then it becomes yield chasing. \n\nThere's also an emphasis at times on dividends as if they are some sort of magic safety, when they're not. Look at something like VFC, which was a dividend aristorcrat for many years and then the rug is pulled. Look at GE post-Immelt and pre-Larry Culp. Plenty of other examples where dividends have become suspended over time. If there's  a downturn, is the company who has better capital allocation/management and a more reasonable dividend likely to cut/suspend the dividend or is the riskier company that yields 5-6%+?\n\nSo, imo the dividend focus is not something that I agree with because on here 1) it often seems like what it pays is so much more important than what the business actually is/does and 2) \"dividends for the sake of dividends\" often leads to buying low/er quality businesses that in some cases aren't paying dividends that can be sustained 3) there's too much focus by younger people on here on income names that would be in some cases more appropriate for their parents and 4) I joked the other day the investable REIT universe on here seems to be largely made up of Realty Income/O - it's a weird little mini cult stock on here because everyone looks for a REIT because they have elevated the idea of dividends in their mind and they all copy each other. People buy STAG instead of much larger/better peer PLD because it pays a bigger/monthly dividend and PLD has a smaller, quarterly dividend.\n\nSo, TLDR: Dividends aren't \"bad\" but I primarily don't like what often seems like the prioritization of what something yields over what it is/does. Company fundamentals should be the focus - not what the yield is - but any time dividend names/yield come up on here it often seems like the latter.",
