I'm either going to be sent to the wage cage, or get some Tendies shipped to me Same-Day delivery.\n\nBezos, if you are reading this: Pls stop selling. Pls don't dump me like you did your first wife.  Thx\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lqvk592nm3dd1.png?width=2590&format=png&auto=webp&s=61fd42a42e04d9c02a62ab940a361ebbc8f23bfc",
