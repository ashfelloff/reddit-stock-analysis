I agree they paid that huge fine but also paid out the most in bonuses this year due to the great year they had. Moreover, they cut costs by letting people voluntarily leave and are still dedicated to their long term goals on paper.\nNot that I disagree with anything you said, but I wouldn‚Äôt buy Puts on them because I work for them haha. Short term puts make sense tho lol. Good luck OP",
