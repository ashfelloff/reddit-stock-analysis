It was an off putting experience and doesn’t make me want to visit another Starbucks anytime soon. The drinks are also mediocre. You can see and taste that everything is prepared in an automated way. Push a button and out comes a mediocre tasting drink that they charge $7 for. What am I paying $7 for? I thought this was for a skilled barista, premium ingredients, a relaxing experience.

They fit into one of these categories, though sometimes both: they are addicted to caffeine or they are addicted to sugar.\n\nSBUX *used to* offer a user experience that made people feel better about getting overly caffienated at 3p or sucking down 800 calories of sugar, but then they turned the inside of their stores into a bus station and killed the vibe.\n\nI think it's important to point out that SBUX pioneered convenience, technology, and prepay for their industry, which is probably what they will stay known for.

Many of these fast food chains are about to get the same basic economics lesson as none of them seem to understand the products or their customers or their employees. The price increases in the last 3 years from these big chains wreaks of out of touch management desperate to create short term profits at the cost of the brand.  \n\nIt's especially noticeable with coffee considering how easy it is to make better coffee at home for a fraction of the price. Starbucks is never getting these customers back.",
