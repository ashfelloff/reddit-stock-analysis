  "selftext": "Salesforce shares plummeted 16% in extended trading on Wednesday after the cloud software vendor reported weaker-than-expected revenue and issued guidance that trailed Wall Street’s expectations.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared with the LSEG consensus:\n\nEarnings: $2.44 per share, adjusted, vs. $2.38 per share expected\n\nRevenue: $9.13 billion, vs. $9.17 billion expected\n\nSalesforce called for adjusted earnings per share in the current quarter of $2.34 to $2.36 on $9.2 billion to $9.25 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by LSEG had expected $2.40 in adjusted earnings per share on $9.37 billion in revenue.\n\nRevenue in the fiscal first quarter, which ended April 30, increased 11% from $8.25 billion a year earlier, Salesforce said in a statement. Net income jumped to $1.53 billion, or $1.56 per share, from $199 million, or 20 cents per share a year ago.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/29/salesforce-crm-q1-earnings-report-2025.html",

But, about $1.60 of the full year eps adjustment is acquisition intangibles, which aren’t cash charges or predictive in any way.
