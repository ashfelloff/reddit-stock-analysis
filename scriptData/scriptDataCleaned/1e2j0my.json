I got a X3D chip, and power limit it, because the last 100MHz of boost cost 10C on temp and like 15-20W of power. Just not worth is unless you're chasing synthetic benchmarks.\n\nThat said, I'm still scared to short Intel. The market isn't tech savvy, and I don't expect it to react rationally to this.
