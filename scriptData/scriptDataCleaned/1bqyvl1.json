But they still won't sell.  \n\nHow many investors believed Trump would become president again in Aug 2021 and execute a cabal of demonic democrats?  That is very likely many of the same people using Truth and investing in it. \n\nThere are also likely big money players attempting to buy influence by funneling money through Truth to Trump. They know it will lose money, but that's not the investment they are buying. \n\nDJT most defiantly will not ever make positive earnings, ...other than selling stock to people. It has no value or real business plan. \n\nBut it could like run for 10+ years on current funds.  They could probably do a secondary offering in 5 years and make another $6b. \n\nDJT should immediately start charging $10/ month or more. It's not like churches are shy about asking for money. \n\nAgain, a big piece of the fan base will pay. And more people will want access as election comes up.  \n\nMaybe it can be the \"only fans\" for Trump. He can sit on cakes for tips.",

If you guys can't back up your shit talk then it's just that. I want to see some excellent DJT PUT loss porn the next few weeks. Who's got the balls, as for me, \"I like this stock\". 🚀🔥",
