Well since this is r/WallstreetBETS, not r/Wallstreetinvestsresonsiblyandjustthrowyourmoneyintoanindexfundwait30yearsandbeatinflationretirewith1milplus, most regards here are playing options. \n\nSo what the previous user is suggesting is to buy in the money calls and puts on SPY, because if you’re expecting volatility and at least a 3-5 point movement, one leg will be profitable and one leg will be negative, and you hope that the profit is more than the loss. \n\nIf it works, and you scale, let’s say you put in $1,000 and make $100 today, well shit why not put in 1 million tomorrow and make $100,000? \n\nSee how you can get rich easily? \n\nNow go forth and make Nana proud.",

Then you never have to touch it. \nIf you want to trade options then put 75K into VOO stock and maybe some other stocks (GOOGL is what i’m balls deep in). Then play with just the 25k in options. If you play options well you can easily flip that to 100k again but don’t ever put your entire balance into one option strategy. If you want to play options don’t mess with VOO it has no volume and the spread is way tooo wide. It’s not a liquid stock at all and options are all about liquidity. Genuinely I am sorry that happened to you, but everyone here has had to pay for a lesson, it’s just about if you choose to learn from it.",
