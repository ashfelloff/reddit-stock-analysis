The market will be falling over itself to get in line, ASTS will have a P/E ratio of 500, and it will cost $200 a share. That’s the “$200 Q1 2025” scenario.",

Also, service is expected to be able to penetrate buildings, unlike several competitors.. there's plenty of \"why\" - I personally hit dead zones all the time, even near cities, and would easily pay for the service otherwise to go camping, etc... also, the government has 3 contracts with AST, so clearly there's an application - emergency services, etc. Some people don't have internet at all, or have no cellular service until they drive 20 minutes away from their houose, so that would be another reason why you'd want satellite connectivity. Take a look at some of the visuals, it can help really put into perspective how much of the world is unconnected.

My question is - should I take some profit before the mid-September launch (initial investment +10%?)...or just let it ride.  I would just hate to see this thing tank if the additional satellites flop for some reason.\nMy ACB is $14.",

However, you're right on the smart financial decision being taking your initial investment + 10% out to diversify now that ASTS is almost definitely a higher % of your portfolio - if this isn't a very high % regardless, then I would keep it all - also clearly it isn't nearly as undervalued as before, retail pump and hype, short squeeze this morning b/c they were forced out of positions early (the dump after this absolutely fucked my shit up lol, also dont quote me on accuracy idk), yes you could potentially buy a few more shares at a cheaper price if you time the market, better to have time in the market, yada yada run on sentence who cares. Ultimately, up to you. My opinion: now we're in no man's land (major all time highs), but I have been watching the stock closely for around a month and it really does like to stick in a trading range and hold pretty damn strong on support levels. If you are truly in for the long haul, at least several years from now, I would be thinking about buying more, not selling..\n\nShort term wise.. Right now I'm monitoring on tradestation but haven't quite figured out how to get the proper time and sales data filtered how I want it to mark down support/resistance levels, so I'm not sure where many are up at these new prices.. anyway, if it holds extremely strong above 28-30, I could see the launch in first half of September being yet another catalyst in this wonderful journey of price discovery.. in the end, who the fuck knows, not financial advice. good investment.",
