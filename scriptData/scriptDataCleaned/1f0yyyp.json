I hope we agree on that - if not, I can quote where you said so.\n\n  \nI think the argument that \"life expectancy\" (which is directly correlated with health, personal wellbeing, etc.) is a better index for \"standard of living\" than per capita income is sound. If you don't agree with that, so be it, I think that is trivial (and be it just for the fact that you can increase your per capita income as long as you are alive, but not viceversa - unless income increases as a dead person matters to you).\n\nI challenge the notion, that per capita income is as hard of a fact as life expectancy. There you have issues such as whether to take the mean or the median (or other statistical properties), which differ more greatly for economic properties than for life expectancy. Even worse, you have concepts such as nominal value vs real value and purchasing power parity that can have a major impact on comparisons. Such concepts do not apply to the simple question of death or life. These are just a few issues, that plague economic indicators such as per capita income, etc. but do not apply to life expectancy.  \nGenerally speaking, it is very unlikely to find indices grounded in science that are not \"harder\" than economic indices.",

      "body": "Many people here don’t seem to understand US debt, so here is chatgpt’s answer to whether Us debt is out of control:\n\nThe question of whether the U.S. debt level is “out of control” is a matter of perspective and depends on several economic, political, and fiscal factors. Here’s a breakdown of the key considerations:\n\n1. Current Debt Levels:\n\n\t•\tAs of 2024, U.S. national debt exceeds $32 trillion. This is a significant amount, and the debt-to-GDP ratio (a common measure of a country’s debt relative to its economic output) is over 120%, which is historically high for the U.S.\n\n2. Sustainability of Debt:\n\n\t•\tInterest Payments: A crucial aspect of managing debt is the government’s ability to service it. The U.S. still has the ability to make interest payments on its debt, but as interest rates rise, these payments consume a larger portion of the federal budget, potentially crowding out other spending priorities.\n\t•\tEconomic Growth: If the economy grows robustly, the debt-to-GDP ratio could stabilize or even decrease, making the debt more manageable. However, slow growth or a recession could exacerbate the debt burden.\n\n3. Impact on Future Generations:\n\n\t•\tHigh levels of debt can be a burden on future generations, who might face higher taxes or reduced government services to manage or reduce the debt. However, borrowing today for investments that spur economic growth, such as infrastructure or education, could benefit future generations.\n\n4. Historical Context:\n\n\t•\tThe U.S. has had high debt levels before, particularly after World War II, and managed to bring them down through a combination of economic growth, inflation, and fiscal policy adjustments. However, the current debt level is more peacetime-related, driven by tax cuts, entitlement spending, and emergency measures like those during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n5. Global Confidence and Reserve Currency Status:\n\n\t•\tThe U.S. benefits from issuing debt in its own currency (the dollar), which is the world’s primary reserve currency. This status allows the U.S. to borrow at lower interest rates than other countries might be able to. A loss of confidence in U.S. fiscal management could undermine this advantage, though there is currently no imminent sign of such a shift.\n\n6. Political Will:\n\n\t•\tManaging the debt effectively requires political consensus on fiscal policy, which includes decisions on spending, taxation, and borrowing. The U.S. has faced political gridlock on these issues, which complicates efforts to address the debt sustainably.\n\n7. Comparison to Other Countries:\n\n\t•\tWhile U.S. debt levels are high, they are not unprecedented globally. Some other advanced economies, like Japan, have much higher debt-to-GDP ratios. However, the economic and social structures of these countries differ, making direct comparisons challenging.\n\nConclusion:\n\nWhether the U.S. debt is “out of control” depends on future economic conditions, fiscal policy decisions, and the government’s ability to manage interest payments and promote growth. While the debt level is certainly high and could pose risks if not managed prudently, it is not necessarily “out of control” in the sense that it poses an immediate crisis. However, without proactive measures to address underlying fiscal imbalances, the situation could become more precarious in the future. The key is finding a balance between necessary borrowing for growth and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability.",
