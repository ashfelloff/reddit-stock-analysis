  "selftext": "Hello fellow degens, some of you may remember my earlier post about making $70k shorting TSLA this year (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g9hus6/70k_profit_from_shorting_tsla/). \n\nAs you can guess this strategy has not worked well this month and my YTD profit from my favorite EV company is now down to $40k (see second pic)\n\nBut please indulge my big brain boast about not completely fucking it up because in an alternate universe, I would have completely wiped my portfolio. Instead, I had the audacity to do something unheard of in this sub: RisK MiTigAtiOn.\n\nBasically at the height of my profits I transferred most of my money out of my margin trading account and into another cash trading account (and into basic bitch ETFs). This saved my ass because I would definitely would have gone full regard and shorted TSLA with a position 3x larger than what I actually did = 3x larger loss.\n\nSo for you fellow degens who have mooned recently, congrats, fuck you, and consider implementing measures to curb your degeneracy. Lock your gains into ETFs, change your account from margin to cash, or transfer your assets to your wife or to her boyfriend since it’ll eventually go to him anyway.\n\nIn any case, see you at Wendy’s.

      "body": "Same, big loss and getting out of playing the market. Interesting run up though. People are really set on a vague image of the future that's probably not realistic.\n\nMost people I've talked to say they like the car but FSD is not great. So how can it be anywhere near ready for level 5, as investors are expecting and musk said by 2026-27. I highly doubt it will ever be done by tesla. If they keep pushing then there's likely to be a bad accident that falls the house of cards. \n\nThere's already been some accidents and the NHTSA has an ongoing investigation into FSD. There's also so many questions that tesla hasn't answered. Like for example, how will the image system for full autonomous work in inclement weather. Things like that. Usually for complicated systems, the devil is in the details. \n\nMy field is aeronautics which is a real autonomous transportation industry. They do very rigorous failure analysis on passenger planes, which mathematically estimates the odds of many types of failures in the flight and autopilot systems. For example, this particular component might fail in 1 in 1 million flight hours, whether due to a bird strike or some crazy but not impossible occurrence. And then they determine if 1 in 1 million failure rate is acceptable or not for that system. Famously the 737 MCAS issue was a result of errors in the failure analysis for that system. \n\nHowever autonomous flight is actually extremely safe and robust. Compared to self driving cars, flight has much less variables. But even so, there are still accidents that happen. 1 in a 1 million hours seems like a lot. But if you multiply it by all the planes flying, or all the cars driving, then seemingly unlikely things actually become quite common. You are kind of combating the principles of chaos theory. \n\nIf people decide they don't care about autonomous vehicles resulting in occasional tragic accidents, then teslas FSD would be realistic. Even if it's technically safer than human driving. But I think it's safe to say that won't happen. People really like having someone to blame and be accountable. And when that's a faceless mega company, usually that draws a ton of ire. Versus a distracted driver who caused a tragic accident. But people are more understanding of that because we are all susceptible to distraction. \n\nFor these reasons I believe the only viable, legalized fully autonomous vehicles will have a suite of sensors and redundant systems. As well as robust failure analysis and very sophisticated hardware and software. That wont be cheap and won't be anywhere near 25 to 30k. But we all know elon talks out his ass. I think we will see something looking more like waymo being full autonomous. But I think for atleast the next 10 years we will have only driver assistance style autopilot at the consumer level. And tesla doesn't have a huge lead in this. Likely in a few years all new cars will have hands free driver assistance. \n\nSo yes tesla builds pretty good cars. But cars are not a high profit margin industry. And margins tend to get eroded over time. Tesla only barely squeezes out any profit due to subsidy and climate credits. And there's still great limitations with owning an EV that is preventing mass adoption. There's a lot of teslas out there, yes. But look at any parking lot and it's wide majority ICE cars.\n\nWith this sequence of events though, I'm now thinking this crazy tesla market cap could keep stringing along for quite a while. And it's impossible to time with this irrationality.\n\n I don't think a Trump presidency helps tesla at all either. JD said they want to repeal EV incentive and make an ICE incentive. Model Y without 7500 gov bucks is not going to sell as well. And the presidency is not a magic wand, much less that can make tesla super profitable on products that don't exist. As well as their current products being quite unpopular with people on both sides of the political spectrum. \n\nI don't see any other possibility other than a tsla stock crash. But who knows when. And the cap could go to 2t before that. \n\nBut I will say it was smart of elon to back trump. I wouldn't be surprised if he had his own advisors determining the likelihood of trumps election. The consequences for a Trump win without elon backing him would have probably been a quicker collapse for teslas stock. As the Trump admin would otherwise have likely had 0 regard for teslas business, as their constituents view tesla as being an elitist product, and they already planned to pull the plug on EV subsidy. This way atleast they might go easy on Tesla. But I think it still hurts the company and their profitability over a dem win. Though obviously something like 250b of investor money disagrees with me.",
