Most people don't realize that you can build option structures that virtually can't lose.  They can be delta/vega neutral and still make a decent profit.  However, you build them to \"lean\" a certain way and they'll pay out substantially more if you're market predictions are right.\n\nThe problem you'd run into is with liquidity.   You can only buy/sell so many options before you start making waves and distort the pricing curve, eliminating the pricing inefficiency that gave you an advantage.  Because of this, small investors/firms can take advantage of this, but not really the big guys.  My rough estimates are that you can make 50-100M a year with SPY/QQQ/IWM before having to worry about liquidity issues.  That's a fuck ton of money for us.... but peanuts for a 100B fund.\n\nSomeone posted the yearly fund stats above.  You can see that the fund doesn't go over 10B, even though it's enerating around 5B each year.  I imagine that they had account limits and forced withdrawals specifically because of liquidity limits.​",

Large buyers and sellers cause curve distortions when enough capital is moved. That is why hedge funds limit their size and why PE shops such as Vanguard and Blackrock simply passively buy stakes in firms. If a super large firm such as Blackrock or Vanguard makes moves into and out of firms, their price is no longer reflective of its value simply due to the amount bought.",
