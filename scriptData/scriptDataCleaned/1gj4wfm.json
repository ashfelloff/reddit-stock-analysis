Qualitatively speaking, this is America-Mexico magnitude of difference ($80k to $13k, or 6.5 times).\n\nThere's a reason for this massive gap in economic performance. China is a single language, (almost) single ethnic group market of 1.4 billion people, and had almost 30 years of head start with liberalization & capital accumulation from export-driven economics. India is a continent masquerading as a country. And I haven't even gotten to the Hindu extremist regardation that is seriously handicapping India's policymaking, education, you name it. Their biggest, most populous provinces are like Alamaba X 10.\n\nThe only way that India can beat China is if the latter's demographic crisis gets so bad, that their population gets cut in half. Even then, India will not beat China in terms of individual standard of living.",

Although India’s ceremonial Muhurat session on Friday sparked a rally, bulls are clearly on the backfoot due to continued selling by foreign funds and the weakening in second-line stocks.\n\nThe weakness in the economy is finally starting to show up in corporate earnings. Rising defaults in unsecured loans — a reflecting of growing financial stress in households — has investors worried. The Nifty’s gauge of software exporters was the worst performer on Thursday, tumbling 3% to its lowest level in over two months. \n\nBefore the trading day starts we bring you a digest of the key news and events that are likely to move markets.
