Now, let’s brainstorm how this would go over with  our customers if the same thing happens again, but only to us, beciase we’re with a smaller cybersecurity company, and it’s not a major event in the news, Our customers won’t be so understanding in that situation. In that scenario, we look like a second rate operation that refused to buy the best cybersecurity available.  Now WE have the answer the tough questions? Why don’t you have the industry leader in cybersecurity? What was your vetting process for the company you chose, etc? … hence, this will ultimately be a blip on the rada for CRWD",

You wait around the airport for a few hours and your flight is eventually cancelled. You take an Uber ($20) to a hotel, and have to stay overnight ($200). You incur the cost of a few extra meals ($60). The next day, you take an Uber back to the airport ($20). That’s an easy $300 for the one day delay.",

If anyone will win a significant amount of business from this it is Microsoft. They have defender and it ranks higher in the Gartner MQ and is already installed on modern Windows machines. MSFT sales reps will be pitching M365 E5 Plan 2 hard which will give the org email, CASB, EDR, and AD. Deployment is easier than trying to go with something like SentinelOne which will be ambulance chasing like hell.

Three hours later I went home with $3000 in Delta flight credits and I get to travel on a partner airline tomorrow for free. There were at least 3 volunteers on my flight. With nearly 30k flights affected, every flight for the next 5 days is going to be losing money. I can only imagine how many hundreds of billions in damages this will cause. Some insurance execs are probably on the verge of a stroke right now waiting to see the claims roll in. \n\n\nOn the bright side, now I get three free first class trips for the rest of the year, plus earning miles and status.
