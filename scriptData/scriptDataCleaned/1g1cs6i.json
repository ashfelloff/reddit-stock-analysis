  "selftext": "Everyone is talking about the Cybercab, but Elon actually solved the world-wide housing crisis with the Robovan.\n\nIn 1 year, when it rolls off the production line, you will be able to hail a Robovan, configured to have a bedroom. It will pick you up in the city center, in the evening, and you will sleep in it, while it drives you outside of the city. It will find parking and drop you off at 8 AM in front of your workplace, with a hot coffee and breakfast, which will have been delivered into the Robovan while you slept. I believe this is 1-2 years away.\n\nImagine you can live in a robovan for $8 a day (or $1 per hour)...basically IN THE CENTER of New York. That's $2800 per year, or $140,000 in a lifetime. You wouldn't be able to buy a cardboard box in NY for that price.¬†\n\nI've been heavily invested in real-estate but I am liquidating all those assets and moving them into TSLA stock",

Cybertruck was crack for the Elon ass lickers, but it‚Äôs a specialty buy, specific types of buyers want the cybertruck and willing to overpay for it. For mass auto consumers, it‚Äôs a fuckin awful option. Overpriced and proven full of issues. Aside from that, EV market has taken a hit and Tesla is in a run of bad earnings and missed deliveries. If you invest in Tesla long term, it certainly shouldn‚Äôt be because of robotaxis that are still largely a concept, and then robots? What Tesla needs is the 25K car that they have proposed for years (and also an idea how Elon pumped his stock after horrendous earnings). and coming out with robotaxis and robots, 2 things that are a ‚Äòwant‚Äô buy, not a ‚Äòneed‚Äô for consumers, the focus is removed from their current business to spark a new market, it is a bad model. And their product line becomes too saturated. I don‚Äôt think buying in is bad, but to think the current SP is a discount is pretty ignorant.",

How many miles does a robo-hotel log in a day?\n\nDoes this same model appeal if the true cost is $100/night or more? Would you share a hotel box for $3.0k/mo and no place to store your own possessions other than a back pack or luggage? No toilet and shower other than shared facilities?\n\nPut another way, let's say a city bus came to your work, picked you up every night, and then drove you to the outskirts of town to sleep, returning you to work in the morning. Does that model appeal to you? Does it matter how nice the bus is?\n\nThis isn't reality. In the end your options are the same.",
