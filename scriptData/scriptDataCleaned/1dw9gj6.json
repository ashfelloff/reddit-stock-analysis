I lost on on 10x gains for most of my positions except some put hedging but i still ended up with a fair chunk of profit despite all that.\n\nEdit: also I posted  this in another comment but adding here because it is important to why I played the 200 sma: My plan was to simply play the 200sma along with some really good catalysts despite all the negative news circulating. \n\nThe catalysts being the shareholder approval of elons pay package, and then less impact full but I thought was still important was the collab with Dell and Nvidia, third being earnings coming up, and 4th being the robotaxi. Despite any negative news circulating, the good catalysts were strong enough imo to make a trade based on tsla touching the 200sma",

                          "body": "Repeat with me: Tesla is a growth stock, not a blue chip. It has a massive valuation that assumes a certain amount of annual compounded growth. Otherwise, the valuation is a bubble waiting to pop.\n\nYes, stationary storage is up. It‚Äôs not the main business though, is it? You can‚Äôt point to a new - and already highly competitive sector - as a growth opportunity for Tesla to hang its hat on while they are getting outcompeted left and right in the mainline car business. If Tesla is struggling to maintain growth in the main business after just 5-6 years of competitors really entering the market, it‚Äôs pretty nonsensical to ignore that issue in the storage market, no? Or do you think the Chinese battery makers like CATL who have the best tech in the business right now are somehow uncompetitive in battery storage?",

The cave-in is getting transformed into a bulge out. It'll even out with the index over the long run, and the next bulge might be in oil, or pharma, or financials. \n\nThere's no rhyme or reason to the post-QE market, and very, very few companies have actually been supported by fundamentals in the last five years.
