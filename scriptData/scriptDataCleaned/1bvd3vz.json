  "selftext": "Another one hits my buy zone! Ulta Beauty (ULTA) finally pulled back to my $440 entry point today.  I am all in with 50 Jan 25 options at $480 strike (bought as ULTA hit my trigger).\n\nNOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  \n\nWhile the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.\n\nA few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:\n\n💰 Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data\n\n💄 Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way\n\n💯 Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year\n\nWhile it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.\n\nThe panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450. Elite loyalty ecosystem, smart multi-channel strategy, and flawless execution - what's not to like?? I know analysts are sharpening their pencils, expect possible buy recommendations and a snap back.",

This is horrible for large investors who ultimately move the stock. This is a super massive warning for market movers. And to say that they won’t sell would be foolish. Many of these people have been in on the climb and are still walking away with a ton of money. If they were to sell, this would be the time as the market showed that ULTA not selling enough is super super bad for the next 3-4 months or until demand steps up. Which won’t until this economy changes and I don’t see that happening for the next 6 months. I have poots but good luck to you sir",

People with money (but not too much of it) will choose Sephora, and people even with even more money go to much higher-end fancy pants places.\n\nAmerica is basically a K-shape \"recovery\" and increasingly bifurcated socioeconomic classes: there's the \"Premium Consumer\" and \"The Masses\". Notice every Quarterly Earnings report basically says things like *\"The premium consumer remains healthy, our high end airport experience lounges are up 69% /// We reduced volume by 19.8% this year but revenue is up 23.5% thanks to price-optimization increases targeting the Premium Consumer /// Our premium platinum lines are yielding 9.8% increased profits as luxury consumer flock to our organic premium lines\"*\n\nIf your corporate business relies on selling goods to The Masses, has high overhead, and only juiced by raising prices as volume decline, then it's going into the dunk tank sooner or latter. If your corporate business relies on the Premium Consumer, you are in a better spot as long as you keep your image and brand appeal high toward them.",
