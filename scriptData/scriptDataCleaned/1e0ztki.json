It has generally been between $200 billion to $300 billion since 2021 or $60-$90 in per share terms,\" they say.\n\nThat means that Tesla's current valuation is mostly tied up in hopes outside the auto business. UBS broke that into Tesla Energy, artificial intelligence, full self driving, robotaxis and the Optimus robot.\n\n\"We believe TSLA stock price has gotten caught up in the AI trade/phenomenon. While we don't doubt Tesla is making very good progress on such initiatives, aside from FSD (we were impressed by recent improvement), the other initiatives are purely R&D,\" the analysts said.\n\nUBS valued energy at $18 per share, FSD at $9 a share and robotaxis at $9 a share.\n\n\"Going back to our earlier TSLA valuation attribution analysis, on average over the past 2-years, the market has assigned $490bn of value ($141/share) to ex-auto initiatives.
