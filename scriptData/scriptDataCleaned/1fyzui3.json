      "body": "> Andrew Left is facing SEC fraud charges for allegedly making misleading statements on social media to manipulate stock prices for profit. He claims there’s no rule requiring him to disclose his personal trades, arguing that his « extreme » target prices were often accurate and not misleading. His lawyer frames the SEC’s actions as an infringement on free speech.",
