                  "body": "Exactly. If you think a stock is going up, you buy the stock. If you would rather engage in a leveraged play of that bet, you buy an option. That's all it is. \n\nOptions allow you to allocate a smaller amount of capital to a directional bet, and still reap a significant amount of the award. \n\nThe more out of the money (less likely) the stock is from the price you target, the more it will pay out. \n\nThe one major difference between stocks/options is that (generally) stocks don't expire. An option does. If your grandmother gives you $700K and you buy Intel, and the next day it goes down 20%, you can resign yourself to sitting on that stock for a decade hoping it will recover. This is not without penalty, as there is an opportunity cost to doing so by letting your money be idle. \n\nHowever, with an option, you could literally lose the entire $700k within weeks or months. You might not have the luxury of waiting for the stock to recover.\n\nOne way that people combine these two things together is through LEAPS. If you want a very safe option play, you buy very long dated ones that are deep in the money. This gives you a longer time horizon to realize your profit, while simultaneously offering you the chance to commit less capital to the investment (ie. Leverage). \n\nThis is actually a primary strategy that Pelosi's husband uses. \n\nThanks for the award ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|heart_eyes)",
