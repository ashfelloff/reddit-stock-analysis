  "title": "Tax-Free Guaranteed 8% Return through IRS Overpayment Hack?",
  "score": 924,
  "selftext": "Can a tax guy tell me if I’m an autist or a genius? You’re required to make quarterly estimated tax payments as a business owner. If you underpay, the IRS charges a penalty based on the current interest rate. But, from my understanding, they pay you the same interest on any amount you overpay. In past years, rates were low (like 3-5%). But now with rates being high, it’s 8%! \n\nSo, can I just make a massive overpayment before April 15th for 2024’s taxes and then just earn a tax-free 8% interest backed by the US government until next year’s tax return when they refund you for the overpayment?\n\nE.g. I expect to owe $10k in federal taxes for 2024. I pay $40k when the first quarterly estimated payment is due (April 15, 2024). Will I earn 8% interest on the $30k extra I paid all the way until next April, 2025? ",

      "body": "If 45 days pass from the due date of the original return (April 15) and your refund is not issued, then the refund accrues interest at the 8% rate (which is determined on a quarterly basis) from April 15 to the refund schedule date. This calculation is suspended if the return is found to be incomplete and credit interest is then suspended. If you make an extremely large overpayment and request the refund, and we happen to hold this refund for a processable return, then it's possible we owe you interest from the original due date to when it's paid out.\n\nSometimes the overpayment can be held for years if we receive such payment not declared on the original return. The reason we might hold the refund is that we believe you are filing an amendment or we believe the undeclared payments are questionable, i.e. the payment is not yours or possible identity theft with the return filed.\n\nAdditionally if you file an amendment (1040X)  within the limitation period of 3 years from the original due date of the return including extensions, and claim a prepaid credit (EITC/AOTC/Child Tax Credit/misapplied ES payment, etc.) that was not originally claimed on the return the Service is obligated to pay you interest on a timely filed return to the refund schedule date. This also applies to a increased deductions resulting in a tax decrease.\n\nThe opposite is also true. You file an amendment showing a tax increase. You make the payment immediately on filing the 1040X. You now owe underpayment interest against the increased tax shown on the return from the original due date. If you do not pay the balance by the 23c date (first formal balance notice saying you now owe x amount that must be paid by x date) you then are liable for a failure to pay penalty calculated from the original due date in partial or whole months to the payment receive date. See Notice 746 on irs.gov.\n\nNow consider the overpayment interest against a quarter billion dollar refund that we hold for a year ;)",

To make it really absurd, they can take over a 1 to 2  years to actually finish investigating you and paying out that refund due to understaffing. \n\nCase in point \n\nI filed our companies 941s every quarter, but then quickly found out about the Employee Retention Credits and FMLA/SICK leave credits, and had to file a slew of 941-X to request refunds. \n\nThey dragged that out nearly 2 years to process. \n\nNot only have I gotten most of those returns, I was given 8% interest. I was in total shock, and the joke is around here we need to overpay more often then file 941-X after a year or two. \n\nAs of right now, I'm still waiting on them to process 1 941-X from 2022 and all four from 2023. They keep mailing letters that they are working on it. Meanwhile, interest accrues. \n\nThe best thing is they have to manually key in 941-X, you cant file those online. So someone there has to manually key in the 941-X on their end as well. Someone got slippy fingers and keyed in a refund that was more than our yearly sales - quickly caught that mistake but not quick enough.  I Got a letter in the mail to expect a refund of 5 Million and interest paid of 111,000. which no, it isn't 8%, but it was it was mere minutes between them keying in their mistake, discovering it, and then cancelling it I was told on the phone.
