  "selftext": "We are almost ½ way mark to the year. Equities have roared on the back of AI/GAI fever. Fed has so far dilly dallied on interest rate cuts and bond yields [baring some dips] have stayed high. Gold/cryptos are [or are on brink] of testing new highs. Inflation has proven to be sticky but job openings have so far given no major cause of concern.\n\nSo we might take a moment to consider on the state of the market and what investment/trading opportunities are available in the market.\n\nNVIDIA: after raining investors with tons of money this year, stock split happened on Monday [and it suddenly feels so wallet friendly]. Analysts are busy revising target price with BofA stating new price target of 145 US$ [current price: 120$].\n\nEnergy Stocks/ETFs: Crude Oil has come off post OPEC+ meeting in first week of June. Stocks of energy companies had corrected but now are slowly inching up. A great time to own energy stocks like Valero, Hess, Occidental or Energy ETFs.\n\nFinancial Stocks: Financial stocks currently appear over valued [high PE] and may face strong headwinds if Fed persists with 'higher for longer'. \nStay away and/or buy PUTs on select stocks like Goldman Sachs, American Express, XLF etc.\n\nMeme Stocks: are all rage. While the interest from retail investors is strong so prudence will not hurt in the long run. \nUse ATM Call or Put options [depending on your views] to improve your chances of earning a decent returns.\n\nCHUBB: Warren Buffet revealed his secret stock in May. Insurance company with strong past performance. This stock is still relatively undervalued and anyone looking for steady returns may consider adding to his/her portfolio.\n\nConclusion: Equities are at or near all time high. To reach further heights, a more accomodative action from Fed is required. \nTill then, diversify portfolio by adding Nvidia, VDE, & Chubb. Shed financial stocks and dabble in meme stocks with caution.",
