  "selftext": "I started [4 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibhpo2/psa_leverage_margin_and_proper_diversification/) with my $400K Leveraged Smart Beta account. I [resurfaced ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1b0uoga/i_borrowed_4m_in_derivatives_to_invest_too_crazy/)at $1.1M. **Now it's a $1.3M account with $645K in gains.**\n\n[Ending Value - Net = $645K of Gains](https://preview.redd.it/sc6zmxmnyy9d1.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=1b8b3e3416922812a844f4e3db3b7c61cc3eea7a)\n\nIn these past 4 months, I made another +$145K. So you know the drill, I borrowed another $200K and now total borrowing is at an ATH of $4.2M. **Total long exposure is nearly $5.3M so that's 4:1 leverage.**\n\nMy leverage is now LOWER than 4 months ago, when it was 5:1. My portfolio is making so much money that it delevers me by itself. **I could borrow another $1.2M to get back to 5:1 leverage but I am being cautious and responsible because stocks are at ATHs.**\n\n[Here are the returns compared to the market](https://imgur.com/vdaNEoU) (I am up +130% while market is up 60% so still keep beating the market by more than twice as much). [Here are the positions as always](https://imgur.com/uDiXeD2). And [here is the guide I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mtmfkk/drydrink_portfolio_guide_to_leveraged_smartbeta/) more than 3 years ago detailing how to make all of this money.",
