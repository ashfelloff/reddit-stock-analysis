          "body": "Modeza’s „sugar ant method“ sounds like the perfect analogy for r/WallStreetBets—just pure randomness masquerading as strategy. Honestly, it’s not far off from the actual approach some people there take, except in this case, at least the ants have an instinctual sense of direction. It’s like they’ve embraced the chaos so much that their idea of market analysis is straight-up letting insects handle it. \n\nIt’s the ultimate WSB move: „Why bother with research, when you can just let nature run its course? Ants can’t be worse than my last three ‘gurus’ anyway.“ Who knows, maybe Modeza is onto something, because at this rate, the sugar ant method might actually outperform half the sub’s “diamond hands” plays.",
