But if it's good enough to screenshot it's good enough to sell. I still think this company is going to go down further personally but probably going to hold off on buying more puts to see if it recovers a bit to secure them at a cheaper price before CRWD earnings coming up in September as I expect the stock to tank even further from guidance + news from lawsuits incoming.",
