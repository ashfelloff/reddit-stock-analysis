PSA don’t play ER … don’t play options … your chances of success are blindfolded w a loaded gun in your hands. Or a bible. ",

I made a pretty crazy gain and was really hooked. But after that was just downhill and lost all of it and some more. I got really beatup and just left altogether. \n\nI came back last year and saw the market and everything was just crazy high.

The person saying you’ll never be profitable tried to day trade/do options and they failed. Since they failed it must mean it isn’t possible for anyone to be profitable.\n\n2. The person saying you’ll never be profitable spent decades learning and lost large amounts of money before becoming profitable and finds it insulting someone believes they’ll be profitable quickly which absolutely happens. Either that or they’re gatekeeping.\n\nDon’t listen to anyone saying you can’t do it. Become very knowledgeable on the subject and manage your risk. I wish you the best. May God bless you.",
