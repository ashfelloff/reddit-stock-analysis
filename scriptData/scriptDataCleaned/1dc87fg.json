                              "body": "there's no point in doing that because there's no historical precedence to compare that to. PE ratio is supposed to compare apples to apples. You can't exclude all the growth stocks (which are supposed to provide the earnings growth for the index), and compare it against the past where all the growth stocks are still included (and forward PE was between 14-17 during the 2010s decade, when the Fed was still doing QE). You'd also remove 1/3 of the index weight as well. Frankly, if you exclude the mag7, I think the forward PE should be at most 15, probably closer to 12-13\n\nIf you want to justify buying individual stocks, you compare that PE against history or its peers. You don't need to use the index to justify it.\n\nRussell 2000 today has a large share of unprofitable zombie companies relative to its past. But I don't use it to talk about the market as a whole.\n\nI think mid cap has the most compelling arguments today. Not susceptible to refinance risk as small cap, mostly US domestic so not too affected by geopolitics, not as heavy weighted by megacap as large cap, and if AI is real and not a bubble, it should benefit average businesses, which would be more mid cap. If it only benefits the large cap or certain sector like software, then it's not really as revolutionary as everyone says it is, in which case mid cap would have less downside because it hasn't really priced in the AI hype yet. The AI pick & shovel trade is kinda overhyped now. If AI is real, you better identify which business it'd actually benefit.",
