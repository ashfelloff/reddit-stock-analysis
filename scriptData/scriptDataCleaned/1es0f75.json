  "selftext": "* July CPI rose 2.9% over the last 12 months lower than the expected 3.0%\n* This CPI is probably the most important for this year as it will likely be the clear indicator for the Fed interest rate to pivot.\n* July nonfarm payroll employment edged up by 114,000, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3 percent.  (Latest monthly jobs report: Non-farm payrolls: +114,000 vs. the expected +175,000; Unemployment rate: 4.3% vs. the expected 4.1%)\n* The probability of a Fed interest rate cut of 25 to 50 basis points is getting higher and higher.\n* The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) increased 0.2 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, after declining 0.1 percent in June, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 2.9 percent before seasonal adjustment.\n* The index for shelter rose 0.4 percent in July, accounting for nearly 90 percent of the monthly increase in the all items index. The energy index was unchanged over the month, after declining in the two preceding months. The index for food increased 0.2 percent in July, as it did in June. The food away from home index rose 0.2 percent over the month, and the food at home index increased 0.1 percent. \n* The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.2 percent in July, after rising 0.1 percent the preceding month. Indexes which increased in July include shelter, motor vehicle insurance, household furnishings and operations, education, recreation, and personal care. The indexes for used cars and trucks, medical care, airline fares, and apparel were among those that decreased over the month.\n* The all items index rose 2.9 percent for the 12 months ending July, the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021. The all items less food and energy index rose 3.2 percent over the last 12 months and was thesmallest 12-month increase in that index since April 2021. The energy index increased 1.1 percent for the\n* In July, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers rose 0.2 percent, seasonally adjusted, and rose 2.9 percent over the last 12 months, not seasonally adjusted. The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.2 percent in July (SA); up 3.2 percent over the year (NSA).\n\nThe economy would benefit drastically if the interest hike started to turn around which is the most likely move that the Fed would take in September's meeting.\n\nLoans are much less likely to go on to default as inflation comes down.\n\nA study by credit agency TransUnion has shown that inflation pushes borrowers with low FICO scores to default. Default is always a concern for investors of lending institutions.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell is more likely to cut the rate this year sooner than later as inflation comes down.\n\nThe CPI report, interest rate hikes, house prices and rents, wage growth, job openings, unemployment rate, international conflicts, and trade wars all play a significant role in guiding the market's microenvironment.\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)",

Businesses rely on debt and debt is locked in for years. So really you have to wait a long time for the impact of lower rates to be felt by businesses. Existing debt has to mature and roll off the books and refinanced at lower rates. I wouldn't expect 50 or 100 bps of rate cuts to have any near term effect on labor market. I think we have a ways to go yet until we know if the Fed can actually nail a soft landing. They have always been successful with taming inflation, but the economy is not something that can be \"managed\" easily. It has momentum and many factors that influence it that are hard to balance. The Fed has pretty much always botched the soft landing in the past. And if the Fed cuts too aggressively it could be self fulfilling prophecy. People and businesses will be freaked by the large cuts and start saving and hoarding money instead of spending.",

      "body": "The Fed fiddles with interest rates, while US debt burns down the world...\n\n# U.S. debt just hit a record $35 trillion\n\nThis nation’s gross cumulative debt has hit $35 trillion — a number so large, the International Monetary Fund warns that this is unstainable. But it’s hard to even imagine what the number 35 trillion looks like. So, say you had 35 trillion actual dollar bills, and you put them end to end, starting from the Earth’s surface. How far up would those dollars reach? Like, maybe, the moon? As it turns out, the moon is not even that big of a jump. It only takes about 2.5 billion dollar bills to get from Earth to the moon. It’s no wonder the IMF is worried: U.S. debt has boldly gone where no human has gone before.\n\n“Yeah, $35 trillion is really a big number,” said Peter Blair Henry, an economist at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. To get a sense of just how big the number is, Blair Henry says that you would need to take our dollar bill trail out into the solar system.\n\nCall it “Debt Trek.” Our $35 trillion debt is so huge, our trail of dollars would breeze past Mars, which is 140 million miles away (roughly 1.5 trillion dollar bills). The next planet out: Jupiter, the giant of the solar system. But not nearly giant enough. (It takes roughly 4.5 trillion bills to reach Jupiter.) Next up: Saturn. But at a measly 9 trillion bills away, on average, even Saturn can’t put a ring on U.S. debt.\n\nWe continue to the outer planets. We pass Uranus and arrive at Neptune. Neptune is just under 30 trillion dollar bills away. We’ve reached the last official planet in our solar system, and we still have about $6 trillion in debt to go. Keep in mind, a dollar bill is just over 6 inches long, and 35 trillion of them would reach Pluto. I ran the calculations over and over again because, truly, I was stunned at the absolute absurdity of the size of the US debt. \n\nBlair Henry said. “What really matters is: How big is the debt relative to the size of the economy?” And our debt, which has been piling up for decades, is $35 trillion. Right now, our debt-to-GDP ratio is around 120%. We owe a lot more than we’re actually making — that’s what worries Blair Henry.\n\n“As your debt ratio rises, your financing problems just start getting tighter and tighter,” he said. “And the danger is, at some point, your creditors look at your debt situation and say, ‘Oh my gosh! You are not going to be able to repay me.’” So those creditors will start demanding higher interest rates when they lend money. “Your borrowing costs go up dramatically, and that will ultimately lead to a financial crisis,” Blair Henry said.\n\nIn fact, that has already started to happen. For the U.S., borrowing costs were really low for a long time. The government could basically borrow money for free because people were confident the country would pay it back. The size of the debt didn’t seem to matter. But as that debt has ballooned, lenders have started demanding higher interest rates from the U.S. “We’ve hit a turning point,” said Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff.\n\nRogoff was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund for years. He calls the rising US debt a huge economic problem. “This is the biggest thing that’s happened in the global economy in the last 10 years,” he said. That’s because the U.S. has practically-Pluto debt, so even a small jump into more debt gets galactic real fast. “The interest payments that we have to make on U.S. debt have soared,” he added. “I think the interest payments alone is now the equivalent of our US military budget.”\n\nThis year, the interest bill is expected to approach $1 trillion. That’s $1 trillion we can’t spend, for instance, on roads, health care or growing the economy. Our debt isn’t just big, it is now draining our economic resources.   \n\n“People got this idea that it was just free — ‘Don’t worry about what your debt is!’” said Rogoff. “That’s the big change that’s happened in the world, is a bucket of cold water on this idea that debt doesn’t matter. A debt this large, if left unchecked would ultimately obliterate our economy.”",

I don't think YOU know how taxes work. People who retire are no longer earning an income and thus are no longer paying those taxes out of their paychecks. And they also become net tax entitlement recipients. \n\n>This is false. Younger generations have been outpacing previous generations in retirement contributions. This is easily verifiable with a quick Google search.\n\n>No, it's not false at all. Younger generations are not as large as the retiree generations (baby boomers). And they are also not having children. The entire world is on the verge of a population collapse that will see the global population shrink faster than the Black Death. This is a fact that cannot be disputed and it also cannot be changed. By 2030 there will be more retirees in the world than people being born. By 2080 there will be more people dying in the world than being born. \n\n>This is honestly the funniest thing I've ever read on this sub, and I've read a lot of stupid stuff.

The largest and swiftest population explosion in all of human history (which is over). While at the same time the most secure and globalized world history has ever seen (with all the world's trade routes protected). That has never happened before in huma history. And you -- in your foolishness -- think it's just going to CONTINUE like that? When we are now facing the largest population collapse in history? A mass population die off on par with the black plague? This isn't \"DOOMER\" It's reality. You think a return to hisorical norms in markets is \"doomer\" -- that shows your recency bias. 100 years -- a blip in history -- is not something you should base your investment decisions on, especially when thousands of years of history are available for you to compare to the current cycle we're in. \n\n>You will continue to underperform with this mindset.

However if a soft landing is achieved then yes this time may be different as we have never played out these set of circumstances before.\n\nSo again - don’t confuse causality with correlation and don’t be so certain with your predictions. One way or another you will be humbled.\n\nEDIT - I also just realised your ‘100% crash post-fed pivot’ statistic is completely wrong just using recent memory. Look at the covid crash - March 2020 the fed pivoted and cut interest rates to zero which coincided with the bottom of that particular bear market and led to an almost 2 year long bull run. \n\nA second example is in late 2018 the fed announced planned rate hikes but in the summer of 2019 pivoted and cut rates three times  - stimulating another 2 year bull run (until the covid crash). \n\nHave you only been investing for the last year?",

In recent recessions the increasing affordability is accompanied by an increase in supply and decreasing prices due to rising unemployment or waiting for better rates. If the Fed begins cutting in September I think we quickly see the shelter input drop to negative on the monthlies & that will put total CPI hurtling to 0 (which, when it gets hit on an annual basis, has coincided with Feds putting the funds rate to 0).",
