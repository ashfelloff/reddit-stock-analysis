Technically, you arenâ€™t invest directly into Chinese company. \n\nIâ€™ve been averaging UP since $17, gosh was I a pussy back then. You can tell with the 2016.Jan call. \n\nThis stock already did reverse split in 2022, 20-1, basically itâ€™s like $1~2 dollar. If you think Chinese index is going lower than $1~2, you are crazy. \n\n",
