  "selftext": "Disclaimer: I’m a potato who is morbidly stupid and obese. Don’t listen to me. Do your own DD.\n\nTL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it’s undervalued with huge forward looking potential.\n\nFour main points:\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly\n2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses\n3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue\n4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume\n\nNovo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight & live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they’ll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can’t make money? I’ll tell you how degens\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly\n\nNovo Nordisk:\n\n\n\n* Market cap: 436 B\n* Net Sales Growth: +31%\n   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%\n   * Net Profit Growth: +51%\n* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion\n* Net Profit Margin: 36%\n\nEli Lilly:\n\n\n\n* Market cap: 745 B\n* Net sales growth: +20%\n   * Earnings per share: -16%\n   * Net profit Change: -16%\n* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion\n* Net Income Margin: 15.3%\n\nComparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn’t mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don’t short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly’s out of the water.\n\nHell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.\n\nThe numbers speak for themselves.\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses\n\nIn their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first “approved weight management medicine \\[that\\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death” is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a “priority review”.\n\nWhy is this a big deal?\n\nBecause according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.\n\nThat means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue\n\nDemand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.\n\nThe biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they’re heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.\n\n“If you produce it, they will come”\n\n\n\n1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume\n\nToday, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.\n\nBut Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.\n\nNow if you’re too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.\n\nThere are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.\n\nThe other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.\n\nSo yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vbky7tdz2btc1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=fa5c86207f4ff364b409f709c6255f6c1f42868b",
