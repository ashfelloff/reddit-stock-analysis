  "selftext": "I think a lot of people fundamentally don't understand how monumental the rescheduling of marijuana is. I'm going to lay it out here for you:\n\nMarijuana is going to be rescheduled from a controlled substance 1 to a 3. You may have heard that this puts in the same schedule as things like Tylenol, but so what, right? Why should I care, short that news! No, and I'll tell you why.\n\n1. Rule 280E. This is the bane of the marijuana industry and is the number one reason why businesses have struggled. It states that any business that touches a schedule 1 drug cannot participate in federal programs or benefit from federal tax breaks. This is why the industry pays 40% + in federal taxes, and a total tax rate being in the 60% range in some states. This law will no longer apply to marijuana! That means a double digit tax break industry wide! That means growth and profits like the industry has never seen.\n2. Marijuana businesses will have broader access to regular banking. That means lower rates to borrow. Refinancing debt to lower rates. No more risky cash only businesses. That means growth and profits on a massive scale.\n3. Marijuana will now be able to be shipped across state lines in the mail.\n\nAll of this together will create a boom for the marijuana industry and stocks. It is hard to overstate the impact of the DEA's decision. When this becomes law, cannabis stocks are going to fly. The valuations of every marijuana stock will go up, and there will be a new floor. There are a lot of FUDsters out there trying to scare retail away from these stocks. You saw them short the heck out of them today. They know what is coming and are trying to bring the stocks down so they can get in themselves.\n\n[https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-reclassification-biden-garland-dea-3c9478472e124c7aaa9b934270b0d450](https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-reclassification-biden-garland-dea-3c9478472e124c7aaa9b934270b0d450)\n\nPlace ridiculous snarky uninformed comments below:",
