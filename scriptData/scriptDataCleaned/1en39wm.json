  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "> Eli Lilly & Co. lifted its 2024 sales outlook for the second time this year as its blockbuster weight-loss drug Zepbound outsold expectations. \n\n> Full-year revenue will be $45.4 billion to $46.6 billion, the company said Thursday in a statement, up from its earlier guidance that topped out at $43.6 billion. Adjusted earnings for the year will be $16.10 to $16.60 a share.\n\n> The Indianapolis-based drugmaker’s stock rose as much as 10% before US markets opened. They have gained 32% since the start of the year through Wednesday’s close amid an insatiable demand for its weight-loss and diabetes medicines.\n\n> Lilly and rival Novo Nordisk A/S have both struggled with manufacturing as prescription rates soar. While Novo continues to limit starting doses of its drug Wegovy, Lilly’s supply woes are starting to ease. The company has said the situation would improve substantially in the second half of the year as it increased production capacity.\n\n> Novo reported disappointing second-quarter sales of Wegovy on Wednesday, saying price concessions for companies that manage prescription drug benefits in the US cut into its performance. Investors pushed down shares amid worries that the growing competition with Lilly would continue to crimp prices. ",
