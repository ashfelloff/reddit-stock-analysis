A call is when you gamble that the stock will go up from its price and hit a certain $ value you guess. A put is the opposite where you gamble that  stock will lose value and go down. In either case you arenâ€™t actually buying shares of the stock, you are buying the bet. That bet is on 100 shares minimum as a 100 share bet on the stock going up or down is referred to as 1 contract. Itâ€™s a bit complicated and really just shouldnâ€™t be used at all. Itâ€™s easy enough to make money just buying and selling shares, you wonâ€™t skyrocket your gains this way but by buying shares you protect your gamble because there is no set date that you have to sell for a loss on shares where as a call or a put you must denote an expiration date and your $1k gamble could go to $0 if nothing happens by the final day.",
