  "selftext": "What's the long term view of nuclear energy? As of today, nuclear fission start-up $OKLO was approved to merge with SPAC $ALCC: [Bloomberg Altman-backed Nuclear Developer Nabs Approval](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-07/altman-backed-nuclear-developer-nabs-approval-for-spac-merger?leadSource=reddit_wall)\n\n*\\* For anyone interested here on reading more here is the company:* [*OKLO*](https://oklo.com/overview/default.aspx)\n\n\n\nLooking at some of the biggest nuclear companies like **Cameco ($CCJ)** and **General Electric ($GE)** over the last few years the perception has shifted significantly. Over the last 5 years both stocks are up over **230% and 380%** respectively. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dnlnta9141zc1.png?width=1448&format=png&auto=webp&s=b75a8204ddf3df5c5a38a8f91e99da7362b1ab9d\n\n**Some interesting facts regarding the market as a whole:**\n\n- Nuclear energy provides about 10% of the world's electricity from about 440 power reactors ([World Nuclear Association](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/nuclear-power-in-the-world-today#:~:text=Nuclear%20energy%20now%20provides%20about,of%20the%20total%20in%202020))\n\n- In terms of usage nuclear energy accounted for about 20% of US electricity generation in 2023 ([EIA.Gov](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3#:~:text=About%2019%25%20was%20from%20nuclear,solar%20photovoltaic%20systems%20in%202023))\n\n- The US is the top nuclear energy producer in the world - the industry contributes $60 billion to the US GDP annually ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/18-countries-produce-most-nuclear-195118024.html))\n\n\n\nWhat is the long term view of $OKLO as a nuclear fission company? What are the major regulatory factors that will hold nuclear back in the next 5-10 years? What kinds of societal shifts/perceptions need to happen for nuclear to become an accepted major source of energy? What pure nuclear plays would you consider?\n\nHere's an interesting graphic comparing OKLO to other clean energy companies: [Reddit - $OKLO/$ALCC](https://www.reddit.com/r/ALCCstock/comments/1cmdwso/core_differance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)\n\nTLDR: Nuclear stocks up bigly, $OKLO 🚀, but what is the long-term view of the industry...",

Cameco doesn’t even make reactors, they’re a miner… GE makes large reactors, although they are working on small modular reactors.\n\nThe problem with investing in nuclear start ups is the NRC. The application process is long and it will be years before commercially viable models will be on the market. The bureaucracy of the US will have bad headwinds on this industry. NuScale power has a SMR almost done with the approval process, but they changed something with the output power and it’s set them back two years. \n\nNot to mention I thought I saw something that Oklo got their combined license got denied by the NRC…",
