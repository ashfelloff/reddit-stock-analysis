The fact that Quantum Computers work and we have made so much progress with them, supports the idea that superposition has practical applications, even if some people misunderstand what physicist mean by it. \n\nQuantum Mechanical (Heisenberg) Uncertainty Principle means that when we collapse the wave function, that we can never truly know two properties of that wave at the same time. Position and Momentum can be known separately but not at the same time.\n\nSuperposition just means that we can combine two quantum states like we combine waves, and create one result. Thus the interference pattern created by light and electrons.\n\nThe problem with Schrodinger's cat is that the radiation will occur at aome point, but the observe won't know if it has occured. We have observed radioactive particles shooting out of a source. The uncetainty is only from the observer's point of view, but it doesn't change when the cat is killed. We know that on the Macro scale, Quantum Mechanics breaks down, that is what Schrodinger is trying to illustrate. However, those micro states affect macro states, and we can actually prove that.",
