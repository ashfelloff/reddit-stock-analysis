Their CPU for AM4 sockets and 4 CPUs for AM5 socket that too from July 2024 seems great. 9900 with 5.6GHz with only 65W TDP is mind blowing.\n\nHow on earth is AMD able to increase the GHz, core count and decrease the power consumption byv50%\n\nNVDA one was fine but Jensen seemed more like blabbering this time. Nothing for gamers on Blakwell (seems they just want to milk AI for now). Also didn't like where Jensen kept on saying 'We have glued 2 Blackwells with 45x TFLOPs increase but only 10x power consumption increase'. They are going Intel route gluing chips, ignoring power consumption factor. Sooner or later over next 2 generations they'll hit roadblock just like Intel got hit with 11th Gen series and then barely went upto 14th Gen by gluing. I expect NVDA must be aware of it and would solve it but today's glued Blackwell GPUs (He even showed water cooled GPUs) will not fly for long in future. Power consumption /TDP wattage is a big big factor nowadays. Maybe META can afford billion $ power bills but not medium size companies. NVDA got to come up with a 'lesser power hungry architecture' or in next 2 yrs they'll face issues. They had same issues with GTX and RTX series as well.\n\nAll I could see was AMD's chiplet architecture does favor them. AMD had CPUs for gamers and MI Cards for AI. They seemed to have worked on their material this time. Time will tell in next 1-2 yrs how much TDP wattage each company reduces in future.    \n\n######For now holding both NVDA and AMD long. NVDA does feel threatened and was visible in the presentation. Rubin name reveal especially with comments from Jensen  that 'We are far from it but I want you guys to take a picture and share it wherever u can' seemed like a forced marketing to show they are leaders. (When u are forced to show you are a leader means you are feeling threatened)",

Though maybe this wasn't communicated to vendors before they purchased MI300, in which case you would expect to see MI300 revenue decline in coming quarters.\n \nAround the same time Microsoft stated MI300 provides best perf/dollar performance for GPT4. You're free to believe Microsoft is flat out lying, but it's not really the most compelling argument considering the explosive growth of MI300 revenue.  What is an open question, is what the ratio of workloads share this edge.\n\n\nNow of course NVidia could cut prices to recover the price/perf lead, they have plenty of room to move there.
