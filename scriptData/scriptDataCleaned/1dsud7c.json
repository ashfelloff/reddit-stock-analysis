They can raise prices on their shoe sets, but they can't increase quantity without destroying it.\n\nOk, now for some fun posting: What they needed to do was to sell welded shut shoe boxes for mega $$$. You pull a tab and a magnesium strip ignites, unwelding the box. You pull it open and find out which shoe you get! They can have the usual commons, rares, ultra rares, foil shoes, etc.",
