It wasn't so much that I was confident, as I was more than okay with risking $60 for even a little price action. If AAPL was sideways today, I probably would've just held to zero. It wasn't a DD driven research play, it was a gamble heavily lopsided towards the upside, so I bought in and it worked.",

It happened faster than I thought , I was going to sit on them for a week at least, but I got in just before the big run up.  I sold on my goal  which was 5 per contract (4.98) I could have held out longer I suppose and possibly made another 10k in a week , but 4x yur money in day or two on options 3 weeks out i've learned , you take your gains .... especially on a stock like aapl that doesnt move much.\n\ngood luck to you as well!",
