  "selftext": "Admittedly I don't do deep DD on my investments. I invest in what I know and/or like and/or trust, and that I think is currently trading at a good valuation. In fact two of my better recent investments were $NVEI and $CJT. I'm up 25% on $NVEI in only a few months, and the basis of my DD for investing was I heard Ryan Reynolds invested in it. And I'm up 22% on $CJT in a few weeks only, and that was based on the student investment club at my alma mater recommending it in a case competition that they won.\n\nSo with that disclaimer in mind, my latest investment in $BCE. What's my rationale? It is a blue chip, very stable Canadian company. $40b market cap in an industry dominated by a few players only. It is currently trading at a 5 year low, so this is about as cheap as you can get it. And because of that you also pick up an almost 10% dividend yield on it!!! If I can get something blue chip paying a 10% yield at a discounted price, I'm happy to sit on this at these lows, collect a good dividend, and wait for the market to strength and valuations start to rise back up at least to historical levels if not more. And even if they don't rise, I'm still getting my 10% dividend and I'm happy with that.\n\nWhy aren't people getting in to BCE at these low prices and with this dividend yield?",
