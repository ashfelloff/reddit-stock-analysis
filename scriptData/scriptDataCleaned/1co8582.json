                              "body": "Photolithography is using light to draw patterns on the wafer. Just like how you can draw finer features with a 0.5mm pencil than with a sharpie, the narrower the wavelength of light you use, the smaller the features you can make. Blue light is in the 400 nm range, DUV (deep) is in the 200 nm range, and EUV (extreme) in the 10 nm range. During photolithography, light is produced by lasers and then focused with lenses. ASML is the only photolithography equipment manufacturer who figured out how to make EUV commercially viable. As for why? My understanding is as light wavelength decreases, it starts to interact with glass lenses and air itself, producing artifacts and losing energy, so the process was not commercially viable. However, ASML has a close partnership with Zeiss and through joint R&D was able to make incredibly smooth mirrors, and using those mirrors and clever engineering, get the desired wavelength.\n\nMany other tool makers, such as Canon and Lam, make blue and DUV range photolithography machines. If you're producing chips for machines that don't require next generation computing power, like toasters, those machines are more than sufficient. Those companies may also have segments that produce equipment for other parts of the semiconductor manufacturing process, eg Amat makes CVD (chemical vapor deposition) and Lam makes plasma etch equipment.",

Semiconductor manufacturing involves a ton more than just photolithography, which is ASMLs niche. \n\nWithout getting too complicated, the rest of the steps generally fall into one of the following categories: deposition (of materials that go into the final product or protection layers) via chemical bath, vapor, plasmas and many others; removal via etching/milling using similar means as deposition; or metrology/inspection to measure and quality control the built features. There are also a ton of washing steps.  \n\nThe patterns drawn via photolithography expose layers underneath which then dictates where the deposition and removal steps work. Those processes are generally also bulk processes so they affect the entirely of the wafer, and rely on differing chemical properties of the exposed vs unexposed areas.  \n\nThe main reason photolithography gets all the press is it's the limiting step in how small the drawn features get, which thus limits the number of transistors you can cram onto a chip, which largely dictates computing power. \n\nedit. Also chip design is really f\\*cking hard",

It's a great solvent and is the backbone of acid/base chemistry.\n\nMany of the removal steps (and deposition) rely on the different chemical properties of various materials when exposed to same removal (and deposition) agent. For example, a photomask, similar to rubber, may readily dissolve in acid but a metal will barely be changed. You can tweak the chemical (or other agent, like heat or UV radiation) being used to achieve the result you want. Between all the steps, that's a ton of water being used.\n\nMany processes also produce tiny particles worth of potential contamination. For example, after an acid bath or a plasma etch, the top layer is removed but there may still be tiny microparticle sized \"dust\" remnants on the wafer. In the building of especially important features, the wafer may be extensively washed with ultrapure water to ensure there is zero contamination.",

Each unit costs over 500 billion won.\n\n>NA stands for numerical aperture and indicates the ability of an optical system to collect and focus light. The higher the numerical value, the better it is at collecting light, High-NA EUV equipment has their NA increased to 0.55 from 0.33. This basically means the equipment can draw finer circuit patterns.\n\n>Intel is adopting high-NA EUV faster than its rivals to win over customers. The company reentered the foundry market in 2021 but last year the business lost US$7 billion.\n\n>출처 : THE ELEC, Korea Electronics Industry Media(http://thelec.net)",
