I use RSI as my signal if there will be a trend change and MACD and Stochastic RSI as the primary indicator of a sustained reversal. Volume of these are also high so it’s just double checking if a clear reversal from sells to buys is happening. I usually use the 5 minute charts or greater as the main indicator vs the 1 minutes which is better for scalping/short term reversals IMO. \n\nIf RSI is close to or below 30 on the 5 minute and 30 minute charts, if no news is causing the sell off it’s a good bet for a reversal. At that point I set limits of the profits I’m trying to generate (usually $500-$1000 per trade).",
