              "body": "Theoretically, the effects of the BTC halving should kick in 6 months after the BTC halving was effected due to short supply and high demand. So we should see demand for BTC starting to rise sometime in Nov/Dec, and that should mark the start of the halving bull run, which typically lasts about another 6 months at which time it should peak. Though, some believe the BTC ETF's priced in this halvings bull run, so maybe the bull run is done and a long crypto winter has started. However, the Etherium ETF's might be fully approved by July 4th (rumor), and that could trigger a mini bull run. Who knows, but if you paid any attention to crypto back in Aug of 2023 when the BTC ETF's were in the talks, you could have made a shit ton of money. Some alt coins like SOL, DOGE, and SHIB were 12 baggers within a 6 month period. BTC was barely a two bagger but it was the safest bet to nearly doubling your money.",

People buy it for speculation expecting price to go up. Barely anybody uses it for transactions. So the only variable that matters is the price and not the supply.  \n\nBut even if it was true the supply cut went percentually down with each halving. Since 94% of all bitcoin is already mined. The supply from miners is now just such a tiny percentage that it just doesn't matter anymore anyhow",

He wanted it to be a decentralized peer-to-peer payment system.  That‚Äôs not what it is anymore due to the high transaction fees and those will only continue to increase as halvings occur.  I think there are other blockchains that do these things well but btc in my opinion is only serving as a store of wealth.\n\nObviously other chains are interconnected because btc could be the ‚Äúsavings account‚Äù of a crypto wallet which then gets transacted into another currency for quicker and cheaper transactions but bitcoin in and of itself is just another digital fiat currency imo",

          "body": "Yes, it would be great to have a time machine, but Bitcoin's historic run-up is not a great argument for buying in *now*. You would be better off trying to guess the next SOL or SHIB.\n\nBitcoin has gone from under a penny to over $70,000 (briefly), but it has become constrained by its own success.\n\nAt current prices, an 80X run would make Bitcoin more valuable than all stocks traded on US markets. Where is this money coming from, and how would there be sufficient exit liquidity if you want to cash out?  \n  \nIf BTC increased 400X (a fairly boring run compared to past performance), it would suck up *all* the money in the global economy. This includes all government assets, all real estate, all stocks and bonds, all consumer goods, and all precious metals.\n\nI should state that I have *no idea* where Bitcoin will be in five years. It could be a five or ten bagger, or it could go back below $10K.\n\nWhat I *am* saying is it's not going to go up 1,000x or even 100x ever again. If you are expecting those kinds of returns again, you need to look elsewhere.",
