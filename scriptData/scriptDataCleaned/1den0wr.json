Focusing on the company that's actually paying him for the job...\n\nPlus let's be honest, his stake in the company is alredy more than enough of an incentive for him to do the best he can for shareholder price, he wouldn't need an extra, and this win creates a very dangerous precedent that allows the \"star ceo\" to pretty much bully other shareholders into giving up insane compensations.",

They are valued much higher than traditional automotives because of faith in Elon innovating and delivering (robotics, AI).\n\nEdit: Feel free to downvote. This sub is filled with a bunch of gammblers high on mountain dew anyway.\nI would only consider investing in tesla because I believe whoever wins the market of robotics + AI will be the most valuable company of all time. And I believe Elon could build that company. Imagine renting a tesla robot for a 100/day and being able to tell it to do your yard and house work. \n\nWithout Elon, the value for Tesla just isn't there. PE is 4X of Ford, but then with a rapibly declining reputation. Sure, that reputation is also due to Elon, but that is already gone. If he leaves, that reputation is still gone. \n\nThat would be fairly valued at 150 billion. And that, tbh, is being very generous. They could easily fall from 550billion to 50 billion in a few months. But with Elon there.... thats just such a wild card, and the market is so huge between all the things they are working on, that they really could be worth a few trillion if they deliever",

But you can’t just push delivery timeline into perpetuity while competitors catch up and actually book those profits. \n\nTSLA was the only EV for a while. Then it was the only good looking EV for a while. Now it’s really not that competitive with tons of manufacturers releasing multiple variations. \n\nI also have little faith in their robotics division. Not sure how they’ll leap over the tons of companies that have been in this space for a decade or more. Getting 80% of the way there is not that hard. The remaining 20% is where all experience and funding go.",

It's incredible to watch from the outside and see what he gets away with on a daily basis that would land most people in jail. There's way too much money tied up in this for him to have any serious repercussions even when blatantly and publicly manipulating the market.\n\nNow he's manipulating (or at least trying to) shareholder votes and nothing will happen, again. If what he's stating is true, the shareholders don't care. It's unbelievable. He's publicly admitted to behavior targeted at hurting Tesla, has made statements indicating he will destroy the company if he doesn't get what he wants, and yet shareholders are still standing behind him.\n\nIt's like a petulant toddler throwing a tantrum and mommy shareholder is swooping in and coddling them while showering them with ice-cream.

          "body": "Just my $.02, Musk has been a drag on Tesla. In the short term yeh he gives investors a lot of short boosts, but he is too impulsive for long term company health. He really would be awesome as a hype man. \n\nLet me explain my thoughts. Tesla had pretty close to cornered the charger network ecosystem, like wow, this is a huge achievement and that by itself should have been a major focus of the company for long term success and profitability. But then he goes all in and decides to get rid of their entire department because (and this is just from news reporting) the executive in charge of the supercharger department pushed back on making more cuts. Like why isnt their arguably most successful department trying to expand more across the US with more locations, partnerships, new technology, updates and even other markets. Then there is the half assed roll out of the cybertruck, the diminished battery range that is software locked, or the lack of any new passenger models ( the 3 is 7 or 8 years old and the Y is 4 or 5 years old). And where is the full self driving feature that has been promised next month since 2019. Hes a hype man that has been getting by because Tesla cars are far and above what anyone else has in the electric market in spite of him and not because of him. \n\nIf I were in his shoes:\n\n1. Stop promising stuff that isnt ready like FSD until it is actually ready to roll out. Stop building half assed cars for production with  all that new technology/designs (cybertruck). Dont make any crazy announcements unless they are actually ready. \n2. Employ an in house experimental group that just comes out with Tesla concept models, it doesnt need to be anything else other than a group that generates buzz by putting really cool looking bodies over already existing models.  Tesla employees should show up to a high end cars and coffee with a never before seen convertible and just let people oggle over it.  \n3. Figure out how to compartmentalize batteries so that you can replace smaller groups of cells when they fail instead of the whole battery pack, limit those battery compartment costs to $1k so it is somewhat affordable. \n4. Have a continuous plan to refresh each car model every 5 or 6 years so the lineup doesn't get stale, heck it could just be a new body over the continuously update chassis. Have 4 models in the lineup, a pickup, an SUV, a sedan and a cheap sedan. \n5. Introduce a cheap sedan, sub $30k. Have it come with a limited range that is less than the other cars, give it minimal options as a base model. Maybe make it dependent on the tesla charger network instead of home charging. No autopilot, and you can save a ton of design costs by making it only 2wd and based on current models. His pay package can easily cover the cost to create a solid low end car and refresh the rest of the model line. \n6. Prioritize the charger network. There should be a charger in every parking lot and every gas station. you should be able to go to a southerbys or a dollar store and expect to be able to plug in. Then work with every other car company to make sure that they work with the tesla standard chargers.\n7. Challenge BYD in asia. Make a car that will compete in the east. I think china is a lost market because they put their thumb on the scale too much, but make an asian base car that will compete in other asian markets\n\nbut what do I know? I'm just some dude on the internet",
