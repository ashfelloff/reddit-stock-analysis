Guidance can be bullish and the stock still go down.\n\nRight now, because of technical patterns, a lot of investors are expecting a market correction to start any second now. So a company like HOOD can have bullish earnings but still pull back a bit because the initial gap up is a great opportunity to claim profits before the market-wide correction.\n\nOn top of that, everyone is trying to anticipate future earnings, and they want to buy before those earnings come in and sell when they materialize. That's why APPL goes up right before they announce a new product and down when they actually do.\n\nIf you're doing risky, WSB-like short-term trading, you have to trade on human sentiment, not earnings. That's why inversing yourself actually kinda works. When you think a play is a good idea, other people do too, so the demand is high and the price is higher. And, likewise, when it's a bad one, demand does down and the price gets cheaper.",

Market is bullish at the time and then the stock sells off. \nCan guarantee you that guidance and everything else you can think of literally means nothing. All that really matters is did some one buy or sell. If they did then the stock price will move against them because it’s priced by actors who have everyone’s trading data and intend to scalp them. There is literally nothing else that will affect price ever. The only way you can make any money is to know this and then trade the system for what it is. IE: if there’s high likelihood most people will be doing X, you best be doing the opposite. ",

      "body": "Just because a company has good earnings that doesn't automatically mean the stock will go up. Everything in finance is relative to something, whether that's comps or guidance. You also have to understand what the market expectations are. For example, the metrics you compare a financial company is different than how you would compare a tech company. So even if they beat top line and the bottom line, a stock can still go down if it doesn't meet other metrics that the market deems important. For example, if Netflix didn't hit EPS expectations but their subscriber users exceeded expectations, you can see the stock increase because investors deem that metric important for this company.  This is why it's important to understand a company and their business model and what investors look for.",
