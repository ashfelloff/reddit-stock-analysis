                  "body": "If you had asked me two days ago for a coherent bear thesis, I would have said the only out they have is if CPI comes in hot. \n\nWell here we are. Market has been pricing in two to three rate cuts for 2024 since the beginning of the year and now we are forced to finally acknowledge that isn't going to happen. We didn't cut in March, we aren't cutting in April, we are going to be lucky to see 0.50 bp by the end of the year. \n\nWhat does that mean for stonks? Well it depends. This is obviously a huge downside catalyst. However, that does not automatically mean that bears win. What we need to see is meaningful volatility expansion. Show me VIX above 20 and I will believe. \n\nTo trigger a real selloff, the downside catalyst needs to be large enough to cause global macro funds to shift positioning from bullish to bearish. These are funds that look at current market momentum and leverage the fuck up to amplify gains. These funds are all currently positioned bullish. \n\nThere are two key things that trigger systematic deleveraging of CTAs: 1. spot price moves below key levels, and 2. volatility expansion. If you see both, then CTAs in aggregate are selling off their shit and positioning bearish. Once CTAs start selling, everyone follows suit and at that point we are basically selling into a hole. Once that sort of momentum kicks off, nobody is buying. Every strategy sells into this setup - systematic macro, vol dealers, your grandma, everybody. \n\nBut if you don't see a significant volatility spike, macro funds don't give a fuck. They will just buy the dip and so should you.\n\nEdit: What to pay attention to now? Track volatility over the next few days (I mean you should track volatility always but anyway). If it retraces back down there's probably not a bigger selloff coming. The current elevated VIX levels relative to last week are due to downside hedging (read: funds buying puts) after last week's jobs report. It's only if the CPI print causes those hedges to have to unwind that this translates into selling pressure. If there's no big downside kickoff, then the hedges just expire and the market continues upwards. The next meaningful news event is Q1 earnings season. If companies are doing poorly then maybe you get a weak jobs print, which then means a rate cut. Rate cut = stonks go up. But if companies are doing really well, then that means profits growth (likely powered by AI). Investors like profits, stonks go up. Wait a minute, bulls win every time.",

I am just going to point out that the economy doing well and companies earning more money and hiring more people in spite of higher rates suggests that maybe we don't need a ton of rate cuts to have stocks go up.",

So I agree with you, that if Q1 earnings fundamentals are strong, then stocks are going to go up even without rate cuts.\n\nThe bear thesis, funny enough, is probably somewhere in the middle. Companies do well enough that they avoid layoffs (no weakening job market, no non-farm payrolls miss, hence no rate cut), but they don't do well enough to justify high valuations, or are not confident enough to provide strong guidance for the next few quarters. How likely is this? I feel like not very.",

This allowed politicians from all sides to effectively buy votes by increasing \"social welfare\" spending. With a gold standard, the government can't spend more than it has and then everyone would see the true cost of all the entitlements and military spending. I don't see a way of going back to any sort of gold standard because all governments are corrupt and won't want to give the drug of money printing up, but I had to mention it.\n\nThe second problem, and this is something we can easily fix, is that we allowed the corporations to outsource everything to China, India, Vietnam, etc.\nYou want people to have more money in their pockets and for labor to have more power?
