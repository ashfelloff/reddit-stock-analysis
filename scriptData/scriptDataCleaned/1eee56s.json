Had you just bought QQQ in 2010 You would have done amazing. No one knew that, granted, but that outperformed me. \n\nSo the moral of the story, if we look at history, at least from my opinion, is get into something that is working and let it play out. It's the case with QQQ, it's the case with people who bought BTC earlier on, maybe even now? I'm inclined to think it's a little bit more of a trading vehicle right now but who knows?

I guess I’m only halfway through the new year, but I’m absolutely clobbering the markets. Bought cava around 50 dollars, bought the ARM ipo, bought 3x leveraged S&P tracker which is outperforming the market, and over the last month or so I’ve been deep in ASTS, which is my best performer yet. No idea how long I’ll be able to sustain this for. My only Ls were buying intel (already sold for a small loss) and dell (sold for a small loss when I could have held) as a reactionary move to the AI hype/chips act, thinking everyone else had to win as hard as NVDA.",
