  "selftext": "Hi. Recently bought 90 shares of Airbus @131 euro. I bought this as a safer part of my portfolio as I'm not expecting massive gains but feel it has a large moat and the potential to shine due to Boeings problems. Peaking in the 170s quite recently it's trading at quite a discount and a feel Airbus has a chance to improve margins as it can ask more for products whilst Boeing can't deliver on time and when it can doubts arise over quality issues. The current woes of Boeing won't show up as positives in Airbus results untill the aircraft are delivered and profits are booked. In my opinion this is a safe long term investment. What are your views? ",

Toulouse being the only factory with final assembly lines is a thing of the early 2000s.\n\nProducing parts across Europe is a non issue, Europe is tiny. The distance between the factory in Toulouse and any other european Airbus facility is less than half the distance between Boeings facilities in Washington and South Carolina. Between which Boeing did the exact same shit Airbus did, with the exception, that they were forced to consolidate the 787 production in south carolina, because boeings equivalent to the A600 is too small.\n\nWhat are you even ranting about \"lost its vision?\". Airbus supply chain is fucked up, that is not an internal Airbus issue, but primarily stems from turbine deliveries, which Airbus does not even produce.\n\nThey produce superior planes when compared to boeing, to the extent that Boeing had to botch the 737 max together because they completely missed the mark and were unable to compete with the A320 neo. With known consequences.\n\nBoeings military contracts are how old? Jdams since the 90s, B-52 contracts, C-17, all new contracts go to Northrop or Lockheed. Boeing defense is an old mess and struggles severly to stay proftiable.\n\nBoeings P/E? Not even positive since 2019.\n\nI dont know what kind of copium you are smoking, but Boeing would be down the gutter if it wasnt the only US component of a duopoly.\n\nEdit: C-17 instead of C-5.",

A look into Boeings defense products is a look back to the 80s. \n\nBoeing Multirole Fighters F/A 18 and F-15 will be around for a while, but Boeing missed its entry into the new generation, being pushed out by the F-35, F-22. The same with bombers, B-52 and B-1 will be around, but for the future Boeing is pushed out by the B-2, B-21. They missed out on following up on the V-22 and are losing a much larger future contract to the V-280. I can continue, you get the picture. \n\nSo? What other company has a concept for reusable rockets? Airbus secured contracts for satellite development and delivieries anyways, some as lately as less than 2 weeks ago. What is boeing doing in space, except their starliner staying much longer than they anticipated and SpaceX running them in the ground?\n\nPinpointing a lack of vision at Airbus on a specific technical detail of a specific product of the segment that makes up less than 15 % of Airbus revenue is not smart.\n\nYou think your experience during a student job or if you studied in Germany maybe a \"duale Ausbildung\" is in any way representative of Airbus? It is silly dude, i studied Engineering in Hamburg and know a few people that went to Airbus, never heard any of those complaints.\n\nThey are doing significantly better than Boeing, all Airbus has to do is to ramp up its production, Boeing on the other hand has a lot more on its plate.",

It has everything to do with their current positing and capacity relative to the market leaders in long cycle business.

Also, no, it has not worked for them in every other market… despite pouring billions into semiconductors, they’re drastically behind there, too.\n\nDifference there is that end market adoption is more feasible for many types of chips, but they’re also dealing with US-driven export restrictions on semi capital equipment like the lithography machines/repair services from ASML.\n\nIt’s clear that you don’t know what you’re talking about when it comes to aero, so I’m not sure why you’re digging your heels in.
