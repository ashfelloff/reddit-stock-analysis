E-commerce is how Amazon got it's start it's not how they make all their money. And e-commerce benefits from \"AI\" improvements too. Self driving massively cuts shipping costs",

          "body": "Amazon has starred as an e-commerce company. The freaky thing about them is, they made $574bn revenue in 2023. Lets just assume they are growing 13% (actual Q1) in 2024. That means they are adding $74bn in revenue. Lesser global behemoths make less than that per year (e.g. Accenture’s revenue for 2023 was $64bn). They basically have to disrupt some new area every couple of years to maintain their growth. And they are pretty good at that. AWS and Advertising in the past, Healthcare and communications (Kuiper) in the future.\n\nEdit: doesn’t mean shit regarding stock price development",
