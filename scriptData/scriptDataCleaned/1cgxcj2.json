  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Since taking over Warner Brothers Discovery in 2022, the company has lost over 60% of its market value, tanked its relationship with talent and is now worth less than half of what Discovery paid for Warners Brothers just a few years ago. Also, they are still facing a mountain of debt, albeit slightly less since they have basically stopped making movies and new TV shows since the strike. Should they ever start spending money again, they will probably struggle to find traction given their heavy cable TV footprint and struggle to gain traction in streaming.\n\nStock is down almost 10% today and even at $7.40 it feels like a value trap. If it gets down near $6 you are starting to see the company worth less than the sum of its parts and there might be value there. Otherwise avoid this one at all cost. ",

For one, he fucked up the Late Night situation by not telling one of Conan/Leno to leave, didnâ€™t pay to extend key NBC actors to stay, and a host of other issues. \n\nZaslav sucks, but he inherited a terrible company in WarnerMedia with no clear plan of how to monetize assets while engaging customers to continue seeing their product, with massive debt. He chose to address the debt, and while heâ€™s done shady things to do so, itâ€™s not a bad strategy for long term survival.",
