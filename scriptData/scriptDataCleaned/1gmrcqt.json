But some people are pushing to put regulations on constellations and SpaceX may even swing to supporting those after they build up theirs more. It's a classic tech move.

I'm not as concerned with LUNR and RKLB as I think like you say, they potentially benefit for regulation relaxation (well as long as the relaxed regulations don't lead to disasters) but I am a bit concerned for ASTS as right now a lot of their value is their head start in a fairly untapped section of space. Starlink doesn't 1 to 1 compete with it, but I still think it affects ASTS's valuation.",

I've read a lot of people comparing ASTS to Starlink, but they're different. \nMore than a year ago ASTS made the 1st 5G call from space directly to unmodified cellphones with their prototype satelite, meanwhile starlink is just sending text and voice messages. Right now asts has the leading technology and doesn't have interference problems. \n\nBut investing in ASTS is a wild ride, if you want to make quick money idk if this is the stock for you, they're still pre revenue, they still need FCC approval for commercial operations and they still need fundings for full constelation, 25 satelites for US basic service and 90 for global, they already have 5 satelites up and each satelite costs 22.5M and they have about 800M in cash rn, so they have enough cash for US service but not global.\n\nRumor has it that they will launch the 2nd generation of satelites on February, they're already building 17 satelites more so I expect next year to be the year they start making bank.",

In a few years, the space industry will mature and you may have thousands of launches occuring. At that point, spacex and spacex related space products could be 50-60%.

Spacelink is in competition with them, but ASTS has better tech. Elon has 1000 instruments to deal with them. The FCC can require them to disclose certain elements of their design, which Elon could then access. He could then choke off their business by signing contracts with every other space agency (primarily rocket lab for now) saying they work exclusively with spacelink for telecommunications. They have to sign these contracts, because Elon implies they won’t get NASA contracts without signing these deals",
