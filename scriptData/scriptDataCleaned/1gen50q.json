Stolen for a highway? \n\nYou pay property taxes for holding land.  You cannot take your land with you on a plane to another country and buy something with it. \n\nBitcoin is similar to land but pristine. No friction.  Fungible. \n\nThe other thing about bitcoin is the tidal wave of money that cannot access it yet. Price discovery is still in progress. Land is old and the price is known.   People are still realizing the value behind bitcoin. \n\nSpend 50 hours learning about bitcoin.  See if you change your mind. I have invested thousands of hours learning.

My Roth is up 213% in the last 12 months (no options).\n\nBitcoin cannot be stolen easily.  What a horrible take.  Satoshi's wallets have tens of billions of dollars in them, just sitting there. No one has stolen them.\n\nBesides, you can own bitcoin, FBTC, IBIT, MSTR, etc in your 401k or brokerage. (Thanks to CashApp, Fidelity, and more). Major banks are now being approved to hold bitcoin. Hell, my Credit Union will HODL for you.\n\nI hold a relatively small amount bitcoin on Coinbase, but it is in their vault.  It takes an email from multiple people to unlock it. I use an authenticator, so that no SMS is ever sent. No one is stealing that. Most of my bitcoin-related investments are in my fidelity account, where you can buy all the above instantly.\n\nPeople that learn about Bitcoin, buy bitcoin.  It is pretty much a rule. We all come to Bitcoin at the price we deserve.\n\nI challenge you to spend more time learning and maybe you will do better investing.",
