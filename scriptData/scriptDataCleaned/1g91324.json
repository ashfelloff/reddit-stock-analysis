                  "body": "Sure, it’s relatively “low risk” in that you are only risking what you bet (the premium) but what you’re describing is not that much different than betting on the outcome of a basketball game or UFC fight and if you don’t understand how options work, it’s still easy to get it wrong even if your prediction of how the stock will do is correct.\n\nWhat you described is not really a trading strategy and betting small amounts of options isn’t gonna generate any sort of significant generational wealth unless you get incredibly lucky. You have a much higher chance of getting really unlucky. With long term, regular investment in index funds, my only real risk is the entire economy crashing. And at that point, I just have to wait things out and not sell because statistically and historically, the market will recover given enough time. As an added bonus, I don’t need to worry about short term capital gains taxes because all my positions I could cash out are over a year old.\n\nI’d rather take a fairly predictable 10% average annual return on my money and let it compound over time. After less than 10 years in the market, I have made more money in returns than I have contributed and went from having $95k in student loan/medical/credit card debt to being on track to retire early, take care of my parents as they age, and leave a sizeable inheritance for multiple generations of my family. Obviously, I’m incredibly lucky that my wife and I both have 6 figure incomes so we will have a larger nest egg than most, but those percentages remain the same for most people and would be adjusted to ones lifestyle.\n\nIf you have money to invest, that means you have money that you can afford to just let sit and grow over time. For example, if one was to start investing just $100 a month at 18 years of age, that person would have about ~$1.4m-$2m once they reach retirement age, depending on the market. Time IN the market will always beat TIMING the market.",

Retail traders hold a very small portion of the assets and derivatives in the grand scheme of things.\n\nStop loss order is a good start. And only betting a small portion of your portfolio is good too. There’s nothing inherently wrong with trading options, I’ve done it before as well (though tbf I actually majored in this in college, even though I ended up becoming a software engineer instead). It’s just that most people aren’t knowledgeable enough nor do they have the financial resources to really have significant, major gains. I’d wager that buying $5k worth of $TSLA stock when it IPO’d and selling it today would probably carry a better return than buying $5k worth of options and trying to time the market at present.",
