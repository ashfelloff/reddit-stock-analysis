It's literally eating them alive. \n\nI said it before, and to this day, AMD refuses to compete on the high end GPU market. The same shit show for Intel. While that strategy is sound at times for consumer it is a death sentence in the enterprise. They aren't looking for cheaper as there is so much space in those data centers. Do you want to fill racks with shit that you can't resell or practically give away or do you want the best you can get per square inch. \n\nI don't know how many times Jensen has to say it. It's bonkers really. You can't go shite on the enterprise market and wonder why nobody wants your stuff.",

I wanted to sell the IBM $220/$225 call spread for a credit this morning but it didn‚Äôt fill for the price I wanted. Lots of opportunity, IBM is 2 standard deviations away from the mean in a rising channel, so it should come back in over the next couple of weeks. $MSFT should probably be bought in the $423 area, so I‚Äôve got orders in for the 11 Oct 430 calls. I‚Äôll probably sell them first though, and then reverse on any weakness. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt fill today even with the drop earlier, but I feel pretty confident that I‚Äôll get my fill tomorrow sometime if I sell today and then reverse.\n\nIt was a good day.",
