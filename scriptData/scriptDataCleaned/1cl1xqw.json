  "title": "MSOS May 17 Options Expiration: Rocket Fuel for a Cannabis Rally? ",
  "score": 83,
  "selftext": "Hey fellow traders,\n\nJust wanted to share some juicy info about the upcoming options expiration for MSOS (AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF) on May 17. There's a massive open interest in calls, particularly at the $10 and $11 strike prices. \n\nRight now, MSOS is hovering around $9.62, but if it can push past $10, it could trigger a significant amount of buying pressure. There are 12,132 open interest contracts at the $10 strike and a whopping 15,658 contracts at the $11 strike. \n\nPlus - there is large OI on puts at $10. If $10 MSOS is cleared - market makers will remove their hedge and cause further significant buy pressure. \n\nWith the DEA set to officially publish its proposed rule and move cannabis to schedule 3 - the tax savings significantly re-rates the sector from a cashflow perspective. \n\nThe last pop on the AP news reporting sched 3, had short sellers scrambling to prevent the rally - and I suspect they are significantly over-leveraged at the moment. \n\nA modicum of buying could see an easy 10-20% pop on MSOS. \n\n ",

I expect a lot of volatility after CEOs explain to institutional investors how much money they will save in taxes once passes.\n\nThe problems: the rescheduling isnâ€™t guaranteed to happen in 2024, itâ€™s just more probable that it will. Also most of the tier 1 MSOs donâ€™t trade on Nasdaq so a lot of big money investors (not traders) donâ€™t do business over the counter aka OTC. Plus theirs a fee doing business on OTC.. at least on E*Trade and CS. So thatâ€™s an obstacle for some retail investors. Does Robinhood even allow it? Pretty sure not.\n\nConclusion: CEOs will talk up stocks but unlikely to hold high levels until they uplist to Nasdaq.\n\nWildcard: talks of SAFER Banking Act passing this year would be massive.",
