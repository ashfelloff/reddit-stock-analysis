The only upside risk I can think of is a takeover, but interested buyer can probably buy in a fire sale when the company goes under.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the comments, everyone. This company is shit and stock price reflects that. I am afraid the short side is too crowded. It can be squeezed on a tiny bit of improvement. Just look at ENVX. The short side was a HF hotel. The stock actually did better after squeeze. ",
