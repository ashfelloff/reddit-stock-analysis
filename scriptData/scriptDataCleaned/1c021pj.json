  "selftext": "US stocks closed mixed after a bouncy (and uneventful) trading session on Tuesday. The moves come as investors bide their time until a key inflation report lands and potentially sheds light on the path of interest rates.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) hugged the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (IXIC) edged up about 0.3%. The benchmark S&P 500 (GSPC) climbed more than 0.1%.\n\nStocks have become marooned ahead of the release of the Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, seen as a pivotal point for a market facing a slower next leg higher after a strong first quarter.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-today-us-stocks-go-nowhere-ahead-of-cpi-data-200159426.html",

I was going to do half or even 2/3rds but we all know psychologically we’re stupid and greedy. \n\nI liquidated mostly because of the inverted curve and because high interest rates do no good on the economy even if they claim “soft landing.” Soft landing they claimed successfuly in 2006 and what happened next? Exactly. If nothing happens then I’ll re-enter the market and if we do get a recession oh boy it’ll be Christmas.",
