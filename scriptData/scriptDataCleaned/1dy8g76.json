      "body": "While I’m not (currently) bearish you must be able to see where people are coming from?  As an example Apple’s current market cap is higher than the GDP of all but the top 6 economies of the world. Apple, by itself, could be a member of the G7. That is the thing that is insane. In addition it is trading at over 35% P/E ratio which makes it overvalued for a mature company. Where exactly is all this growth going to come from that makes it worth it to buy at this level?  Because it sure as heck isn’t more phones. \n\nMany people are banking that AI is going to have this massive impact, in a short time frame, based on very little evidence, and in some cases evidence to the contrary. For example there have been articles out stating that generative AI is already close to as good as it can be in the reasonable term - and it’s not very good, unless you count the many many terrible memes that uses it, to the amusement of all in how terrible it is. There’s only so many times I can squint to see Jesus while ignoring the freakish hands/arms/extra limbs. So if AI is a hype train then where does that growth come from to justify that P/E?  That is why people become bearish, not to mention that virtually all market crashes happen with high retail market participation….. \n\nLeaving the above to one side - even if this graph was remotely accurate it would have no real correlation to the market, in fact it could be evidence to the contrary, i.e. if the market is so overvalued (after-all a lot of ‘net worth’ is tied up in stocks) it is wiping out personal mortgage debt  then you might think it is time for a painful correction.",
