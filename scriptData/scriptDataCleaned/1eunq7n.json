Those around here at the time remember the front page being full of theses about how Tesla would go bankrupt, Elon is lying and theres no way they can deliver. Anyone remember \"bankwupt\"?. Turns out it really did only have ~2 months of runway left, then they started actually pumping out and delivering units. Many bags lost. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/1dI9XEmk2A\n\n* Announced that Model Y would be best selling car ever. r/RealTesla famously posts drone videos of the parking lot claiming Tesla is lying about sales and simply stocking up unsold cars. 2023, Model Y is actually the best selling car in the world. https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/s/QCQQxtFQaN\n\n* Cybertruck is predicted by many on this sub to be literally illegal to sell in the US, due design of steering wheel and lack of pedestrian safety. Cybertruck is the best selling EV truck as of Q2, outselling R1T/F150 Lightning, despite $100k price tag and preannounced imminent $20k price drop. https://qz.com/tesla-cybertruck-ford-f150-lightning-electric-trucks-1851596485\n\n* Car issues largely overblown; the cars are extremely popular among owners. As of 2023, Tesla's Net Promoter Score is +96, which means that current owners of the cars overwhelmingly recommend the cars. Whatever the issues are, customers generally feel that the positives outweigh the negatives, moreso than any other car company. https://customergauge.com/benchmarks/blog/top-highest-nps-scores\n\nI'm not saying Elon always gets it right, or always pulls out rabbits.
