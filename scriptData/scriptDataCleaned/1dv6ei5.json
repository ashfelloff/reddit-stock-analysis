They calculate that if they bypass certain legislation or requirements, they may face liabilities of X amount. However, they stand to gain Y amount if they avoid detection.\n\nThis practice is widespread within all organizations. Ultimately, it's unlikely a company will be caught for all its infractions/crimes. \n\nConsider a scenario where a company engages in ten illegal actions but is only caught for three. \n\nThe profits from the seven illegal activities covers the losses from the three discovered ones, still leaving the company with a huge net profit.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nThink about the BP oil spill, they were fined $75 million for it but they made billions over the year operating that illegal plant.
