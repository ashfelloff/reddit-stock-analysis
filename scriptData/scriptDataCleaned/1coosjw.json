And this is without projection of profits from the marketing/sales by Sanofi commencing 2025. Going concern is removed.\n\nThe other information that is pertinent is that there are 44m shares shorted (>30%)\n\nSanofi Deal + Cost Reimbursements for R&D is better than Moderna deal\n\n* Matrix-M integration Deal\n* Sanofi Equity Investment\n\n140 million share float, 35% shorted, this gonna be January 2021 all over again",

However, I'm concerned about the implications of the Sanofi deal on Novavax's future. From my understanding, Novavax might be shifting focus away from launching new products to earning smaller royalties through this partnership. This could potentially stave off bankruptcy for Novavax, but it seems to limit the company's future product output. The only exceptions might be the ongoing development of their malaria vaccine and the combined flu/COVID vaccine.\n\nWith the market's reaction, the forecasts for Novavax have become more conservative, now varying between $8 and $20 over the next year. Does this shift reflect the concerns I've outlined? I'd appreciate your thoughts on whether this is a solid analysis or if I'm missing key details.",
