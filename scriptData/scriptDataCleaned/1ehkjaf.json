The economy is so fucked against the working class that workers have lost all bargaining power against the employers. Powell and gang have raised interest rates to lower inflation. They pulled out the Phillips curve which was employed under Carter to fight a stagnant economy and high inflation. But Phillips showed that raising interest rates inversely affects employment, rates üìà employment üìâ.  But that‚Äôs not what we are observing. Interest rates have been high for a long time now and it has not affected the unemployment numbers at all. The Phillips curve is broken, or doesn‚Äôt apply any longer bc workers have zero bargaining power. \n\nFor a little more, during the pandemic young workers found situations, live with parents, roommates etc, to whether the storm and they waited out employers to raise wages. The corporations just raised prices on us to compensate the small increase in wages they were forced to pay. \n\nPowell and Yellen are older people and still live in that older world, one where the Phillips curve will help us dig out of this inflationary period. It wasn‚Äôt transitory like they told us. \n\nTL;DR: shits fucked six ways from Sunday",

Like that period of sub 2% interest rates was the outlier, not the norm. It's gotten us to this mess we are in now and also the fortunes we found due to it. \n\nYou want data, go look at the jobs reports. We are replacing tons of full time jobs with part time jobs. And also it's kinda contradictory you're saying we have amazing growth yet in the same time you say how troublesome these \"high\" rates are. Well these higher* rates hurt everyone technically, not just smaller companies. Because debt becomes expensive for all companies. And so you see even big companies increase their offshoring of jobs to India. Hiring for white collar jobs right now is a nightmare. Probably the lowest point since covid. So that's fun.\n\nThings are at a weird state right now. Sure the economy is doing well but it probably could be because a ton of people secured housing at low rates, thus they are flush with a lot of cash to spend on other shit. So that's another reason why lowering rates could screw things up even more, in terms of housing. However, if layoffs do tick up, and they have slowly been, (4% now), then the real fun begins. Those with houses won't get another job, and panic selling starts.\n\nI think it's warranted. We need a reset of some sort. Keeping these rates at these levels is the only way.",
