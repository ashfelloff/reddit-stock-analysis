With the benefit of hindsight, some did work out, others...not so much. \n\nWhat are things today that you would be willing to throw $500 at for fun, with roughly even chances it'll be +/- 30%, vs total loss, and maybe a 1 in 10 chance it'll be the next hot thing. (picturing a roulette wheel where black is +/- 30%, red is total loss, and a few zero slots that pay out like 50-100x) ",

Literally the only company in world that can make those specific lithography products, which are extremely in need for the world economy. Together with TSMC they form a bottleneck of the world economy in a certain sense. Obviously, the fact that they have 100% of the market does not automatically mean that their stocks will grow, but they are extremely innovative. As a laser physicist in Germany (where every single big laser company is supplying ASML) I have some \"inside\" info that goes as word of mouth in our industry, but they are also essentially changing the lasers they are utilizing in their lithography machines and plan to change it completely in the next 5 years, which will be quite a game changer in terms of both productivity and some technical lithography, not anything revolutionary, but an extremely healthy growth of an extremely successful company.\n\nThe issues I have are political. A lot of the ASML research is done at US national labs. Theoretically, if some shit occurs and the US loses trust in Europe (maybe Trump, but not him in particular) the US has the capability to either bring production to the US or even set up a new company doing so. Definitely have the capacity to fuck up ASML as it is crucial in a security sense. Just look at this year, the US said no exports to China, that is why their stocks fell 10% in a single day when the financial report came. Definitely have a position in ASML and will buy more, I expect a growth, but could be risky",

Find a reputable company that deals with that and get on board now. \n\nWhen I was a kid I bought baseball cards as an investment because my dad's buddy cashed all his in from his childhood. Some were worth nearly $2000 in the late 80s. Enough to buy a cheap car. I remember he said he had no idea they would be worth so much. That he and his friends used to put them in their bikes, or play with them outside. The key was that everyone was buying these cards. \n\nWhen I decided to buy them as an investment none of my friends gave a shit about baseball cards and hardly any really even cared about baseball. Those of us who were buying them were keeping them in pristine condition in hopes they would be valuable one day. Then the internet made finding them easy and even for the most serious collectors who bought out of nostalgia there really were no rare cards. \n\nA few years later all my friends were playing a game called Magic. I didn't make the connection that these were cards with limited printing runs being played with by everyone so most of the cards wouldn't survive in the same way by Dad's generation's baseball cards didn't survive. \n\nI had no way of knowing the game would still be popular over 20 years later, but even without that knowledge it should have been clear that these were worth keeping in good condition. That this was my generations baseball cards. \n\nThe point is, it will be stareing you right in the face and you may not see it. \n\nWe can't predict the future but history does have a habit of repeating itself.\n\nMy bet is something to do with robotics and automation. The biggest companies right now are involved in other things like automobiles. But there will be an outlier that has a legit product. Not the vaporware that Musk peddles. \n\nWhen you see a robotic company that creates a product that can do most everything a person can do that's what you want to invest in.",

Just look at the kinds of margins they were pushing when their covid drug was on the market and you can see how promising their prospects are once they end up pushing their current pipeline to the market.\n\nRight now they are trading at cash value so i’d say it’s a pretty safe bet.
