  "selftext": "Not willing to give it back. Mostly traded SPY/QQQ. The biggest jump is from swinging QQQ puts when META earnings were released. Bought some shares of VOO, JEPI, JEPQ, and a few beat up stocks that I like. Now it’s time to transfer out the rest and put it in a HYSA (~5% will feel a bit insulting but the money is safer there). Lessons I’ve learned - ignore the noise and stick to your plan. Take the base hits, meaning scale out at 20%, 30%, etc. and leave a couple runners once you’ve taken most risk off the table. Market tide by UW is a pretty sweet feature. Use it to guide you, but don’t yolo based off of it. Same with flow in general. Find a strategy that works for you. If you like quick scalps on choppy days, go for it. If you prefer trend days, try to wait for a retest for a decent entry. Don’t be a shmuck because you’ll end up blowing your account just to see an A+ setup that goes bonkers without you. If you’re ever unsure of what position to go for, take it as a sign to sit out. Patience is the name of the game and conviction goes a long way. Best of luck to you all. Also, before anyone rips me for using RH, Etrade is my preferred and main platform, this was just an experiment that happened to pan out and it’s now time to walk away. Cheers",

So I'm racking my brain here trying to understand what indicators you use on April 24 to determine (I assume around noon?) that it was the right time to go all in on those puts expiring the day after?  Your answer would be very appreciated!",

Also noticed a gap from the previous day around 420. Couple other things came into consideration: META, from Oct. 2022 to April 2024 had rallied from $90 to $500+, a 480% move.  I figured earnings would need to be next level stellar for it to continue chugging along, also noticed the gap on META from February. I saw people suggesting $600 calls in anticipation of earnings..people posting memes of Zuck’s glow up. It seemed like up was the common consensus, despite the market flashing signs of a local top in the prior weeks leading up to earnings szn. Will post a QQQ chart next that hopefully gives you a better idea of what I was seeing. It was time to take a shot, loaded up on the 424 strike on 4/24/24!",

Also interesting to see how you extrapolated your assumptions for Meta’s after earnings performance into the Qs performance.  I would assume that tomorrow is a good day to buy 0dte QQQ puts. I may buy one or 2 to put my toes on the water, but given all the mistakes I’ve made so far during this learning process I wouldn’t dare to buy more, and luckily, I’m not (yet!) a degenerate gambler. lol.  Keep those great trades going! ",
