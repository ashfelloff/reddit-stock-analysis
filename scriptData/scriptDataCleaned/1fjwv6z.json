  "selftext": "Boeing will furlough a “large number” of U.S. executives, managers and other staff, citing the ongoing machinist strike as the company races to preserve cash, CEO Kelly Ortberg told employees on Wednesday.\n\nThe furloughs will affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, a company spokesperson said.\n\nThe plan came less than a week after Boeing’s more than 30,000 machinists in the Seattle area and Oregon voted down a new labor contract and 96% voted to strike, walking off the job just after midnight on Friday.\n\nOrtberg said affected employees would take one week of furlough every four weeks for the strike’s duration and he and his team would take “commensurate” pay cuts for the duration of the strike.\n\n“While this is a tough decision that impacts everybody, it is in an effort to preserve our long-term future and help us navigate through this very difficult time. We will continue to transparently communicate as this dynamic situation evolves and do all we can to limit this hardship,” Ortberg said in his message.\n\nBoeing’s CFO Brian West earlier this week said the company would freeze hiring and raises to cut costs, and would let “non-essential contractors” go temporarily.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/18/boeing-furlough-strike.html",

On the 787, they even outsourced the jet’s wings to Japan.",

You can't just take anyone and put them on the assembly line - its a \\~2 year training program or the military.\n\nOn the engineering side - the US aerospace engineering ranks are gutted compared to 50 years ago. Fewer students go into it because (1a) the contraction/consolidation in the US aerospace industry post Cold War impacted jobs and career opportunities; (1b) salty old dogs scared a bunch of us away or wouldn't make room for us; (2) engineering students were choosing SWE over other forms because it was way more lucrative. Throw in that its one of the few industries, the other being automotive, where engineers are often impacted by large scale strikes, and it doesn't inspire confidence in 18 year olds that its a good career choice.\n\nI graduated in the mid-2000s with an AE degree, saw the writing on the wall and went into Tech. \n\nI'm not saying the skill sets don't exist, but they are nowhere as prevalent as they were in the 80s and it will take a decade of aerospace success to motivate students to go into aerospace. Boeing will continue to bleed talent to other industries. Even if they emerge from their current situation, they will struggle with human capital issues over the next 10 years.",
