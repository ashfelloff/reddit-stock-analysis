All domains.  Its a passive service that you do not opt-into.  Did you know that when it finds a site distributing anything that it considers malware, it can tell your web browser to display a big red warning message rather than deliver you to the website?  And that if it chooses, it can lock out entire domains, including all sub-domains with that same warning message until the domain owners (a) fix the problem, and (b) petition Google to review the fix with another malware scan.\n\nWhat gets even crazier is that this behavior isn't limited to Chrome browser ... all of the browser manufacturers have decided that this is the way it should work.  Literally google at the center of this somewhat vague process which has high potential to cause serious disruptions in traffic flow.\n\nIf/when they get busted up, I for one hope this tool gets lumped in with one of the more successful business units as it is a \"cost center\" itself and doesn't make money directly.\n\nMy thesis stands ... Google is far larger and more complex than a simple search engine.\n\nWhen the axe-men come for it, lets hope they've done their homework and understand all the nuances.
