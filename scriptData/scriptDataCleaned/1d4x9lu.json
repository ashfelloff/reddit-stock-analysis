PayPal was a big deal in terms of the ease of making payments sending funds, etc... but they also sucked so hard on the CS side that it was also the early days of getting F'd over and PayPal was basically total garbage and useless.\n\nAs soon as any type of competition and alternative services popped up, companies started jumping ship.\n\nI put a lot of the blame on Ebay. I think paypal was beginning to evolve and maybe would have gotten better, but Ebay cannibalized paypal and rather than continue to invest and improve, they used it as a way to make up for Ebay's market share regression over the years, and then they both started going down...\n\nI just always remember thinking to myself, \"If some other company comes along and does even just one simple thing better paypal is toast.\" And, while they are still around, they are not really growing, hence stagnant stock.",

              "body": "If they perform similarly to last quarter in terms of eps their P/E ratio should drop to around 20, potentially a less. In addition recently they focused on becoming more profitable through better efficiency. Also long term they invest 10% of their profits in bitcoin. So if you want a way to gain some exposure to btc but aren’t fully comfortable buying it, SQ is a way to gain some exposure with mitigated risk. In the FinTech field of stocks where many go for a premium valuation, I believe SQ is a good value pick that also has good upside potential through transaction  and cryptocurrency growth. I will personally be buying some if it drops into the mid 50s as I believe it might go a little bit lower than its current price level of 63 (and I’m trying to time the market, which might be a mistake). Unfortunately due to its crazy original valuation, there’s a ton of bag holders. Don’t be fooled by its all time downward line, right now is a great time to go long on this stock due to its financials and potential growth. I believe it could hit $100 by the end of the year (~60% upside)",

SpaceX's idea is that by cutting costs enough, they can grow the industry (see Jevon's paradox) because more projects become economically feasible with lower prices. Heavy lift's the best way to do this, because if the customers want, they can just fill the same big rocket with 1000 minisatelites instead of 1 satellite around the moon or whatever normal companies want to do in space (think of a cargo ship.)\n\nUntil 2020, there were 1-200 satellite launches per year. At say $100 million/launch, that's in the low billions, less than Disney makes (revenue) from amusement parks (let alone Seaworld, 6 Flags etc.) Today there are over 1000 satellite launches per year, because of lower costs and many microsatelites. But even if we kept that price tag, 100B of revenue for a whole industry isn't a lot of profit in the end. Companies like Dior, Lowes, 7-11, Tesco, Albertsons do that alone, with lots of competition in their niches.",

S & P 500 did 83.67%, which is 16.7%. \n\nPlus Nintendo have paid dividends that whole time, so the performance is more like 26-28% per year. \n\nNTDOY (the US ADR) is a different story because that's affected by the US to Yen exchange rate. Around the start of this 5 year period (June 2019), the US dollar was buying Yen for about *¥*107. Now it's at about *¥*157. So that's the reason for the \\~50% difference between NTDOY and 7974.T over 5 years. \n\nWhen the Yen: USD returns to *¥*107:1, that will get baked into the NTDOY share price (i.e. it will go up 50%). \n\nOver short periods of time the performance of NTDOY and 7974.T will differ quite a bit. Sometimes NTDOY will outperform. Over very long periods of time their performance should be in line.",
