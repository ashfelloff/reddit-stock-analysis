Even if it doesn't make sense at all and we all know that good business and margins unavoidably attracts competition, people will extrapolate few years of revenue growth and project that line growing endlessly.\n\nThe nuts are now bending 90 degrees like that on Nvidia.\n\nBut you just can't bet on this kind of stuff, in a way or the other. Eventually it doesn't matter if it makes sense or not, it will make and lose a shitton of money.",
