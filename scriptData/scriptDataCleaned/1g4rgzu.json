Literally everything you ever touch or see is owned by these three large firms through passive investing.\n\nSo why is it a problem? You are either a 'have' or a 'have not'.\n\nBlackrock will use it's 'passive' capital to fund venture capital firms which are VERY MUCH NOT PASSIVE that are snapping up literally everything including single family houses, government lobbyists, and anything and everything you can think of.\n\nIts great for those people who grow a business quickly and cash out their hundreds of millions of dollars.... For everyone else, it means these blackrock backed businesses have massive advantages in the marketplace and are causing huge wealth inequality and stagnating wages.\n\nI have personal experience here, has my business was bought by a blackrock funded vc and the equity holders became really wealthy overnight. The business was once booming, but now it doesn't matter at all, because all of our competition is also blackrock owned. It doesnt matter to them whether we fail or succeed. We are just a very small part of a portfolio where the business will just leave us and go to one of their other companies.\n\nAntitrust laws really need to be in place regarding funding. Hundreds of venture capitalist firms all backed by blackrock should not be able to own everything. Capitalism is broken.",
