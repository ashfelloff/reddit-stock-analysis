Ok, TSMC is building in Arizona after looking it up just now. After starting to do small daily buys on an American semiconductor ETF, I'm up 30%, I started the day the chips act passed\n\nWould be up way more, but I didn't have a lump sum to invest",

It's XSD - spdr s&p semiconductor ETF\n\nIt's also equal weighted, where a typical investment would be market cap weighted, if Nvidia comes back down to earth it won't have an outsized impact on this, but it also won't benefit as much if it goes to the moon.. ETFs based on the S&P are inherently American stock focused, although it doesn't say as much in the description or anything",
