I have written a lot more about that on Reddit and elsewhere.\n\nTake a look at Moderna, they would be the first to develop an mRNA vaccine and got government funding for phase 3 trials:\n\n[https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Receives-Project-Award-through-BARDAs-Rapid-Response-Partnership-Vehicle-Consortium-to-Accelerate-Development-of-mRNA-based-Pandemic-Influenza-Vaccine/default.aspx](https://investors.modernatx.com/news/news-details/2024/Moderna-Receives-Project-Award-through-BARDAs-Rapid-Response-Partnership-Vehicle-Consortium-to-Accelerate-Development-of-mRNA-based-Pandemic-Influenza-Vaccine/default.aspx)\n\nCureVac and GSK are also developing an mRNA vaccine, but with the licensing agreements and patent litigation it's more complicated:\n\n[https://www.curevac.com/en/curevac-announces-start-of-combined-phase-1-2-study-in-avian-influenza-h5n1-development-in-collaboration-with-gsk/](https://www.curevac.com/en/curevac-announces-start-of-combined-phase-1-2-study-in-avian-influenza-h5n1-development-in-collaboration-with-gsk/)\n\n[https://www.curevac.com/en/gsk-and-curevac-to-restructure-collaboration-into-new-licensing-agreement/](https://www.curevac.com/en/gsk-and-curevac-to-restructure-collaboration-into-new-licensing-agreement/)\n\n[https://www.curevac.com/en/curevac-provides-update-on-trial-dates-for-patent-litigation-across-multiple-geographies-against-pfizer-biontech/](https://www.curevac.com/en/curevac-provides-update-on-trial-dates-for-patent-litigation-across-multiple-geographies-against-pfizer-biontech/)\n\nCidara is very promising, with a much lower market cap. Phase 2b trials for CD388 are starting this year.\n\n\"The private placement provides $240 million in gross proceeds that will be used by Cidara to develop CD388 as a universal preventative against seasonal and pandemic influenza A and B, beginning with a Phase 2b clinical trial in the upcoming Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The proceeds from the private placement fund the upfront payment under the agreement with Johnson & Johnson and are expected to provide runway beyond topline data from CD388’s Phase 2b trial.\"  \n[https://www.cidara.com/news/cidara-therapeutics-reacquires-global-development-and-commercial-rights-to-cd388-and-announces-private-placement-financing-of-240-million/](https://www.cidara.com/news/cidara-therapeutics-reacquires-global-development-and-commercial-rights-to-cd388-and-announces-private-placement-financing-of-240-million/)\n\nThey actually have a company presentation on Monday:\n\n[https://www.cidara.com/news/cidara-to-present-at-the-h-c-wainwright-26th-annual-global-investment-conference/](https://www.cidara.com/news/cidara-to-present-at-the-h-c-wainwright-26th-annual-global-investment-conference/)\n\nCheck out their website, they even made a video for Youtube:\n\n[https://www.cidara.com/cloudbreak/influenza/](https://www.cidara.com/cloudbreak/influenza/)\n\n[https://youtu.be/RimtrUVxgCU](https://youtu.be/RimtrUVxgCU)\n\n  \nYou can see typical press coverage below, but be careful about Novavax, they somehow always get mentioned, but never answered my requests for clarification:\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaccine-stocks-rise-growing-threat-150800194.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vaccine-stocks-rise-growing-threat-150800194.html)",
