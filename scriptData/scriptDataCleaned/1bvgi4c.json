  "selftext": "TSMC seems to have come out pretty much unscathed from the earthquake except for slight damage to some equipment. Still, there are going to be delays as they return to full production.\n\nThis slight delay may actually be beneficial to them as supply-demand drive prices for chips higher especially with the huge demand for NVDIA's new Blackwell processors with the AI bubble in full swing.\n\nWith TSMC monthly revenue set to be published on the 10 Apr, most likely going to show yoy growth and earning on the 18 Apr where I doubt they will give a weak outlook for the year due to the crazy demand for AI processors; I think TSMC is gonna 🚀🚀. They are the major chip suppliers for NVDA and I don't think it will slow down, and this slight slowdown in production due to the earthquake will only increase profits (they are in the Goldilock zone of disasters).\n\nWhat do you guys think? I'm still bullish and I'm thinking of getting some 150 calls especially if there is a slight pullback tomorrow due to market overreaction to the natural disasters (there was a 6.3 earthquake in Japan a few hours ago)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gr5db2mxpesc1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=278386fc570725d12e06e1a4e1428f1ca2d065ac",
