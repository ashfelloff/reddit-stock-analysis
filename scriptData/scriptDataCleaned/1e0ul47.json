When people said the roadster is only for rich techies he released the Model S where everyone said an electric vehicle can never be a Family car. He made the model 3 the most successful electric car that ever existed. Right after the Model Y which was the most sold car in 2023 not most sold electric car most sold across all car types in the world with 1.8 million units. Under his name the largest and most profitable charging network in the world was built. Oh btw it is also way more reliable measreurable by uptime than any other charging network. There is companies that do nothing else than charging networks and they are worse at it. The Tesla semi truck is on the road already going 500 miles on a single charge while towing almost full weight while Mercedes said electric semis would be impossible. People said the cybertruck would never be released yet it was the most successful car over 100k$ last month. Musk is never on time but he delivers like crazy and this can be very easily seen in the numbers as well. But here are anyways just uninformed idiots. Oh Tesla has also the largest battery backups already online on several different continents",

Do you know how many Porsche 911 gets sold lol? They are all over 100k. I think you might want to look up and it said for Ev's and even that not by much. I wouldn't brag about a car that has 4 recalls in 6 months of existence and delivered 6 years late  but ok, you do you\n\nTesla semi is on road, that's news where? Can anyone buy one? Please let me know I have a bridge in Brooklyn I would like to sell it for",
