Does anyone ACTUALLY think we see rate INCREASES? I don't but I'm curious if others' actually believe it's inside the realm of possibility? I cannot see an increase occurring on an election year, let alone after the FED has already conducted 11 hikes in the span of 2 years. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h7lrw8nwirtc1.jpg?width=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bddce4bcac62b96952fa2d5bdea2b6fd6f2c9c7a\n\n",
