  "selftext": "It is exactly 4:54 am as I start typing this shit. I‚Äôve been looking at the charts and economic data all night as well as different funds recent trades. My oh fucking my. What the fuck is going on here. The market is currently ripping off of the consensus we have officially bottomed and there is no threat of an imminent recession. CPI comes out under 3% and the market rips the next day. We all think this is the holy grail bull run coming that has drowned our underwear in substances during our wet dreams of this time. But realistically, CPI going under 3%, which it hasn‚Äôt done in three years, just means that the economy is slowing down to rates we haven‚Äôt seen in 3 years. Doesn‚Äôt that just mean we are more likely heading to a recession. All of the data is pointing to the economy ‚Äúcooling down‚Äù. Economic indicators globally in other nations are pointing towards the same ‚Äúcooling down‚Äù phase. Just a little fucking curious as to why anyone is even ripping the market long term right now. Citadel doesn‚Äôt even know what the fuck to do as most of their positions are straddled with heavier percentages of assets allocated in puts. Just curious as to what anyone thinks of this. Am I slow (as in slow I mean a word that is banned by Reddit)? Am I going crazy? At this fucking point it could be both. But I think that everyone entering the market right now in long term securities could be entering a death sentence. Please let me know what you guys think. Currently working on a MCMC quant strategy relating certain market corrections to the drawdown that just happened. Highly suggest looking into MCMC. Will post more about what I find from this strategy soon. Please let me know if I should just shut the fuck up and throw some Gs on the TQQQ. ",

There is over $1.8T in these funds according to the Fed. A record level. The thinking is that as the Fed lowers rates, MMF investors will pivot away from lower yields on MMFs and buy stocks. \nAlso as rates are reduced this will help companies bottom lines (especially small caps) and it also may yield a higher multiple on the higher earnings. \nThat being said the devil is in the details and large caps are already at high multiples. I think the Fed will slow roll any rate reductions. Therefore a wall of money entering the market is unlikely. It will be a gradual process. Also the money will flow to value and small stocks which will benefit the greatest from lower rates. \n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?eid=1217622&rid=21",

Even despite the crushing data for July, the situation needs to be assessed holistically, covering a wider range of comparisons.\n\nIndustrial production fell 0.2% y/y in July, for Jan-Jul.24 down 0.2% y/y but up 0.2% y/y to the same period two years ago and just +0.1% for 2019.\n\nThere has been protracted stagnation for 5 years, and if we look more broadly, for 15-17 years, with no pronounced trend.\n\nTo remove volatility, the estimate will be for the first seven months of 2024 to the same comparison period. \n\n- Manufacturing: -0.3% y/y, -0.8% by 2022 and -0.3% by 2019, where durable goods production is -0.5%, +0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, and short-term goods production is within zero, -1.2% and +0.4%.\n\n- Mining production: -0.9% y/y, +5.5% by 2022 and -1.2% by 2019.\n\n- Power generation, utilities: +2.3% y/y, -0.9% by 2022 and +1.6% by 2019.\n\nAmong manufacturing production in plus for 7m24 (among capacious industries): \n\n- Computer and microelectronics manufacturing +3.9% y/y\n\n- Auto manufacturing (light, commercial and freight transportation) +0.4%\n\n- Aerospace and other transportation equipment +2.5%\n\n- Oil refining +4.6% yoy\n\n- Chemical production +0.6% y/y.\n\nIn manufacturing, many sectors are in negative territory:\n\n- Fixing crisis in construction as furniture and fittings production -6.6% y/y, construction materials-5.9% y/y and stagnation with a downward trend in steel production -1.3% y/y.\n\n- Among knowledge-intensive industries, machine building -2.9% and electrical equipment -1.5%\n\nThe dynamics is multidirectional, but more and more industries have negative dynamics.",

      "body": "the \"draw down\" that happened into early August was due to an idiotic wall street trade, triggered by the JPY unwind. The USD/JPY tracks the QQQ very closely since much of this trade was in tech stocks.\n\nJap data came out showing good GDP growth, repatriation of cash into domestic stocks, while they are dumping dollars and printing domestic bonds.\n\nA decent chunk of the very risky leveraged trash was margin called over the past few weeks. There are likely still positions that need unwound, but much much less impactful since our ice queen Yellen over at Treasury is balls deep on the unwind trade while shuffling treasuries.\n\nMy speculation is that the unwind trade is mostly done. This past Friday there was a deviation in price movements between forex USD/JPY and QQQ. The former retracted (dumped) to a prior support while the latter did not.\n\nJapan keeps strengthening their Yen while short term yields increase. If there were still a lot to unwind in the indexes, I'd expect this pressure to cause more margin calls and dumping, but that seems to have petered out. Should the Yen continue to strengthen we might get one more correction at some fraction of the magnitude of the early August one, but I think the name of the game right now is 'suck retail into the markets before pulling the plug down the road' -- think long term, massive wealth transfer from boomers to millennials is underway -- why freak everyone out because of some shitty Yen carry trade? How about Japan threatening to dump massive amounts of T-bonds, threatening a default? F\\*ck that noise! Don't talk about it, doesn't exist!\n\nOn a Macro level, we have tensions in the middle east abating, movement towards some resolution in Russia/Ukraine, and China still sizing up the playing field with investments (Burry e.g.) slowly fluffing the Chinese mkt.  On the back of everyone's mind is the USD supremacy. As pressures to cut rates mount (and suppression by activist Treasury trading), the USD isn't the King it used to be.  This means less market liquidity, more volatility, as the Fed and Treasury seek to fluff up the Piggy.\n\nWe have entered an era of financial Vol because of mistakes made recently and a long time ago. I don't think the Fed *can safely* cut rates, but when have they ever done anything resembling responsible behavior?\n\nFor now, the #1 rule is \"optics\" -- fluff the Piggy and everyone stops whining -- if we need to inject some Vol, OK, some folks will whine for a bit but we can smash that down\n\nWith these Boomers on their way out...there is too much slush fund and laundered money flowing around the globe to give up and surrender that clown notion of 'my american dream retirement' because of some shitty wall street trades, over-leveraging, crappy data prints, stagflation, etc. If we need hyper-inflation to juice my portfolio, we'll do it.\n\nit's a \"don't fight the machine if you want to eat\" type of deal, just hedge some risk.....all the irresponsible damage has been done and its all about doubling-down \"i ain't hear no bell yet!\" until some actual serious Macro international event occurs (hello? coordinated US T-bill fire sale)",
