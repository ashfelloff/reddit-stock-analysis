  "selftext": "Okay Crayon Sniffers, \n\nHere is the low down on BMY and why I have a 350K YOLO. It Their main revenue sources are facing a series of patent cliffs. They have a few years to replace their revenue with new products from their pipeline or  you can draw a big red arrow down on the share price. \n\nThey posted their Q2 2024 ER today and showed some decent progress in alleviating that fear. They have done a ton of acquisitions over the past few years and it looks like many new drugs will enter their pipeline, get approved, and generate a ton of revenue. \n\nThis is exactly what happened to AbbVie a few years ago. And look where their stock price is now!\n\nI think they will replace the revenue and grow it. I believe the share price will be $80-$100 in 3-5 years. \n\nIn the meantime, I’m going to enjoy the dividends, 5B share buyback on the books, and 18 years of dividend increases and I expect it to continue! I plan on drawing a big green arrow from here to that PT.\n\nDisclaimer: I am long BMY. This is not investment advice. Do your own DD and make your own investment decisions. ",

The fact they had some data to suggest they will in fact over come the patent cliff is huge and the market responded accordingly. It could have dropped to $40 or $35 if they indicated further that the patent cliff was looking more likely. \n\nIt doesn’t feel like a YOLO because you probably think a YOLO is quick and fast. \n\nYeah I made 15% in a few days. I’m going to make 2X my position in 3-5 years with patience plus fat dividends. \n\nI fully expect my shares to be worth 700K in a few years. Bears say they still can be worth like 200K. \n\nIs that YOLO enough for ya?",
