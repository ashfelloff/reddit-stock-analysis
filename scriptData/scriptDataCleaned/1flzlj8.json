  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI recently found out that Japan suffered a stock market crash in the 90s and is still recovering from it. That's over 3 decades of basically no returns if you invested your money at the peak.\n\n**What lead to the crash and, more importantly, why did it take them 3 decades to recover ?**\n\nAmerica has also had terrible periods of 10 or so years with 0 returns but nothing even remotely close to 3 decades.",

Essentially no matter what they did they wouldn't be able to earn enough money through their normal business operations to justify their sky high values. So they started engaging in financial engineering, via buying each other's stock, and then recognizing the profits when said stocks (that were already absurdly expensive) went up even farther in price. Think of it as stock buybacks, except most businesses in the market were buying each others shares instead of their own (since you can't recognize your own shares going up in price after your share buybacks as a profit).\n\nSo in other words after a certain point Japanese businesses were only worth so much because they kept on making a bunch of money buying up other Japanese businesses shares, which were also buying up their own shares. Meaning business A has strong earnings because business B has strong earnings, and business B has strong earnings because business A has strong earnings. \n\nThis head eating it's own tail obviously led to problems farther down the line when the bubble burst. Some businesses even had big scandals years later when it was found that they were covering up those losses.",

It has a high population for its amount of arable land, so it’s import-driven, meaning it has to make up for its lack of natural resources with technology exports. It did this very well in the 80s, but speculation drove the price of assets to an unsustainable level.\n\nBecause the country is aging demographically and it has a bureaucratic, Confucian mindset regarding hierarchies, it lacks a young vibrant work force with new ideas (a lot of Japanese either don’t have kids or their kids end up shut ins). Most of the economic power is centralized within the large zaibatsu (Japanese conglomerates), so it’s difficult for start-ups to gain traction. \n\nThe country is also pretty xenophobic under the surface, so they have rather closed/restrictive immigration policies (they allow a lot of temporary visas for migrant or skilled workers, but permanent residency and citizenship are difficult).\n\nSo, you have a country whose demographics are screwed, is reliant on imports for natural resources, can’t expand geographically or militarily, faces constant economic losses from disaster-proofing or rebuilding from natural disasters, won’t open their immigration, has a high cost of living, is massively bureaucratic, and has centralized all of its economic power within its zaibatsu.

      "body": "have done some research on Japan before, here are some of my thoughts. It is clearly a combination of several factors.\n\n1. Demographics. Japan is a country with severe population aging problems and thr problem has deterriorate faster after 90s, growing popluation is always a most important feul.to the economy. With not enough births and aging society can not provide enough workers and demand for goods are suppressed.\n\n2. Global competition. After 90s Japan also face increased competition from other Asian countries.Japan is an export oriented economy and relies heavily on export goods to global markets. Emergence of Korean and Chinese goods have hit Japan hard. Korean cars, chips and electronics has eating market shares on the top end and Chinese goods are driven Japanese products to extinction in the mid/low end.\n\n3. Lack of inner demand caused by post-crash trauma. During the 90s boom in Japan there is a rapid appreciation of real estate, a lot of people borrow huge amounts of money invest/speculate in real estate. With the asset buuble burst, a whole generation is left with huge debt and deeply traumatized. Learning the lessons, and combiend with a depressed labor market, the Japaneses have gone to another extreme to so called 'Heisei Otaku' , meaning lifestyle of low desire and being simplistic and frugal. This also lower the demand for all goods and services, making it harder for business.to be profitable in Japan.\n\n4. Internal flaws of the Japanese model. labor market operate as a lifetime employment model, there is rarely layoffs and employee usually stay with the same.firm until retirement. It works great in the good time but at the downturn it make it very hard for firms to downsize and increase operational effciency. This contribute also to Japanses firms failure to compete with Korean and Chinese firms. The work culture is also quite toxic and discriminative against womens and many japanese women choose not to work and this also cause the further tighening of Japanses labor market.\n\n5. Ineffective monetary stimulus. Although BoJ has lowered the rate to negative, it does very little help stimulate Japan. Partly because Japan economy lacks innovation and are outcompeted by US and other emergent market as a invest destination. People will just borrow money from Japan and invest in other countries with high interest rate or higher expected ROI, like US or Brazil -the so called \"\"carry trade\", little money actually went into Japanese economy to help invest in their own business.",
