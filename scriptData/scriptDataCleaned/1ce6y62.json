EU is not significant for BYD at this time.\n\nIn China only 33% of cars are EV.  The Chinese government is making a significant push for the country to switch to EVs and get rid of Legacy cars. You can see from how China can lock down whole cities for Covid, the government is now pushing the country to fully switch to EV.  It is why so many EV makers have sprung up because everyone want a slice of the growing market.\n\n In case you didn't know Tesla sold 670k cars in US and 603k cars in China in 2023 and the Chinese market is getting larger due to government directive whereas it is slowing down in the US.  The losers are all the legacy car makers especially Japanese like Toyota and Nissan and it seem like Tesla since they are losing market share in China.\n\nIn terms of exports, BYD is everywhere in Australia, Malaysia and South East Asian countries etc etc  It is also building a factory in Thailand, Brazil and Hungary.\n\nIt is like with most industries, there will be a lot of competition in the beginning and within a few years there will be a consolidation of a few major players left.  BYD will be one of them. Buffett buy companies with good management. Why Charlie Munger turned down Tesla for BYD.",
