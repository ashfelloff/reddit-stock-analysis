      "body": "Nuclear faces regulatory hurdles typically, but something Sam discusses is the impressive pipeline of deals and contracts that Oklo has lined up, that is hopeful. One thing that will be crucial to follow is the success of nuclear material acquisition by Oklo from INL (Idaho National Lab). [here is an article speaking a little bit about it](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Oklo-reports-progress-in-Idaho,-Ohio).\n\nWith that said, recycling spent Uranium is an actual brilliant idea. Many complaints surrounding nuclear involve waste, cost, and proliferation. Using recycled fuel waste addresses ALL of those concerns.\n\n1. By being able to recycle fuel rods we can effectively extend the life of manufactured Uranium fuel many times over. This will reduce fuel waste over time as we eventually transition to renewables or fusion gets off the ground.\n2. Again, by extending the life of the fuel, and doing it in house, Oklo won't need to continually acquire fuel for it's small moduclar reactors, or at least not as much. This reduces cost. It also means that they can acquire their fuel at a discount from companies, who would otherwise have to pay for their waste to be removed. Now those companies can sell it to Oklo, at a discount of course, and recoupe some of that loss. Oklo can also tap into the massive stockpile of already spent fuel waste that the government has buried away. Which according to the CEO, [would be able to meet all energy demands in the US for 100 years. I believe it. Nuclear material is extremely dense with energy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXbWC1mDrl4) E=mc\\^2 or some shit.\n3. Proliferation. This is the big one honestly. When we dig up Uranium, it consists of several different isotopes. The most abundant of which is U-238. That is not really a good nuclear fuel, for most reactors, since it is relatively stable and hard to fission. What most reactors want is U-235. What we end up doing, in very simple terms, is we turn the raw material into a gaseous form and use centrifuges to increase the concentration of U-235, taking advantage of the difference in mass between isotopes. This process can produce fuel grade Uranium with enough U-235 to power a reactor. However, this whole process is the same process used to make weapons grade uranium. With Oklo though, and the advent of using recycled fuel waste to power reactors, you could actually de-proliferate, that is shut down the centrifuges used to spin up Uranium to high concentrations of U-235, and just rely on nuclear fuel waste to power your reactors. This could be revolutionary, not only from an energy standpoint, but from a foreign policy standpoint. How does Oklo do this? Basically, their reactor designs rely on fast neutrons as opposed to thermal neutrons to induce fission. These neutrons carry more energy, and are able to break apart transuranic atoms or even the heavy, and hugely abundant, U-238. Essentially, their nuclear reactors are more efficient. This is also not a novel idea. Other countries have been using recycled fuel, but I don't know of other reactors relying on fast neutrons.\n\nI think catching this wave early could be huge. The real question is what kind of future do you want to invest in? I believe in nuclear power. I believe in clean energy. And I believe in Sam Altman. I am long shares. If this idea gets off the ground it would be very groundbreaking. If it fails, then that's a future that is a little less bright anyways.",

Nuclear waste is not fissile, so how does that plan work.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but am genuinely not understanding how what you said is physically possible.  Unless you are considering what is known as a breeder reactor, in which case the waste is Pu-239.  Pu-239 is very fissile, but this kind of reactor kind of negates the nonproliferation argument, as breeder reactors are exactly how weapons grade plutonium is made.",

[Also, here is Oklo talking about their process, I think a little more in depth, at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission meeting one year ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZWU7AI9Ywc). Their reactor design does not require as high of a concertation of U-235 because they rely on fast neutrons to generate their fission reactions, transuranic or heavier isotopes of Uranium, such as U-238, now become usable. So basically, all existing uranium fuel waste right now in the US, that is thought of as useless by typical standards because of its \\~1% (don't quote me on that) concentration of U-235 at this point, becomes an invaluable fuel source for the Aurora power plant that Oklo is proposing. Essentially, nuclear reactors are getting more efficient. And the fuel waste of the past, is the fuel of the future. They wouldn't need to spin it back up. Most nuclear fuel waste consists of transuranic isotopes, or U-238. So I guess that the whole additional revenue stream is my bad there. They wouldn't be able to turn other company's fuel waste around for them. They would however be able to use it, and acquire it at a discount because other company's would be happy to sell it to them.",

                  "body": "Unfortunately, even though U-238 is just as good at fissioning fast neutrons as U-235, it is still not capable of sustaining a chain reaction. Uranium is typically broken up into three categories, Low enriched, high enriched, and weapons grade. Low enriched, which is the one that this company would use, is still around 5-10% U-235. This is because U-235 can fission thermal neutrons, whereas U-238 only begins to fission around 5-10 MeV. The problem with this is that both isotopes of uranium only emit neutrons at around 4.6 MeV. Essentially, Uranium cannot fission U-238, and this is why U-235 is always used in some quantity. If you look into Franceâ€™s waste recycling program, they create plutonium from the waste, but the process still takes years. I am not saying this is a bad thing for the company, but math pretty much says that a 1% U-235 reactor canâ€™t sustain energy production. I still love SNRs though, and do see a large industry for them in the future.",

However, we are not only talking about Uranium, but other transuranic elements that can be used with fast neutrons more effectively. In the fuel waste for example that is spent and stored now in the ground, there is a significant concentration of transuranic elements that would work well in a fast neutron environment.\n\nI don't claim to fully understand all of Oklo's design, much of which might be proprietary, but fast neutron reactors are a real thing.",

Unless a breeder reactor is used, which the US has largely outlawed internationally due to their ability to produce weapons grade material, Okla wonâ€™t be able to just buy the material they need\n\nAlso, take a look at the difference between the cross sections for U-238 and the other nuclear elements.

Only that Uranium cannot cause fission in Uranium-238. It does, to a smaller degree, and that is taken into account in all reactor designs, but I agree not in a substantial enough way to achieve criticality, under traditional PWR designs.\n\n  \nHowever, existing fuel waste stocks do contain a small percentage of Plutonium and other possible elements that can be used in a fast reactor design if enough processing occurs. [There is currently \\~85000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel waste in the US alone, not accounting for allies that we would be open to exchanging fuel waste with.](https://www.gao.gov/nuclear-waste-disposal) If even a small percentage of that consists of plutonium \\~1%, it represents a huge store of potential energy for fast reactors. Keeping in mind, that it is not only plutonium that will be used, but also U-238.\n\nI have to start studying for an exam. I appreciate this discussion. I might return to it.",
