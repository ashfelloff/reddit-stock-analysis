  "score": 304,
  "selftext": "Automaker Stellantis plans to indefinitely lay off up to 2,450 U.S. factory workers later this year as it discontinues production of an older version of its Ram 1500 pickup truck in Michigan.\n\nThe truck, which is produced alongside the Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer, has been largely used as a low-cost pickup to sell to entry-level buyers and fleet customers since the automaker introduced a new generation of the Ram 1500 in 2018.\n\nThe current Ram 1500, which was recently updated for the 2025 model year, is produced at a nearby plant. Operations at that facility will continue as planned.\n\n“With the introduction of the new Ram 1500, production of the Ram 1500 Classic at the Warren [Michigan] Truck Assembly Plant will come to an end later this year,” the company said in an emailed statement.\n\nThe discontinuation of the Ram 1500 “Classic” vehicle is not unexpected, but the company has not announced a vehicle to replace the truck. That’s concerning for local governments, workers and the United Auto Workers union, which represents the plant.\n\nThe layoffs are expected to occur as soon as October. They are the latest for Stellantis, which has cut production at several plants amid sales issues.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/09/stellantis-layoff-workers-ram-pickup-truck.html",

Not trying to shit on your car but just warning you of potential issues, Those hybrid Pacifica’s make me a lot of money (I’m a stellantis level 3 technician). Not only that but the 3.6L V6 they put in the Pacifica has a lot of issues. You will have to replace the oil cooler (oil filter housing) at least once, they crack and leak oil. You’ll most likely have to replace a cylinder head around 100k-150k miles $5k-$7k. I like the Pacificas they are nice but they definitely have issues",

      "body": "The Anti Union Propaganda is in full swing in here, these companies aren't failing because of unions. These companies cut production on sedans (lower cost/margins) to produce SUVs and trucks (higher cost/margins) \\~5 years ago... With the combination of COVID shortages, price gouging, high interest rates, etc... we are now seeing the effects of shortsighted decisions of management. The people complaining everyone was buying too much stuff, are now seeing businesses cut jobs because profits aren't inline with expectations (YoY growth). If anything this should show how much unions are needed across every industry, because business wouldn't be able to cut jobs without having contractual obligations to consider.  Without Unions, cutting jobs is the easiest way to cut expenses (You are easily expendable). Unions force companies to be more accountable with their decisions (You aren't easily expendable).  In the end good people across different industries will be out of a job, and will struggle due to circumstances outside their control. We should be coming together and supporting workers, you know the ones who were not to long ago were essential in keeping the economy going.",
