  "title": "🚀 ACHR on the Rise: +7% Today and New Partnership with Japan Airlines 🚀",
  "score": 1398,
  "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Archer Aviation (ACHR) is up 6% today, boosted by a new partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation. This collaboration includes plans to purchase up to **$500 million worth of Archer's electric aircraft**, marking a significant step in the eVTOL space. Combined with a solid U.S. Air Force contract and ongoing milestones, ACHR is positioning itself as a key player in urban air mobility.\n\n**Why the New Japan Deal Matters**\n\nArcher's partnership with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo Corporation provides a foothold in the Japanese market, which is investing heavily in sustainable urban transport. Sumitomo's expertise in energy and infrastructure, along with Japan Airlines' support for eVTOL deployment, could accelerate Archer's international expansion. Japan's leadership in urban air mobility makes this deal a strategic move for Archer.\n\n**Price Action and Potential Short Squeeze**\n\nACHR's 6% gain today aligns with this significant news. With **26% short interest**, the stock has potential for further movement if momentum continues. Past announcements have driven volume spikes, and today's developments could signal more to come.\n\n**Key Graphs to Watch**\n\n* **Price and Short Interest Over Time:** Shows ACHR’s price history alongside high short interest. With today’s price boost, shorts could start feeling the pressure.\n* **Volume Spikes on Key Events:** Major news like the NASA and Air Force partnerships drove volume spikes, and this Japan Airlines partnership could do the same.\n* **Peer Comparison:** ACHR is making moves not just in the U.S. but globally, positioning itself against other eVTOL players like Joby and Lilium. Today’s price gain helps them stand out in the sector.\n* **Insider Buys and Sells:** Recent insider activity shows some confidence from within, and monitoring these transactions could offer insight into where ACHR is headed.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nArcher is building momentum in the eVTOL space with international partnerships, key U.S. contracts, and a strategy to be an early leader. It’s a speculative play, no doubt, but today’s price action, high short interest, and new Japan partnership give it potential in both the short and long term.\n\n*(Not financial advice - do your own DD, but this could be one to keep on the radar!)*",

The good news is Archer’s already pulled in solid funding from partnerships with Stellantis, Boeing, and others, which should help stretch that cash runway.

Waiting until they’re closer to revenue is a smart play, but the upside could still be big if they keep on track.",
