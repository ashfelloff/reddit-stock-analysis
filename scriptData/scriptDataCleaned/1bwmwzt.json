I get you won’t be a millionaire, but man that’s almost 29 an hour… that’s homeownership pay just starting out. \n\nIt’s never black and white. Some jobs (customer service, retail, etc) truly are supply and demand issues with pay, but we also couldn’t fill a mechanic position for 83k a year which is wild.

Unions go by seniority and people work for many years without a guarantee of steady work. If you aren’t doing union work and don’t own your own business you are going to work for a small company with shit benefits. Commercial trades are more consistent than residential; however, work can and does dry up. Industrial maintenance/trades can be a good route if you have enough companies locally that keep wages increasing. If you don’t have competition for the workers wages will stagnate.",

First, there are flaws in the weighting. Secondly, it is a lagging indicator. Third, excluding food and energy means that it's basically useless in understanding household spending. And fourth, the shelter component is very subjective.\n\nThat said, CPI generally does capture the direction of inflation. I personally look at the PPI because it's a leading indicator.\n\nI stand by my contention that inflation has declined directionally. Let's consider the categories you listed:\n\n\n\n1. Food: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/food-inflation](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/food-inflation)\n\nFood inflation peaked at over 11% in August 2022 after being on an upward trend for over two years, and is now at 2.2%.\n\n2. Housing: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=kYEb](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=kYEb)\n\nOn this one, inflation hasn't cooled down much.\n\n3. Energy: https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/energy-inflation#:\\~:text=Energy%20Inflation%20in%20the%20United,Percent%20in%20July%20of%202009.\n\nEnergy inflation surged starting in 2020, and peaked at 41.6% in the summer of 2022. We are now seeing energy deflation\n\n4. Used cars & trucks: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CUSR0000SETA02)\n\nInflation in this area has decreased since the summer of 2022",
