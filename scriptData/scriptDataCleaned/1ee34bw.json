Do you even know how EU works?\n\nThe French don't even source their parts in France, the EU hub where most tech parts ship from is in Hamburg.\n\nThose cheese eating regards tried the same with META and AAPL, their response was ignoring any invitation to attend meetings and simply deprecated, blocked or cancel whatever France regulators targeted(Facebook news, iPhone 12 sales in France, etc). France regulators for decades love using these type of \"bans\" or \"call for bans\" to bully big corpo to cut a deal with them so France gets a bigger cut from their business. It worked in the past, but now all it does is hurt their own economy since MNCs do not give a fuck, local big businesses just work around by having it shipped from somewhere else to work around regulations while small ones gets fucked.\n\nAnything beneficial to AMD only drove up TSMC, there's a reason AMD is called Advanced Money Destroyer. You're better off saying you're an AMD bagholder rather than pretending \"it's interesting\" then sprouting old news.",

When sentiment is down it's a ridiculously high P/E chip stock that is way over valued -- when sentiment is up, it's market cap is way too low for it's future growth and P/E doesn't matter because big earnings jumps are just around the corner.  I will say though, a 35% draw down from peak and a 30RSI on 1 year chart seems like a good enough entry point.  That flush on Wed/Thur might have just been temporary bottom and uptrend will probably start this week -- whether thats an earnings miss, and AMD hits 110-120 (RSI/% off peak way too low) or an earnings beat and chip growth story continues.",
