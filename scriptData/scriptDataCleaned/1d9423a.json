And only play with money you can afford to lose and not care about. (And we all know you'll care about every penny, but just hang in there during the downturns).",

I’m mostly levelheaded, pretty risk averse because I have a small account and I work full time retail and can’t monitor my account all the time.\n\nEven though I’ve mostly learned my lesson, once in a while I jump in on the latest hype train with a couple hundred bucks, nothing major that I’m afraid to lose. And I get burned almost every time. I realized even tho $200 isn’t a big deal, I could’ve just bought another AAPL share or waited for the NVDA split, and I wouldn’t be throwing money away $100-200 at a time. Hell, I could’ve just bought a fractional share of NVDA.\n\n\nI’ve cut my losses, trimmed the fat off a lot of my portfolio and reinvested more in stuff like AAPL and SPLG. And not only have I made some of that money back, it’s much less stressful now that I’m seeing 90% of my portfolio be green again.",
