              "body": "Thanks on the good DD, because you're the type of regard WSB deserves, but not the one it needs ever. So they'll hate you. Because you can take it. Because you're not [our hero](https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1epojbl/intel_guy_gets_inducted_into_the_wsb_hall_of_fame/). yadda yadda yadda. A dark regardegen.\n\nI'd favor banning Slick_MF_iG if they posted in [DD] instead of just under [Meme]. Upon reading it, I instantly thought it was the [stupidest post of the day](https://assets.rebelmouse.io/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy8yNzc2NTI5OS9vcmlnaW4ucG5nIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTczMzYyODc0Nn0.2ciojZ5JcOsyHJjBhvK3DgUjvg2ghmArzDBblfRGd-E/img.png?width=800&quality=85) because it offered 0 advantage to OP but only made the collective community dumber because a few fucking regards wouldn't get that it's a fucking joke. It was so fucking dumb I didn't even bother to post in the comments of that thread. \n\nThat said, I can offer some insight on thetagang. They usually would win most of the time because they aren't going for the flashy 10x, the hail marry pass, the beyond half court 3pt shot, etcetc. The Thetagang I see and participate with are a mix/combination of feeding fish, an underground casino, and janitor. They do menial shit while taking small risks with clear downsides so they can win more than they lose. Whether they are in the red or black doesn't come down to the number of wins because options expire worthless more often than not. The make/break is on how much opportunity cost they gave up to run their options instead of investing, how bad they lose the few times they do lose, and if they bought adequate protection for the cases they lost.",
