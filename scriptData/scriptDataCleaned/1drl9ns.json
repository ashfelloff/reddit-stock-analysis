  "selftext": "PFE, PYPL & NKE are the best three stocks on the stock market as of today.\n\nPFE - 20B higher revenue than Eli Lily, PFE had 150B in revenue in 2022, that's more revenue than Eli Lilly is expected to hit by the 2040s or 2050s. Dengue, bird flu, and new viruses mean PFE will get more revenue. Eli Lilly has only gone up in revenue by 10B in the last 12 years.\n\n  \nPYPL - The pe is approaching meta level lows back in Meta's crash. Paypal isn't going anywhere. The institutions are dumping their shares and not buying any. So only retail can buy it and affect prices.\n\n  \nNKE - When inflation goes back to normal, people will buy shoes again and all will be normal",
