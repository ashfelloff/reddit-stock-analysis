Meta withstood the sell-off pretty respectably thanks to their earnings that otherwise would have pushed them to a new high.  Both seem solid, but next earnings will tell the tale.   I'm sure Meta is receiving a lot of campaign $ for advertising, so that will help offset the current economic weakness.",

Looking at how yen carry trades work, seeing the yen gaining value and then Japan raising interest rates on the 31st, you can see why there would be some pullback in the S&P. Would’ve been nice to know about the carry trades before 😂",
