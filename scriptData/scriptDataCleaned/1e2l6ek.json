  "score": 280,
  "selftext": "Given how last week reacted to Fed interest rate cut possibility, do you think SPY is going to 650 this year ? Looks like small and medium cap will join the mag 7 after rate cut. If Nvdia , Microsoft, Apple results are also good this q2, there is no stopping. Especially since election is coming there won't be any major events other than rate cut until Nov.\n\nThanks for the comments everyone! Obviously it has to crash 15-30 % at some point. But I believe it will be some time next year given not much going to happen until election. Also AI boost ( bubble?) Is not yet done. It will continue for few more months before adjusting to reality. It's just my thought. I am very much hopeful for this year. Let's see.\n\nAnother stat for the negative comments.. S&P recorded double digit gain in the first half 15 times in last 4 decades.. every single time it increased further in the second half. 7 out of 15 reached double digit again in second half ! And you people think it's impossible!! ( I am not saying it's obviously going to happen.. but historically there is a good chance)",
