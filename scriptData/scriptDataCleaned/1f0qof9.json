That's literally common sense, if it works the way you describe it, what's stopping everyone from borrowing the max amount they can from their 401k and then simply putting it into a money market and make sp500+4%?.  \n\n>while using it as collateral to make the option purchase in an account with relaxed rules using the loaned cash\n\nthis sentence make no sense, there's no collateral or relaxed rule.  The moment you borrow the money, it's just straight up cash, just not consider income.  Any capital gains you make on it would still be tax like everything else.\n\n> if everything goes south make the 401k withdrawal to cover the loss of the loan and claim it as a tax deduction for the next two years.\n\nagain, you lack basic understanding of how this works.  The \"withdrawal\" is already made, his 401k is just frozen until that amount is paid back through withdrawals from his paychecks or re-depositing his money in.  They give you real hard cash when you borrow, not some sort of electronic IOU that you can use to buy options with.\n\nI don't know why people on here come up with non-sensical theories and think they found some free money glitch that no one else found in the last 30 years.\n\nOP is essentially either funding the US gov. with extra taxes if he win or donating to the MM if he lose.

                          "body": "lol, it would be a huge stretch to read \"when you borrow against it you can keep the capital invested in the 401k account tax free\" to mean that the capital not borrowed is still invested.  I don't know how or why anyone would make that conclusion when reading that statement.\n\n>By relaxed rules OP means a taxable account that doesn’t have the same restrictions as a 401k. Quite easy to see here.\n\nsure, if you completely ignore the non-sense about collateral.  I don't understand why you're using mental gymnastics to try and make sense of his clear lack of understanding on the topic, but it's you're time to waste.\n\n>HSAs aren’t available to high income earners on good health insurance plans.\n\nthis show not only do you not know what an HSA is, you don't even know how health insurance plans work.  In fact, high income earners are more likely to have an option for a HDHP, compare to people who work for small firms with limited health care options.  One of the criticism about HSA is how it only benefit rich people, so not only do you have a misunderstanding of it, you have a completely opposite understanding of it.\n\nThere are no \"good health insurance plans\" only ones that fit your needs.  You can instantly tell when people have no idea how health insurance work when they say \"good\" or \"bad\" health insurance, instead of what their max out of pocket or deductible is.  HDHP with an HSA is the best insurance plan for anyone under 30 without a long term health condition or kids.",

      "body": "Looking at the photo in the original OP confirms 0DTE is far better than later DTEs. It’s because if OP was trading 0DTE they would have taken those profits when they arose. \n\nInstead, they think they can make even more money. Then, next week or so the market tanks and the option goes negative and never recovers. \n\nThey then either sell at a loss or hold it up to a 100% loss. It’s inevitable because buying later DTE almost always inherently brings on the trading psychology that they have time, when in fact they don’t. When in the negative they’ll keep holding up to a 100% loss because the illusion of having time to expiration causes it. Then every day the option is held it loses money and value. If people that trade later DTE took profits when they arise then trading them might be viable. But because of the illusion of having time to expiration, They’re sure to lose. When trading 0DTE, a trader knows time is of the essence and treats the option like a hot potato. \nAll options should be treated as short-term trading instruments as they were intended to be, no matter the date to expiration. \n\nIn sum, I would take profits and open another trade. Otherwise just because it expires two years from now doesn’t mean the option can’t be down to a 100% loss next week. IJS.",
