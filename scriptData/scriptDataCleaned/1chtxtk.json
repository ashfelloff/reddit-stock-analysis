                  "body": "I can usually meet or beat a 6-12% annual dividend. This is a slow and steady wins the race strategy. At worst your shares go down, but you were paid, so it brings down your cost basis a bit.\n\nI usually sell options with at least a +$5/share out of the money premium and usually the options don't strike. Thanks WSB community!!! \n\nExample buying 1000 shares of Meta the other day netted a 20% premium for a year and a half out. More than 10% a year. If it strikes, I make another $10/share, not a lot but money is money. \n\nSince I am investing solely for the options gains and not for the huge win, if the shares swing massively the other way, and I lose out on even a 100% gain,but doesn't affect me mentally at all. I'm not swinging for the fences, I am just trying to beat the market. When they strike I get my money back sooner, the premium, the out of money price differential and I get to buy the next thing and I don't have to wait as long. That's a win.\n\nFinally, it is great when I have a dividend stock because this just compounds my gains. XLE is an excellent ETF because it's paying me 8% dividend based on my purchase price and I can meet or beat that with the CC's. That's a 20% guaranteed income until it strikes. I will miss my huge dividend, but that's OK. My portfolio is a couple $M that I invest this way. \n\nFinal risk is short term capital gains. That's a downside of covered calls, but I will always take some money over no money.",

      "body": "Anyone who thinks you can quit your job to full time trade - you cannot. \n\nLet’s say you needed 20k to survive a year, which is like poverty level btw. At a reasonable rate of return like 8% you would need over 200k of capital to get your 20k. Problem is that you have to scrape the 20k off the top so it doesn’t compound into the future. You also owe capital gains taxes on it. \n\nAt your level, which looks to have been about 4500 dollars, you would have had to 6x that to withdraw 20k and have your original 4500 to continue investing with.\n\nThat’s 600% gains annually. It is not realistic. Some of the best investors in the world have only managed like 20% annually. Even really good years for a lot of investors like banner once in a lifetime are only like 30% if even.\n\nRay dalio for instance was hailed by some for his trading around the 2008 crash, many saying he predicted a crash and avoided large losses. His best year in the past 15 years? 27% return. \n\nYou can play this fun game with day traders too, ask a day trader what their goal is either daily weekly or monthly then annualize it out. They will often tell you oh if I could make 1% a day I’d be happy. Well there’s 252 trading days a year so that’s fucking 252% gain annually.\n\nNot realistic. And to show how not realistic it is you can play another fun game. If you started with only 1000 dollars at that rate of return you’d have 252,000 dollars in a year. Off 1k. In 2-3 years you’d be the richest person in the history of the world. \n\nThe only people who can consistently do the thing you’re talking about doing are people with enough capital that they already don’t have to work. If you have 10 million dollars to invest you can make a livable return consistently on a yearly basis.\n\nSo to anyone who thinks like OP - stop. It’s not gonna happen for you. You will not trade away your job. You’ll much more likely lose the capital and end up having to work harder or longer to get it back.\n\nYou should think in reverse to this. Your job is there in part to fund investing so in the future you can retire and not have to work.",
