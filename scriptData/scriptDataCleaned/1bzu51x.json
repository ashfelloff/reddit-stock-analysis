If you did then you'd know that shorting those companies has no impact on the lives of billionaires who have long since diversified.\n\n* Poor folk stay poor.\n\nPoors stay poor because \"the game\" is by design to keep poor people poor. And by \"poor\", I specifically mean \"people who need to work to live\" vs \"people who don't need to work to live\". The government needs to keep the people working. There's been no society ever in the history of humanity where the majority of people don't work. Folks thought technology would change that in the 1900s with Jetsons type shit but here we are in 2024 wishing we could go back to [\"simpler times\" where a man can afford a home, a car or two, 1-3 children, a dog/cat, enough for a few vacations, being able to take care of your old parents, and a have a stay at home single income on his single income.](https://nypost.com/2021/11/05/heres-how-much-the-simpsons-house-would-be-worth-today/) All without a college degree btw.\n\nWelfare keeps the poorest from rioting, taxes ramp up as you gain more income, and the economist system will keep most from ever breaking out of the cycle: consumerist mindset means you'll spend more as soon as you get more, easy access to debt and credit further enables it, midlife crisis or forming family by the time you hit peak earnings means you won't save much, those who want to make it will throw away what little money they have into near 0% win crap like short term bear options or lottos hoping for an easy out, etcetc. \n\n* Winners keep winning.\n\nOP lets Bezos and Zuck live rent free in his head but they don't know them at all. They have long since diversified into other things. Their stock keeps going up even without them doing shit. Even when they burn money investing in space crap or metaverse crap it comes up as tax breaks. \n\nMeanwhile OP [hasn't learned from past mistakes](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1alew8i/rh_has_ruined_my_life/) and doubles down on options + being bearish (both proven to be loss generating in the long run)",
