They burned 105m hosting their own videos and images and their player is so bad many subs have it banned. They saw 0 revenue from doing this lmao. Burned 100m+ on ceos. Its legit the easiest thing to turn profitable. Every1 memes on the tactic on taking on high amounts of debt to grow but it does works sometimes. Reddit is one of those companies that you can argue isnt going in debt enough.\n\nIs there a cap on growth? Most likely. But they arent worth a market cap of 2b like some regarded bears here claim. At 8b im surprised some company didnt buy reddit just to be able to control the a significant part of the internet. Because they can cut their operating cost in half within a day, they definitely have a soft limit on how low they can be worth",

The save 3rd party apps blackout didn’t work, but you didn’t see Twitter users doing anything when their site was thrown into a production blender by Elon.\n\nOur protests are useless but we Redditors are special in the sense that we put effort into our posts. Every site has bots, but every site also has users that post low effort content. A couple sentences at most. Here, we have subs of fans and experts that are willing to type out a properly cited APA essay on the most over-specific bullshit topic you’ve ever heard (kind of like I’m doing right now). That may be a little sad in some contexts, but it’s gold to search engines and AI. While we’re the worst user base to manage, we’re also easily the most useful. Not for advertising, but as a source for information. Don’t cite a Reddit thread though.\n\nThe power of neckbeards; hard to manage, but crazy valuable. Good info and free moderation… hard to pass that up",

      "body": "Try advertising on Reddit and you will know why it's not profitable. I can post an add on insta, facebook, tiktok, etc.. in under a minute. I've tried to post ads on reddit multiple times and always denied for some BS reason. They try to set up a call to help you blah blah blah, no hoops anyone would jump through with the ease of posting ads on other platforms. Until they fix this they are fucked IMO",
