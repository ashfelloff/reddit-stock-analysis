Why do you think BRK never bought in on Nvidia even when it was dirt cheap? I remember when I first started investing and also thought Buffett's word was law, You'll grow out of it eventually.\n\n  \nBuffett thrives in recessions where intrinsic value and fundamentals are the only thing that matter. In case you haven't noticed, we're not in a recession, and Buffett has been making pretty bad calls since the start of 2020 in a growth driven market. Don't fall into the trap of thinking that their $1T portfolio moves the same way as your $20k portfolio. I'm fairly certain I've heard Buffett explicitly say that if he had <$1M, he would be investing completely differently.\n\nHere's some advice, since you're obviously quite new and inexperienced to investing based on your worshipping Buffett. **No one knows how the market will move**. There's no stock market prophets out there. There's a lot of educated guesses, but they've all been wrong on several occasions and this includes Buffett. The reason Buffett is rich is because he started a business which has been leveraging compound interest longer than anyone else, not because he's a master at timing the markets.",
