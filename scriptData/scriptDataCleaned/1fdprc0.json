  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nGood news on 2 fronts, important for the big stockmarket cashflows and with impact on all your investments\n\n**A.** No need for Bank of Japan rate hike in September.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ra21jnas11od1.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=72f6dcac914e640ce34d1950485d9c2f2216c8c8\n\nAnd with significant lower oil price, high LNG inventories in Japan and a YEN becoming more expensive compared to the USD, I expect that BoJ will not have to raise their rate in coming months, making it a less aggressive rate hike.\n\nNext BoJ rate hike in January 2025 maybe.\n\n**B.** A softer Basel III End game: less capital requirements for banks\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-backpedals-and-unveils-a-scaled-back-proposal-for-bank-capital-requirements-142309642.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-fed-backpedals-and-unveils-a-scaled-back-proposal-for-bank-capital-requirements-142309642.html)\n\nSee picture in comment\n\nCheers",
