If there is a stock that he wants to buy and hold for long term, and say he wants to own $5M, what he will do when he goes to open a position, is first wait for a slump in price and then buy 1dte calls at the end of that day. Then at market open he will stagger $10M in purchases over the opening hour, then unloads his call, sells 0dte calls, buys puts, and then sells off $5M in shares over the next hour. So he profits off the 1dte calls he bought, profits off the 0dte calls he sold, and profits off the 0dte puts he bought.\n\nHe told me he’s had trades go so well that the entire principal amount that he was planning on purchasing was fully covered but the profits on his options strategy.\n\nAnd the movement was entirely driven by his purchasing. \n\nAnd the chart ends up looking almost exactly like spy did today. opened high, big dip, recovered to previous close.",

                      "body": "Yes, but also no.  Ramping has some grey areas, like; was the sole purpose of the trade to manipulate the price? Well how do you prove that if the trader held a significant portion of the share they purchase after the “ramp”?  And then it raises other questions like, can you make any option plays on any of your trades then?  Like you’re opening a call on speculation that your planned trade will drive activity, so if it does it’s ramping, but what if it doesn’t and your options plays tank? Is it still ramping? Also if you purchase 10M of a stock and the price increased 10-15% are you not allowed to take some of those profits now? How much of a sale of your initial position counts as a pump&dump?\n\nBasically it’s the traders job to bend the rules as much as possible without breaking them, and they have the benefit of the SEC needing to prove they broke the law.  And depending on the severity they might only get a slap on the wrist.",

                  "body": "Hedge funds, by definition, hedge. Their purpose is to hold and maintain lots of institutional capital with returns exceeding savings accounts, but almost always lagging the stock market. Lower risk, lower return. \n\nThey hedge by doing things like buying puts against their own positions while leveraging up during a rally, or deleveraging (selling off shit) when the market dumps. \n\nThey do even dumber stuff like shorting stocks in a downtrend and not covering until it moves against them (think Melvin Capital), or buying stocks with good momentum right before shit hits the fan.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks totally regarded. Hedge funds will never buy the absolute bottom in the market, but they might buy at the absolute top. They will never sell at the absolute top but they might sell at the absolute bottom. That's why I think it's fair to say they buy high and sell low. They're also constantly working against their own positions; puts against share positions, calls against short positions.\n\nFrom the perspective of their large investors, it makes perfect sense. They want decent returns on a large amount of money, with the expectation of most or all of it being available again when they need it, come nuclear war or economic collapse. So hedge funds dip into the stock market to get their returns...then leverage up and buy a mess of options and different trading products to make sure they don't lose it. \n\nA hedge fund is never going to call their clients and say \"Lehman Brothers just collapsed; we're going to YOLO all your money on big banks at fire-sale prices and you can't have your money back for two years.\" No, they'll release a report saying \"2008 has been a challenging year for us, but our protective puts and short positions have paid out handsomely, generating overall returns of -11% against the stock market's -40% return. After closing our riskiest positions we are confident we are in a strong position to secure and grow our clients' capital in the future.\"\n\nYoloing on big banks in the midst of a financial collapse, however, is exactly the sort of thing we do here. Or, you know, Yoloing on retailers in 2020 while everyone's stores are closed, which is how I earned enough money to constantly lose on options with the rest of you guys.\n\nIt's possible to beat the market precisely BECAUSE there's other guys with a lot of money out there whose goal is actually not to beat the market. It's NOT all priced in.",
