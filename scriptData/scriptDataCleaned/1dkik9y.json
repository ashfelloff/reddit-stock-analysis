              "body": "Well when you buy a call someone has to sell for you. So the sentiment is reversed. When you sell a call, the loss is unlimited theoretically… \n\nSo in this case the game is on volatility not necessarily the pricing actually hitting 125.\n\nTo add after just finished with the computer upgrade: \n\nWhen you are options trading as a professional/semi-pro active trader, you would typically trade slight OTM puts/calls to balance out risk/reward and hitting \"Moneyness\"... \n\nWhen you buy a call as a bullish trader, you expect stocks to go up. For this to happen someone has to sell for you. For you - typically - the risk is the premium (SEE NOTE BELOW); while for the seller, he is typically bearish because he wouldn't want you to be in the money and profitable. \n\nPricing of options is determined by people's expectations (NOT by Black-Scholes variants. These formulae try to predict \"if this then that\" in a more intuitive way. Pricing is determined by you and i the market actors). So this means there are multiple ways to \"skin a cat\". The pricing will change as actors intuit the likelihood of that making money. \n\nSo if ABC is trading at 25, I might buy monthly $30c or 32c for risk / reward. If ABC moves to 27 in a week, >30 is likelier to happen.\n\nAt 125 (4x the current stock price); the game is to buy something at 0.01 (lowest you can go), so *any* correct movement will double your money. Not so much about the stock hitting $125++\n\n*So could I just spend $100 every month to buy something at 0.01-0.02 and double money?* Not so fast. Remember that pricing is determined by expectation. If you bought SPX 6000 calls at 0.01 0dte, it probably will not go up in price as much as SameGtop or NVDA.... \n\n\nFor the seller, what's in it for them (other than potentially free money)? You would typically see liquidity issues because clearly the risk/reward is not there, but it's not as \"nuked\" as you think because if I play selling these, I typically would buy shares to hedge and neutralise the delta movement...\n\n\nNOTE: \"In theory when you buy puts/calls your risk is the premium... but there is a difference between \"ITM\" (in the money) and profitability. ITM simply means the strike is breached in your direction, but profit means you get more than you pay. At the end of the day these are real contracts. So if you were to buy - say - NVDA 130C when NVDA is trading at 135, for $7... If NVDA closes and expires at 131C, *you will lose that $6 (7-1)*, but because it's ITM, the Options Clearinghouse will need to balance out all the transactions and assign you the shares at 130 a piece. This could mean you will make more money if they shoot up to 150 in a week, or you could lose more than that $6 premium if NVDA shoots down to 110 in a week....\n\nThis is why you hear a lot of complaining around RH closing at 3:30... it's actually to prevent liquidity issues on edge cases where \"it could be ITM but may not be profitable to close by 4PM\".... At the end of the day the option becomes an obligation to balance out the shares and cash around.",
