That said, it could die a long, slow death as the defense budget slowly shifts to Lockheed, Northrup, etc. Commercial plane sales don't seem to be a strong prospect short term and while the US can heavily subsidize sales, if Boeing can't export many models, it will suffer. \n\n\nI feel like Boeing might be following a GE type path. Once an ubiquitous manufacturer with a huge moat, poor leadership and placing shareholder value above innovation/quality control saw it become a shell of its former glory. Even the government slowly diversified away from GE while ensuring it had enough life to still make the most advanced jet engines. \n\n\nA non profitable company with limited growth potential and no dividend? Looks like a silly place to park a person's money, especially currently. Failure doesn't require chapter 11.
