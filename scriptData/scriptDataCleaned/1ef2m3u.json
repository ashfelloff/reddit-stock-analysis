This option says that the holder can force him to buy 100 shares at $220/share, no matter how low the share price goes.\n\nI buy the put. I don't have shares. If the price stays the same or goes up, the put simply dissolves. If, however, the price of the stock goes way down, say, to $210/share, I can, optionally, either buy shares of TSLA for $210 and force the put writer to buy the shares from me at $220, or I can sell the contract for about $1,000 to someone else who wants to do this.\n\nHowever, the price did not drop. TSLA closed at $220, which is supposed to mean the contract expires worthless.\n\nHOWEVER, because the put was 20 cents in the money ($219.80), the contract executes. As I do not have any shares of TSLA, I'm forced short, which puts -100 shares of TSLA in my account, which I have to buy to get back to zero.",

      "body": "Yo, so looks like what happened is you got screwed by the old, \"What's that closing price again?\" Ive seen this happen where yahoo, and google and etrade and NASDAQ all have different closing prices, because of the HFT trading. Eventually they all have to agree on the price that i think NASDAQ posts. (not sure). But when ever you see a different price reflected on different platforms, you should call in and ask them, and or, just call and cancel the options anyway. \n\nSo your situation specifically, the official closing price for TSLA was not showing, but it was actually <220. Therefore etrade exercised it, because they will exercise your bought options whenever it is in the money by 1 cent. So you got screwed on the price that was being displayed, which is sometimes not the official closing price.   \n  \nunlike what others have suggested, IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH AFTER-HOURS TRADING. \n\nHOWever, EXERCISING options is allowed up until sometime 5pm EST. But for those scenarios could MUST in and say you want to exercise and OTM option (lets say it ended >220 and then afterhours it was trading <220), then you could exercise for cash if you have the margin. (makes money because they would exercise at 220 and buy immediately <220.)  This would also apply to the opposite party if you sold to open, and someone else wanted to exercise OTM. (Remember the rule is still RIGHT TO EXERCISE, but not obligation)\n\nI'm sure you know most of this, im just filling in some details that seem to be missing from other commenters.   \n  \nSo in your specific situation (assuming you learned at 4:30pmEST via hangover, that official CLOSING price was actually <220), call ETRADE and tell them you want the options NOT to be exercised. Then they just remove the options. You could also have bought to close shares in the premarket yesterday, especially if price was not already gaping you.",

Ten minutes before the close and even INTO the close they were still out of the money on the day of expiration.  I watched and KNEW something here is not right.  I closed about half but couldn't get the other half filled. After the close they announced CRWD was joining the SPY500 and somebody knew ahead of time.  And of course I got fukt bigly in my anoos.*\n\n*Why would they pay more than they could by just buying them in the open market?  Leverage & they didn't care* because after the announcement the stock moved up well past the strike.\n\nEdit: In your case you were the buyer and the close was very close to the strike (happens all the time as bots pin them to different strikes). If there is any value at all the broker has the right to auto exercise if you don't.  They don't have to tho and I've had them die when I thought the broker might auto exercise. The only way to know for sure is to close it.  CBOE says only 10% actually get exercised. About 60% get closed and the other 30% expire worthless.
