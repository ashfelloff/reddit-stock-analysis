Netflix says that would be misleading to state. You need to focus on how much we get paid by users.\n\nP.S. There must be a better way to communicate algorithms/people on what to look for. This happens all the time when a company tries to suggest hey you should be looking at x, as that is the metric we are focusing on, that is better for us.
