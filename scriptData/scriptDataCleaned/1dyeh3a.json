The sell power supplies but they don't design or manufacture power supplies, they design and sell RAM modules but they don't manufacture the memory ICs that mainly determine the quality of the modules.\n\n\nPeripherals like headsets, keyboards, mice, as well as PC cases are probably their best opportunity for differentiated products and good margin, but it's a crowded market that seems to be getting even more crowded rather than less.",

Combine this with the huge spike in prices of parts since crypto went mainstream, COVID, and now AI, there is far less cost savings. I think we past the peak synergy of plug and play convenience combined with price efficiency.\n\nIn the past cars were unreliable pieces of shit so everyone had to be at least part mechanic if they wanted to keep them running and save money. Nowadays cars are so reliable and complicated that you really need to make an effort to care if you want to do much beyond changing your own oil/brake pads (and with EVs now that is going away).\n\nI see PC building going the same way, it will be something that dads do and scoff at their kids for not knowing/caring.

EPS growth looks nice though, what‚Äôs really going to help it is when sentiment comes back to small caps and you see multiple expansion. These companies used to trade at 20x 25x 30x forward P/e\n\nIt definitely feels like a bottom though I totally agree.\n\nMy problem is there are so many good values out there right now it‚Äôs hard to divert capital to something like CRSR.\n\nFor example PayPal is at a 14 forward p/e, has similar growth, has a WAAAAAAY better balance sheet, and is honestly a waaay better company that‚Äôs buying back shares and returning value to shareholders on top of it. I can see PayPal 10xing.\n\nI could see CRSR doing well too, but the limits of their sector are hard to overcome. There‚Äôs only so many people who need mousepads and memory. They would need to diversify their products a lot and maybe get into mass market type products that everyone can use for them to ever do real big boy revenue",
