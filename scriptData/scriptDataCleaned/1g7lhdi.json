It’s about the same size as a Toyota Tacoma, Ford Ranger, Jeep Galdiator, etc. All 1/2 ton trucks are bigger than the CT. The CT has nothing to offer to real truck owners who tow and work with their trucks. Reasons:\n\n* The entire truck is made of aluminum and there’s been reports of the rear end snapping off while towing a trailer, which suddenly becomes detached to the truck. Safety chains won’t do jack because the entire rear end falls off.\n\n* The bed is super short, but the bed becomes narrower towards the cab of the truck. This means you can’t even load plywood on it, or anything that is rectangle shaped and longer than 3 feet.\n\n* Because of the oddly shaped bed and poor payload capacity, a camper is out of the question.\n\n* Range severely suffers when towing. You’d either have to take up a bunch of space when charging with a trailer, or you’re gonna have to detach your trailer to charge it… every 100 miles.",
