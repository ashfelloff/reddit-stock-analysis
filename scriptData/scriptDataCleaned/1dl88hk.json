AAPL is trading at 210, but their expected volatility is pretty low compared to NVDA at 130s. This is what determines your call and put pricing. Similarly when you compare NFLX and SPY pricing for example. \n\nBut still even with your example, at most you lose $12K compared to $68K from buying 100 shares of NFLX outright... It's true that NFLX theoretically won't drop to $6.8 per share in a year, but by definition this 12K v 68K **is** leverage. \n\nLeverage =/= profitable for sure. You need to look at volatility and expected move. When volatility is low maybe buy, when volatility is high, sell. You can short-sell options too.
