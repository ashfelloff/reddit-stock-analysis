  "selftext": "Dish guy really convinced this fellow regard last year into thinking Dish stock could be the play. Iâ€™d like to preface with, I am too broke to mess around with options, so I bought some stock and figured I could just do an easy flip. Well after the stock tanked I knew I was in for a long hold or loss. So I held, through the tank, through the Echostar Merger that didnâ€™t appear fortuitous (Initially), and all the way until today. Over the past few months Echostar, SATS, had been creeping up into the green, and today had a solid leap. I thank you, Dish guy, for my unrealized loss leading to todays realized gain. Purchase price at 22$, sold at 30$.I always believed in you Dish Guy. ",
