Firms like Citadel. Firms like Fidelity. Firms like Viking Global. Capital Research. We are all running large teams of people that are engaged in fundamental research, **trying to drive the value of companies towards where we think they should be valued;** and, passive investing, in a sense, enjoys the market efficiency that we create in our work each and every day.\"\n\nKen Griffin admits they are manipulating prices.\n\nSo, when the price of a lot of stocks drop at the same time, it is probably coordinated among those groups. It isn't the individual investors who all wake up one morning and decide to sell.\n\nLook up the short interest of your favorite stock and figure out how much the short sellers made when the price was forced down.",

What's with this? 😂\n\nLike this one, it's a reasonable theory, I don't personally agree with it outright but the end result might not be different. Japan absolutely knew what was going to happen when they did this. It's happening, it's clean off their market and by proxy ours and by proxy wringing leverage out of the carry trade. This one doesn't seem as bad as the Asian contagion of 1998, however even with that one, the s&p sold off hard for a month and 3 months later we were making you all-time highs, some variation of that is very easy to picture this time and this is why I say even though I don't necessarily agree, the end result is kind of the same thing. We have this sell off that allows the Fed to do their thing, Japan stabilizes their currency because right now right cuts would just fan the flames of the USDJPY. The public sees a crisis and a federal response to it therefore it really squashes down any potential political finger pointing. Anyone that says, well this helps Harris, well do you think a crisis right before the election helps Harris? \n\nSo what was the ultimate motive for manufacturing this crisis? I don't think that's one we will ever know, publicly inflation in Japan is the stated reason. I'm pretty sure a 20% fall in their index has kind of cooled off the spending a little bit. If this continues, even if it continues for a few more days, very easy to picture the nikkei absolutely terrifying people over there\n\nWhat it looks like to me is we are going to have a diet version of the Asian contagion. If we test the s&p 5000 to 5100 level, that would not surprise me at all, as low as 4,800 also would not surprise me. To start getting under that something would have to really be spiraling or this whole leverage windup currency carry is much much larger than we currently realize",
