  "selftext": "Today I produce to you the Millenial 40 List a.k.a MILF. These are 40 stocks that Stacy's mom might not have heard of, but our millenial buddies use these products and services all the time. This is a serious list.\n\nTo start off, we'll go big in the cap spectrum.\n\nOur millenial buys AAPL products, uses MSFT Excel and Outlook at their \"Information Worker\" job. They are frequently gamers, so they need to buy NVDA GPUs and AMD CPUs. They often buy these at AMZN.\n\nThey buy YouTube Premium and YouTube TV, so they can skip the ads of their fellow influencers (GOOGL)\n\nThey spent most of their waking hours at META's Instagram website.\n\nThey drive a TSLA or RIVN.\n\nThey're on the GLP-1 drug (LLY) to impress their SOs.\n\nThey're churning their credit cards with AXP Platinum and Gold, JPM's Chase Sapphire Preffered (no, NOT Reserve), some younger ones need to rely on COF's Venture and Venture X cards that gave nice \"subs\".\n\nThey use these cards frequently to eat out and earn those points at CMG, SHAK and SG.\n\nThey're flying a lot on DAL, and they need their free wifi that is often sponsored by their preferred choice of mobile carrier, TMUS.\n\nTo get to the airport they need to use UBER or LYFT, since they don't want to drive their sweet electric ride. When they arrive at their destination airport, they pick up their rental car, and of course they prefer AVIS (CAR), but their credit cards give them presential circle status on HTZ, so they are ok with that too.\n\nThey check into their hotel room at Marriott (MAR) to impress their friends, but really they are using all their Chase points to book Hyatt (H) hotels. The slightly less premium young ones will have to go Hilton (HLT) and fly on UAL.\n\nThey often booked all this travel on EXPE or BKNG. Sometimes they use ABNB.\n\nWhen they check in they need to get some food, so they use their DASH gift card they bought at COST every two weeks because they get 20% off.\n\nWhen they go to Vegas, they prefer to stay in WYNN, because it's where all the hot ones stay.\n\nAfter they're done with their holidaying which they do basically 4 months out of the year, they're going to ULTA or LULU to buy their beauty products or Khakis.\n\nThey are drop shipping on SHOP and sometimes they need to use ZM to conduct \"business\" for their \"coaching classes\" that they teach. A lot of times they get paid using Venmo (PYPL).\n\nWhatever money they make, they buy call options on HOOD.\n\nAt the end of the day their sugar daddy's give them a $1m deposit so they can buy those nice suburban homes built by TOL and furnished by WSM.\n\nAnd of course, they spend their entire day on RDDT.",
