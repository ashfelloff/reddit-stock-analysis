I mean, there's costs attributable to the admin of these 17,000 employees which I'm assuming is not done solely within the department (think HR). Then there's costs for development computing (cloud for devops, plus devops engineer comps if that's handled outside the department ). And of course there's business functions that aren't necessarily performed by the dedicated employees, like marketing, which would have costs besides just the employees. And then there actually is the costs of servers, production materials, and w/e else OP was talking about. So even if we assume an average comp of 300k per dedicated engineer, I can definitely see these costs being so high.",
