It will probably be another couple days before we completely finish cleaning up the mess.\n\nWe were already going to be replacing CrowdStrike with something else before this shit went down, but I bet leadership will want that schedule accelerated after this debacle.\n\nThe silver lining is that some companies might learn the folly of having most of their IT offshored, now that they've been hit with something where having local hands would have been useful. Having people who speak poor English walking non-technical users through booting into safe mode, entering bitlocker keys, and deleting files via command line has been nightmarish for all involved.",

What about earnings retention credits?  The truth is, most business owners take distributions and gut the company of any capital for rainy day funds.",
