  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "NVDA will continue to be a great company, but it will face increasing competition as even its own customers are working to design their own silicon. The stock won’t tank, but its rise will be slower, followed by a decline before “settling” at a price and growth rate more typical of a multitrillion dollar company.\n\nMy play instead is TSM. TSM is the most advanced semiconductor fab in the world. They build NVDA’s silicon for them, but they also build Apple silicon and that of many others. They are far ahead on fab tech, beyond everyone except maybe Samsung, and no matter who competes with NVDA, TSM will keep getting those orders to build the most advanced designs. There is no one who can do what TSM does without an unfathomable level of investment in fabs—their moat is huge. \n\nWith NVDA’s earnings today, TSM rose 4.5%…not far behind NVDA’s own 5.8%. And I think in the coming days, weeks, and months, TSM’s growth rate will surpass that of NVDA, AAPL, and the other customers that rely so heavily on this fab. ",

          "body": "It’s a risk, but a much lower one than the market thinks. My “real job” is in China policy, and I lived in Taipei and Hong Kong for many years. China’s economy is weak and will be for at least the next couple of decades due to a number of factors including demographic changes and increasing global trade barriers. Invading Taiwan would cause an economic collapse in China, which would risk political instability—and priority #1 for the country’s rulers is avoiding political instability. \n\nAlso, a Taiwan invasion would be militarily very painful. The country is basically a porcupine designed to repel invaders. There are two beaches on the entirety of the island’s China-facing coast that are suitable for ground troops—both well defended. Mobilizing for an invasion would require at least a couple million troops amassing for a month or more in Southeast China—during which Taiwan and its allies would be preparing for them if not outright shooting at them. Once the invasion begins, you’ve got to have thousands of boats crossing what would be a heavily mined strait with missiles raining down on them. \n\nIf the invasion succeeds, estimates are a million dead young Chinese men…in a country where almost everyone is an only child. And then the CCP has got more political instability with a huge number of newly-childless parents. \n\nThe more likely scenario, though still not particularly likely, is an attempt at (a) an embargo of the island, or (b) an “invasion” of Kinmen, a tiny Taiwan-controlled island that is so close to China that it can be seen from the beaches there, and where the small population is largely pro-China. In both scenarios, a resolution is likely that doesn’t expose TSM to much damage.",
