In other words, they created and gave out a bunch of stock to the executives.  This is a 'cost' because they gave the stock to the executives but also created it.  So it didn't cost them cash.  The way it's supposed to work is that when a company creates stock, it dilutes everyone else, which lowers the stock price for existing shareholders. So companies don't like doing this very often or for very much as shareholders are the ones who vote to do it.  You would do it if the company needed to raise money for future investments and felt the dilution would be less than the raise.\n\nThe way it works for this company is that they diluted the stock by about 50%, and the stock price went up. They also reported a 30% decrease in revenue YoY, which would kill any 'growth' company, and the stock price dipped slightly.",
