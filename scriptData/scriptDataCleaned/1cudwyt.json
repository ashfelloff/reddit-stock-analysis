That being said I‚Äôve heard rumors of a stock split and I was wondering how that will impact the price. I know it had a red day today, but I bought a 5/24 $1,150 C @ 2.50 and I‚Äôm riding it out till Wednesday because I believe it‚Äôll get to $1,000 by then at least if not more‚Ä¶.. right?",

Given the share price and float I just doubt how much it can go up.\n\nMeanwhile, if they don‚Äôt obliterate earnings and just meet them I think the stock is coming down hard given how far it‚Äôs run. Seems like an asymmetrical trade to the downside so I‚Äôm short some shares. It‚Äôs also universally loved at this point. Also meta got slapped last quarter for saying they were going to be spending like crazy for several quarters. I think this was a warning shot for the semi trade as the minute the hyperscalers stop getting rewarded for spending they will do an about face and focus on profitability.\n\nLast quarter the stock went vertical into the print, then a couple days before there were a lot of people with cold feet advocating taking some profits, then they beat massively and the stock went vertical again into what seemed like a blowoff top after the print.\n\nThis time the trading and sentiment into the print have been different. The stock dipped then ripped back towards the old highs into the print. But sentiment this time seems more complacent. We all know what they will say and a beat is likely, the question becomes at what point does the street start discounting peak AI spend? You don‚Äôt want to be long when that happens and I think it will seem very non obvious what‚Äôs happening at first.",
