                  "body": "Sure. AI is essentially two things: data and GPUs. You can have all the GPUs you want but if you don't have any data to work with it's useless. Some spaces where AI is useful can generate their own data. Not that it's necessarily _easy_ but with the right amount of money it can be done consistently. That doesn't hold true with the space like ChatGPT where you want to create something that sounds like a person. You need lots of people, posting lots of opinions on lots of different subjects. It may be up for debate but the other social media giants like Facebook, and X don't have what Reddit does because people don't make long detailed comments (much like this one). And getting back to my point earlier, you could throw billions of dollars at creating a Reddit clone to produce data of your own and just, flat out fail.\n\nOf course there are the risks: Maybe this AI thing is overblown, maybe the data pulled by ChatGPT before Reddit shut down the API is all that was needed so Reddit's fresher dataset isn't worth much, maybe AI overall is useful but the ChatGPT space itself is not. I'm kinda on the fence on these risks and that's why I say I _understand_ it but I haven't invested myself because I feel like it could go either way.\n\nIn short: Reddit has a very unique dataset which would take decades to replicate. Time will tell if that data has the value (or more) it appears to have for the moment.",
