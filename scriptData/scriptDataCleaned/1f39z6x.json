There's single analysts covering multiple companies, you've got thousands, if not millions of accounts, you have fuck all of an idea what funds go in and what go out... I worked in Liqui Risk Mgmt for a while, it's staggering that no one knows what comes in and what comes out. You call treasury, they have no idea, it's really funny. Banks, even at a small level, are waaaaay too large to get a grasp on. And to think some employers have an employee turnover of less than 10 years. Every 10 years, on average, the bank has been completely changed out with new folks. It's fascinating that banks, the bigger they are, they more stable they are simply because they are so diversified that it doesn't really matter if something goes bust... because the ship is so big and so robust, a small crack seals itself.\n\n  \nIt's fascinating, really.",

The contentious part is when those revenues are realized. This is it. \n\nPretty much all other Hindenburg allegations are hocus pocus, and their standard model is to start a lot of smoke and hope something comes out of it. After their attack if a company sues them they ask for all financial documents in discovery, which is a disaster in itself, which is why no one sues them.\n\nAs per the delay, won't be surprised if SMCI is doing additional audits to be on the good side of SEC, and be accurate. The accounting firm they use will be independent and have shared responsibility. I think this is the right way to go. \n\nWhere the stock moves from here really depends on the fundamentals, which I think makes this a very cheap entry point. I just loaded up today for this reason.",
