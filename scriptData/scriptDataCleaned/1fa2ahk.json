  "selftext": "It all started on the 11th of July. The every declining Japanese yen completely u-turns on word that Interest rates will be increased. Market participants panic, but it's early days. Risk managers are trimming, but not trying to raise alarm bells. \n\nThe ever growing yen and determination of the BOJ to remain hawkish further panics market participants, who are scrambling to sell assets to recoup the liquidity it needs to pay off their loans potentially new interest rates. Everything gets liquidated, from gold to Bitcoin, it seems plenty of whales have been taking advantage of the low interest loans, the question is just how much has yet to be unwounded?\n\n",

There's absolutely no way ism manufacturing data caused this! BULLSHIT!!!! It (manufacturing sector) accounts for less than 12 percent of USAs GDP. The services sector for example accounts for over 70% and yet it did nothing! Despite beating consensus.... This is a cover up of major proportions!!!",
