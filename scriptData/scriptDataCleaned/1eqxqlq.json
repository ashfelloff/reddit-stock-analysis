When I was in high school I had a shrimp guy. Dude would pull up and give you a ton of shrimp for ten or twenty bucks. Big ones too. A lot of people don't know this, but you can do a ton of things with shrimp. Shrimp is the fruit of the sea. You can barbecue it, boil it, broil it, bake it, saute it. Shrimp-kabobs, shrimp creole, shrimp gumbo. Pan fried, deep fried, stir-fried. There's pineapple shrimp, lemon shrimp, coconut shrimp, pepper shrimp, shrimp soup, shrimp stew, shrimp salad, shrimp and potatoes, shrimp burger, shrimp sandwich. That's about it.",
