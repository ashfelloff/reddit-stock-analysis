I’m just confused how their value became this high this quick when it doesn’t look like they were performing as good anymore.

Look at the 2011 10k (note MSFT fiscal year end is June 30th), Microsoft’s Windows and Windows Live segment was the 2nd largest revenue segment with $18.7B (behind Microsoft Business Division with $22B) with Server and Tools (aka Cloud before it was called that) coming in 3rd at $17B. **But** Windows and Windows Live operating income was 2x Server and Tools ($12B vs $6B)\n\nMicrosoft didn’t truly embrace its cloud-first transformation until Satya was CEO in 2014.",
