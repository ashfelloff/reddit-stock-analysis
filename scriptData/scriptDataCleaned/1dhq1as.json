Because I don't have the whole portfolio in NVDA.\n\nA few things to get out of the way in case people ask\n\nPortfolio now is about  \n\\~3M in different ETF, QQQM, VOO, SCHD, etc  \n\\~1M in SNSXX which is a treasury based money market fund  \n\\~500K in other individual stocks, also heavy on tech (AAPL, MSFT, TSMC mostly)  \n\\~5.5M in NVDA\n\nI think the discord on NVDA here is too extreme, either that it will tank immediately or that it will moon immediately.  I think the answer is more nuanced.  It is actually now at a point that it is very difficult to say which way the stock will go.  \n\nBull's case:  \n- Blackwell will change the game from selling GPU to selling whole solution.  This has potentially the largest immediate bump in financial in the next 2Q.  I think it will be apparent in Aug's guidance to see if there is some real crazy guide coming out or not.  This is probably the most concrete immediate bull case.  \n- AI is real, there is no way the big players will try to save money to lose the race.  This does not only include CSP.  Enterprise and Nation States will need to get in ASAP too.  \n- There are other real long shot also where AI break through actually enable new market.  Medical research vastly boosted by AI.  Actual FSD being massively adapted and NVDA's automotive business take off drastically.\n\nBear's case:  \n- Competition catching up, NVDA's moat (TCO) lose strength  \n- Actual recession to slow down NVDA's customer's spending  \n- Taiwan and War\n\nWith this comparison I would like to think that bull's case has more chance to play out.  However Are we going to see massive upside like what we had in the last 18 months?  Not unless market goes really irrational.  And I am not sure if I would like that.  ",

Not sure how big of a risk this is.\n* company's that are banking on AI to generate more revenue for them won't generate as much as they think or provide as large of a cost savings as they would have liked?\n* internal development of processing chips that are not marketed to the masses but good enough for what the company needs impacts NVIDIA's demand. I think in 2025 we will understand more of this impact.\n* Supply strain constraints - all the materials that are required to make semiconductors, the main supplier for the raw materials is China. Russia is the second largest supplier of silicon. Germanium and gallium arsenide = china is a heavy producer.\n* some geopolitical shit happens with China excluding a Taiwan invasion.\n\nanyways not financial advice, just my observations.

If they can get within what they feel is an acceptable distance of the best AI hardware out there at a fraction of the cost creating internally and working with TSMC and others directly, they will. They are bleeding too much money on AI with limited real ways to tangibly generate profit to justify it right now. Most of them have far deeper cash reserves than Nvidia to dump resources into playing some sort of functional catch up and bullying for fab time on latest nodes. \n\nEven if AI as is currently raved about is more than just a bubble/fad, it's not financially sustainable to keep lighting money on fire for the latest H100/B100 hardware like they are right now. Nvidia will never be in a stronger position in this area than they are right now, because they caught everyone with their pants down coming right off the last big bubble which fueled them into position to do so (crypto hardware bubble).\n\nAnd to be clear I'm not saying Nvidia will lose their AI hardware performance lead, moreso that it will become increasingly less relevant big picture due to financial realities.",
