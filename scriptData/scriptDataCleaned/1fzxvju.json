But the minutes indicated that others also favored a smaller move. It was the first time a governor had dissented on an interest rate vote since 2005 for a Fed known for its unity on monetary policy.*\n\n*“Some participants observed that they would have preferred a 25 basis point reduction of the target range at this meeting, and a few others indicated that they could have supported such a decision,” the minutes stated.*\n\n*“Several participants noted that a 25 basis point reduction would be in line with a gradual path of policy normalization that would allow policymakers time to assess the degree of policy restrictiveness as the economy evolved,” the document added. “A few participants also added that a 25 basis point move could signal a more predictable path of policy normalization.“*\n\n*Since the meeting, economic indicators have showed that the labor market is perhaps stronger than officials favoring the 50 basis point move had expected.*\n\n*In September, nonfarm payrolls increased by 254,000, much more than expected, while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%.*\n\n*The data has helped cement expectations that while the Fed likely is in the early days of an easing cycle, future cuts likely would not be as aggressive as the September move. Chair Jerome Powell and other Fed officials in recent days have backed the expected 50 basis points in cuts indicated by the “dot plot” unofficial forecast released after the September meeting.*\n\n*The minutes noted that the vote to approve the 50 basis point cut came “in light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks” against the labor market. The minutes noted that a “a substantial majority of participants” favored the larger move, without specifying how many were opposed. The term “participants” suggests involvement of the full FOMC rather than just the 12 voters.*\n\n*The minutes also noted that some members favored a cut at the July meeting that never materialized.*\n\n*Though the document was more detailed about the debate over whether to approve the 25 basis point cut, there was not as much information about why voters supported the larger move.*\n\n*At this post-meeting news conference, Powell used the term “recalibration” to sum up the decision to cut, and the term also appears in the minutes.*\n\n*“Participants emphasized that it was important to communicate that the recalibration of the stance of policy at this meeting should not be interpreted as evidence of a less favorable economic outlook or as a signal that the pace of policy easing would be more rapid than participants’ assessments of the appropriate path,” the minutes stated.*\n\n*Such a recalibration would bring policy “into better alignment with recent indicators of inflation and the labor market.” Supporters of the 50 basis point cut “also emphasized that such a move would help sustain the strength in the economy and the labor market while continuing to promote progress on inflation, and would reflect the balance of risks.“*\n\n*Under normal circumstances, the Fed prefers to cut in quarter-point increments. Previously, the Fed moved by half a point only during Covid and, before that, the 2008 financial crisis.*\n\n*Market pricing is pointing to the fed funds rate ending 2025 in the 3.25%-3.5% range, about in line with the median projection of a 3.4% rate, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch. Futures markets previously had been indicating a more aggressive path and in fact now are pricing in about a 1-in-5 chance that the Fed does not cut at its November 6-7 meeting.*\n\n*The bond market, though, has been acting differently. Since the Fed meeting, both the 10- and 2-year Treasury yields have surged about 40 basis points.*",

They may have used the weak jobs report as an argument to favour the 50bp cut against those who are more hesitant but I doubt it was the deciding factor. The fact is inflation is pretty spot on where they would hope it would be. They wouldn’t want it to be much lower right now, otherwise the risk of overshooting would look to great, with high interest rates still likely pressuring inflation downwards, with the effect lagging. \n\nThe better than expected jobs report since shouldn’t change their course of action as long as inflation continues to come in in line with expectations. The balancing act they’re trying to pull off is working out perfectly for them so far, and pausing cuts due to a healthy economy with inflation in the target range would make very little sense. They would be shooting themselves in the foot. They’re just as aware of the risk of deflation and recession. They’re close to pulling off their dream scenario",

There's really no good reason to start with 50 bps cut, and then not cut at all in 1 out of the next 2 meetings. Cutting by an extra 25 bps 1.5 months early is not gonna make or break the economy, but it creates a huge inconsistent image if you start with 50 bps and then pause the next. Most of the 3 cuts people were probably pressed by Powell to not dissent on the vote.

The Fed is constantly adapting to changing data.  And all the recent data points to strong economy (the recent jobs report was insanely bullish), so I certainly could see them pausing, particularly given their historical hawkishness.  Although quarter point is also possible.  I think the most likely scenario is two quarter point cuts.\n\nAs far as where the median lies, I don't understand your math.  There aren't 19 relevant people in the Fed.  Non-voters opinions don't matter -- they can talk all they want, but they don't set policy. The 12 votes that matter are here: [https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/](https://www.itcmarkets.com/hawk-dove-cheat-sheet-2/)\n\nYou can somewhat assume the 4 hawkish dots in the June dot-plot are likely Bowman, Schmid, Bostic, and Kashkari.  Of those, two are voting this year, and two are voting next year.  So at best (worst?), 2 of the 12 voting members of the Fed are effectively not in favor of cutting much further.  Moreover, the 2025 Fed voting picture gets even more dovish since it brings in Goolsbee...you're going to have 4 doves, 2 hawks, and a middle that slides a bit more dovish.",

Their dot plots were done before the strong data. That means they thought 5.5% was obviously way too high to warrant starting with 50 bps cut, but then 5.0% is somehow not that high to even warrant a cut?\n\nWhen you're talking about Fed medians, I'm assuming you're talking about all officials. Among 2024 voters and 9 people who put in 3 cuts in 2024, Bowman, Bostic, Barkin, and Waller would've all preferred a 25 bps cut. Hammack was a voter, but no clear side from her yet. I was talking about Sept dot plot, not June dot plot. I don't know why you're bringing up June dot plot to describe voters in Sept.\n\nAlso, that dove/hawk spectrum is pretty wrong by the way. Kashkari has turned back into a dove already and thinks the risk shifts more towards weaker labor market. Barkin is the third most hawkish Fed member behind Schmid. Daly's a dove, and Waller's much more hawkish than Powell, who is now pretty much a dove. In fact, Waller probably sets the tone for where the hawks stand, which was why the Sept vote was very surprising because the Friday before the blackout period, Waller came out and didn't give forward guidance for a 50 bps cut, which caused even the most dovish forecasters like Citi to move to predicting 25bps cut.\n\nFor 2025, you get Goolsbee but loses Daly. You get Collins which is pretty much centrist, and Hammack is unknown. Loses Bostic but gets Schmid, so it's pretty much the same as 2024.",

                          "body": "lol, Kashkari changing his view on cuts literally in just the last month or two doesn't make him a dove...he's been plastered on the \"moar hikes\" bandwagon practically all year (he's on the record as saying \"rate hikes aren't off the table\" as late as May 28th: https://www.barrons.com/articles/fed-rate-hikes-kashkari-6224f141).  If anything, the fact he's acquiesced to cuts (and significant ones at that) is more of a sign of how much sentiment has shifted, even among the hawks.\n\nWhereas nothing is perfect, I found that cheat sheet to be relatively accurate.  Daly isn't a dove...in fact, I've seen Daly go back and forth quite a few times in sentiment, very similar to Powell and Williams, both of whom are fairly rated in the middle-ish.  They all tend to be reactive more than proactive.\n\nThe fact you call Powell a dove is nuts.  If he was a dove, they would have cut a quarter point in June when they should have.  He's \\_very\\_ clearly more weighted towards overvaluing the inflation side of their dual-mandate.  Waller may be a \\_touch\\_ too dovish on the chart, but marginally...he's nowhere near the Kashkari range.  He's probably somewhere between Barkin and Bostic.  At that rate, you're really splitting hairs though.\n\nFor 2025, I still disagree.  Losing Daly, who is close to the middle, is not the same as gaining Goolsbee.  When it comes down to it, I kinda view it like the Supreme Court...Bowman/Bostic/Schmid/Kashkari are your Alito/Thomases...you know what they're going to do before they vote.  Kugler, Barr, Goolsbee, and Cook are like Sotomayor...you know what they're going to do before they vote.  Everybody else is somewhere around the Roberts area...their opinions are going to ebb and flow based on prevailing data (Daly being in that cross-section).   Gaining a Goolsbee and losing a Daly is a distinct dovish shift...it's a shift from a situational dove to a definite dove.",

                              "body": "Did anyone else on the Fed say the risk is more weighted towards weaker labor market? None. Therefore, Kashkari is NOW a dove. I don't care what he said 12 months ago, because we're talking about the present. If you want to talk about the past, why stop at 12 months. Go back 6 years, when he was the most dovish member.\n\nIf you listened to Daly talk at all, you'd see she clearly shifts more towards protecting the labor market. She's a labor economist by training, and frequently talks about the hardship of lower class workers. Of course she's gonna lean towards protecting the labor market, which hits the lower class the most in recessions.\n\nPowell is CLEARLY a dove now. Look at his Jackson Hole speech. He was obviously pressuring the hawks in the committee towards a cut. Whenever Powell speaks at the FOMC or Jackson Hole, he has to represent the whole community, not just his own opinion. The fact that he declared definitively the Fed was cutting when several hawks were still on the fence, and then chimed in his own dovish opinions on a platform where he was representing the whole committee (hawks and doves) showed he was trying to steer the committee towards him. Even in July FOMC before the weak job report, you could see he was leaning towards a cut when the labor market was supposedly super strong, but couldn't convince the committee to get on board. He's been itching to cut since July, easily just a notch below Goolsbee, and that's only because he has to represent the whole committee.\n\nBarkin is just as hawkish as Kashkari 6 months ago. He rarely talks about inflation progress, and is always cautious that businesses have shifted towards raising price first mindset. He doesn't even want to go back to neutral rate yet, which means he still thinks the risk leans towards higher inflation. In fact, they were frequently among the most hawkish dot plots along with Bullard/Mester/Bowman, and Bostic/Waller 1 notch below them. Waller was always saying the labor market is strong and there's no rush to cut in all his speech.\n\nNo one knows what Barr will do. Barr doesn't talk about the economy much. He pretty much just follows Powell.",

I mean he's pretty much a hawkish *meme* on the internet with his crazy eyes.  Is it possible his view radically shifted again?  Absolutely.  But I don't believe it yet.\n\nOn Powell, I still disagree.  His talk didn't talk dovish until after the June jobs report, when it became \"club over the head\" obvious to everyone (Kashkari included).  Powell talked very hawkish up to the point, including in his response to questions at the FOMC.  In general, looking back at the FOMC meets, he would very easily dismiss weakening labor market news and trends and be very quick to latch onto even a subtle shift in inflation numbers.  Like inflation would have 1 month of surprise upsurge and he would insist they need 3 more months of good inflation data before they can think of cutting.  And if another upsurge happened in those 3 months, he'd reset the 3 month counter.  That went on nearly all year, fully ignorant of the trendline.  \n\nAnd the inverse was true of jobs. Like you would see this clear upward trend (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA) in unemployment that he would fully ignore, pointing to the fact it went down in like a single recent report.  I could ***very easily*** see Powell looking at the recent 254k jobs report, freaking out, and returning to his hawkish talk (needing \"more data\", \"having plenty of time to wait\", \"pausing w/ tools to respond\").  That's his MO...overreact to a single recent event and be slow to react to broader trends.\n\nAt any rate, agree to disagree on this one, but you have fair points.",

If this is what he believes in, he should slowly cut until early next year and observe what inflation does, not start with 50 bps cut. There's also the new president next year which would be inflationary no matter what, so that further adds reasons to go slow and wait until next year.\n\nUnemployment rate going up is due to more labor supply, not layoffs. What's the rush in that? Unemployment was going up for months while we continued to add 250k+ jobs, and everyone was saying nothing but positive things about the economy. We only shifted down to 150k jobs for 2 months and now suddenly the labor market is weak? Consumer spending is strong, job confidence is strong. If there was any real risk of recession, economists and the market would've already flagged that, but none have so far.\n\nBtw, a dove focuses more on the job mandate, and a hawk focuses more on the inflation mandate.

If anything, the story of 2024 is that he says the same thing, reiterating himself again and again and again.  Hell, the whole reason the stock market would tank after each Fed meeting is because people kept expecting the dovish \"cuts are coming soon\" convo and he'd stubbornly stick to hawkish \"don't even think about it, we need more data\", promptly causing a rapid sell off in equities.  The market was over-pricing cuts because they literally were ignoring the words coming out of his mouth.

Powell doubled down on the dot plot’s hawkish tone at the press conference, proclaiming, “If the economy remains solid and inflation continues to persist, we are prepared to maintain the current rate level. If the labor market were to weaken significantly…we are prepared to respond\"*\n\nThat's literally the *exact* same stance he was running for 7 meetings prior: hold rates steady, wait for data.  There wasn't a hint of dovishness there.  He doesn't say anything like \"we're preparing to cut soon\".  That didn't come until Jackson Hole following the dismal June jobs report.\n\nOn the labor market, it is weak, but macroeconomics don't turn on a dime.  Show me any time in history on this chart where the unemployment rate starts turning upward and then stops or declines after only three quarters of a percentage point: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE)\n\nYou won't find it.  Sentiment and trends are long term glacier-like snowballing effects.  It's why you can't ***see*** a recession until you're in it.  Because if all you're focusing on is present data whilst ignoring a clearly developing trend, you'll never see it.  Sure, the labor market is fine now.  But that's not what I'm concerned about.  Do you ever wonder why the Fed is always behind the curve and seems to miss the boat all the time?  Always reacting and cleaning up messes after economy implosions instead of being ahead of the ball?  This is why.  They're going to see that most recent 254k jobs report and go \"look, everything is fine, we can maintain the rate\".  Then the next month the jobs report is going to be adjusted or abysmal, and once again they'll be behind the curve.  Honestly, for entities that constantly claim to care about long-term data, I'm shocked at how short-term thinking they truly are.  Inflation has been on a clear downward trend since at least August 2023, and only ***now*** they start releasing the screws?  When we're only a half percent above 2% CPE?",
