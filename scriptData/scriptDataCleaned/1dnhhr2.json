  "title": "Why space industry and $rklb could be the next big thing",
  "score": 99,
  "selftext": "I wanted to share my thoughts on why I believe the space industry, and specifically Rocket Lab, could be the next big thing. Here’s a quick breakdown:\n\n1. Growing Space Economy: \n\nThe space industry is booming, with projections estimating it could be worth over $1 trillion by 2040. Companies are not just focusing on launching satellites but also on space tourism, mining, and even colonization. This sector is becoming a significant part of our future economy.\n\n2. Rocket Lab’s Competitive Edge:\n\nRocket Lab is positioning itself as a major player in this industry. Their Electron rocket is designed for small satellite launches, which is a rapidly growing market. Plus, they’re working on the Neutron rocket, which could potentially compete with SpaceX's Falcon 9.\n\n3. Frequent Launches:\n\nOne of Rocket Lab’s strengths is their ability to conduct frequent and reliable launches. This reliability is crucial for building trust with clients and securing long-term contracts.\n\n4. Diversified Services:\n\nBeyond just launching rockets, Rocket Lab is moving into other areas such as satellite manufacturing and space systems. This diversification helps mitigate risks and opens up multiple revenue streams.\n\n5. Government Contracts:\n\nThey have secured several contracts with NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense, providing a steady stream of income and validating their technology and reliability.\n\n6. Innovation and Reusability:\n\nRocket Lab is innovating with their reusability efforts, similar to what SpaceX has done. Reusability can significantly lower costs, making space access more affordable and frequent.\n\nIn summary, with the space industry set to explode (figuratively, of course!) and Rocket Lab’s strategic positioning and innovative approach, $RKLB could be a promising investment. As always, do your own research and consider the risks, but I think this is a sector worth watching closely.\n\nWhat are your thoughts? Anyone else bullish on the space industry and Rocket Lab?",

It takes well over a year for those craft to reach that far.\n\nFor space mining, we need all of that plus the ability to mine several tons of cargo, capacity to store it all without burning up on reentry, and powering capabilities to haul it all at a reasonable pace. This is already sending the cost of a single mission to 11 or 12 digits. It will take years for this craft to collect the goods and come back, and at the end of it what gets brought back needs to be valuable enough to turn a profit. \n\nOnce you start to add in risk evaluations of the missions failing, acting like this is anywhere on the horizon as an investment prospect becomes another level of ridiculous.",

Therefore, RKLB would always be able to get business of that with Firefly Aerospace being the only other real player. Furthermore, SpaceX is in constant beef with the FAA so who knows what the future of their government contracts is.\n\nI seriously doubt that we would see the future of SpaceX taking 90%+ of the market, there would always be a niche for a second player with smaller launches even with a higher cost to them.

If it goes to $100 it's literally 20-30x cheaper than any competitor.\n\nAnd they already launch spy satellites:\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacex-launches-first-satellites-new-us-spy-constellation-2024-05-22/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/space/spacex-launches-first-satellites-new-us-spy-constellation-2024-05-22/)\n\nSo yeah nothing you're saying stands up to even basic fact checking.",

Of SpaceX’s 96 launches, two-thirds (63) deployed the company’s Starlink internet relay satellites. Put another way, 30% of the world’s launches and 70% of spacecraft were dedicated to one company’s space business, which catered to less than half a percent (2.3 million) of the world’s population (8 billion) in 2023.\" \n\nSpaceX is the world leader in launching SpaceX satellites, cool. I don't deny they are a leader and very likely will be one in the future, there is a reason they are privately valued at $200B or so, 100x more than RKLB.\n\nI find it very hard to believe any launch cost figure that comes from SpaceX until there is a paying customer for the price they quote. While the latest Starship launch was successful, it's clearly a very complex system that will take years to become reliable enough for commercial operation and some years after that for it to become rapidly reusable. Remember, the vaporware spirit is strong at all of Musk's companies.\n\nMy claim about spy satellites was referring to the fact that they won't be able to be launched by Starship, that's all.",
