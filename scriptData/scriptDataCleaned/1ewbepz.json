              "body": "Delta applies to all options - it's the rate of change in option price relative to the underlying share price\n\nIt is low for OTM and high for ITM. The rate of change is not linear (i.e. gamma, but that's another topic). Delta is a quick figure to represent how many actual shares the option is worth - very useful for delta hedging\n\nQuick example: If an option is ATM then the model assumes there's a 50/50 chance of ending up ITM or OTM by expiry. So delta is 50 - call options are worth about half a share each. When the share price increases by $1, the option price rises by around $0.5 instead\n\nWhy does this matter? Delta is very useful to set your strike levels, and knowing how delta and gamma works explains why options can start snowballing in price - up or down",

Your wildly OTM options will take time to start properly moving in your favour\n- Delta moves the most around the strike price, so a losing trade can very quickly become a winning one and vice versa near the strike price.
