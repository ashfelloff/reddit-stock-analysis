  "selftext": "Hey everyone, something huge went down today, and I wanted to share what I know so far. Some who I know works at Carahsoft in Virginia, and earlier today, the office was raided by around 50-100 FBI agents along with other federal agencies. They confiscated everything from laptops, desktops, and even personal journals, leaving everyone pretty shocked.\n\nHere‚Äôs a quick breakdown of what happened:\n\n* **Date**: September 24, 2024 (Today)\n* **Location**: Carahsoft office in Virginia\n* **What happened**: Employees experienced a weird VMware update across all work laptops. Not long after, FBI agents stormed the building instantly yelling they have a \"Search Warrant\", took equipment, laptops, desktops, even journals and pencils lol, and started questioning employees about the team managing VMware software (who, interestingly, work remotely from places like Hawaii). Tuesdays are their days where most people go in person, the feds did not detain, ask to not talk or read miranda rights etc to the person I know at all. \n* **Agents** were especially interested in the company‚Äôs data servers located on the 4th and 5th floors of the building.\n* **Aftermath**: Employees were told they probably won‚Äôt get their equipment laptops etc back anytime soon.\n* The company is giving everyone new laptops tomorrow so far this is quitet but should come out in public and officially soon.\n\n# Why Does This Matter?\n\nVMware, a major player in cloud computing and virtualization, was recently acquired by **Broadcom** (December 2023), and they hold **very sensitive data** for many industries, including government agencies and national security bodies. Here are some major developments related to VMware and Broadcom over the last year:\n\n* [**Broadcom Completes VMware Acquisition**](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2023/12/13/insights-broadcom-completes-vmware-acquisition-software-business-expected-to-account-for-40-45-of-its-revenue/): This acquisition was a big deal. VMware now dominates the server virtualization market, with more than 70% market share.\n* [**VMware Settles $84.5M Patent Lawsuit**](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/vmware-settles-patent-lawsuit-after-densifys-845-mln-trial-win-2024-05-13/): VMware recently settled a lawsuit where they were accused of infringing on cloud software patents. It‚Äôs a huge case that hints at legal and ethical issues surrounding VMware‚Äôs practices.\n* [**AT&T Sues Broadcom Over VMware**](https://www.fudzilla.com/news/59652-at-t-sues-broadcom-over-vmware-s-extended-support): AT&T is suing Broadcom because Broadcom is refusing to honor VMware support contracts unless AT&T purchases additional (and unneeded) subscription services. AT&T argues this puts national security at risk as many government services rely on VMware‚Äôs software.\n\n# What Could Be Happening?\n\nThe raid could be tied to VMware‚Äôs role in managing sensitive data for **U.S. federal agencies**, including national security bodies. With all the legal drama surrounding VMware‚Äîlike the lawsuit with AT&T‚Äîit‚Äôs possible that VMware‚Äôs data handling or licensing practices raised red flags with the federal government.\n\nAlso, the fact that VMware is integrated into so many critical systems across industries (including **national security** and **first responder systems**) makes this raid potentially more than just a corporate dispute. There could be concerns about **data security breaches**, **corporate espionage**, or even VMware‚Äôs legal battles coming to a head.\n\n# Key Takeaways:\n\n* VMware is involved in **critical U.S. government services** and national security infrastructure.\n* There‚Äôs a growing tension between Broadcom and major companies like AT&T over VMware support, which might put public safety at risk.\n* The raid could be part of a much bigger issue involving **national security** and **corporate malfeasance**.\n\nKeep an eye on this story‚Äîit‚Äôs not getting national coverage yet, but given the scale of the raid and what‚Äôs at stake, it might soon hit the news in a big way.\n\n**Sources:**\n\n* [Broadcom Completes VMware Acquisition, Software Business Expected to Account for 40-45% of Its Revenue](https://www.trendforce.com/news/2023/12/13/insights-broadcom-completes-vmware-acquisition-software-business-expected-to-account-for-40-45-of-its-revenue/)\n* [VMware Settles Patent Lawsuit After Densify‚Äôs $84.5 Million Trial Win](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/vmware-settles-patent-lawsuit-after-densifys-845-mln-trial-win-2024-05-13/)\n* [AT&T Sues Broadcom Over VMware‚Äôs Extended Support](https://www.fudzilla.com/news/59652-at-t-sues-broadcom-over-vmware-s-extended-support)\n* [Broadcom and AT&T Reach Temporary VMware Support Deal](https://www.channelfutures.com/channel-business/broadcom-att-reach-temporary-vmware-support-deal)\n\nLink to my lengthier blog post here  \n[https://techscrutinytoday.blogspot.com/2024/09/carahsoft-office-raided-by-fbi-today.html](https://techscrutinytoday.blogspot.com/2024/09/carahsoft-office-raided-by-fbi-today.html)",

Carahaoft handled the complexity; they knew current approved GSA rates, and had pre-determined selling agreements with a broad range of agencies; we would say they ‚Äúhave the paper‚Äù, which was shorthand for having an agreement to sell into a gov agency.¬†\n\nIf that‚Äôs still the case (like I said, it‚Äôs been awhile since I did this for a living), the raid likely has to do with improper rates (ie, charging too much), kickbacks, stuff like that.¬†",

So it's becoming increasingly difficult for companies to get help installing and maintaining their VMWare deployments, even though they're paying 10X the previous cost for this support!

I worked a job early in my career and got to see a contract for a \"CEO/Director\" and granted he was only making 160k/year... and to me at the time making 45k/year in middle America I was like \"If I made 160k/year I would be happy for life\"\n\nAnyway, he showed me what his employment contract looked like as a Director because we talked about life at that level and how I wanted to be there and all. So in his offer letter, it basically stated, in plain English, that at any point from day 1 of him coming onboard, that if he didn't like the job, or the board didn't like him, he could quit or they could let him go, and they would have to write him a check equivalent to 1 years salary with taxes accounted for, meaning he would get to take home an actual 160k, so the actual check would need to be for a bit more accounting for his tax bracket and all...\n\nSo I remember asking, I said something like... wait wait wait.... so when you reach this level, you can just start this job knowing if it doesn't work out 1 day, 5 days, 4 months down the road, at any point, not only are you making a fat salary, but the day you leave you just got a years salary ahead of time coming at you ready to go fuck all to go find the next thing? Meanwhile over here the rest of us are like \"here's my two weeks notice you want from me if I leave\" and if you don't want me, you just kick my ass out the door and fight me tooth and nail on unemployment that you pay for anyway by law?\"\n\nThis shit is so fucked up, even more so that it was a not-for-profit company.\n\nSo, seeing his simpleton contract, made me believe that for profit companies have probably way more involved and lucrative contracts in them to entice CEO's onboard.\n\nWhile I'm not saying as a CEO you'd wanna just jump from company to company working 1 day and taking your 1 years pay, because then nobody would hire you. But imagine just being at that level where, no matter how bad you do, and lets be honest, at this level there's no BAD you can do because all the blame rolls down hill at this point, you just get to collect your millions, get lauded as a hero, then some other startup or some shit wants to hire you, they throw another contract at you and the cycle starts again.\n\nYou come in, they say hey we will pay you this 300k a year base salary, here's a bunch of stock options, you can cash these out after 2 years and these out at 5 years, then the rest whenever you feel, along the way, if the stock goes up 2 points or whatever we give you X more shares and you can cash those out as you please... that shit adds up. Not to mention company bonus'. We all know those numbers can be fucked around anyway you see fit.\n\nAccounting can make a company seem profitable and a CEO look good or bad even when a company makes no actual profit at all. Just look at the banks during the 2008 crisis and they got all those Bailouts by the government and then they gave themselves all those bonus' like they did a good job. Like \"but but my contract said I get a bonus' this year!\"",

It's simply the platform that manages the VMs and data that is interesting to the FBI. So...getting the keys to vSphere is the path of least resistance to getting the data they actually care about. \n\nYou mentioned in another comment that VMware forced and update to users laptops just prior to the raid.
