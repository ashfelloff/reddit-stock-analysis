  "selftext": "**Jensen Huang**\n\n\" I'm going to work backwards. I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers -- $1 trillion dollars’ worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs.  \"\n\n( Perhaps the most significant comment in the entire cc )\n\nNot sure when the Ai rally resumes but i know the growth in ai has several years of expansion out in front of it.\n\nThis transition is similar to the move from fixed landline phones to cell phones ,from Cassette players to Cd's . from video rental to streaming ...\n\n  \nit's a transformative generational story that happens rarely and Nvidia is making it happen ",

There is just the concept of beta decay where in periods of high volatility, you will lose value even if the ticker it tracks is flat. It works both ways though; if the underlying ticker is going straight up, you have more then 3x gains, as seen in the price since inception",

Since the industry is moving so faster with computing power, it seems it is not very simple to just build a new PSU that meets 80 PLUS Titanium rating.\n\nThe hurdle with these companies is the long period of design time to switch from traditional silicon to GaN. Switching to GaN requires circuity re-engineering I believe for customers who want to adopt it. That is one reason why the design/dev time to adopt GaN is so long when switching from traditional silicon. That is why most of these companies that specialize in this are very long-term plays because it's going to take awhile.\n\n[Navitas Overcomes AI Challenges with World’s Highest Power Density Data Center Design | Navitas (navitassemi.com)](https://navitassemi.com/navitas-overcomes-ai-challenges-with-worlds-highest-power-density-data-center-design/)\n\nON is down is 14% past 6 months\n\nNVTS is down 51% past 6 months",

              "body": "My guess is a long time. Nvidia has had an incredibly consistent road map for their chips over the last decade plus - and if you look at a lot of their published research over the same time span it's clear they were \"preparing\" for the accelerated computing \"revolution\" for decades, ML has been their bread and butter forever. Trying to quickly build what Nvidia has spent decades researching and developing is probably impossible. CUDA isn't going away anytime soon. It has embedded itself into every single field that uses any GPU acceleration at all (which is basically all of them, from hard sciences/research fields to engineering to visual effects work/CGI, AI obviously and anything else in between).\n\nI'm just some dude, so don't take my word for it but if I had to guess AWS and Azure are going to be buying Nvidia products for a long time... Regardless of what they might say. Their ASICs will come, but when will they outperform? Google is maybe the most well positioned to provide the quickest competition to Nvidia as they've been building their TPU infra for a while now and tensorflow is relatively established - but there's still a lot of work to do even for them and they'll continue to buy Nvidia because at the end of the day they still need the highest available performance for the highest number of tasks. I can't speak to IBM or Oracle but I imagine it's much the same as Amazon and Microsoft. Apple seems like they're content using their own chips internally but I also don't know how much they want to expand their cloud computing services.\n\nCompetition will come, and to a degree it already exists - but Nvidia is going to be king for a while I think. We have to remember it's not about catching up to where Nvidia is now, it's catching up to where Nvidia is *going to be*. That's the tough part.",

Vacuum tubes were coming of age and it was just about possible to build computers using vacuum tubes.\n\nToday we're seeing something similar with microprocessors and AI. Microprocessors are coming of age, we're reaching the end of the line with miniaturizing and building massive systems that can just about function as a useful AI tool.\n\nNow the AI revolution is still in its early stages, but it's then likely that microprocessors will be ditched in favor of new technology. We know that AI can be implemented in a much more efficient way than we're doing it at present because Nature has been doing that for 750 million years, and if we mimic how Nature goes about this, we get far better results:\n\n[https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s42256-020-00237-3](https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s42256-020-00237-3)\n\n>We develop compact representations called neural circuit policies (NCPs), where each neuron has increased computational capabilities compared with contemporary deep models. We show that NCPs lead to sparse networks that are more easily interpretable and demonstrate this in the context of autonomous driving.\n\n>We discovered that for the lane-keeping task mentioned above, **very small networks of brain-inspired neural models (that is, networks with a control compartment consisting of only 19 neurons)**, in combination with compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs), **achieved superior performance, compared with state-of-the-art models, in learning how to steer a vehicle directly from high-dimensional inputs.** Here we use the representation-learning challenges as the main criteria for assessing the performance of autonomous-control agents.\n\n>**The network structure of NCPs is inspired by the wiring diagram of the C. elegans nematode.** Many neural circuits within the nematode’s nervous system are constructed by a distinct four-layer hierarchical network topology. They receive environmental observations through sensory neurons. These are passed on to inter-neurons and command neurons, which generate an output decision.\n\n>Finally, this decision is passed to the motor neurons to actuate its muscles. The wiring diagram of C. elegans achieves a sparsity of around 90% (ref. 6), with predominantly feedforward connections from sen sors to intermediate neurons, highly recurrent connections among inter-neurons and command neurons, and feedforward connections from command neurons to motor neurons.\n\n>This specific topology was shown to have attractive computational advantages, such as, efficient distributed control, requiring a small number of neurons6, hierarchical temporal dynamics, robot-learning capabilities and maximal information propagation in sparse-flow networks.",
