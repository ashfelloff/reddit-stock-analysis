I'm balls deep in RYCEY.\n\nIt's a big deal because it solves the problem of electricity transmission for electric semi trucks.\n\nYou literally can't make cables big enough to send the juice. Here, you can have the smr in remote locations off the main grid.",

The latter will eventually save you money, but it's a commitment of time, money and other risk most don't want to deal with.",
