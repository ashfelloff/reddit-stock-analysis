We have some cheaper ones like LLamma and Mixtral, which are about 30-70 Billion each but are not very capable of a lot of business solutions.

One example would be code generation - a small model that can provide extremely fast code suggestions based on local code context and a Mixtral8x7/Llama3 level of knowledge and performance would beat the pants off Copilot imo. We're not there quite yet, but in 2-3 years I think we will be seeing that stuff on high-end laptops.\n\nI personally don't think GPT-4 or any LLM is capable of performing true generalist tasks, and is not going to attain AGI, so any attempts to replace skilled employees with LLMs are doomed to fail. Augmentation is definitely going to happen, but again - local can probably handle ~80% of these use cases.",
