Some people will get mad, others will say it's market manipulation, so on, so forth...\n\nI think it comes more down to 2 things:\n\n1. The people who have large amounts of cash in the game\n\n2. human psychology\n\nI've definitely learned one big lesson from all of this and settling for going long: Be patient.\n\nNo matter how strong FOMO is, no matter how promising NVDA is, the big fish traders will do things, that seem strongly irrational, but make sense, if you look at the outcome for them, while everyone else is losing.\n\nBe patient, buy during corrections and deep dips, don't give into FOMO and sell when things look the most promising and everyone has their hopes up. \n\nBuffet was right, be greedy when people are fearful and fearful when people are greedy.\n\nI have strong confidence, that I will make my money back over time.
