You see, what you gotta avoid is exposing the cat to electricity (energy stocks) and then ending up with a Frankenstein cat market. Because then the market narratively splits into two separate crises; Frankenstein terrorizing retail traders and Dr.Frankenstein sitting on the sidelines pondering the right time to get in.\n\nI am highly regarded amongst my peers for using such valuable metaphors for our learnings.",

This isnt 80/90s where windows is competing for market share vs apple (although apple is at ~30% of business market share and growing each year)...OS sales are like 10% of Microsoft's business. \n\nMicrosoft's competitor is AWS, GCP, Oracle, etc... Azure/Cloud is about 40% of Microsoft's revenue....followed by its cloud based office suite at over 20%...\n\nSo yes, Microsoft does have plenty of competition....but that competition is not apple.",
