  "selftext": "Japan stocks rebounded sharply on Tuesday after the Nikkei 225 and the Topix dropped over 12% in the previous session. Other Asia-Pacific markets also opened higher.\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 — which saw its largest loss in the previous session since the 1987 Black Monday crash — and the broad-based Topix gained over 10%.\n\nThe yen weakened over 0.62% to trade at 145.07 against the U.S. dollar.\n\nJapan’s heavyweight trading houses all saw rebounds of over 8%, with Marubeni up over 13%. Softbank Group Corp jumped almost 10%.\n\nSouth Korea’s Kospi jumped above 4% while the small-cap Kosdaq was up over 6%. The rebound comes after South Korean markets were halted temporarily on Monday after circuit breakers activated.\n\nSouth Korean heavyweight Samsung Electronics rose 4.2%, while chipmaker SK Hynix climbed 5.5%.\n\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 opened up 0.16%.\n\nOil prices also rose with Brent crude climbing 1.65% to trade at $77.56 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude rose 1.86% to trade at $74.30.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/06/asia-stock-markets-japan-household-spending-rba-rate-decision.html",

You see, what you gotta avoid is exposing the cat to electricity (energy stocks) and then ending up with a Frankenstein cat market. Because then the market narratively splits into two separate crises; Frankenstein terrorizing retail traders and Dr.Frankenstein sitting on the sidelines pondering the right time to get in.\n\nI am highly regarded amongst my peers for using such valuable metaphors for our learnings.",

This isnt 80/90s where windows is competing for market share vs apple (although apple is at ~30% of business market share and growing each year)...OS sales are like 10% of Microsoft's business. \n\nMicrosoft's competitor is AWS, GCP, Oracle, etc... Azure/Cloud is about 40% of Microsoft's revenue....followed by its cloud based office suite at over 20%...\n\nSo yes, Microsoft does have plenty of competition....but that competition is not apple.",
