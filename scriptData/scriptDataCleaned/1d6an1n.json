Once that happens the dividend will be increased. \n\n206 million shares shorted, down from 220 million but still makes up 46% of the float. A short squeeze is a possibility.\n\nAssets are undervalued based on the recent sale and refinance transactions. Assets could be worth more than 20 billion. Current stock price like buying real estate at less than 50 cents on the dollar. \n\nThe core business is solid. This is a very profitable REIT that hit a rough patch during COVID. \n\nThe stock price has went from sub $3 to over $5 since January. However, it’s still very much oversold. Value based on book is over $12. \n\nIt’s time to buy. \n\nAny other similar turnaround stories out there? \n\n",

The REIT had borrowed $1.6 billion against that $1.8 billion facility at the end of the first quarter. However, that didn't include repayments after closing assets sales in April. It has since amended that facility and reduced its borrowing base to $1.4 billion. Continuing to pay down that facility would reduce its interest expenses and make it easier to extend its maturity and at better terms. That would give it even more breathing room to address future debt maturities...with its financial profile improving, the REIT has been able to refinance some of its debt at a very attractive term, which will give it more financial flexibility. While it has more work to do, its financial situation is improving with each step, reducing the risk that it will need to cut its dividend again.\"\n\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240523572008/en\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/ultra-high-yielding-dividend-stock-114800307.html",

      "body": "Lot of people wondering about the dividend. They just sold off assets and refinanced other hospitals in the Uk and their war chest of cash sits at 2.4 billion dollars..dividend and debts are not even a problem until 2026. That’s assuming they just didn’t make any money as well. \n\nTheir buisness will be normalizing here in the next year or so..interest rate cuts will help them. \n\nIt won’t go to all time highs as they had to sell off assets but a $10 stock is very very reasonable. That wouldn’t even be expensive valuation.\n\nBuisness mgmt has been really great taking a defensive approach and really made it happen.. \n\nNow steward..the govt just can’t have that ammount of hospitals close at the same time..just can’t..so they are actually stepping in to help fast track a transition. There is a non profit who said they wanted the hospitals already but their footprint is too big in Mass area..but ultimately I believe they will just give it to them to avoid crisis.\n\n\nThey had issue filing their 10k because of so many recent developement in the quarter so stock went from $6 to $5..all resolved so stock should venture back to $6+ ..especially is inflation keeps easing like it has. \n\nGood luck guys..it’s a great stock that had some crazy shit happen and once all is resolved they will be more diversified and resilient as they have ever been. \n\nNot sure how long it will take for them to go on offensive and buying properties but you’ll make money off the discount/recovery for now.\n\nRemeber in 2008 they made it through that with similar prices. So it’s happened before..hold strong. Hard to kill a company at owns 400+ hospitals",
