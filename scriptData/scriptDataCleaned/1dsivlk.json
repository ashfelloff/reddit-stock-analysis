  "selftext": "Draftkings is arguably approaching it‚Äôs most popular season of the year, Fantasy Football. With price targets averaged at $53.86 with a ‚ÄúStrong Buy‚Äù rating, currently, DKNG is UNDERVALUED BY 44%. On top of this, the RSI is sitting at 41, almost OVERSOLD, and the MacD is at -0.15. This typically shows downward momentum, but these also often indicate a strong reversal in stock direction is approaching. \n\nDraftkings also has great financials, reporting a 57% YOY revenue increase, according to the quarter ending March 31, with projected 31-36% YOY  growth in revenue for fiscal year 2024. \n\nDespite this, the short interest in DraftKings (DKNG) has risen by 26.69% since its last report, with 21.32 million shares sold short, which is 4.51% of all regular shares available for trading. And I know short interest is a shot in the dark, but it definitely means something in situations like this where a strong stock is already 50% undervalued and hasn‚Äôt even hit it‚Äôs most popular season yet. \n\nWith all of this considered, I believe DKNG is a STRONG investment, and specifically September (when NFL season begins) calls may be an absolute banger for most. \n\nI‚Äôm extremely bullish on DKNG and thought this would be good information to share with my fellow regards ü´°",
