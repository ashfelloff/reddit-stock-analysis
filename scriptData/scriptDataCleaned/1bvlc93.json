If you compare it to the other socials:\n\n-Pinterest makes 2.8B in yearly revenue\n\n-Snapchat makes 4.6B in yearly revenue\n\n-Meta makes 135B in yearly revenue\n\nThat's the real reason those companies are valued at multiple what Reddit is. Pinterest has half of Reddit's active userbase, but they're still able to churn out 4x the amount of money from them than Reddit is\n\nThe real issue keeping the stock low is that the admins and executives really, really suck at their jobs and have done a terrible job extracting value from their massive, addicted userbase. \n\nI will say, though, I don't anticipate that stays that way for long. Taking time to figure out how to properly monetize your gigantic userbase that will never leave no matter what is a good problem to have imo and is the reason why my Reddit position is so big rn. They've already figured out the hard part which is getting users to try the site and then stick around. Now they just need to properly extract value from that userbase.\n\nI would consider this valuation a great time to be a buyer for the long term. Once they start consistently growing revenue and monetizing better, we'll see the mother of all market corrections and the stock will be multiple times what it's trading at now. It's low key a blessing that the admin team and execs are regarded cause it let's us buy at would I would consider a steal of a valuation.

It is possible those are their genuine expectations though so it's something to keep an eye on. \n\nI'm with you though, I think it's a fantastic 5 year hold.

At one point I figured Google was just putting reddit near the top every time cause they know that's probably the link I'm looking for, which would make sense. But then a few months ago, to my surprise, I found my parents asking me how to make a Reddit account because every time they search something, they see results from reddit that answer their questions lol.  My parents are in the demographic that I assumed would be the very last one who would actually use reddit, if ever, so that was very interesting to me. They were like \"that's that website you're always using right? Explain to me how it works\" üòÇ \n\nI've been a daily Reddit user since 2011 and I literally never thought I'd ever hear that. My friends who used to ask me \"what's that\" whenever I mentioned Reddit are almost all regular users as well now. It's crazy how much the userbase has grown over the last few years. Genuinely mind-blowing\n\nI have a lot of friends in Egypt and Reddit is growing exponentially in popularity there as well. I would be genuinely shocked if Reddit hasn't grown revenue substaintially over the next couple years. To me, that would signal gross incompetence from management and would likely cause the board of directors to move on to different ones. I highly doubt we get to that point though. As much as I think Steve Huffman is an arrogant asshole, he seems to genuinely understand what makes Reddit so special as one of the founders and I imagine he considers this company his baby just like musk with tesla, zuck with fb, reed hastings with netflix, jeff bezos with amazon, daniel eck with spotify, tim cook/steve jobs with apple... etc. I'm always a huge fan of companies that keep one of their founders in charge as CEO. More often than not at least in the tech world, that is a recipe for success because they truly understand the value of their company.\n\nYou should comment on this post again regardless a year or 2 from now and give me a heads up. I'm not planning to sell my shares any time soon either so I'll want to pick this conversation back up with a year's worth of hindsight too haha. Matter of fact, if Reddit drops back down to IPO price or lower again, I'm planning to increase my already huge stack substaintially. I'm currently holding about 830 shares all at IPO price. Haven't sold any, just been selling covered calls on them to make back a lot of my initial buying cost",

      "body": "That's pretty much the same assessment I had.  I've got some diagonal put spreads on RDDT now since I expect this sinker to meander its way to the bottom of the bowl, but very slowly.  Probably not a hilarious drop like the usual meme stock garbage dumps, but it'll trickle it's way down.   A reasonable opportunity to buy long dated puts and sell shorter puts against them, since I don't expect any catastrophic drops except possibly on earnings reports maybe.\n\n  \nI expect this to be below IPO in a few months and probably not do much exciting after that.  We'll see I guess.",
