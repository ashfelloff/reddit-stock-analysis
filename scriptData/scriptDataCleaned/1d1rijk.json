                              "body": ">  Netlist has already asked for director review in the 912 case\n\nOK, looks like they asked about a week ago.  I was not aware of that update.  By the way, you will note that Netlist did not request that the Director recuse herself, indicating they don't care that she used to work for Micron. \n\n> Claim 16 of the '912 has been validated a couple of times by PTAB already and even been finally validated by the highest authority in the CAFC, which probably is the same way this will go once again. \n\nWhere are you seeing that any claim of the 912 has been validated by the PTAB or upheld by the CAFC?  There have only been two IPRs filed against the 912 (one by Samsung and one by Micron), and they were joined/consolidated in to this case where it's pending director review following Netlist's loss.  I also do not see anything in the 912's prosecution history indicating the PTAB ever weighed in on its patentability, or that the CAFC ever did either.\n\n> Its ridiculous that once one Company (Google) exhausted their appeals they just get another company (Samsung and Micron) to ask for another review. \n\nBro, that's how patent law has always worked.  If you sue someone, they get to challenge your patent, regardless of whether someone previously has challenged it.  \n\nAlso, unlike with district court, the PTAB itself has several safeguards to ensure that it doesn't keep adjudicating serial challenges to a patent, such as dismissing if the parties are RPIs (i.e. two parties working together, when one of them has been time-barred), or General Plastic (where serial petitions are dismissed if denial of the first petition is used as a roadmap for the second petition, especially if brought by RPIs), or Section 325(d) (where petitions are dismissed if they present the same or substantially similar prior art previously considered). \n\nAnd in fact, the issue as to whether Samsung or Micron were working with Google was extensively litigated, and the Board found that they were not.  Indeed, in a win for Netlist, the Director herself stated that the Board initially made a mistaken not conducting discovery and deciding the RPI issue, and so told the parties to collect the relevant evidence for the Board to make that determination.  (*Sue sponte*, no less, for those who understand how rare that is... on top of the rarity that the Director even grants review.)  \n\n> Which is the only reason the PTAB exists in the first place, since its just been created by Googles bidding in 2012.\n\nlmao, Google has lost plenty of times before the PTAB.  I myself have won plenty of times representing patent owners (which is about half of the IPR cases I've worked on).  Maybe Netlist should've hired better lawyers or gotten better patents.",

Your continued insistence that there was some kind of corruption because two unrelated different parties brought two different challenges against the same patent just reeks of ignorance.",

          "body": "Think big picture here. It's important for the overall context of what's happening. There's excellent background and discussion on [](/r/NLST/) on these court cases and the memory space. My own opinion and belief is that there is tremendous opportunity for Micron and Netlist to come to an agreement that benefits both parties, and the potential for both parties is substantial and a win-win for both.\n\nIn my opinion, the next significant milestone can be a settlement agreement between Netlist and Micron for a variety of reasons as it makes perfect sense from a business operational and strategic perspective for both companies. \n\nAs many know, the memory industry is highly concentrated with a small number of players that all know each other. They attend the same industry conferences and participate on the same standards boards. In particular, this level of intimacy is a dynamic that factors into play. Without going into all the decade plus history and litigation (which by the way is covered in a most excellent and truly outstanding manner on the Reddit [](/r/NLST/) and Stocktwits forums), Netlist clearly has established itself as a leader and innovator in memory space that has had a transformational (you might even say seminal) impact on products used around the globe by everyone who uses internet servers and other devices with memory products, and while this may not have been recognized at the onset, this recognition is gradually and methodically now coming into focus. If one steps back away from all the litigation details, you see the strategy game that’s being played out over a number of years. \n\nThe first major milestone was the settlement agreement between SK Hynix and Netlist following claim construction. Now, ask yourself what motivated both parties to come to an agreement and what did each take away from that agreement? Well, from SK Hynix’s perspective, following claim construction, they knew in all likelihood they were going to lose the case and felt it in their best interest to settle upfront and avoid the longer-term litigation path and associated costs. They also got full access to Netlist’s patent portfolio via the cross-licensing agreement and the prospect of early collaboration on future technologies. In short, with all the litigation behind them, they were clear to focus on the future and do what they do best, deliver high performance and innovative memory products. And, as the first to settle, they got an ‘early buyer discount’ on licensing. From Netlists perspective, the got a much-needed infusion of cash, much more favorable financing agreements, the ability to payoff existing debt, a supply agreement for products which allows them to increase their revenue streams, and most importantly, they got recognition from a top tier industry player on the value and validity of their patent portfolio. In short, they achieved a significant financial and strategic milestone that allowed them to move forward toward the next step of the process. \n\nNow, here’s where things get really interesting. The character of the players is key to understanding not only the past, but the future evolution and events. The relationship between Netlist and SK Hynix was conducive to a settlement. Contrast the Netlist-SK Hynix relationship with the Netlist-Google or Netlist-Samsung relationships. Night and day is probably a huge understatement. When one considers the alleged collusion, theft, and attempts to drive Netlist out of existence on the part of Google and Samsung, that’s on an entirely different sphere, may be even a different universe. So, expecting a Netlist-Samsung or Google Settlement to be the next milestone would not be first on the list. Samsung breached the contract they had with Netlist and their CEO is a convicted felon that was sent to jail) – not exactly the pillar of ethics. Google for their part has played out their efficient infringement strategy going back to 2009 leveraging and some might say abusing the legal system to delay until Netlist could no longer continue the fight. Well, the settlement agreement with SK Hynix threw a wrench into that plan. \n\nNow as far as the Netlist-Micron relationship is concerned, it’s more like the SK Hynix relationship and one focused on what it should be, namely, the operational business of creating, developing and delivering innovative memory products to customers. Another interesting similarity is that both SK Hynix and Micron’s core business is focused on Memory devices, so that is of paramount importance to them, unlike with Google and Samsung, where memory is not first and foremost. Micron also has a history of arriving at settlement agreements as evidenced in their most recent 10Q (see below detailed references). More specifically, in regards to Netlist, in some of the court documents, Micron has indicated a willingness to pay Netlist a royalty, but they need to agree on terms. So, with Micron you have a firm that is operationally focused, has a history of arriving at settlement agreements, one that does not carry the emotional baggage and conflict like with Google and Samsung, and one that like with the SK Hynix case, has just received an unfavorable claim construction ruling which will likely result in losing the court case. And, Micron did just lose in the ED Texas Judge Gilstrap district court. So, its is a good time for Micron to settle and at a time that is conducive for both parties. SK Hynix got an ‘early buyer discount’ and next in line is likely to get favorable terms, not as good as with the SK Hynix terms, but not as bad as waiting until the bitter end. One does not want to be playing a game of musical chairs and find out when the music stops, they don’t have a chair while the other participants are sitting comfortably. From Netlist perspective, Chuck Hong has shown a willingness to settle if it satisfies a strategic objective, so a settlement agreement with Micron is a natural and logical next step in the ongoing process of achieving full industry recognition. And, depending on the specifics of the agreement, a settlement with Micron would likely give Netlist a complete lock on having whatever resources needed to take Google and Samsung to the final destination of this journey. ",

Look at NVIDIA V 3DFX from the early 1990's. \n\nThat  said there are Patent Trolls and incredibly obvious patents that should have never been granted. In the latter case Micron lawyers can find prior art that was not referenced in granted patent nullifying it. \n\nSo the LIKELY outcome is this drags on a while and then Micro licenses the patent for a princely sum in perpetuity.  Or like NVIDIA - buys 3DFX  and drops the suit against itself.",
