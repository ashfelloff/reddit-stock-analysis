  "title": "Detail analysis: What if you had just bought the highest market cap stocks",
  "score": 196,
  "selftext": "I was inspired by this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f5l4c6/update_what_if_you_had_just_bought_the_highest/) to take a closer look at various scenarios. My analysis assumes the stocks are bought once a month - at the beginning of every month. It can extended to rebalance everyday but not everyone can do that.\n\nInitial investment: $1,000\n\nMonthly investment: $100\n\n**Strategies**\n\n* Buy and hold: buy the top N market cap stocks of a given month. Do not sell the stock if it's not in the top N list in the following months.\n* Rebalance: If an existing stock in the portfolio is not in the top\\_n stocks list in the current month then  check when was the last month it was part of the top\\_n market cap stocks. If the resulting month difference is greater or equal to `rebalance_threshold_months` then sell the stock and tax the gains. The sale proceeds (minus short term taxes) are added to the monthly investment budget equally among the current top\\_n stocks. If there was a loss then I simply use the total sale proceeds. Eg, Assume AMZN was top 3 stocks last month but not this month.  If the threshold months is 1 then we sell AMZN this month, tax the gains, and distribute the sale proceeds equally to buy this months top 3 stocks.\n\nBacktesting. Start: 2018-1, ~~End: 2024-1.~~ Edit: End 2024-8.\n\n|Strategy|Rebalance threshold months|Top 5|Top 3|Top 1|SPY|QQQ|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy and hold|N/A|$20,793|$21,967|$17,530|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|3|$19,791|$22,383|$13,625|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|2|$19,802|$22,108|$14,141|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|1|$19,582|$22,206|$13,982|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|3|$20,229|$23,050|$15,555|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|2|$20,181|$22,738|$16,138|$15,266|$17,989|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|1|$19,847|$22,825|$16,142|$15,266|$17,989|\n\nRegardless of the strategy buying top 3 market cap stocks seems most optimal. Buy and hold handily beats SPY and QQQ. And if you have the itch to rebalance then rebalancing on the 3rd month seems most optimal. But note that past performance is not indicative of future performance.\n\nBack testing longer term. Start: 2010-1, End: 2024-8\n\n|Strategy|Rebalance threshold months|Top 5|Top 3|Top 1|SPY|QQQ|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|Buy and hold|N/A|$107,205|$122,673|$75,026|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|3|$127,848|$146,441|$42,948|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|2|$123,116|$145,579|$44,803|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance. Short terms capital gain tax 24%|1|$127,423|$143,843|$51,132|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|3|$129,959|$150,096|$56,915|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|2|$124,976|$148,884|$60,258|$58,958|$90,923|\n|Rebalance on tax advantage account|1|$129,178|$147,589|$72,899|$58,958|$90,923|\n\nLong term, buying top 3 market cap stocks seems most optimal, regardless of the strategy. Buying and holding handily beats SPY and QQQ. If rebalancing then rebalancing on the 3rd month seems most optimal (maybe 4th or 5th month is even better but I didn't check it).\n\n**Disclaimers**\n\nTHIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.

          "body": "I see the logic.  Usually the highest cap stock stays there for a long while before being overtaken, and grows significantly.  Generally, you should sell and rebalance when there is a break-even point between a new front runner and the current stock. So it should, hypothetically, be neutral in terms of selling one stock to buy another to ride the second stock's wave up.  I can see why this outperforms the SNP 500, as you are only chasing the currently winning stocks without being bogged down by lower performers.\n\n\nThe two fundamental issues I see with this strategy are:\n\n\n1.  Taxes neutering gains.\n\n\n2.  Unless you watch like a hawk, you aren't going to be 100% efficient meaning you aren't maximizing the benefits of it.  Out of town for a week when one stock overtakes another, and you basically are going to miss some percent of the gains.",

If it didn't work, neither would this analysis.  I see no reason why this wouldn't work regardless of period, as most companies don't grow at a pace better than the SNP 500 or broader market. In fact, they mathematically *can't*, because of most companies beat the average, then the average would just increase.\n\n\nConsider it logically.  If a top company isn't outcompeting the broader market on growth, then it will inevitably be overtaken.  If it maintains it's spot in the top 3, then it *has* to be growing, and more importantly it has to be growing faster compared to other companies.  If it weren't, it will no longer be the top spot eventually.\n\n\nAnd at that point, you would switch out of it to whatever replaced it.  \n\n\nSo, basically, this analysis proves that the top 3 stocks beats the average growth of the next 497.  That's really about it, and it makes mathematical and logical sense.  Growth isn't going to be evenly distributed, and in order to maintain the \"top spots\", a company *has* to grow faster than the index. If it didn't, then some other company will inevitably take them over in a run up, and it's doubtful they just barely get there and stop.  You miss the run up, yes, but you will still beat the average market as the only way a company can get to that point is by beating the market.",
