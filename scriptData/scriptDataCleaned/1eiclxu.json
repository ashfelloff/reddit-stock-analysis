When I open an option trade I try to size my position to no more than 20% of the trading amt - so $6k. Then I try and limit downsides on an option trade to 15-20% - which in that case would be $1.2k - which is .002 of my total portfolio. \n\nBecause options are so volatile you need to be able to absorb some losses - like a 5% stop loss could hit near instantly if you bought at a high mark, so you need some breathing room.\n\n  \nHowever, for this position, I YOLO'd and went full option trading port into and it worked out.\n\n  \nIt's just luck and I'm not risk-averse.\n\n  \nHalf the entire portfolio is probably from option trading proceed.",

Best to understand where levels of local resistance are in the uptrend. \n\nIf Iâ€™m doing a day trade with a lot of leverage thatâ€™s a huge % of my portfolio, like I did today, I never hold those overnight.
