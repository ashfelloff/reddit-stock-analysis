              "body": "Yeah, I have seen a lot of Motley Fool articles about how AMD is a great buy compared to Nvidia. To me, that's a good indicator that calls on NVDA coupled with puts on AMD is a good bet. AMD doesn't have EBITDA or revenue growth that compare to NVDA, they don't have the ability to compile pseudo-CUDA code, they don't have the extensive proprietary optimization libraries, their current GPUs have barely caught up regarding some specs and if Blackwell gets off the ground they will be left behind. They have always been number 2 and spent too long focusing on beating Intel on CPUs, which were state-of-the-art technology in the early nineties, but now a component that talks to GPUs. AMD has the same TSM supply constraints as NVDA, with less pull. They have consistently lagged NVDA in price appreciation. Finally, their PE is really, really high, and they have to sustain growth for much longer before they get a PE in the range of 20 before diminishing returns or reduced demand curb growth and they have to offer a dividend and aggressive buybacks to keep investors interested. I'm not knocking Lisa Su, because she's brilliant, but she doesn't have the resources to threaten Nvidia, which can always curb its huge margins if it faces competition for high-end chips.  \n\nI think people get trapped in the fallacy that the number 2 stock in an industry that didn't go up as much recently is somehow a better buy and this is rarely true without much better growth or earnings per share in the here-and-now. Back in the day, people adopted this fallacy and bought search engines stocks that weren't google, or smartphone stocks that weren't apple. Motley Fool was pumping companies like RIM, Nokia, HTC, LG and Motorola in don't buy apple clickbait in the early 2000s.\n\nI think the big winner in Intel's implosion is QCOM. I opened my first position in the week of the carry-trade collapse. It has a reasonable PE and dividend right now and QCOM is also one of the four companies that has serious pull with TSM for advanced chips. However, this position is small compared to my NVDA and TSM positions and is based on the chance that QCOM can advance snapdragon LLM-oriented GPUs, especially for edge devices, but maybe cloud later, before Apple succeeds in dropping them, which they have been unsuccessfully trying to do for a long time. In the meantime, there is a dividend, which will probably go up in the next five years. \n\nA great company can have a terrible valuation relative to its competitors, and that describes AMD. I'll even buy a small stake in Intel if it falls further below its book value because I know that corporate raiders are brainstorming what they can do with its parts right now.",

Some people are already starting to head towards the exits to leave before the crowds do (a fair amount of large hedge funds selling NVDA mostly or entirely in the latest round of 13fs; looking at Tepper's 13f for example, sold nearly all of his NVDA and a decent chunk of AMD, QCOM, MSFT and META, among other things; Druckenmiller sold most of what was left of his famed NVDA stake, sold a lot of his MSFT, ANET and AAPL stakes and it generally seemed like a lot of funds trimmed tech.)\n\nAMD is not NVDA (and nothing against AMD, but imo I look at recent earnings and they're fine; it's not \"holy shit look at the numbers AMD is doing\") and the AI theme is past the hype phase where a stock could be up 5% on the mere mention of AI. Now, quarters have to be genuinely good. **And when I say that imo the AI theme is in late innings, it's not against AI necessarily, but if a material payoff after an astronomical amount of spending is a few years away and the stocks and hype are acting like it's much sooner, eventually (and it takes longer than people think, but eventually) that becomes problematic - and a lot of AI names are still well off recent highs.**\n\nIs it undervalued?\n\nI don't think it's undervalued. I don't think it should have been $200+ and back here it's probably closer to fair but not cheap.

              "body": "Of course! Many investors look at the free cash flow of a comapny. The amount of cash generated is not equal to the profit of a company. For example a company writing off an amount that they had invested in a building will have that amount deducted from their profits due to the depreciation. But depreciation isn't a cash out flow. But free cash flow alone isn't enough. Would you rather own a company that generates 100$ free cash flow or a company that generates 500$ free cash flow. With this information you'll of course say the company of 500$. But what if the company that generates 100$ of free cash flow costs you 200$ to buy while the company that generates 500$ free cash flow costs you 5000$ to buy. That's why we look at the price to free cash flow of a company. Let's look at examples.\n\nFor example I bought Microsoft in January this year. It was trading at 30 times the free cash flow. (The free cash flow is the first thing I look at within a company). The overall rule is that you want to make 10% of your investment annually. So you would like to see a company at 10 times the price to free cash flow. Now finding a great company, that is growing, that is priced at 10 times free cash flow is hard. You will not find many. So it's good to understand what is the median price to free cash flow of the company you are interested in. I like to use the site gurufocus. If you type in google price to free cash flow Microsoft gurufocus. You will have an overview of the price to free cash flow of Microsoft and how it compares to the industry. You will see that the current price to free cash flow is 42. The median is 27. And the price to free cash flow of Microsoft is ranked worse than 74% of all Software companies. Now this may seem bad. But how many software companies have the resources, the diversification of income and the name Microsoft has. So always keep that in mind. Secondly we see the Median price at 27. It is now 42. It seems the price should go down by half. But if we scroll down a bit within the site until we see the first 'Microsoft annual data' we see that the price to free cash flow was 35 in 2020, 37 in 2021, 30 in 2022 (this was during a stock market drop) and 45 in 2023. What does this tell us? It tells us Microsoft will most likely not see a 20 times price to free cash flow unless something really bad happens within the company. It's more likely to hang around 35 to 40. But this is IF, Microsoft keeps going and innovating as it does.\n\nNow what am I trying to say with this story here? Some investors will tell you Microsoft is a buy and hold type of stock. And I would agree with them. I'm comfortable holding Microsoft. Even at a bit elevated prices. BUT. I still sold Microsoft in June. As it was hitting the 40 times price to free cash flow. You have to ask yourself. How much growth do we see in Microsoft from here. Because if there is not much room for the multiple to grow. All the stock growth will come from increased amount of free cash flow Microsoft is able to generate.\n\nIf we take DHL for example. They have a median price to free cash flow of 17. They are currently trading at a price to free cash flow of 7. Now we have to ask ourselves why is this. So the second thing I look at within a company, is how much net debt are they holding. So I look at their total debt and their total cash on hand. If the company can pay off their debt within a reasonable amount of years based on the amount of cash flow they generate annually I'm happy. Then I look at if they are buying back their own stock (this is not a must, just a huge plus in my eyes). A company that buys back their own stock is great because the stock price goes up. But it's also great because these stocks will not be publicly traded anymore. They're just held by the company and that will most likely stay like that if you are investing in strong companies. Meaning stocks are more scarce and also meaning they generate more cash flow per share as the amount of shares have decreased. So back to the example of DHL. DHL is currently trading at 7 times price to free cash flow while the median is 17. Now this seems like the deal of your life. But it doesn't always have to be the case. Usually there is a reason for it. And the reasons are Germany being in a recession and lowered revenue guidance by DHL. Now let's say DHL doesn't grow 10% like previous years but they grow 5%. You can expect a stock growth percentage of 5%. But lets say the fears of lower revenue for DHL start to dwindle. And the price to free cash flow goes back to 14 from 7 for DHL. This is an increase of 100%. Your stock is now up an extra 100% just because market sentiment has shifted. I like to keep a safety margin within the price to free cash flow of companies that I understand. So for Microsoft I bought at 30 price to free cash flow. And I found 40 price to free cash flow too expensive. So I sold. I like DHL as a company and see them gaining in stock price. But I won't hold indefinitely. They have about a price to free cash flow of 12 in the past four years. So I will look to sell if DHL hits a price to free cash flow of 10.",
