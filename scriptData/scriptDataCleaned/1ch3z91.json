So if you're looking at sort of the near term, the near term, I would say for example in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply.

Yet they had a significant run-up when they announced MI300 and projected these majestic sales numbers.\n\nAtleast INTC are pretty realistic with their 500 m$ sales projection for Gaudi3 in 2024. And their stock has been beaten to death.\n\nAMD has a long way to go before it bottoms out.",
