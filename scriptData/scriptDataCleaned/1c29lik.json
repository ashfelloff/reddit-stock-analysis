Otherwise it will cause unnecessary suffering and job loss.\n\nPlus Fed has made the \"Ample Reserves\" policy framework the official stance of the Fed since 2019 anyway.  The idea being to prevent crises *before they happen*.  Like SVB last March.  This way Fed is lender of first resort rather than last resort.\n\nHere are some good interview quotes:\n\n>Yahoo Finance. You said back in July that you needed to start cutting rates before getting to 2 percent inflation. As you mentioned, PCE inflation is now running at 3½ on core. On a six- month annual basis, core PCE is running at 2½ percent, though when you look at supercore and shelter, they are, of course, stickier. So when looking in the different components of the data, how much closer do you have to get to 2 percent before you consider cutting rates?\n\n>CHAIR POWELL. I mean, the reason you wouldn’t wait to get to 2 percent to cut rates is that policy would be, it would be too late. I mean, you’d want to be reducing restriction on the economy well before 2 percent because—or before you get to 2 percent so you don’t overshoot, if we think, think of restrictive policy as weighing on economic activity. You know, it takes—it takes a while for policy to get into the economy, affect economic activity, and affect inflation\n\nWaller said rising real rates is enough of reason:\n\n>If inflation continues to cool “for several more months — I don’t know how long that might be — three months, four months, five months — that we feel confident that inflation is really down and on its way, you could then start lowering the policy rate just because inflation is lower,” Waller said in remarks at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. “It has nothing to do with trying to save the economy or recession.”\n\nRecent interview from 60 minutes:\n\n>Pelley: Why is your target [interest] rate 2%?\n\n>Powell: Why isn't it zero, I guess, is the question. And the reason is 2% is interest rates always include an estimate of future inflation. If that estimate is 2%, that means you'll have 2% more that you can cut in interest rates. The central bank will have more ammunition, more power to fight a downturn if rates are a little bit higher.\n\n>Pelley: Are you committed to getting all the way to 2.0 before you cut the rates?\n\n>Powell: No, no. That's not what we say at all, no. We're committed to returning inflation to 2% over time. I've said that we wouldn't wait to get to 2% to cut rates.",

Here's some more that I think is great and helps understand Fed's current thinking:\n\nSenior economist Scott Fulford at the CFPB:\n\n>The Federal Reserve's new policies for inclusive growth meant it did not want to slow a broad recovery too soon. As Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told a congressional committee in June 2021, \"Those who have historically been left behind stand the best chance of prospering in a strong economy with plentiful job opportunities. And our economy will be stronger and perform better when everyone can contribute to and share in, the benefits of prosperity.\" **One of the reasons most Americans had not shared in the economic growth over the previous 40 years is that the Federal Reserve had tended to raise interest rates just as wages started to rise to fight inflation.**\n\n* Powell, a lifelong Republican, also said to Congress:\n\n>“There’s a growing realization, **really across the political spectrum,** that we need to achieve more inclusive prosperity. These things hold us back as an economy and as a country.”\n\n>Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell says two major long-term issues facing the U.S. economy are sluggish productivity growth and low participation rates in the job market by prime-age workers.\n\n* Powell on anemic job participation that needs to go up.\n\n>Powell says that the United States currently lags most major industrial countries in the percentage of workers in prime working ages who are in the labor force. He says one hopeful sign is that this participation rate is finally beginning to move higher, but more needs to be done.\n\n>**“We lag just about every wealthy country in the world in labor force participation** and that is not where we should be,” Powell said Wednesday in testimony before the congressional Joint Economic Committee.\n\nSo if you look at unemployment it looks like full employment.  But labor participation tells a different story:\n\nhttps://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.png?g=1k20r\n\nThere's probably not enough people working still.",

No. The problem is that the hype assumes that the entire economy and all sectors will benefit from AI. That won't happen. AGI is years or maybe a decade away.

I believed it was coming to, but after seeing SVB and First Republic not trigger a long-term panic, I was convinced. Each sector got hit so hard, and each was offset so that even though people in those industries paid the price, everyone else was safe. Also gave a place to run to for those unable to find opportunities in their previous industry. When you have these kinds of microrecessions, it keeps the economy afloat. It's the \"soft\" part of the \"soft landing\". One sector drops as another sector recovers, the overall drop is negligible or non-existent. Unfortunately though, pulling off a \"soft landing\" after the Feds were  so late will still play to the bears favor. It means rate cuts won't come as soon as people had hoped. It means CPI will continue to be warm instead of cooling. It means the plane stays afloat just a bit longer.",
