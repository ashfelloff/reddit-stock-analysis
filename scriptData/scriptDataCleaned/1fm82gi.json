  "selftext": "I believe $TLT is a great investment for the next 3-5+ years. With the current macroeconomic environment, there is a lot of potential here for capital gains. This claim is based on the recent lowering of interest rates. \n\nI have ALWAYS been bullish on the U.S stock market. Despite that, I have a feeling there will soon be a lot of market turmoil. There is a lot on the table right now regarding the economy and management of foreign policy. Much will need to be decided after the upcoming election.\n\nThe data I have gathered from FRED will be charted from 2004 to 2024. The previous years numbers are averaged on a monthly basis to total an annual figure for that year.\n\n[Federal Funds Effective Rate Over 20 Years \\(FRED\\)](https://preview.redd.it/u44j1c16nvpd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=82feb1c54600205dabbda76813d94d3327e88e21)\n\n[S&P 500 20 Year Performance](https://preview.redd.it/07hd20n1a0qd1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1c6b3b877c5a9cf13d7a28b5afd0905ab8def68)\n\nAs you can see, each time the FFR has been raised within the span of a few years, once rate cuts start, the market plumets. On June 30th, 2004, the FFR was raised from 1.0% to 1.25%. Following this, there was 16 more rate hikes between 2004-2006 resulting in a final rate of 5.25%. On September 18th, 2007, rate cuts started. The initial was -50 bps. Sound familiar? After 9 more sequential rate cuts between 2007-2009, the FFR was .16% for the beginning of 2009.\n\nFrom the timeframe of rate increases and decreases in 2004-2009, the market was a catastrophe. The same can be seen in the years 2015-2021. On December 17th, 2015, rate hikes started from .25% to 2.16% ending December 20th, 2018. The following year starting in August, rates were once again steadily cut until March 16th, 2021, with an ending rate of nearly zero. From 2021-2024 we have seen rates rise to 5.33% and just yesterday were cut 50 bps. \n\nTLT 52-week Low/High price during the years mentioned: \n\n2004 - $83.10 - $89.55\n\n2005 - $89.33 - $96.70\n\n2006 - $84.16 - $91.53\n\n2007 - $85.17 - $94.99\n\n2008 - $90.28 - $119.35\n\n2009 - $89.89 - $105.71\n\nThis data represents a 27.20% gain over 5 years. Now for 2015-2020.\n\n2015 - $117.46 - $130.69\n\n2016 - $119.13 - $141.56\n\n2017 - $120.17 - $127.99\n\n2018 - $113.58 - $121.97\n\n2019 - $120.02 - $147.28\n\n2020 - $152 - $171\n\nThis data represents a 45.58% gain over 5 years. Now lastly, for 2021-2024.\n\n2021 - $135.45 - $151.59\n\n2022 - $96.11 - $139.87\n\n2023 - $83.58 - $106.46\n\n2024 - $88.82 - $99.01 \n\nWe can see a 36.80% loss over 5 years.\n\nFor these specific periods, the data concludes a lot of price volatility for TLT seeing swings of +27.20%, +45.58% and -36.80%. Price is highest during rate cut years.\n\nBased on this historical data, there seems to be a pattern within 5 years of rate hikes followed by cuts. Rates raise in the first 2-3 years a substantial amount followed by a substantial decrease in rates the following 2-3 years. The FED has announced the prospect of future cuts in the next 2 years with a target rate of 2.9%. This seems like it is following the trend.\n\n[Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 20-Year Constant Maturity \\(FRED\\)](https://preview.redd.it/f0h2uj35uvpd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=e95cf38c7e19862e836f3befcb7f4606ca5435ed)\n\nThe market yield chart above displays that anything 4.5% and under correlates with an attractive price for TLT compared to what it currently trades at.\n\n[iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF \\(TLT\\) Yearly 52-Week High \\(FRED\\)](https://preview.redd.it/vkwk83fbuvpd1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e360922242e1b728a37b0bb24fc82bf46ecbeae)\n\nIt goes without saying that when rates lower, bond prices raise. I have picked this ETF due to the price sensitivity long term bonds experience from rate fluctuations. The fund also has a yield of 3.72% but I am not concerned with that.\n\nTo sum up, TLT currently sits at $98.89. If rates can get to the target 2.9%, I expect further upside of a minimum +15.28% resulting in a price of $114. As I mentioned, I believe a lot will unfold in a matter of time and therefore, see the bond market as an excellent play. \n\nNOT INVESTMENT ADVICE. I actually saw some DD on here that contradicts my conclusion. Do what you will. Would love to hear some other opinions. ",

The carry trade could take a decade to unwind. \n\nI agree there’s debt issues with america but that is already priced in. I’ve been in libertarian circles for a long time, they have been screaming about the debt my entire life, it shouldn’t be new news. Ron paul even explained the concept of blowback for expensive wars during presidential debates. There’s no excuse. \n\nAdditionally, bonds have been undervalued for so long because of the opportunity cost of missing the stock market bubble. A reasonable 3% return with inflation is not very sexy when stocks go up 15% a year. When stocks have a decade long bear market, bonds will be priced accurately. \n\nThis misallocation of money into stocks is not only irrational, but also is unsustainable with the wealth consolidation into a few rich families. Middle class consoomers have no money left to consume.\n\nThe same arguments against bonds also apply to stocks, the american empire has collapsed, turkey is leaving NATO to join BRICS. Not only would a debt crisis hurt S&P profits but the dollar will become a headwind. Sanctions will only increase from here on western corporations. I think any kind of war escalation in lebanon will result in 40-80% S&P drop over the next decade. \n\nWhy buy TLT despite all this? You just have to time it and rotate into gold at the point depression deflation flips to inflation like WW2 Germany. it’s coming, just be prepared. Blackrock and others have most of their money allocated to foreign countries already. The middle class in america has been strip mined down to nothing by blackrock, they also are buying up entry level housing so we go back to feudalism. ",

Either you really believe the economy is going to boom with lower rates (which is what the stock market seems to imply) which you’d think would make long rates go up to compensate for the opportunity cost or you think we stagnate/shrink even with lower rates. In that case if the government continues to issue debt without offsetting tax revenue you’d have to expect some currency devaluation as bond issuances continue in which case I can’t see people lending money to the government for 20 years for a 4% return. I think a massive steepening of the yield curve is a real possibility where the fed manipulates the short end while the long end sinks. But the most likely scenario is that it just settles at a slightly higher rate.\n\nTL;DR I think there’s a possibility that the Ron Paul/peter Schiff stances of 10 years ago do finally start to present themselves.

Interest payments are already 13% of the budget -- 3rd largest category behind social security and medicare.
