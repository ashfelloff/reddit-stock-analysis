  "selftext": "Starbucks announced Tuesday it’s replacing CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol.\n\nShares of Starbucks rose 10% in premarket trading on the news, while Chipotle’s stock fell 10%.\n\nNarasimhan took over as chief executive in March 2023. The coffee giant’s performance has struggled this year, hurt by weak sales in the U.S. and China, its two largest markets. Former CEO Howard Schultz, who handpicked Narasimhan as his successor, had written an open letter in May, weighing in on the company’s issues and offering advice but never addressing Narasimhan by name. Activist investor Elliott Management had acquired a stake in the company in recent weeks.\n\nStarbucks’ shares have fallen 21% during Narasimhan’s tenure, excluding Tuesday’s move.\n\nNarasimhan’s departure is effective immediately. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri will step in as interim chief executive until Sept. 9, when Niccol officially takes over the top job.\n\nNiccol has served as Chipotle’s CEO since 2018. Prior to that, he led Yum Brands’ Taco Bell. As CEO of Chipotle, he helped the chain rebound from its foodborne illness scandal and led its restaurants through the pandemic. In recent quarters, while other restaurants have reported a sharp pullback in consumer spending, Chipotle has seen its traffic and sales climb, bucking the trend.\n\nChipotle’s COO Scott Boatwright will serve as interim CEO of the burrito chain. Chipotle CFO Jack Hartung, who was planning on retiring next year, will now stay on as president of strategy, finance and supply chain.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/13/starbucks-replaces-ceo-laxman-narasimhan-with-chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol.html",

Then they pick a CEO whose company from my perspective doesn’t seem to be that focused on experience.  Seems like this pick could be a rejection of his pleas.",

However, what I see at Chipotle seems uniquely pathetic. They are constantly out of tons of ingredients before, during, and at the end of peak times. They can't manage to keep coca cola on constant supply in the fountain, even though there are two hookups for it and it is the staple fountain soda.\n\nChipotle admittedly has its own complexities when it comes to food preparation. The fountain soda, though really not a big deal, is what stands out to me as a clear indicator of how poorly things are run. This gets fucked up less often at Burger Kings and McDonalds locations with less than 2 stars.
