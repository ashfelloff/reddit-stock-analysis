Many western countries, especially the US, are basically paying for a huge chunk of their capex.\n\nConsidering they cut their dividend and stopped buybacks, laid off a ton of employees, and are receiving a ton of government money, I'd be very shocked if Intel goes bankrupt.\n\nWith that said, calls are a moronic way to capitalize on this. The ROI on these new fabs will take several years.\n\nPretty much the only reason to buy calls is to speculate on Intel being acquired.
