I tried a valuation: Looking at the historical PE they had about 30 PE in 2021, when they were about to grow their eps 33% in 12 months. Now estimates say they will grow their EPS by 29 % in the next 12 months and they have a PE of 28. To me this means they have their average valuation considering the PE and estimated growth. Of course one would normally look at the next years instead of just one year, but who really knows whats definitely going to happen in one year. And that also seems to be the opinion of Mr. Market.",
