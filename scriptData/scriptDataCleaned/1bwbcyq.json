Rate cuts always see a capitulation move down. ALWAYS have. I know most of you think yesterday’s hawkishness was bearish.. it’s bullish.\n2. If we can sustain no rate cuts into QRA in October and Yellen does say a 80/20 — bills/notes ratio we are going to the fucking moon. Similarly to what happened through covid.\n3. Buckle the fuck up and BTFD at key levels. If we get a surprise rate cut load those puts you regards.\n4. Not many of you made it this far in the Ted Talk but if you did fuck you, & may the market gods be in your favor.",
