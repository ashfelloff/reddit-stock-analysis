Dollar stores are pigs. Walmart does everything better than they do, and even delivers. \n\nI sold first thing in the morning. $7.50/each while I was on the toilet at work. \n\nWas tempted to hold, but $72000 is big money for me. Especially from an initial risk of around $3000. \n\nHad I waited, could have been $120k or even $160k by EOD. Or, it could have only been worth $10k. \n\nI'm starting a position in $DLTR $65 puts for next Friday for an ER play, will increase it next week if the price is better. \n\nDollar stores are pigs.

              "body": "That's the thing. It is down 10% so an argument could be made that bad earnings could very well be priced in already. \n\nNot only that, but in my experience, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores are far less overextended than DG stores, better stocked, and better staffed as well. \n\nFurthermore, the puts are pretty pricey. Options writers are likely already pricing in the risk of bad ER due to DG. \n\nI am extremely bearish on dollar stores as a whole, for the same reasons I am extremely bullish on WMT. WMT is going to kill them. \n\nDollar Tree/Family Dollar stores are FAR better run than DG stores. Problem is, doesn't mean that DLTR can compete with WMT. \n\nThat said, looking at the options chain, it is intriguing to me that the lowest strike you can buy is the 65 puts. Incidentally, look at where the 2018 and 2020 lows are. \n\nHypothetically speaking, if $DLTR went below 65, option makers will be out of position. Bad. \n\n$DLTR ER is next week.   \n  \nThe 9/6 $65 puts have a bid/ask spread of 0.05 and 0.25, respectively.   \nThe 9/13 $65 puts have a bid/ask spread of 0.29 and 0.36, respectively.   \n\n\nI am going to put out feelers for both, and see where I get filled. I'd like to get in the 9/6 65p for 0.15/each. *Maybe* 0.20/each. My issue is, if I have to pay 0.20-0.25/each for 9/6 puts, why not pay the extra 0.05-0.10 to get an extra week of time? \n\nThis chart, and price action does look eerily similar to the DG and INTC chart I posted above. I'm just thinking to myself, \"It can't be this obvious, right?\"\n\nI'm going to try it though, just not as zealous as a starter position as with DG because the news is already out and the options are pricing it in.\n\nThe similarities between the charts are striking. Not sure how many of the puts I'll grab, or if they'll be for the 6th or 13th expiration. Going to see what fills I get tomorrow and re-evaluate next week. \n\nI'll also be starting a position for the $100c for WMT for March 2025.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/il3jyzc3jold1.png?width=3338&format=png&auto=webp&s=688ad2270781f5922f6a5163e43f88559c4b8f94",

So now, you only have the intrinsic value and no extrinsic value (IV). So, you're left with an option that is $5 ITM, so the value of that 120p would have been $4.5-$5.00 max. \n\nPaying $3.50 for an option that is $3 OTM? If the stock price did not chance, that option would have been worth pennies. Because the extrinsic value (ER volatility) does not exist and, is therefore not priced in the premium of the contract anymore. So now you're only left with the intrinsic value. \n\nMeanwhile, the 100p is in fact a lotto. Only costs 0.28/each. As with above, lets assume DG was at 115. Would also be worth pennies. \n\nIf I'm only thinking DG (or any stock) is going to drop a couple bucks, why not just short the stock instead of pay inflated prices on options during ER? \n\nAnd as stated above. I sold my options when DG was at $93, so \\~7.50/contract I sold them for. Let's take that same $93 price.  \n\n120p = $3.50 in cost. Would have been $27 ITM, so after ER, the 120p would have sold for \\~$2700. \n\n100p = 0.28 in cost. That same 3.50 would have got you 12 of the 100p. \n\nThose 100p were $7 ITM when I sold. 12 x $7 = \\~$8400.\n\nI don't buy options on ER to account for minor drops. Why not just buy/short stock instead at that point? \n\nI buy options when I'm speculating on something massive. \n\nIf DG price action never changed after ER, that 120p I paid $3.50 for would have been worth pennies. If even that.",

So you bought the OTM 100p mainly bc you were expecting a huge drop in DG’s stock price, and you didn’t want to pay huge premiums on options that were ITM or ATM due to the high IV.

If DG’s stock price had dropped a few dollars eg from $123 to $115, then wouldn’t your $100p (cost $0.28 per share) be worthless compared to your $120p (cost $3.50 per share) that are at least ITM by $5, so you make some profit ie $500-$350 = $150? Your $100p that cost you $28 are worth $0 now bc there’s no intrinsic value and extrinsic value (if the expiry was short) has gone to 0 bc IV has dropped significantly after ER, so you lost all $28?",

Gonna be a book, fair warning.\n\nEarlier this month, I grabbed WMT calls for the 70, 73, and 75 strikes for an earnings play. Why? I use their online ordering religiously, easily 4-5 times a week. Groceries, and anything else in their store delivered the same day. In under 1-3 hours if you pay extra. They don't have it in their store? You'll get it faster than even Amazon.\n\nIn fact, a few weeks ago I ordered a 45 inch 4k TV from Amazon for $300 to use as a monitor so I could see multiple charts at a time. The next day, still wasn't shipped. Which was good, because I realized 45 inches was too small. So, I checked Walmart. 60 inch 4k TV for $298. Amazon still didn't package it, let alone ship it. I cancelled the TV on Amazon and ordered it from $WMT. I had it on my doorstep the next day, in less than 24 hours. I'm super bullish on WMT. Grabbing $100 calls for March 2025, in fact. I digress. \n\nWhy puts on DG, and why the 100 strike? \n\nFirst, why puts on DG. WMT does everything dollar stores do, but better, and will deliver to your door within hours. In fact, WMT has more $1 products than the dollar stores themselves do. And their generic brand (Great Value) is actually pretty good quality. Seemed like a no brainer that, if WMT is taking market share from grocery stores, they'd be taking it from dollar stores too. \n\nIn fact, DG said in their conference that 'consumers are struggling' where as WMT said the opposite. Dollar stores will be a thing of the past within a matter of years. They simply cannot compete with WMT. \n\nWhy the 100 puts, specifically? Look at the picture I attached. The chart looked very similar to INTC before it dumped on ER. I did make money on Intel, had 20 and 25 puts before ER. \n\nI'm looking at the charts side by side and thinking, INTC went back to prices not seen for nearly a decade, DG very well could too. Not only that, the puts were only 0.28 a piece. Super low risk but high reward if I was right. \n\nAs for the \"dollar stores do better in this macro environment' statement? You would think so. But the issue is that WMT does everything dollar stores do, but better, with better quality products, and will bring it to your door. \n\nNot to mention the shrink (theft for those that haven't worked retail) that dollar stores have compared to WMT since the dollar stores are criminally understaffed. My town has 5 DG stores within a 15 mile radius. Why have 5 DG stores running on a skeleton crew when you can have 1 store that is fully staffed?",

I'm personally not seeing the floor at $75, but $80 is definitely a level of interest where there could be a bounce. \n\nThe issue I have with that is, will anyone want to buy DLTR for $80? Or even $65? When $WMT is still only $76/share, and has printed 8 new ATHs since is ER earlier this month? \n\n$80 cracks then it is a straight shot to $65. Concerning that $85 is already almost being cracked as of this time today. $80 breaks, straight shot to $65. \n\nHitting $65 in itself will cause a panic, and you could see $60 just as quickly as $65 happens. \n\n$60 is a key level of interest, for sure. The question is. Will we see dip buyers at $60? Or will they be out by that time and getting into WMT and other plays? Furthermore? How do we know that 'smart money' hasn't already bailed after DG earnings? \n\nIf this does in fact crack 80, I expect to see 65, then 60. \n\nAt 65, I will close 25% of my 100 options. That should make it a free trade. Then I can sit back and watch. \n\nBreaks 65 and hits 60, I close another 25% of my options. Now I'm on a free trade, with profit on top of the fact. I will then let the rest ride until Friday. Does it bounce and get back to $65? Maybe. I'll still make a little profit if it does. \n\nBut if it breaks $60 and I still have 50% of my options open on a free trade that has made me money already? \n\nBoy howdy.\n\nAll the above said, I do not see this breaking $50. Is it possible? Sure, stranger things have happened. But my targets to trim profits will be 65, then 60.",
