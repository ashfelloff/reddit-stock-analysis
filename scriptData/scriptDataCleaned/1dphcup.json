It's actually worse than a typical call debit/put credit spreads because a well set-up PMCC  will be way more directional and carry more theta. \n\nBy well set-up = debit < width of the long and short. This can be hard to achieve without being very directional like ATM long, way OTM short leg... Because of time value sure you could start with debit > width and make a couple hundred bucks, but at that point, a vertical spread will be a better use of your capital..",

Over the course of 6 months or so she made 70k. Thought she was a genius. Until one of them hit. All her gains were wiped out instantly. And she ended up owing several hundred thousand dollars more. \n\nThe reason people don't do what you're thinking is if things go wrong, and rest assured if you do this long enough it will, then you are utterly and royally fucked.",
