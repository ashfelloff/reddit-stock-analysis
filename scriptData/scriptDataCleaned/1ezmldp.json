  "selftext": "Last Friday I was feeling froggy so I put everything down to the rent in. Since then, only been moving in and out of NVDA 8/30 130C, held every overnight and dip. managed to sell close to the tops yesterday and today.\n\nThe kicker of this is that if you lose money in a TFSA, you don't get that contribution room back. It is a relatively new creation meant as a long term boomer investment account to create wealth for retirement, so fucking your contribution room significantly gimps your potential returns after the 40 yrs you're supposed to be holding in this account\n\nAnyways, holding cash over the weekend to regulate emotions (get some actual sleep) then going to set up an earnings play next week if I find a good entry. See y'all at the casino Monday ! ",
