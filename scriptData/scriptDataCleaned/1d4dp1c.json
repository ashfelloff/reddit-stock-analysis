  "selftext": "# Intro & About me\n\nI've been watching Fastly (FSLY) stock for over a year now but it's only since their last earnings that I've started to get super hyped. I'm a Senior Devops Engineer so Fastly is a company that provides services that I'm the target user of. The higher ups in my company have decided AWS everything is the path on the company road map so I've not had a chance to work with any Fastly services - but I do have a decent understanding of their value.\n\n# Last quarter's earning, what the fuck went wrong?\n\nAfter the earnings report, FSLY dropped like a sack of shit, \\~33% from when it was already near it's 52 week low. Just like it did on the last earnings. Notice those green earning beats? Surely we're missing something,\n\n[Here's last quarters results for those of you that can read](https://investors.fastly.com/news/news-details/2024/Fastly-Announces-First-Quarter-2024-Financial-Results/default.aspx)\n\n**Summary:**\n\n* Company reports positive operating cash flow of $11.1 million\n* Total revenue of $133.5 million, representing 14% year-over-year growth\n* Last 12-month net retention rate (LTM NRR)^(1) increased to 114%\n\n# Value proposition:\n\nOkay, that's all really good, what are we missing?\n\n* Current marketcap: $1.08B\n* Current assets: $1.51B\n* Current liabilities: $514M\n* Assets - liabilities \\~= the marketcap\n\nOkay, so it's valued like it's going out of buisness? It must have shit products/services?\n\n# What the fuck do they actually do?\n\n**CDN**  \nA CDN is a Content Delivery Network, you know when you're watching porn? Where does that video stream from - thats a CDN. The internet is getting really data heavy and CDN usage is only going to rocket up.\n\n**WAF**  \nA Web Application Firewall is something you put infront of your website to filter out DDOS attacks, bots or whatever other shit that not only can cause problems but also increases operational costs. I think the offering is similar to CloudFlare which has seen huge uptake.\n\n**Compute**  \nFrom their website: \"Solve real problems at the edge with serverless computing\"\n\nOkay, this is what gets me really hard. Edge computing is absolutely the way we're going with the need for low latency solutions. Pure speculation here but if I were Fasly I'd be pushing developers to run machine learning/AI on edge.\n\nBut ML/AI uses lots of power you idiot! Some of it does, but not all of it. If your phone can already do some of the heavy lifting then edge compute can do the rest and let me tell you 2024 is the year of AI running on phones.\n\n# I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANY OF THAT, SHOW ME LINES ON A GRAPH!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/yvnla45xim3d1.png?width=630&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0f8f30bc72fef12741fd30de7a67be7455d5fb2\n\nEdit: I can't update this image but volume went up towards market close and it's a definite uptrend in volume if you look for yourself\n\nI'm no TA wizz kid but what I'm seeing here is volume starting to pickup again, bottoming out around 4 days ago. MACD is crossed over but barely and OBV looks like it's about to set a higher low. But here's the thing, I don't care about the TA. I don't care about the price. I don't have a price target, just up. I'll keep putting my paycheck into this every month as long as it stays red, I don't give a shit. Am I a bit in the red? Maybe. Do I think this bitch will print? Fo sho.\n\nI absolutely suck at Reddit posts. I'll post my position if this gets any traction but I'm about 100 July & September calls in ($8 & $10), I'd go deeper but I'm waiting to take profit on other positions so I'm a bit low on liquidity currently.\n\n# TLDR:\n\n* FSLY is valued as if it's a shit company, they're not and they have loads of assets so they aren't going anywhere anytime soon and they're not offering stock at the all time low\n* FSLY offers services which will see massive growth\n* FSLY has customer retention >100% and 14% YoY revenue growth\n\nFirst ever DD, fifth ever Reddit post, tear me to shreds you degenerates.\n\nEdit: Clarified the text as some people seem to think I work at FSLY, I do not. I'm their target customer because I build internet thingies. \n\nEdit2: The more I look into this I think this could be an acquisition play at this price. \n\nEdit3: Why is everybody being nice? Come talk shit and inverse my position, I wanna see some blood.",

Fastly wins over AWS CloudFront on a few key points:\n\n* More price competitive for content delivery\n* Simpler pricing tiers\n* Vendor agnostic\n* Better caching\n* Easier image optimization\n* Real-time log streaming\n* More expensive, but better performing out-of-the-box WAF",

I think this could be a great play here just purely on the chart. \n\nYou can have a tight stop level for great risk reward skew - sustaining below 7.15 ain't good (last major low), so if you can get in mid 7s, set a 6.95 or so stop in case of a spike and reversal, but if that 7.15 holds then the upside has potential back toward 30 longer term.  The FSLY chart reminds me of ZIM, but before it took off a few months ago (I got in ZIM at 7 last fall, just sold at 22). \n\nI'd throw some OTM leap calls at it, but I'd go more like June 2025 and just hold tight, July2024 calls could be really risky if we get a broad market selloff soon-ish which certainly has the setup forming, or especially a larger tech/AI pullback, then this may get sold off arbitrarily and could really delay any upside until a new basing pattern can set up, which could take months, so even Sept $10s could be risky I think.",

Although CDN usage is rocketing, a lot of it is from core cloud providers Amazon, Google, Microsoft. I think compared to Cloudflare, FSLY is insanely underpriced too. \n\nI think FSLY has a niche here, they architected their CDN network differently than other providers (fewer, larger nodes) and the performance speaks for itself. \n\nI believe they will start to taper off spending and move towards becoming more profitable over the next few years or their demand for edge compute will increase drastically or they'll be acquired.",
