Ultimately there has been about 30% inflation over 4 years\n\nYou are pretty dismissive of what these numbers mean. I'm not saying the US isn't holding up well in comparison to other countries. But a healthy economy is not one that is fuelled by inflation, injecting liquidity, deficit spending, and people who can't make ends meet with only one or two jobs. The economy is bifurcated and the story for the richest of the country is ending up being applied across the board. That isn't going to keep working for much longer as the poor and middle classes continue to be squeezed.",

If the economy slows even more next quarter (let's say less than 1% growth), the inflation keeps the pace or goes higher and we see an uptick in unemployment we will pretty much be in a Stagflation even when the growth is not 0.\n\nAnyway, I agree with you, we don't really tick all the marks to call it stagflation.\n\n[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stagflation)",
