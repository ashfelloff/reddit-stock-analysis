  "score": 95,
  "selftext": "A quick analysis of where we go from here + historical data. \n\nThe S&P has a history of going counter trend in August with early August weakness after a strong year tending to strengthen the case for a bullish finish. \n\nFor example, since 1950, there have been 16 years in which a double digit, first seven months of the year (Jan-July) was followed by a negative first two weeks of August. \n\nThe following Aug14-January time frame was 14-2 in this setup for an avg 5 1/2 mt gain of 9.34%.  The 5% moves were 12-0 to the positive with the worst drawdown as measured from Aug 14 of the single digit variety. \n\nThe weakest period, on avg, was Sept 23-Oct 2 which was 6-10 for an avg loss of 0.90%.  \n\nThe strongest time frame was Oct27-Jan20 which was positive in all 16 of those setups for an avg, 8 week, gain of 7.27%.",
