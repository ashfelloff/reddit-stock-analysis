Yes the drug company is trying to muddy the water with patents on the pens claiming they extend the patent of the drug but this is garbage and the FTC is fighting many drug companies on this right now (see below). \n\nPatents are 20 years from the date of application not from the grant date. \n\nGLP-1 actual drug (not garbage add on patents for using the drug at specific doses or the pen for delivering it) expire in 2025 and 2026:\n\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK602920/table/t03/\n\nhttps://www.drugs.com/availability/generic-ozempic.html\n\nFor example, one of the primary drug patent application was in 2004 (most countries) and 2006 (US). The patent wasn’t granted in the US until 2012, but it expires in 20 years from the application (2026) not 20 years from the grant (2032):\n\nhttps://patents.google.com/patent/US8114833B2/en\n\nThe FTC is suing many drug companies for these garbage add on patents and the GLP-1 add on patents are included in the suit:\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/04/30/ftc-challenges-patents-held-by-drugmakers-including-for-ozempic.html\n\nWhat is happening here is similar to what happens with generics where companies will start making the drug before the patent expires because they know the company is unlikely to fight it in the final years. \n\nBut it’s different because they didn’t say it’s a generic they said it’s from a compounding pharmacy, which to me says they are buying the drug, probably indirectly, from the another (or even the original) manufacturer and just packaging it. You can’t “compound” this drug into existence, but you can dilute it to the right strength and package it at a compounding pharmacy.",

As of recent estimates, the global market for these drugs is valued at approximately $6.5 billion.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide is a significant driver of the GLP-1 drugs market. With more than 42% of the U.S. adult population classified as obese, there is a growing demand for effective weight management solutions​. Pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in the development of new GLP-1 drugs and combination therapies that enhance efficacy and patient adherence. This ongoing innovation is expected to contribute to market expansion​ because the significant weight loss results achieved with GLP-1 drugs, such as a 15-21% reduction in body weight, have increased both patient and physician acceptance of these treatments.\n\nInsurance coverage for GLP-1 drugs is also gradually improving, making these treatments more accessible to a broader population. The introduction of lower-cost compounded versions, like those offered by Hims, may further increase market penetration.",
