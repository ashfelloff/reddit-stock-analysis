My grandfather was an stock broker and owned his own investment firm and he always instilled in me don’t invest money you can’t afford to lose twice because replacing the money is really making you lose the money twice. \nPeople invest almost all there money all at once when they hit a threshold either expecting to game the stock market which like oooookay buddy boy or get one big payout and be out of the game. The issue people have is if there initial investment or cash flow goes red and they can’t recoup because they spent a long time getting to there threshold. I often see a lot of people only investing once they have 6 figures to invest but not to the point where that’s a large chunk of their wealth. This causes a huge time sink, we don’t get more of two things on earth time and land and time is money and money is power so time is power. \n\nI recommend as a young person to not gamble at all it’s not worth chancing it unless you are comfortable after a financial gamble. \n\n\nThe stock market is an unhealthy addiction it’s the higher stakes version of gambling that most cannot or have not participated in. Posts like this is also why I only make investments I can afford to lose twice and be happy about it.",
