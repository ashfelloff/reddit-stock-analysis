This drops the value of that debt BUT slows new loans and therefore new money creation. There was a glorious side effect of sucking $2 trillion out of circulation and parking it in the reverse repo program for guaranteed 5%.\n\n\nThe brakes are still on new loan creation and most of the rrp funds have been taken back out and put to work. Inflation is still too high most likely because the reserve rate is still 0, so there is no cap on loan creation. If you can afford it, they can still print it for you",

It might not be, though to be honest the economy needs 4-5% for years to let air out of  the housing bubble specifically so that there isn't a massive crash because prices can't just keep inflating the way they were for so long without any consequences and corporations can't buy all the real estate to make up for fewer  people with sufficient money.\n\nWe will see.  If they lower rates, time will tell us better than the words of any official.  If the fed is being responsible, they know to keep rates high enough to slow spending and reduce costs of loans, simultaneously tackling inflation climbs while also deflating bubbles... but not overdoing it so high or for so long that they create deeper recession through monetary policy.

Imagine you had a credit card with an unlimited credit limit (whenever the US gov hits the credit limit, it just votes to raise the debt ceiling - you probably see that drama on the news every now and then)\n\nNow also imagine that credit card interest rate was near zero.\n\nBut here's the best part, your credit card company only requires you to make interest payments.\n\nEssentially, no matter how high the balance, your payment is always around zero. Why wouldn't you keep borrowing like an imbecile with no fear of the future.\n\nThat's why debt has skyrocketed since the early 2000s. The FED dropped rates to zero to avoid an economic depression, but in its infinite stupidity did not slowly raise them back up over time. And you can see the direct result of that by looking at our debts increase in that time.",

I think this is the fair price at the current fed fund rate; TLT seems to move around 15 bucks for every 1% fed funds movement. If rates climb upwards, I’m going to get hosed if rates actually go down it could be a lot of fun.",
