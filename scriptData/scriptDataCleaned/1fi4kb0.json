Still the worst CPUs by far.  \n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nSaw Intel’s demise over half a decade ago. Every week bag holders have to try and pump Intel and I have to keep reminding them INTC is almost a scam investment. I still don’t know how they fumbled the 4 biggest cloud computing, tech, semi conductor, QE rallies in the past 10 years.\n\nThey’ve got a major problem that they seemingly can’t fix. Everyone is running away with better performance/watt and this was half a decade ago and everything I’ve tested is leaving them further behind.\n\nThis is like Boeing getting gov contracts. You suck so much the gov needs to keep you floating is NOT a good endorsement. Just because some mom with 8 kids gets gov money to float her every month doesn’t mean it’s worth your time.\n\nStill by far the worst performance/watt by far and there are now several players so far ahead of Intel.\n\nMy parents who can’t work 2FA, don’t know what a login box is, can’t turn on a computer, think it’s a value play.  They lost money on INTC.  You can’t fix stupid.  I had to change their 2FA to an Authenticator app on my phone so when they login they now have to call or text me to relay them the code.  I have to video conference them to click the next button.  It’s UI designed for the dumbest people and they can’t click the big NEXT button to get a code sent.    \n\nBoomers don’t even know how to click “NEXT” in an app yet think they know the semiconductor field more than someone who literally slept in the datacenter some nights.  Boomers clicking emails with domains that are spelled similar and failing for obvious phishing scams are those that buy INTC.  Sorry for the rant, I told them don’t click obvious pw reset scams, don’t but INTC stock but I come over and what do they do?\n\nThese are the type of dummies that have been buying INTC for 10 years.",

It’s no fun seeing your parents lose money or be stupid but their thinking process and unwillingness to adapt is crazy especially in a field they don’t know. \n\nThey’ll spend 50 hours on a task that I suggest try ChatGPT the end result was very similar and ChatGPT did it in seconds but they won’t even try it.  I’m not saying it’s good but you need to try it and compare results.  Regarded, just set in their thinking process, no adapting, no empirical evidence.  \n\nYou might buy INTC wait 10 years and break even or lose money when buying Amd nvda msft amzn aapl asml or any semi /cloud computing stock could’ve retired you in 10 years.  \n\nIt’ll be similar the next 10 years.  They can pivot when new management comes and they design a new efficient product but that takes 10 years +.  In that time you could have used your money more efficiently \n\nLook at how inefficient amd opteron was,  took amd new management -12 plus years to redesign and gain acceptance, to dig out of that hole .  \n\nEvery few weeks for the last 8 years I’ve warned this sub not to invest in INTC and it’s been spot on. \n\nOpportunity cost of buy Intel stock vs investing in any other major semi or cloud computing company would have retired folks in the 20s or 30s.   \n\nImagine listening to people who worked in this field, being retired 4 decades early.  Owning your own time.  No alarm, no commute, no one to tell you where to be or when.  Now I get to sit back and laugh at the INTC regards  \n\nWaking up commuting, working , commuting home , eat do chores, get 1-2 hours with your family for 40 years is f bullshit, time is too valuable for that non sense but that’s another rant for another sub.",

This noble idea would work not work if the EU comprised only of Eastern European countries, since they have shown in the past, they dont care about the EU.  The EU would also work without these direct money transfers. I visited Poland almost every year since the 90s and the memebership was the best thing that could happen to Poland. Most village in Poland had no pavements, now they have illuminated bike lanes. Or take farmers, 1/3 of the funds go to farmers. Almost all of them have been doing farming for decades and the EU now pays them so much money for continuing the job. That's not necessary. Open borders would work without these subsidies. Poland is not even a major export partner of Germany.",
