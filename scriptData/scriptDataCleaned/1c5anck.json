      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nr/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.\n\nTo keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.\n\nWe try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. \n\nThis is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:\n\n* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. \"What app should I use?\", \"What should I invest in?\". \n\n* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, \"inverse cramer\" joke again. \n\n* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. \n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",
