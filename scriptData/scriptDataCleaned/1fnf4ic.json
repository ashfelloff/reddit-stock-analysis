Religion was largely banned and regulated in USSR whereas in Poland the Catholic Church had a very important role in the fall of communism (including the election of Karol Wojtyla, a Polish cardinal to be Pope).\n\nPoland did act multiple times, even under socialist governments in spite and opposition to Moscow on multiple matters, both social and political.\n\nIf the DDR (East Germany) and Poland were part of the Soviet Union, the events of 1989 onward may have happened later, or not happened at all. When the Baltics attempted to break away from the Soviet Union one year later, they faced Soviet military intervention e.g.\n\nBut the fact that many countries from the Warsaw Pact could decide for themselves independently from Moscow without Moscow being able to do much about it was a very important factor in the fall of the USSR itself.",

In my opinion what drives growth among other things is that many people in Poland feel we’re far, far behind and must run fast to catch up.\n\nWhen I traveled to California in 2004 it felt so advanced. You could pay with credit card everywhere.\n\nThen I moved to NY and Philadelphia for somewhere before Covid. I wanted to pay touchless with my Apple Watch as I was used in Poland but few terminals in NY were touchless. I had to use card. Turned out chip cards were unsupported in most places and magnetic stripe was blocked by default as obsolete and unsafe tech - had to turn it on in bank app.\n\nThen the internet. I was used to pay 70PLN ($20) for 1Gigabit. In Philadelphia I had to pay $100 for 10x slower.\n\nAlso cheques and banking in general. I pay for everything with instant transfers in Poland, from my banking app. Receive salary that way too. Then I suddenly had to pay bills with a cheque I’ve never seen in my life - I know my grandma used them when I was very little.\n\nBut roads and infrastructure in general is still much, much behind US. From my experience tech is much more advanced in Poland but the rest still isn’t. Which is funny as most of the tech is US based.\n\nAlso health care. I’ve visited family in hospital in NY and it looks a hundred years ahead of Poland. Though - what sounds crazy to me - broken leg treatment costed thousands even with health insurance.\n\nIt’s super weird from my perspective that the richest country on Earth doesn’t have free higher education and health care in the US. I have friends from my university who work at Microsoft and Apple and never paid a single dollar for their degrees. Their colleagues from work had to pay hundreds of thousands in much richer country.\n\nNot sure about comparison to Western Europe, though. But more and more Poles who go to States for vacation think Poland is still a shithole and are expecting miracles but came back surprised.\n\nThe cost of living is increasing and I feel that all the problems I see in the US are coming to Poland, just 10 or 15 years later.",

      "body": "Polish Person here.  \nRead about Balcerowicz plan – a controversial plan by our then finance minister. In the 90s it aimed to privatise most of the government-owned companies and to cut down on social benefits that were unsustainable. Most post-soviet countries experienced some form of slump and then growth after the fall of the USSR. Poland is special in many ways – Balcerowicz plan was like shock therapy of hyper-capitalism. Many people suffered immensely and lost their jobs and livelihoods. It was very bad at the beginning. However, over the years we can contribute this growth to those policies. What is really funny - as much as this plan is criticised by people on all political spectrum, almost nobody dared to push significant changes to it. All politicians realised it was the nececery evil that was required to get the country going. There are other factors that helped – the EU is the big one, but it wouldn't explain this growth by itself. Poland also dodged 2008 crisis, as we were not tight so strongly with US markets back then. Covid went relatively well for Poland as well.\n\nThe good thing about the Polish economy is that it is very diverse – we have a good farming industry, services, and nice startup bases. There are some weak points (energy mostly), but we don't over rely on one thing.\n\nPoland is currently transitioning – we used to be considered cheap labour for export. Nowadays we need to start demanding more money for our services, due to economic growth. We are yet to see how will poland navigate this landscape. I am investing in Polish stocks, and I will soon invest in some indexes as well.",
