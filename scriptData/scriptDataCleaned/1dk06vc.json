First, holding it for longer than a year reduces your tax burden. Second it gives you some breathing room in case the stock price falls. The worst thing that could happen would be for the stock to fall below the strike price. Then it‚Äôs not worth anything. Buying in the money at least gives you some of your investment back even if the stock price falls a bit so long as it stays above the strike price.",
