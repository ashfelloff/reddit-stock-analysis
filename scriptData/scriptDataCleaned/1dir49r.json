Then when a move does happen I‚Äôve already spent my option allowances for the day and just watch it go up sadly with no benefit.  In papermoney I have done what you did with limit orders at open, I think I need to revisit that.  I like the action at open but am not confident in which way the action will go.  A limit order would at least let my guess pan out a bit before getting in, no?",

I aim to find options that cost less than $0.50, have stock prices close to the strike price ( in this case it was less than a quarter to the stock price), and exhibit high volatility (no earnings, but just a good green week).

Learn what is a butterfly spread, very cheap to open and can give 10x1 reward to risk ratio so not just a coin flip and your trades may start going better. Not financial advice just prob should learn safer roulette haha",

Right now price is $26, I can open a butterfly selling 10dte $28 strike twice and buying the 10dte $27 and $29 strike. You have to set custom ratio to input the two sells. This gives me breakevens of $27-$28.92, I set an alarm to let me know when in this zone. Spread cost .13 to open with max profit $92 or 1x7 risk to reward ratio. It's defining the trade more, risking less and still excellent reward just requires actively managing the trade that's what I'd do.\n\nEDIT: That's an example, CHWY is moving so quickly I'd prob sell the body of the butterfly at a higher strike, and sell two spreads at different strikes like $30 and $32 to cover more profit range. Overlapping double butterfly spread. I'd compare this to long call calendar at $32-$35 range. So those 3 strats but they need to be compared, shopping around a bit.

Have butterflies set for $28 and $29 strike for PLTR around its earnings date. And diagonal spread on SPY since 30m RSI dumped. Pretty simple plays. Calendar cause close to earnings. Butterfly since far out which is cheap and high reward. And diagonal spread for SPY for short term safe play wqhile waiting it's my go to play.
