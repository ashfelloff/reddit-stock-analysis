  "score": 1875,
  "selftext": "TSLA is having an enormous problem. First off I live in Austin and I drive by the plant every once in a while. They have cars stacked 4 and 5 high, looks like almost a 1,000 if not more. Cybertrucks too. They have finally caught up to demand and now have way too much supply. The CyberTruck is a dud. I canceled my order, so did everyone else I know. The Model Y and 3 seem to sell well but I rarely see a new model X or Y. So the high end has stopped moving. Plus they have lowered the prices so much they have destroyed the high margins they were making. Plaid has gone from almost $140k to less than $100k. That‚Äôs a lot of profit gone. Tesla dealerships have them stored to the Moon. Same thing cars stacked 4 and 5 high and parked all over the place. At other Dealerships I am being told by friends who live in other parts of the Country that it‚Äôs worse. \n\nThe entire car industry is having massive issues but Ford and GM are not valued at 60xs forward earnings. \n\nI think Elon is going to try to preempt the Earnings disaster with his ‚ÄúRoboTaxi‚Äù announcement on the 10th. 1 week before earnings on the 16th. Try to ride the ‚ÄúAI‚Äù hype. \n\nPower-walls don‚Äôt sell, Solar does not pencil out, and they are not building a robot anytime soon.\n\nBut they still can‚Äôt make my dam Roadster, been on order for 4 years plus. \n\nMe thinking of taking out a nice Put position for the 16th. Short term Puts will be cheap and stock has rallied back over $250. Perfect timing to knock $50 bucks off the stock. \n\nThat‚Äôs what happened last time.\n\nThoughts WSB wizards?\n\nTSLA Puts, out of the Money, for the Win? \n\nOr don‚Äôt bet against Elon. I am a huge fan but I can do math too and theirs just does not add up.",

Model Y with temporary tags everywhere. The cybertruck is a damn shame, no doubt. I‚Äôve been driving a Y for about a month now, 50-60 miles per day, recharge each night on a standard household outlet (slow AF, but it tops me off), and the car is luxurious and fun. I think it looks stupid, and I look even more stupid kicked back and relaxing while it drives me to/from work. But I‚Äôm telling you, Tesla is going to continue to be the leader in EVs and people will continue to change their minds about EVs‚Ä¶ one at a time. Anyway, good luck on the puts.

The CEO has literally fucked every celebrity dude wife, got another 6 women pregnant, says whatever he wants, fucks Cathy Wood, does whatever he wants, CEO  of 6 different companies at the same time and the stock still goes higher because he knows no one will ever sell.\n\nHe understands the mechanics of publicly traded stocks really well and knows once the major indexes own your stock, they're going to pump it forever, look at Microsoft and Apple.\n\nAlso, many people who are shareholders will never sell because they have owned it since before the first split. Many, just like me know as long as SpaceX, X, and grok, never go public, the value of Tesla will continue to go through the roof. It has nothing to do with cars or solar. We know the company isn't doing well but as long as the other companies are not publicly traded, they're essentially part of Tesla.\n\nIt's going to take some type of crisis to crash his stock.\n\nHope this helps",
