Keep in mind that the market needs to cooperate in order for this patterns to work. If it’s a bad market these patterns won’t work. Use Volume and MACD. The clearer the pattern the better. Also make sure to buy options with lots of time just in case the stock takes a few days to breakout. Also look at the options Greeks to see what you’re dealing with.",
