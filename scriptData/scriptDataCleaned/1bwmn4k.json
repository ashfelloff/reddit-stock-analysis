  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôve gathered you all here today. \n\nCCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B\n\nAround 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.\n\nIn 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.\n\nCCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. \n\nRCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. \n\n\n\n-CON-\nCCL‚Äôs long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. \n\n-HOWEVER-\n\nDuring last quarter CCL‚Äôs operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. \n\nCCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, ‚ÄúOur responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs money to be made here. Love to hear some thoughts on this.",
