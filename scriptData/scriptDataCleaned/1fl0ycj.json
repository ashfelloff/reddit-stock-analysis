Basically, Japan has a long term problem that may see Yen devalued greatly in the years ahead. In the short term, they nearly had a full on currency crisis this summer. They first avoided it by dumping US treasuries to buy Yen to prop up its currency. When that failed and Yen started tanking they had to raise rates in July. That led to blow up of leveraged Yen carry trades (like Capula). If they keep raising rates, that gets very expensive for Japan who’s been living on borrowed money so it’s not a good solution long term. US not far behind btw. But USD is still the global currency (petro dollar) and Yen isn’t.",

                              "body": "So this article is incredibly poorly written and makes zero sense \n\nThere is a negligible amount of directional risk in an FX swap as the near leg delta is offset by the far leg delta (mostly). An FX swap is effectively an indirect way to take a view on foreign vs domestic interest rates (dv01 of ccy1 vs dv01 ccy2).\n\nWhen the local banks buy the USD on the near spot leg, they are selling Yuan. Certainly if the market drops in the future, their selling of the far leg would be in the money but because this is a 2-legged trade (a swap) it does not have the same implications as selling an outright forward which would then actually be going short USD. \n\nIn the article it says \"The banks use the dollars to buy yuan on the spot market\"which makes no sense. They are buying USD on the near leg and selling Yuan to the counterparty that's giving them the USD, they wouldn't in turn then sell out the same USD to buy back the yuan.. that's just  unwinding the FX swap into a an outright short forward.\n\nI.e.... if they wanted to short a usdcnh fwd they would just do that, not do an fx swap then unwind the spot leg... But the article is saying they are using fx swaps to short USD which makes no sense.\n\nWhat they ARE doing is trying to offset the weakening effect of low domestic rates from weakening their currency by setting forward points so low as to scare anyone from holding  cny/cnh shorts for the long term because of the threat of a downward sloping forward curve.\n\nThe cb is paying the market with carry to keep the cnh shorts at bay. This is not the same thing as \"going short usd.\"\n\nThey hold too many treasuries to ever genuinely be short USD.\n\n\nIf you actually read all this then my heart goes out to you!",
