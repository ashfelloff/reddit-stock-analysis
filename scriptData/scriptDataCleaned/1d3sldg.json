As soon as he launched the proxy fight, DIS magically found billions of dollars in waste that they could cut, began trying to fix their movie slate, etc. all in an effort to win over investors. The net result is it boosted the stock in the short-term. And since Peltz didn't win any seats, he did the smart thing and dumped his stock and took the increased gains brought on by the potentially temporary stock pop - he has no way to know whether the changes his presence prompted will stick, or they will soon revert back to the same old dumpster fire.\n\nSee: Zaslaw/Licht/CNN",

Number of shares you own is also meaningless, especially now that every brokerage offers fractional shares. The _only_ thing that matters is the lump sum of money you invest in the company and percentage deltas the stock moves.\n\nSaying invest in Disney instead of Carvana makes just as much sense as saying invest in Disney instead of Tesla or Chipotle or Pfizer or Nike. The only thing that matters is if you think its stock price is going to go up faster than any other ticker based on your assessed risk based returns.

Remember, the comic book Thor sounds like a knight from King Arthur's court. They tried that in the first movie. Think back to all the dumbass scenes like the one where Thor smashes his coffee mug asking for another or attempting to speak in ye olde English. Later movies his dialect is much more conversational, and they leaned heavily on Hemsworth's comedy chops - Again, something nonexistent in the Thor comic books (Thor doesn't do jokes) and much more common place in Spiderman's.\n\nThey ended up doing an ok job with Captain Marvel but made her so OP, that she literally had to check out for the entire Infinity movies, otherwise she could just show up, punch Thanos in the face and the movie would be over (which is sort of exactly what happened at the end of Endgame when she destroyed his ship and went 1v1 with him). She was probably mean to be the who decided the whole thing - but Downey wanted out and they thought they could kill him off by being the ultimate hero - and it made sense since it was Iron man 1 that started this whole thing - cue the \"I am Iron Man\" line from the first movie as he snapped his fingers.\n\nDon't flame me, but I thought Black Panther was way overrated. Don't get me wrong, I think Chadwick Boseman is the shit (Look how utterly horrible BP2 was without him) - and I love the actress that plays Shuri, and she was a great comedic balance to Boseman - but the reality is the movie was ok-ish. It was definitely not as amazing as everyone was proclaiming. I think there was a bit of virtue signaling going on there because of all Black cast/director/African culture part of the movie.  The ending was also dumber than a bag of shit. Killmonger absolutely hates BP because of his life growing up. He spends the entire movie vehemently ranting that he wants to destroy Wakanda and everything it stands for. He shows up and wants to kill Black Panther, his uncle, his sister, and anyone who even looks at him funny. He wants to use Wakanda weapons to destabilize the world, etc. but at the end after losing the fight to BP, he lies in his arms and just wants to watch the sunset. lol, wut?",

But if you look at the returns from merchandising and brand extensions, the last few years of the MCU have been destroying the golden goose. \n\n\nConsidering Perlmutter became a billionaire from toys and brand licensing, typically tied to Animated Series and live action projects from other studios, his perspective is not without merit. ",
