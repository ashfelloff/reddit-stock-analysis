Our Innovations Center has state of the art labs where you can get hands on experience. We have AR and VR labs that look identical to Wendy’s Dumpsters all over the world! You’ll learn advanced techniques from proven experts like former President Donald Trump.”\n\nThis is what Mr. Trump had to say about Wendy’s.\n\n“Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nIt is with tremendous pride and great enthusiasm that I announce my new role as the Senior Lead Innovator at the Wendy’s Innovation Center. Believe me, folks, this is going to be HUGE. Wendy’s, as you know, is already the best in the business—nobody does it better. But with my incredible vision and unparalleled expertise, we’re taking it to a whole new level.\n\nNot only are we going to revolutionize the menu, but I will also be teaching cutting-edge business classes in state-of-the-art VR and AR labs. We’re talking advanced techniques, folks, on how to be the most effective when you’re out back, doing business by the dumpster. It’s all about strategy, efficiency, and making the best deals possible—even in the most unexpected places.\n\nGet ready, America, because Wendy’s is about to become more fantastic than ever before. Together, we will make Wendy’s the greatest, most innovative fast-food chain in the world. It’s going to be tremendous!\n\nThank you, and God bless.”",
