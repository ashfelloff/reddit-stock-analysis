  "title": "Why do people buy ARM over SoftBank?",
  "score": 251,
  "selftext": "Softbank owns 90% of ARM yet, it's 6/10 of ARM total market cap.  Would it not make sense to buy SoftBank (SFTBY) instead of ARM? That's a 40%+ discount.\n\nEdit:  Thank you for all your comments.  Will update this post as we get more clarification.  It is a lot of reading, so will summarize it here in one paragraph.\n\nBased on the comments so far, Softbank and their management has made some poor decisions in the past and have accumulated debt, including WeWork. They also do not allow to trade options. That is why it's stock is trading lower than ARM.  I do think SFTBY has a bright future ahead of it, with 38.22% growth this year.  The question would be, will ARM continue to go up?  If it does, Softbank will be a good long term investment.  If ARM doubles within the next 12 month, Softbank will go up 4x.  In other words SFTBY is a 2x leveraged ETF on ARM.\n\nJune 11 Update:  ARM just went KABOOM today.  Softbank most likely to follow suite.",
