That’s by far the biggest mistake I’ve seen first time options traders make. The second is getting to the Ferrari dealership and not having already thought about what color you want. Red is classic but is it too obvious? These are the sort of things you’re going to have to think about now.\n\nAll kidding aside, congratulations on your win.
