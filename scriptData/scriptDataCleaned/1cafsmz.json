  "score": 33,
  "selftext": "I have noticed that lately the market has started to treat long term investments as an expense and sells off when it is announced.\n\nGenerally speaking stocks making long term investments has been a very good thing for investors.  Companies that underinvest historically are the one you want to avoid.\n\nThis type of thing only happens in  a depression or stagflation.  If it's. depression interest rates are going to 0% again.  If it's stagflation then it just buy and hold as much as you and hold it long term until it's over.",
