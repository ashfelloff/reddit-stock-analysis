I managed to change my military TSP account from single digit gains from bonds (yes, It hurts.) to S&P and gain about 50% last too years for emergency money (I don't add it to it anymore, I have a 401k I max out.) It shows how compounding interest works in the market.\n\nRemember the movie with wtf his name Gordon? Shia Lebouf was saying a 1300 point drop was the end of the world, I chuckled. Back then on a 20/20 episode in 2008, people we're on the verge of retirement and looking at their 401ks and losing 50% of their port value. Had the same young women crying because she experienced the same but had years of work left. Kind of gives perspective how the market works overtime, and I think a lot of people still don't understand it. Share buybacks are a major thing.\n\nWhen times are hard and people need money. This is when you should buying. It might take a years or decade to recover. It will be will worth it in the end.",

Another explanation for Black Monday comes from the decline of the dollar, followed by a lack of faith in governmental attempts to stop that decline. In February 1987, leading industrial countries had signed the Louvre Accord, hoping that monetary policy coordination would stabilize international money markets, but doubts about the viability of the accord created a crisis of confidence. The fall may have been accelerated by portfolio insurance hedging (using computer-based models to buy or sell index futures in various stock market conditions) or a self-reinforcing contagion of fear”",
