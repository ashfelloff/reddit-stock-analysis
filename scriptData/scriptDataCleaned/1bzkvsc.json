This company can grow.\n\n- Regulatory problems almost solved.  Grab employs so many people and greases the right palms.\n\n-  Grab offers three types of delivery services: food, mart, and express.  Together, these services account for more revenue than the company‚Äôs  ride-hailing services.\n\n-   Grab app also offers a wallet feature that allows users to make  payments online and in person, send money to family and friends, finance  purchases over time, and even buy travel insurance.\n\n-  Uber received a 27.5% stake in Grab, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi joined the company‚Äôs board.\n\n- Cheap and undervalued.  You missed out on Uber, this is better play it is worth at least $3.80 but can easily hit $5.00 in the next year or two.\n\n- Position : Share$\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5ylizu9g9etc1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=715dd35fb6a5fa435871112b6232a24f3ae39f35\n\n  \n\n\n",
