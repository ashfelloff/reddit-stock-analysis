  "score": 317,
  "selftext": "\nThe U.S. economy expanded at a healthy pace during the third quarter, keeping fears of a downturn at bay while Federal Reserve officials eye further interest-rate cuts.\n\nInflation-adjusted gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% over the three months ended in September, according to the first estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The consensus call among economists surveyed by FactSet was for growth of 2.6% in the third quarter, though Bloomberg's forecast was for 2.9%.  \n\nWednesday's solid third-quarter growth comes after real GDP growth was 3% during the second quarter and 1.6% during the first three months of the year.\n\nWhile GDP is a fundamental economic measure, most economists and analysts believe Federal Reserve officials will use inflation and employment data as more of a guide when weighing their interest-rate policy decision at next week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​\n\nSource: Barron's",

For strategic industries this is acceptable, as they are about national security rather than maximum profitability, but for normal economic sectors this is detrimental to the general economy.",
