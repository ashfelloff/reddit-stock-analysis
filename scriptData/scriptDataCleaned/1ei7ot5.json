Intel just dropped this new architecture, and they probably have 3-4 generations in the pipeline with it already (think of AMD propping up bulldozer). \n\nIF Intel has any magic sauce, it's probably 5-10 years down the line at best, assuming they can keep talent, and actually build a competent product. They can't revert to a previous architecture after major vulnerabilities like RowHammer and the 10% hit they took to performance there. They'd have to dev something brand new.\n\nI don't know where intel goes from here that leads to a good quarterly earnings call in the next 5 years, and I doubt they'll be particularly positive after that. ARM as an architecture is starting to enter the PC market, Apple stopped using intel based chips, and microsoft is dabbling in supporting ARM. ARM also supports a wicked battery life and a ton of other improvements you just can't get out of x86_64. As someone in this industry, It's only a matter of time before the x86_64 instruction set stops being the workhorse of the consumer sector, and that will DESTROY Intel and AMD's chokehold on the processor market.",

AMD left because of yield issues back in the APU era. Global Foundries is already on the US trusted foundry list. AMD will walk right back into Global Foundries arms again if Taiwan is invaded, as will Nvidia, as they're publicly traded. \n\nSure, there'd be turmoil, but between a fab that creates chips that literally degrade from normal use, and supply chain issues, I'd take supply chain issues any day.\n\nAnd that's not even talking about the explosion of non AMD/Intel ARM chips that would happen. Windows has a functional ARM release now and ARM laptops are already in the works. Only one has come out, but there's a LOT of them in the pipeline, and Intel doesn't support arm.\n\nAll of you speculate on this speculating that global politics are the only destabilizing force in this industry. ARM's rise has been on the horizon for many years and we're just seeing the edge of it. and it is going to FUCK Intel (and AMD) up, if they don't pivot accordingly.",

Apple didn't just choose to fab with ARM cause they thought i'd be fun. Meanwhile both AMD and Intel shuttered their low power lines (No more Atom/APU processors). How do you quadruple battery life? Cause my m2 macbook gets 18 hours of battery life and my brand new x1 carbon gets 4. and it still reads racist rants on facebook and plays whatever shitty gatcha game last came out. no problem.\n\nAll the intel fanboys are throwing good money after bad thinking that \"it's just a slump\". \n\nIntel's technical chops have been in rough waters for years, and because of the way that the industry works, you have a several year delay to see structural problems in a company.",

See: https://ficalc.app\n\nAll of that with near-zero stress. Honestly I don't even know why this sub exists, it seems to destroy so much wealth while laughing.\n\nI genuinely hope you recover this position and can then move away from betting on single stocks and just buy the casino so every gambler is funneling money to you instead.",
