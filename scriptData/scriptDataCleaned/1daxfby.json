  "selftext": "Hey Guys,\n\nNot seen much chat on this, looks an interesting proposition, with some sources saying the IPO is already oversubscribed multiple times.\n\nInitial share offering £2.60 > £2.80 expected.\n\nI love the Raspberry PI and will be great for the LSE but not sure how its going to play out once it goes public.\n\n\"According to [reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-07/pc-maker-raspberry-pi-seen-pricing-ipo-at-top-end-of-range), the IPO is set to raise £179 million ($228 million) from the IPO, which will give the company a valuation of circa £540 million ($686 million). The pricing would be would be at the top end of its range, according to terms seen by Bloomberg.\"\n\n  \nEDIT. Here's the offer documents with lots of interesting info \n\n[https://media-prod.ii.co.uk/s3fs-public/pdfs/RPI\\_Factsheet.pdf](https://media-prod.ii.co.uk/s3fs-public/pdfs/RPI_Factsheet.pdf)",

For hobbyist, you're better off buying a used miniPC/NUC, depending on your use case you can even use an old Android phone.

At this point I've been hearing the, it's all about the community, for Raspberry Pi for at least a decade and every year that becomes less of an advantage. So on that makes sense to try and cash out as soon as possible in an IPO.\n\nThe most recent Raspberry Pi wasn't very compelling in my opinion. Fine for IOT but not such an upgrade to be preferable against older Pis or alternatives. Also its video encoding/decision capabilities looks like they've conceded the HTPC status of Raspberry Pi's to competitor SBCs and mini PCs. Raspberry Pi is top as a brand name but in my opinion that brand name is losing its reverence in the SBC and miniPC market",
