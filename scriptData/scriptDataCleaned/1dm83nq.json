  "selftext": "Just curious to see what other people's strategies are. I tend to feel more comfortable shorting a stock since price action seems to move more quickly when price drops. I look for the 15 min and 5 min candles to both look like they are going to be reversing and then get in. Price will either go my way, or I'll know within 5 minutes if my trade didn't go my way.",

Even if you lose 90% of the time, that one win can more than make up for the losses.\n\nProblem is, those days are few and far between, and most people don't have the discipline to throw $1,000 at a trade they've lost 9 times in a row. That time you tell yourself \"this is stupid. It's just not gonna work. I'm not gonna risk it\" is the one time that it works.",

Faster EMAs moving away from slower EMA after almost touching and bouncing off (bull=faster rising quicker, bear= falling faster)\n4. Too much to write on candlesticks, but this is a part of the equation \n4. I tend to do these between (EST) 10:00-11:00 and 2:00-4:00. \n5. Best part: Greeks don’t matter as the maximum time to hold the contract is incredibly short at 15 minutes\n6. Limit order to open. Once a comfortable profit margin is attained, I’ll commonly use a trailing stop to close the position. \n\nHope this helps someone. \n\n(FYI this is a combination of Jea Yu ‘Alpha’ and Steve Nison’s candlesticks training. )",
