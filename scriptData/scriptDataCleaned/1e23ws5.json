Just a ground invasion of what the ussr did for just a couple years collapsed their nation when we have been involved in an unimaginable amount of long distance foreign conflicts for decades.\n\nAs much as everyone fear mongered about Russia being a military capable nation with the second strongest military was just a paper tiger, it’s the same with China they didn’t even know a portion of their weaponry was unusable until we let them know when it was politically relevant.\n\nI am not some ultra patriotic individual who believes the USA is untouchable, but right now if it was USA vs the entire globe we would actually hold our own. This isn’t ego talking but our current resources/ inventory, our training/ field experience, and our dominance of military intelligence.\n\nYou’re not even considering the allies we have now, you’re talking about one nation or brics nations going against the USA and nato.

The remarks drew a sharp response from Beijing.\n>Japan worries that any conflict in Taiwan would spread to its territory.\nWith its westernmost island only 110 km (68 miles) from Taiwan, Japan hosts more than 50,000 American troops, hundreds of U.S. military aircraft, and an aircraft carrier strike group that Washington could deploy to defend Taiwan.\n>Japan's 548-page assessment also highlighted China's plans to double its nuclear arsenal to more than 1,000 warheads by 2030.\nIt mentioned attempts by neighbouring North Korea to boost its nuclear strike capability with surveillance satellites and new, more advanced missiles, some with sufficient range to strike the United States.\nJapan also identified Russia as a concern, because of its military ties with China, and, more recently, with North Korea, which had begun supplying it with artillery shells and other ammunition for its forces fighting in Ukraine.\n>In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a deal with North Korea's Kim Jong Un featuring a mutual defence pledge by which Moscow could offer military aid to Pyongyang.",
