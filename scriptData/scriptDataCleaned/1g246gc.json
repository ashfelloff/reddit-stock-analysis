  "title": "How Risky Are Junk Bonds Really?",
  "score": 72,
  "selftext": "I was looking through some of the junk bond yields and I've noticed a few bonds, most notably Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) with a 130% yield, maturing on 05/15/2026. I assume this yield comes from bankruptcy risk, but if spirit were to file chapter 11, they would do something to make the bondholders whole(ish), right (assuming the company didn't evaporate; see FTX)? \n\nIs there a strategy that improves outcome, or is it almost all a gamble?\n\nWhat are the odds that the bond makes it to maturity and how risky would that be compared to something like 0DTE calls?\n\n\n\nI've tried to google but have not found a super concise answer.",

It's like asking if technology stocks are safe...it really depends on the company. \n\nBond holders get paid before equity holders, but other creditors get paid first.
