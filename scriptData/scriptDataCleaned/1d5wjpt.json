  "selftext": "This is my third time posting this because the first time I fucked up formatting and the second time I accidentally deleted the post, forgive me if it's light on details or rushed. \n\nDisclaimer: This DD involves **BIOTECH**\n\n[Humacyte](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1224214916412739617/1246561894647726162/Untitled.png?ex=665cd6bb&is=665b853b&hm=da026dea632d9dc450c82f92500867a0928cdc65dc7bd633b0d95338b92ac1bc&) (HUMA) produces lab-grown artery implants that physically become part of the body after implantation. This is better than the current existing methods for artery replacement which involve either a plastic device or harvesting a vein from another part of the body. \n\n[Basic price per unit is $20,000](https://x.com/beefwellingtoni/status/1755596697957195920)\n\n[Demand will be pretty high, likely above 10k units yearly. They have capacity to produce 8k but can move up to 40k if needed](https://twitter.com/beefwellingtoni/status/1755430644098670788). In addition to being popular with civilian doctors, the [US Military and Armed Forces of Ukraine](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-medicine-blood-vessel-technology-ukraine-saving-lives/) are also interested in this technology. \n\n[The median price to sales ratio for biotech firms producing biological implants is 14.7](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1039195519068668035/1246285937835642900/image.webp?ex=665c7e7a&is=665b2cfa&hm=e499d3c5501ed9cf610c8adcc291d7a2082c67975a4b1764a6c2cbff14dd2972&)\n\nTherefore: Conservative revenue estimate of $200MM * 14.7 = $2.9 billion dollar valuation or just under $30 per share. \n\nThe stock has pretty high retail ownership % due to congress tracking accounts posting about the stock, expect some volatility before the PDUFA date due to that fact. However, there is something more here than just Tommy Tuberville buying some shares. The ex CEO of AMGN who sits on the board of HUMA [bought 100k shares](https://twitter.com/RevShark/status/1790890188954321246) just after the run from $4.5 to $6.5. Tuberville also timed his trades quite poorly if you actually look at it. I doubt he has access to any information that isn't already publicly available. \n\nThe FDA Approval date is set for August 10th. \n\nIf you're curious about the most recent dump from $10 to $7.5, the CEO's husband sold 1 million shares. I literally don't care about the 40% daily loss though, im holding until December. \n\n[My positions](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1224214916412739617/1246561639109759179/positions.png?ex=665cd67e&is=665b84fe&hm=2ba64d4457b8327bf8a73a78ef5cf6ce6df95fffc9b3acab9ad3af4dd7db432b&)",

Better bang for your buck - a better PDUFA play right now.",
