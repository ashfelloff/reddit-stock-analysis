  "title": "All-In on Tech: Why I Just Invested $2.1 Million in a Single ETF",
  "score": 1737,
  "selftext": "Hello Fellow Investors, I Need Your Advice!\n\nRecently, my parents sold their house and entrusted me with managing the proceeds. I've just started exploring the U.S. stock market, and I'm a firm believer that technology is the future. Since tech can't thrive without semiconductors, I found the SMH ETF.\n\nThe holdings in SMH are nothing short of a \"dream team\" in the tech industry: NVIDIA, TSMC, ASML, AMD, and other semiconductor giants. In my opinion, investing in an ETF like this is better than betting heavily on a single stock, as it offers diversification without missing out on growth opportunities.\n\nThat's why I've decided to go all-in with $2.1 million and invest it entirely in SMH, with a long-term horizon of 10 to 20 years, following a value investing approach.\n\nHowever, this is just my initial thought, and I would greatly appreciate any advice or feedback from experienced investors. Are there any better strategies or considerations I might be overlooking? Thank you!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9i1ho67ov1kd1.png?width=1633&format=png&auto=webp&s=5bf00847cad46963d47d5d1dfdbcfffea4b093f6\n\n",

On the historic lifetime average of 8% gains which is like…actually a really safe bet, you’d be making $168,000 a year which would allow you to be super aggressive in building a property portfolio to then build a guaranteed income stream from renting. You say that you have a 10 to 20 year scope, but you also sound new to investing and when the market downturn comes and the PE ratios of companies like NVDA come back down to planet earth, you’ll be looking at hundreds and hundreds of thousands of unrealised losses before you ever see green again. You haven’t guaranteed yourself an income stream. With 2.1 million, you don’t need to be aggressive to build portfolio wealth. Not financial advice but I’d seriously consider taking it all back out and putting it in something safer and less prone to losing hundreds of thousands in a bubble burst event.
