I was broke and in Thailand, and because of the time difference and partying I had purchased $2500 on a Wednesday of what I thought was Tesla call options that expired Friday (2 days later). The next day my drunk ass was staggering around playing with this Russia girl I met and the next thing I know etrAde is blowing me up, calling back to back to back, and this had never happened so In my mind I thought “I’m fuc*ed”, something bad has happened and they want their money. I didn’t have access to my app because of the cost of data, so I didn’t know what the hell was going on. I answered and it was etrAde support asking me what the hell I wanted to do with my Tesla options. \n\n\nLet’s rewind: \nI said I was broke, and I was. I had like 23k to my name. And I had made almost all of that on a Lululemon puts a month or two before where I spent like $500 on a ton of otm contracts and that $500 turned into 23k in 20 seconds when their stock plummeted from 70 down to like 45 after bad earnings. (Just had a feeling 😉)\n\nSo I took my ass and my new found wealth of $23k to Thailand for a month lolz \n\nSo I am in Thailand, and that’s why when I say I was broke I still threw $2500 like a dumb ass into an OTM telsa calls that expired that week. I thought I had 2 days instead of 1, and I was willing to lose half the money on a gamble. And I’ll be damn if I didn’t get my days wrong, and etrAde was blowing me up as said, and the conversation went something like. \n\n“you need to deposit a half million dollars in the next couple hours if you want to exercise your position”. Drunk and confused as hell, I was terrified. And I wasn’t understanding. \n\nI was like “how did I lose all my money, the contract doesn’t blah blah blah” and that’s when they said sir, your position is currently up $60,000+ on the day and it expires at market close today. So you either need wire and exercise very quickly, or sell your options and take your profits.\n\nUmm, did you just say I am up $60,000 on the day? \n\nThem: Yes, actually now your up almost $70k. \n\nMe: Please sell all my options right meow! \n\nThey did, and I went and got to an Internet cafe, and that’s when I was able to go online and see what the hell happened. Tesla has announced their semi trucks, and hit a mini lottery being a drunk degenerate in Thailand. \n\nThat was the 2 months where I turned $500 into almost $100k on two bets. Lululemon OTM puts on bad earnings and my options went from .11 to $12-$14. \n\nThen the Tesla play you heard. Sorry, I have ADHD if this doesn’t make any sense.  \n\nNever had a run like that since! If you go back and look at the Lululemon where it tanked from $72 to $45 after bad earnings, you will be able to verify my story. \n\nthis all happened in March-April 2016",

                  "body": "Sure. In trading there is going long (buying) and going short (selling). When you buy a long call with $50, you are betting $50 that stock is going to go up. If you buy a long put with $50, you are betting $50 that the stock is gonna go down. There is some more complicated stuff that calculates price based on the stock movement, but thats the basic of it. When you are ready to sell your long call or sell your long put, you are closing the position, which is essentially the opposite of your first trade. Buy to open, sell to close. When you do this, you have risk DEFINED. You can NEVER lose more than the $50 you are putting in. Thats why risk is the premium (money) you paid. Its like buying a lottery ticket, you spend $2, you cannot lose more than $2, but you can make more money if you win.\n\nSelling to open, and buying to close, is a different animal completely. Thats shorting options. Your risk becomes completely different. Dont fuck with those if you dont know whays going on. Most brokerages wont even let you make a position like this. It will deny the order because you dont have the collateral.\n\nStick with simple. Long call (buy a call) or long put (buy a put). Then you can sell it for a gain or loss. And you can never lose more money than you put in.",
