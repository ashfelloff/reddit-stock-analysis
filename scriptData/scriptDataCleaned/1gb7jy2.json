Missed mobile, missed ai, not going anywhere in gpus, no breakthroughs in manufacturing, lost leadership in cpus.\n\nThey just keep piling what cash flow they have into all sorts of things playing catch up on all fronts. In tech the rule is winner takes all and nobody wants to buy the third best processor or ai chips with a half assed software stack.\n\nArrow lake was supposed to be their big cpu turnaround and it turned out to be an expensive, low margin shitshow that has a hard time competing with their own products from 2 generations ago. The upcoming class action lawsuits from dying raptor lake cpus could push the stock price down enough that some investor can pick up a majority of shares, break it up and save what value is left in this dumpsterfire.",
