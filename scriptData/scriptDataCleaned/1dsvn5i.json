      "body": "V. Bullish on RKLB. They've been quietly acquiring satellite manufacturing companies for the past few years and they've already paid off their acquisition costs in new revenue that's been generated. When virgin galactic fell out of the sky they bought their manufacturing facilities for something like a 90pc discount. They're now a space prime that can build your satellite, launch it, and operate it for you as a service. Launch is now only a third of their revenue (which will change a bit when neutron starts launching, but not by much). They're a major manufacturer and supplier of space based solar, microchips, satellite thrusters, communication lasers, etc. etc. they're one of the few fully vertically integrated space companies in the world.\n\nGovernment contracts? Look at the [space development agency](https://open.substack.com/pub/caseclosed/p/stars-stripes-and-satellites?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=39s0pp). Billions in funding every year into the 2030s, RKLB has already secured its place as a prime and will receive 500m. New contracts announced all the time. \n\nCommercial contracts? There's  389  [mega constellations ](https://www.newspace.im/) in development. Satellites in LEO last 5 ish years before deorbiting, or their tech becomes redundant so they need replacing anyway, it's a huge market that is not going away and will continue to grow. \n\nRocket labs long term plan is to build their own megaconstellations , launch them, and sell services direct to businesses on earth. If earth observation or earth communication looks profitable, RocketLab can and will pivot to build and launch their own satellites. It's a huge huge huge opportunity.\n\nThey have something like 2bn in backlog orders today, their CFO says this will double in 2025. Their market cap is only barely above 2bn. It's insane how much of a bargain they are right now. If you can stomach being kicked in the teeth during inevitable neutron development delays they could 10x and still only be a tenth of SpaceX's market cap.\n\nPositions: 7.5k shares at average price of 4.50.

Thoughts:\n\nOne can say it's early days, but the launch market at least seems fairly crowded.\n\nLaunch services reward not only cost but (and sometimes especially) reliability. Tough to establish reliability when you're a new entrant - which puts even more pressure on margins.\n\nThis is a complex technology area that is replete with examples of stuff... just not working.  For extended periods of time. Sometimes almost inexplicably. Nowadays, how much capital can you afford to burn on the launch pad while competitors are launching rockets?  It's 2024, not 2002.\n\nGrowth in the demand for services looks tough to predict; long-term oversupply potential seems strong (bad news if your rockets are just proving their reliability around the time the market starts to get saturated...): [https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/space-launch-are-we-heading-for-oversupply-or-a-shortfall](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/aerospace-and-defense/our-insights/space-launch-are-we-heading-for-oversupply-or-a-shortfall)\n\nI think the market will want (if only for geopolitical reasons) some diversification but I could also easily see this entire industry consolidating around a handful of players with just about every other entrant going bankrupt or scrapping for undesirable, low margin business. Maybe Rocketlab will be one of the winners. Maybe...  But I think anyone investing in this industry better have skin like rocket ablative tiles.",

Just look at the first launch of a new rocket by other startup companies: Starship - blew up after 5 minutes, Firefly Alpha - blew up, ABL RS1 - blew up, Astra Rocket 3 - failed (several times), Relativity Space Terran 1 - failed, and their own Electron also blew up (although it was a ground software failure). \n\nI believe RKLB will dump on the news, even if Neutron gets relatively far into the launch (see LUNR).
