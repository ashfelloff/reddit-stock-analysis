Short Squeeze to the Moon!!! \n\nIt helps that this is a solid company with solid leadership!\n\nIt was shorted due to it being a SPAC but they didn't realize it was one of the few legit SPACs. If you research the people, the tech, and the plan, you will see the potential.\n\nI have a feeling they will work with Tesla in India on battery manufacturing.",
