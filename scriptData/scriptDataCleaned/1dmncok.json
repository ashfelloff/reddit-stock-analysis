I also believe that service module is built by L3 Harris not Boeing but I could be wrong. There is no actual threat of the astronauts being stranded or to their ability to return to earth safely(at least regarding the leak that is currently delaying their departure). They are extending the trip so they can figure out what the root cause is so they can perform corrective actions to prevent this on future flights. Nasa is very heavily involved in validating the engineering that goes into any commercial craft that they put their astronauts on. That approval process can even go down to the very individual components that may have non-conformance from the suppliers.",

The selection of Starliner for CCP given literally double the budget than Dragon 2 was the reason that Dream Chaser/Sierra Nevada contested the selection in court. It's only because of Boeings/ULA's pull that they got selected over Dream Chaser, which had far more novel and scientific value than just another capsule.  \n\nDragon 2 despite having off the top of my head, 9 more missions added to their contract, has only just taken over the original Boeing bid cost of 4.2 bill. So Boeing probably still made money off this fuckfest.",
