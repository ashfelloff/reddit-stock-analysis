              "body": "Not entirely true. The Feds can devalue the currency, for example, printing money like there's no tomorrow with $40 trillion in debt, cutting taxes for Bezos, Buffets, Gates and corporate tax rates further ballooning the money supply, giving billions in corporate bailouts. These are inflationary effects on a *currency* of course.\n\nInflation itself (particularly CPI etc) is measured of what consumers are paying for various things.  The Feds aren't the ones raising rents on tenants, they aren't they ones charging $6.99 for a McDouble, they aren't the ones jacking up health-care premiums, they aren't the  ones tripling Auto Insurance rates.\n\nNow currency devaluating effects also are loosely coupled with market inflation, but it's not 1:1 relation, not even close. Maybe like 0.3:1 or something.  And it certainly doesn't originate from the Feds because....\n\nReminder: one man's inflation is another corporations increased revenue (and by proxy: stock buybacks, dividends, big C-suite compensation packages).  Corporations are reporting ATH on profits, beating quarter-over-quarter, while inflation is soaring, these are directly coupled together. Corporations would not be having ATH profits, lucrative buybacks and billions in executive compensation if they weren't 'inflating' their prices.\n\nBut like everything, it's a complex web. There's no binary black & whites.  Certainly there is an effect from how money supply is handled, but there's also even more of an effect that companies need to keep beating expectations and trying to keep rate of profit increasing every year.  Because that's what they're supposed to do is maximize shareholder value (which explicitly means high inflation experienced by the consumers).\n\nThis is the main reason Feds will not get \"inflation is under control\" like they keep looking for. 3.5% y/o/y may very well be the new normal.",
