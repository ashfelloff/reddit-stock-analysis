      "body": "Futures contracts and options are the best and safest way to trade. Market is open 23 hours a day, no pattern day trading rules, and you need fewer contracts or options to hit it big with defined risk. 2 ES options equals 10 SPY options in terms of gain/loss for the same risk.\n\nMy trade today was the calls for a total of $1100, which I sold for $6200. The math gets really fun when you start doing 4, 6, 8, and 10 options ($5000 turns into $35000 and all you need is to be on the right side of the range to grab about 50-65 points of ES movement (average range the last week or so is 100+).",
