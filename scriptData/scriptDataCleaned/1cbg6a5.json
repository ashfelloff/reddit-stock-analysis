The performance metrics he was required to hit were seen as impossible; literally, every commentator and WS insider talked about how it was impossible. Fast forward to 2023 and Elon 10x’ed the company. Share price went up over 1,000% between 2018 and 2023. Tesla went from 100,000 cars per year, to nearly 2 million. They went from $20b in revenue to $96b. They went from losing $1b a year, to $15b in net income. They have $29b cash on hand. He successfully launched the model 3 and cyber truck. Refined the production process. steered Tesla to being one of the most valuable companies in the world. Everyone is entitled to their own wrong opinions, but facts are facts. Love him or hate him, what he did at Tesla between 2018 a 2023 was nothing short of incredible. It’s unfortunate that this has all become so political.",

Tesla’s success between 2018 and 2023 was nothing short of miraculous and he made his SH’s incredibly rich. He also took a huge risk, he took no salary. His comp was entirely performance based. Had he failed, he’d get nothing. If Elon sued because the company went bankrupt, Would the judge have ruled the same way and overturned his comp package? Would he be entitled to back pay? Who knows. Fact is, he hit his benchmarks. So I’ll be voting in favor of his new comp package.",
