  "selftext": "Intel shares slid 10% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker said Thursday it would lay off over 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost reduction plan and reported lighter results than analysts had envisioned. Intel also said it would not pay its dividend in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared to LSEG analyst expectations:\n\nEarnings per share: 2 cents adjusted vs. 10 cents expected\nRevenue: $12.83 billion vs. $12.94 billion expected\nIntel’s revenue declined 1% year over year in the quarter, which ended on June 29, according to a statement. The company had a $1.61 billion net loss, or 38 cents per share, compared with net income of $1.47 billion, or 35 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe company’s Client Computing Group that makes PC chips contributed $7.41 billion in revenue, up 9% and right around the $7.42 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nIntel’s Data Center and Artificial Intelligence unit posted $3.05 billion in revenue. The result was down 3% and lower than the $3.14 billion StreetAccount consensus.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, Intel called for an adjusted net loss of 3 cents per share on $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion in revenue. The LSEG consensus was adjusted net earnings of 31 cents per share and $14.35 billion in revenue.\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel announced that Apollo would invest $11 billion in a joint venture around a chip manufacturing plant in Ireland. The company also introduced Xeon 6 server processors, along with a Gaudi 3 accelerator for artificial intelligence workloads.\n\nIn addition, Intel disclosed in May that the U.S. Commerce Department was revoking export licenses for consumer items to a customer in China, widely believed to be Huawei. Intel said second-quarter revenue would still be in its previously announced range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, but below the middle of the range.\n\nExcluding the after-hours move, Intel stock has lost 42% of its value so far this year, while the S&P 500 index is up almost 14% in the same period.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/01/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024.html",

Historically, there are plenty of 10 year windows where little to negative was made. Even after 20 years, 10% a year is just the average or mean return. You could end up with 5% or less a year return or 15% a year. Nothing is a guaranteed.",

Now AMD and NVDA have been eating their lunch since 2012 and they’re struggling to advance their processes and become relevant in the chip manufacturing and data centers. They’re aggressively cost cutting and dumping as much money as they can into fabs and new nodes to try and catch up. Might be too little too late but time will tell. \n\nIt’s hated right now because it’s a tough turn around. You cant turn around a massive ship like Intel very fast and it’s questionable right now if it can be turned around at all. \n\nI have a relatively small position myself as a moonshot turn around play.

They are evolving themselves to become viable in the future. Cutting the dividend and trimming G&A is exactly what they need to be doing right now.

My bet is Intel becomes a major player as we head towards the 2030s, so I'm keeping some skin in the game with them.\n\nThere's every possibility this becomes a $1T company by 2030, which would be a 10-bagger from here (CAGR of ~50% depending on time period used).
