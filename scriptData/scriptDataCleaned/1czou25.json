Roark capital knew the acquisition wasn‚Äôt going to be profitable but bought it to pair along side their other restaurants in preparation of going public.¬†\n\nSonic, Arby‚Äôs, BWW, jimmy johns, dunkin, and now Subway make a pretty formidable opponent for YUM brands.¬†\n\nHow cava fits into this equation outside of this basket of restaurants is confusing.

          "body": "As I mentioned to someone else below, CAVA's high current PE with a Future PE that is more than half of what it is currently, may indicate investors are flocking to this asset because they find it a safe long term investment and willing to overpay with the expectation that earnings will eventually meet more closely with price. They aren't in every state and have lots of room to expand. The health food industry continues to become more in demand as consumers are looking for alternatives to the existing fast food. Mediterranean is a niche market that many consumers are seeking to eat more of, but are struggling to find restaurants that cater to that menu, or the ability to prepare it themselves. \n\nIn my opinion, consumers will continue to demand this food long term - unlike subway, one of many sub companies (Firehouse Subs, Quizno's Subs, Jersey Mikes, Blimpi's, and the list goes on), CAVA is unique to its market and can take the lion's share of the market instantly.",

Especially considering how bad the quality of food and lack of protions have gotten and its starting to annoy customers, who will look towards the next \"chipotle\" style fast food. Cava is growing at a fast rate and I under the price is overvauled right now, but in the long term i can see it being as big as chipotle. Also as a side note they keep changing their menu seasonally, so it'll always attract new customers.",
