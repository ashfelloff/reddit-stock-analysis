I knew this quarter is usually the worst for Lamb Weston and given the bad prior quarter and the fact that restaurant volume has been soft and their retail products always seem fully stocked, sounded like a prime opportunity.\n\nHad 80 options and turned roughly 10k into 80k, could have been more but I sold the first two chunks at open and held the third for after the call.\n\nWould be worth even more now, but figured that kind of return was good enough for a weekly gain.",
