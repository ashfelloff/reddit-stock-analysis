Maybe it can run to 55… 60x but man, that is a lot of future growth they need to grow into.\n\nLot of hate on TSMC but I shifted there today. If money moves out of NVDA, I suspect it will somewhat land on AI supply chain. Plus, TSMC forward PE is only 28x and they release revenue for April and May that are well above Q2 expectations. I suspect they have some pricing power too.\n\nI know, I know… China! But guess what happens to NVDA or even Apple if China attacked Taiwan. So same risk there too.",
