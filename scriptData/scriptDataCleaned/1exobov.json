But why is CostCo so expensive?\n\nThe only thing that can rationnaly justify a high P/E is high growth. There's no way CostCo get the sheer organic growth of NVidia in the future. \n\nI'm no stock picker, that's why I'm asking. It seems to be an american specificity that you wouldn't find in European markets, for instance. ",

According to a report, Costco’s shrinkage rate is between **0.1% and 0.2%**¹²³, which is significantly less than the nationwide average of **1.44% to 1.6%**¹². Shrinkage in retail refers to inventory loss due to factors like damage, theft, or administrative errors.\n\nThe reasons for Costco’s lower shrinkage rate include:\n- The warehouse-style layout with a single entry and exit point¹².\n- The membership-based business model requiring a picture ID for entry¹².\n\nIn contrast, other retailers have experienced higher rates of shrinkage, with theft accounting for a substantial portion of retail shrink¹². For example, Target and Walmart have faced challenges with rising theft and crime, leading to store closures in some cases¹². Costco’s effective strategies have helped it maintain a lower shrinkage rate compared to its peers.\n\nSource: Conversation with Copilot, 8/24/2024\n(1) Costco is winning the war against retail shrink, boasts it ... - MoneyWise. https://moneywise.com/news/top-stories/costco-is-winning-the-war-against-retail-theft-as-target-and-walmart-shutter-stores-across-US.\n(2) Costco is winning the war against retail theft, boasts it’s ‘not a big .... https://finance.yahoo.com/news/costco-winning-war-against-retail-120000001.html.\n(3) Why Costco Takes Shoplifting So Seriously: An In-Depth Look. https://www.marketingscoop.com/consumer/costco-shoplifting-policy/.\n(4) Why Costco’s Avoided Major Retail Theft Unlike Target, Walmart .... https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/why-costcos-avoided-major-retail-theft-unlike-target/462917.",

          "body": "Absolutely this.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that p/e is just *not* the end-all, be-all. Costco and Nvidia trade at somewhat similar p/e ratios, but their p/s ratios are vastly different. Nvidia sports a truly eye-popping 40x(is) sales which is insane and reflects insane margins. Costco trades at a very cheap 1.5x sales so there's some theoretical incremental improvement that could happen there to drive the p/e substantially lower. I don't know if Costco is a margin story or not but I've seen it plenty of times that people complain about p/e when p/s and improving margins are the story, not trailing p/e. Amazon is a great example. Even over the last couple of years, I've seen Amazon without a p/e. One COULD have assumed it was way too expensive to buy. It's p/s though was insanely cheap for such a quality company. The margin improvement was dramatic and the stock was rewarded. Remember, forward p/e is very important, not just trailing, especially with companies that are diversified with lots of levers to pull. Using trailing p/e exclusively is like something to use for old-economy stocks or something, idk. I remember when I first got into investing and I let trailing p/e guide me and I made a lot of mistakes in doing so. Forward expectations are vital in this game, absolutely vital. Trailing performance is only important insomuch as it instills confidence or, on the other hand, skepticism on ability to execute towards those forward goals.",

I see the same people checking and managing at my local store month after month and year after year. Costco isn't just a good company in the sense of being well-run; it's a good company that does right by its employees and customers which is how they've developed such a successful business.
