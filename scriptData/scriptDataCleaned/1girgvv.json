I got a dividend a month ago for $163 bucks; that's $1.63 a share.\n\n[This page](https://www.dividend.com/etfs/voo-vanguard-s-p-500-etf/) shows 1.23% (and shows a yield of $6.50), and [this page](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/voo-dividend) shows a dividend of $1.64 a share (accurate to what actually happened above).\n\nI don't understand the discrepancy. The share price is 525 right now, but let's pretend it was lower; 1.22% of 500 is 6.1 dollars. Why wasn't my dividend 650 bucks? Why does that site show that the per share dividend is $1.64 and not over $6?\n\nedit: okay I didn't realize that the dividend I got was a quarterly one and therefore 1/4 of the yield rate I've been seeing.",

I simply didn't know that the dividend amount was measured as yearly (I assumed monthly) and that the amounts were arbitrary (I believe they were based on economic performance of the underlying security).\n\nSo, no, I was not blindly throwing money around.",
