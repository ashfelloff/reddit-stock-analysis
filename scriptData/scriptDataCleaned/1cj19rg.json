I would seriously consider a Tiktok acquisition if i were Tim Cook (then build on that ecosystem with financial services tied in with social media.  Realize Elon Musk's wet dream but in a lucrative way-  make it into a true 'super app.')  On the automotive front they should have acquired an auto company and offered Tesla like 'auto pilot' but refined in the true Apple way.
