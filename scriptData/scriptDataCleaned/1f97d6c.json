  "selftext": "\n\nNvidia¬†on Wednesday denied reports it received a subpoena from the Department of Justice over antitrust concerns.\n\n‚ÄúWe have inquired with the U.S. Department of Justice and have not been subpoenaed,‚Äù an Nvidia representative told CNBC. ‚ÄúNonetheless, we are happy to answer any questions regulators may have about our business.‚Äù\n\nBloomberg reported Tuesday that Nvidia had received a subpoena, causing the stock to¬†[slip in after-hours trading](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/03/nvidia-slides-in-post-market-trading-after-drop-wiped-out-300-billion.html). The chipmaker‚Äôs shares had already given up nearly 10% during regular trading Tuesday.\n\nWhile the report did not specify a reason for regulators to be interested in Nvidia, the company‚Äôs recent rise has been directly tied to its dominance in artificial intelligence chips for data centers years before competitors¬†AMD¬†and¬†Intel¬†started taking the category seriously.\n\nNvidia has more than 80% of the data center AI chip market, according to industry estimates.\n\nNvidia ‚Äúwins on merit, as reflected in our benchmark results and value to customers, and customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,‚Äù Nvidia told CNBC.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/nvidia-says-it-didnt-receive-antitrust-subpoena-from-doj.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/04/nvidia-says-it-didnt-receive-antitrust-subpoena-from-doj.html)",

The first they even heard of the subpoena was from the news so they had to check with *EVERYONE* to make sure they didn't actually get one.\n\nA company like NVidia probably has hundreds of attorneys on staff and they rely on a pile of external firms for things. It's possible that one attorney who happened to be on vacation is the one who received the subpoena. Or it's even possible that the government delivered it to a receptionist at their HQ who had no idea what to do with it. But what really happened is that they never got one. But like I said, it takes time to verify - you need to track down everyone who might have got one, and also the DoJ, to figure out that you didn't actually get one.",

Hell, you could make the case that CIDs are \"stronger\" than the subpoenas issued during the course of court proceedings (i.e. discovery requests), because you don't need to bring a claim to be able to send a CID. And it is basically impossible to fight a CID.\n\nA CID is something you send *before* filing a lawsuit. So, while you're not in court yet, that means you have fewer tools with which to fight a CID. You can't argue to the judge that the request is overbroad or irrelevant to the case, because there is no judge. Nor are there any rules of evidence that apply.
