  "selftext": "Walgreens down astronomical levels of bad today after announcement of large store closures nationwide. Currently sitting at -25.19% on the day. Stock hasn't been this low since its initial climb back in 1997. Now the question is, is it worth getting into bed with $WBA or are companies like Amazon and CVS sending them to the grave? Interested to hear your thoughts below. ",

Walgreens has a good business model and they cover their niche well, however, I work in a family owned retail pharmacy and I cannot tell you how many times a week someone comes in with a bad taste in their mouth from walgreens, riteaid, or cvs. It feels like a shift is happening wherein younger generations are beginning to value customer service and going the extra mile a tad more.

It is not like you just stop buying when you are short on cash. Furthermore there are not that many big players in the market so I considered competition is not to strong. However, there were some warnings about the growth of the companies. But all in all it seemed there are more positive points than negative ones and according to my quantitative analysis the company already had a discount. I really was about to buy some stocks but when I took a second look  and even though there were no revenue and profit warnings from WBA itself back then I couldn't really imagine this company to thrive with such a \"lame\" business model. I thought why investing in a company  that lacks behind in online sales and has to keep up thousands of stores around the country when new players can basically just send goods from the warehouses to their customers. \nWhat I want so say is: The company missed huge parts of digital transformation and is to big to catch up fast enough to not lose major market share. And til now I don't see any signs that this will change. Means, if you buy shit cheap you still only bought shit.\n\nEdit: typo",

Massive overhead and brick & mortar spaces, dying stores, insanely overpriced front-of-store doodads that not even the most senile grannnys will buy treats there, massive braindrain and pharm techs refuse to work there, huge employee turnover constantly, failing to fill prescriptions writ large.  It's done 🍴. CVS isn't far behind it in dying too.\n\nBuy $COST if you want to invest in pharmacy, literally impossible to lose money on it.",
