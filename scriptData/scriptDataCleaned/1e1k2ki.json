These people traced every line by hand, separated and built colors with pre-built halftone screens. Ooof\n\nThen came Apple, imagesetters, drum scanners (these things were as big as cars folks...Fuji made a bunch). Then we got Corel Draw, Freehand, PAGEMAKER! Oh the days. Corel was a sack of crap, and Freehand made masks and groups of everything.....FUUUUKKKKKK. \n\nThen is 1995-96 I touched my FIRST version of Photoshop...1.7J. That's right bitches, like 30, 1.44MB floppy discs. ALL on a Quadra 650 Mac with 3MB of RAM, and 250 MB of platter spinning HD madness.\n\nAdobe did great stuff for Graphic design and Print in general. I mean there is a lot Adobe does, and does well. Perhaps they should look back at QuarkXpress. Quark was a lot like Adobe is now. They had their heads in the air and were not really looking to 'pivot'. Adobe pivoted and came out on top. Sadly the cost mongering is going to be their demise. People are just tired of it. We all know we're being raked over the coals so to speak.",

Went on to operate imagesetters, color seps, Shockwave CD-ROMs, Flash sites… and an endless parade of shit I would learn to address the needs of the day.\n\nNow my career is built atop Adobe’s whole stack with lots of motion work inside the rotting space shuttle that is After Effects.\n\nMeanwhile, the FAANG creatives I work across went heavy into Figma as their primary workspace. And it’s awesome, except it was built to do appy/webby things, and feels at odds with its own success. There’s specific production demands it neglects, and good luck bringing in non-creatives if you’re using it as a repo of any kind.\n\nI feel like the industry is at a crossroads. There’s so many foundational things PSD and AI address that can’t be easily replaced. But also the things they do specifically well are things that are becoming edge cases as print and non-screen media continue to die off.\n\nThen you have Premiere and AE that are juggernauts, but also *three decades old* and still built on that foundation.\n\nTo make matters more difficult — the entire profession writ large is under price stress. The AOR model is dying. Clients expect incredible results as design shops race to the bottom.\n\nIn a way, I feel like the future trend may continue to tilt in Adobe’s favor, but with prices adjusted to accept the business reality. What remains to be seen is if Adobe’s 1990s approach to software can maintain its de facto dominance at the student level. I can’t pretend to know.",
