      "body": "Banking is built on confidence.  If depositors are not confident their money is safe, they will pull it out of the bank.  This causes the bank to have to raise money as they don't have the cash on hand to give to the fleeing customers.  To raise money, they sell the bonds they have on the books and if that is done at a discount, they realize losses that they otherwise would not have realized if they held the bonds to term.  Pretty soon you have a bank failure of a bank that otherwise would have been fine if people didn't pull their money.\n\nBanks argue to regulatory agencies to not telegraph there are problems because it can create the situation above.",

And the capital they do have is tied up in bonds that are sitting a mile underwater. These guys are way out over their skis.\n\nIn the US, the Fed basically de-risked this by printing money to buy back banks' ZIRP-era bond trash at par value. I'll bet the ECB will do something similar if push comes to shove.",
