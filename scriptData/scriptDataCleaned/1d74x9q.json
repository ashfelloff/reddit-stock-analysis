  "selftext": "I just noticed this little gem in the earnings docket for this week.\n\nWhat is BASE? It's another oldschool NVP (Name-Value-Pair) database. It's basically the Kirkland brand version of MDB which aims down-market.\n\nWhy am I bearish on it?\n\nMDB ate shit this ER, and BASE is an even shittier company which isn't profitable and 1/20th the market cap. Looking at BASE's chart, I think its price will return to support at $15 soon and expect a big downwards move after ER.\n\nNow, the only problem with shorting it is low liquidity on the options contracts. They only have monthly's, and volume's are low, so the bid/ask spreads are wide. Gotta be careful putting you orders in / don't just buy at market price or the market makers will eat you alive.\n\nPosition: 50 puts $20 strike for Jun 21.\n\n[position](https://preview.redd.it/g2jk3jt73d4d1.png?width=2082&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb350dc0efdd30b6a6848f274b91f91eb3fb8d5d)\n\n",
