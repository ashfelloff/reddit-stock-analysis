The russell rally gives me hope we can see a broader cut rally but I'm not that hopeful for the immediate market reaction.",

Its the number 1 reason many retail investors fail at stock investing.\n\nThe price of a stock or the market depends on three main markers: (1) current stockprice versus company earnings (P/E ratio) (2) company stability and (3) future growth. Thats it. A company can have grown for 60 years straight, if the future earnings are still higher, thus pushing the P/E ratio lower, the market will buy and the stock price will increase. \n\nNow where prices of stocks really screw up, is when humans try to predict the future.
