I‚Äôve lost 13k over the last 12 months while basically every stock has gone to ATH. Like hard NOT to make money. \n\nIf you‚Äôve maxed your Roth this year (7k) then sure have fun. But that 10,000 you just lost could‚Äôve been 100,000 in 15 or 20 years.\n\nI had a friend who is kind of a streets guy and I was talking to him about it.. he said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fighting from your back‚Äù‚Ä¶. Which is exactly what I was doing. To sum that up, BECAUSE you‚Äôre down this amount and saying ‚Äúhow do I recover‚Äù you‚Äôre already in the wrong state of mind. In my experience it only caused me to take quicker and riskier positions without thinking them through. \n\nI wish you the best of luck, but I work outside in Florida to earn my money.
