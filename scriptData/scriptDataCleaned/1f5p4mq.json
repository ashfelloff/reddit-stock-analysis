  "title": "What if Warren Buffett is winding up Berkshire Hathaway? ",
  "score": 357,
  "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway stock selling is been assumed to be because he's fallen out of love with certain stocks (Apple) or because he wants to build up a cash reserve to take advantage of a predicted crash in the market but what if he's selling up to sell up? Berkshire Hathaway is a company that core competencies has increasingly been overshadowed by its CEOs investment gains in partially owned stock - its price going up on the news that its holding so much in T-bills shows how the price might be being distorted by \"buffett magic.\" Market confidence that he can predict a change in the market and that he will be able to time that and exploit it for higher profit with a large cash reserve buoying the price even if the underlying value hasn't change.  $277 billion is an insane amount of cash to hand and it being news probably wouldn't boost the share value for many other CEOs or companies if the source was the same.\n\nIf you're a value investor that should concern you- maybe it concerns him as well- if his value is tied up in Hathaway stock and Hathaway stock is overpriced based on his own continued existence what happens to the stock value when he hands over the company, or dies? Would the market react the same way to learning that Greg Abel has $277bn in cash reserves to potentially invest with? Any other company can fall back on its business model to show potential future revenue when the CEO moves on- but the market value of Berkshire Hathaway stock is no longer in the business model of the companies it runs as a conglomerate- its in only having paid a single dividend since 1965 and reinvesting that money wherever they could if the business they directly controlled couldn't take the investment and Warren and Charlie being able to pick more winners than losers.\n\nHis business partner of 60 years died last year, he's 94 years old, he's a value investor- instead of cashing out of the stock market because he's eager for another round of further investments what if he continues cashing out all of the partially owned businesses that have so overshadowed the core business in the last couple of decades so he can spin off the operating parts of Berkshire Hathaway into businesses that's value isn't at least partially dependent on him living forever as its CEO? Either that or just selling all the partially owned stock that doesn't fall under the conglomerate and paying out a monster dividend so that when he goes and the slight mania of annual shareholder meetings dies down there is still a core value-focused business there to focus on. The guy who he's picked to replace him is much more of a CEO type than an investment management type- was an energy CEO for a company Berkshire bought out in the 2000s. \n\nWhat would you do if this was the case? If he was unwinding his whole market position for at least all the partially owned stock?\n\n",

In terms of the publicly traded stock Berkshire Hathaway owns he sold \\~15% of it in a quarter- I doubt he could have sold more without spooking a lot of people.   \n\nHe hasn't sold any Wholly owned subsidiaries because he is focused on growing operating profit- ie the profit made from the business directly owned and operated within his Conglomerate- he's (potentially) unwinding the investment portfolio of companies that Berkshire Hathaway doesn't manage.",
