Does LULU have the same faith as NKE after earning? They shit the bed last time. I was expecting this time will be better and in fact it will go up but after seeing NKE, I am no longer confident. Anyone playing earning for LULU? Itâ€™s trading at the lowest and just want to know whatâ€™s the consensus here. ",

Lulu and Nike have different customer base especially on male/female ratio and towards athleisure. LULUâ€™s growth in NA is moderating but international has a ton of room to expand.

          "body": "Nike needs to fix their quality problem. I have some Lulu sweats, quality is excellent, Nike, this stuff is like, maybe Walmart quality, maybe Target? Somewhere below Adidas. Shoes, same thing, they have been skating on the name and fashion for too long. The quality Nike had years ago has vanished. I can't imagine it would cost them not much more to actually just make decent products, maybe that's the turnaround play? Story is starting to remind me of Intel though. Got sloppy being in the lead, now management is panicking, time will tell how long it takes Nike to get out of the rut\n\nI think there's also a different customer base between these two and it's not so much what you're packing between your legs, it's what you're packing in your bank account. Lulu customers for the most part, at least from what I can tell, they make bank. Nike on the other hand, I don't really have to finish that sentence ðŸ˜‚",
