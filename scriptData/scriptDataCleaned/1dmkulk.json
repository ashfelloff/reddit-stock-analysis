      "body": "So there are a couple problems with this.\n\nThe whole point of a stop loss is to avoid trading emotionally and to exit quickly if your idea is invalidated. You exit the stock at a stop loss and don‚Äôt rebuy. If you are constantly looking for points to rebuy at, you‚Äôre going to become more emotional and more likely to make mistakes. \n\nIt requires constant attention. You‚Äôll say you‚Äôll rebuy at -20%, it will go to -12% and shoot to plus 20%. Now you‚Äôre missing out. You fomo in, it dips again. Emotion builds.\n\nPlus, if it moves outside of trading hours, then stop loss will trigger at open and you‚Äôll end up -20% anyway. Then it bounces to -7% and the internal screaming intensifies.\n\nIt‚Äôs much better to just hold it until your idea is either actualized or invalidated. If your idea is invalidated at a set price, set a stop loss and if it triggers, look for a different opportunity.",
