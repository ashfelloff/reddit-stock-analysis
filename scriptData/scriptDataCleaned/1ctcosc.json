It should also be noted that Intel's semi recent history doesn't imply that they'd do this (slow EUV adoption)\n\n\nIntel still has a lot of cash to burn now with all of the construction, but once that ends, there will be lots of upside to see how Intel plays in the foundry business.\n\n\nIntel is also insulated from risk by simply not being in Taiwan. A certain announcement from China could drop TSMC to the ground and cause Intel's stock price to multiply overnight. I'm interested in grabbing intel shares in the near future, but I don't anticipate any sharp rises soon.",
