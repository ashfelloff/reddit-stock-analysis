This is not 2008 and I think DG is fucked (and good riddance). \n\nJust the fact that price discovery is so much easier now with online shopping makes their business model tenuous, yeah you might be poor but when you can compare products on the shitter you have an easier time realizing DG is butt fucking your wallet and even if it costs too much gas to drive to the nearest Walmart a town over you can order most shit to your house at no extra cost with a small minimum order size. Even the most economically challenged can avoid paying DG’s poverty tax these days unlike 2008. \n\nThey’ve also built stores in weird places, I live in an up and coming rural suburb with existing family run general stores within 5 miles and a Target and Walmart within 10, DG went and built a store right next to the family run place and sees almost no business because people around here either have money and shop at Target or stick with the existing family shops because they’re still better value and service than DG. Idk who greenlit that store but they’re a moron, this isn’t bumfuckistan Idaho where they can edge out the competition.",
