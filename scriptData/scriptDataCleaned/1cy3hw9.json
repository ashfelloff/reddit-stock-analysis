          "body": "But really to answer your question.. I bought 300 contracts with strike prices of $15.5, $16, and $16.5. At the time of purchase, each contract was roughly $25 each for a total of $7500. \n\nWhen the stock shot up to $20, these options went up in value relative to the difference between that value and the strike price. So for instance the $16 call went up to $4 per contract, or $400. This is a return of 1400%, or 14 times my money, or roughly $90,000 profit overnight.",
