S&P 500 then slowly grinded up for 2 months until 12/5/2001, surpassing its pre-9/11 price.\n\n6. S&P 500 then grinded in a sideways range from there for about 6 months until roughly May 2002.\n\n7. From May-July 2002, the S&P 500 had another fall.  I don't remember the exact reasons for the fall, but I think it just had more to due with further mean reversion and working off the valuation froth of the 1999-2000 dotcom bubble, as well as tech company earnings still coming in shitty and recovering slower than anticipated.

Anyway, so I checked it out because I thought how uncanny the same then and now. Then the dot com hit, and the world changed. According to my research, interest rates being high also were influenced by the creation of mutual funds. I agree with that because I started my trading at this time, and mutual funds were pushed  on me. I, of course, wanted tech stocks. I just didn't have much money, but I am still kicking my own ass for not holding that first account. What happened, you all ask??? I got scared by the same bullshit going on today. I then cashed out of qcom and oracle and Microsoft. Had I stayed in my 100 qcom shares, would it be worth 191 thousand. My Microsoft shares would be worth 164 thousand, and oracle would be close to the same. Anyway, I got scared again later. I screwed myself, so the point is to buy and hold. If you love the stock, stay in there. What was interesting looking up Microsoft was how many times it split during the tech revolution. According to Google, they split like this:\n\n2003-02-18\t2:1\t\n1999-03-29\t2:1\t\n1998-02-23\t2:1\t\n1996-12-09\t2:1\n1994-05-23\t2:1\t\n1992-06-15\t3:2\t\n1991-06-27\t3:2\n1990-04-16\t2:1\t\n1987-09-21\t2:1\t\n\nToday, they are running stocks higher and splitting by the 10.
