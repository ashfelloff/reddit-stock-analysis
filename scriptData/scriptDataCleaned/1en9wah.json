Palantir, which works closely with governments to provide software to visualize army positions, among other services, will use the partnership to launch its products ‚Äî such as Gotham, Foundry, Apollo and AIP ‚Äî on Microsoft‚Äôs cloud products for government agencies.\n\n> CEO Alex Karp said in a letter to shareholders at the time that the company‚Äôs trailing 12-month revenue in its U.S. government business, which includes intel and defense agencies, surpassed $1 billion for the first time. The company earned 54% of its revenue from government clients during the second quarter. Microsoft said the partnership would allow U.S. defense and intelligence organizations to build AI tools for action plans and logistics, among other things.",

To me, ethically, there's a huge difference between being in an ETF vs making a deliberate choice to buy and own a specific stock. Fortunately, the ETFs I'm bought into the most don't feature PLTR though.\n  \nI'm not telling anyone else to sell. It's clearly a good investment and while I made a modest profit, I'm confident that the stock will be worth more over the long term, barring unforeseen circumstances.  \n  \nI just had to make a decision that I could live with. I can make money on other investments without feeling like I'm *deliberately* putting money in the pocket of someone who is actively trying to bring about a change in the world I viscerally hate.  \n  \nBefore I thought he was just an eccentric, and I could let it pass. People talk, I don't have to completely agree with the people running the companies I invest in. That changed when he pushed to get Vance into a stone's throw from the white house; as an acolyte of Thiel and Curtis Yarvin, he's the kind of guy who would potentially support a January 6 scenario, instead of balking like Pence did.\n  \n[Have you read into it at all?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Enlightenment)\n\nThiel is disguising authoritarian technocratic monarchism behind the language of \"freedom\". The ideas these guys toss around about almost everything are repugnant - explicitly anti-American. Explicitly anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian, racist, misogynistic, the list goes on and on.  \n  \nThere are models where a king-like figure acts solely at the pleasure of a council of oligarchs. Another model has the dissolution of nations, and instead cyberpunk-style city states where different corporations exert absolute control over a city state, and the citizens have no rights whatsoever. The one thing these models all have in common is the removal of rights from ordinary citizens, with absolute power granted to technocrats like Thiel. Like I said, cartoonish, James Bond villain shit.\n  \nThe explicitly talk about these concepts as desirable changes to governance in the future. If you feel good about giving your money to someone who not only buys into those ideas, but is working to bring them about? Be my guest.",

I interviewed for them once early in my linux career but the recruiter sent me to an interview for somebody way more senior than I was at that point...I would absolutely skullcrush that interview now but I was green then at the very start of my career over a decade ago and the interview was just weird, they couldn't really tell me what the fuck I would be doing or what they did for the most part and I asked a lot of questions that they just weren't allowed to answer.  It gave me weird vibes...and I was just coming out of DOD contracting work with a secret security clearance so I wasn't new to a world of things you can't talk about but they just seemed to literally not be willing to even explain the job.  And I hate Thiel...but the company has decent engineering from what I can tell.\n\nEDIT: I clearly pissed people off but it is unclear why.  Palantir is a creepy company and I don't get why a bunch of people who probably never worked for them or did an interview there can downvote me for telling my experience in like 2012.  I have interviewed at tons of software companies both private sector and government jobs that required a secret or top secret clearance and none of them were as vague and shady as palantir.  They are successful but I dislike most of what that company stands for and I stunningly dislike their leader.",
