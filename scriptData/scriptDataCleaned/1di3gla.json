  "selftext": "KEY POINTS\n\n* Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21% in this tech ETF, while Apple will be down to about 4.5%, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n* The rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n* The ETF has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion.\n\n\n\n[Nvidia](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/NVDA/)’s blistering rally will force a major technology exchange-traded fund to acquire more than $10 billion worth of shares of the chip giant while cutting dramatically back on [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\n\nThe index that the [Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/XLK/) follows will soon rebalance, based on an adjusted market cap value from Friday’s close. The new calculations show [Microsoft](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT/) as the top stock in the index, followed by Nvidia and then Apple, according to Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research.\n\nAll three stocks would have a weight above 20% in the index if there were not caps in place. But diversification rules for the index limit how big the cumulative weight of stocks with at least a 5% share of the fund can be.\n\nAs a result, Microsoft and Nvidia will likely have a weight of around 21%, while Apple will fall sharply to about 4.5%, Bartolini said.\n\nThat is a change from the prior weightings, which saw Nvidia’s weight be kept artificially low by index rules. As of June 14, Microsoft and Apple were both at about 22% each in the fund, while Nvidia was just 6%.\n\n  \nThe race to finish in the top two came down to the final day. As of Monday, market cap data from FactSet shows that all three companies are over $3.2 trillion and within $50 million of each other, though that data does differ slightly from the calculations used in the index.\n\nThe XLK has about $71 billion in assets under management, so a 15-percentage-point change in the fund equates to more than $10 billion. SPDR does not comment on specific trading strategies around rebalances.\n\nThe big shift in the XLK is an extreme example of how even passive index funds can diverge, especially when focusing on narrow slices of the market.\n\n“Understanding how they might be weighted, where they’re allocated, what the rebalance frequency is, is really important because it can create differences in exposures and make what’s beneath the label seem different from fund to fund,” Bartolini said.\n\nThe fund follows the Technology Select Sector Index from S&P Dow Jones Indices, which uses a float-adjusted calculation to determine market cap. The rebalance officially takes effect at the end of this week.\n\nThe free-float adjustment for market cap accounts for large holders of an individual stock that are unlikely to be trading on a daily basis. For example, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway owns more than 5% of Apple, which could count against it in the index, Bartolini said.\n\n“Its free-float market capitalization is reduced because you have so many controlled interests in the company,” Bartolini said.\n\nThe rebalance will be in effect for one quarter, even if Apple outperforms Nvidia significantly ahead of the official date.\n\nOn Monday, shares of Apple were up 1.8%, while Nvidia ticked up 0.2%.\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/17/nvidia-to-get-20percent-weighting-and-billions-in-investor-demand-while-apple-demoted-in-major-tech-fund.html)",

Which is why the tech megacorps are all designing their own.\n\nThe possibility of demand getting pulled forward to these first few years and then softer afterwards is a real risk as big providers race to establish the lead in providing AI services to other companies and get them locked into an ecosystem, which is basically the Microsoft way now and others are trying to emulate it.

Stocks constantly discussed on reddit either plateau or dump. No one was talking about NVDA until it was the top. Then suddenly it was \"BUY BUY BUY\" on here. The market is now saturated, and once the big boys know it's as invested in as you can get, they will sell off their positions and it will dump.\n\n  \nNvidia is worth a lot of money, but I think it, just like TSLA, is overvalued. Though, like TSLA, is also not totally overvalued because of what they bring to the table, but not worth its current evaluation. If you're gambling, jumping in a few months back is always worth it, as long as you have the money to spare to do it. People were also talking about AAPL as if it would never go down and it was going to keep going up forever, now it's being downgraded.\n\n  \nThe point is, I'm seeing the same Rhetoric around NVDA as I did with TSLA and AAPL. I'm not bringing up GME and AMC. Those are pure gambling. Gamestop stores are just Hot Topic now with videogames. Most boutique mall shops are now just cheap plastic crap and stuffed animals that cost $50. Gamestop is no exception. Hot topic could start stocking videogames tomorrow and Gamestop would get fucked. AMC, I like the theaters, I think they are some of the nicest out there outside of things like the Alamo Drafthouse. They really are trying to offer a lot for their overpriced tickets, but as an investment? They proved that they will take the investor's money. They reverse squeezed everyone who bought in during the 2021 rush, and turned stock money into Liquidity. Upper Management will end up dooming that company, and it will probably get bought out by Amazon or some other big tech company that is also trying to be a media company when its value dumps.",
