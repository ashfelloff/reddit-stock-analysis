If someone is the best candidate, I want to be able to vote for them, no matter how old or young they are, or how long they have been in congress. I think age and term limits are an arbitrary limit on democracy. The voters should be allowed to determine if someone is too young or too old, or if a fresh face is needed.\n\nThe real problem is gerrymandering and money in politics. Those are what cause people who aren't the ideal candidates to manage to stay in office for longer than they should. If you want the best candidates to get elected and to have all ages properly represented in congress, fight against gerrymandering, and for public funding of elections and ranked choice voting.",

Massively crater the economy and default on the debt.... or inflate our way out of it. Inflating our way out of it will be painful, but it will be less painful than the other option. The inflation option doesnt require politicians to actively vote while defaulting will require them to actively take votes saying they want that. All things being equal we are going to inflate our way out of it. \n\nSo if we are going to inflate our way out of it how do we go about that? That is the rub and I suspect we will try to do it in a managed way that extends the inflation over decades rather than getting it all out of the way at once. I would expect that will mean the official fed position will eventually be to tolerate a 3-4% inflation rather than the 2% they have been sticking too. Or they will continue to spout the 2% standard and we will never see it so rates will never go down. \n\nNow as for the rate and how it impacts the federal interest I would point out that if the Fed makes a profit they turn it over to the government. Who wants to bet they eventually monetize the debt and then set the rate around 4-4.5% and just let it run for quite awhile. At that point the rate will be above inflation and the economy will churn on.",

According to the PCE, the total amount of entitlement spending is roughly 4.2T compared to the cost of 1.2T to fund the government. This is directly related to the largest generation, the baby boomers, retiring. There is a second source of inflation too in that job demand is higher because this generation is leaving the workforce. \n\nHow does this affect markets? You're right the government will continue to print its way out and as a result the fed will keep rates higher to fight inflation. In turn this will increase the cost of credit and consequently stunt real economic growth until the millennials reach peak capital in their 50s. You could call that the boomer tax.",
