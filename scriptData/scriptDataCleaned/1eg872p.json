  "title": "Bloomberg: Intel to Cut Thousands of Jobs to Reduce Costs, Fund Rebound",
  "score": 624,
  "selftext": "Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses.\n\nThe workforce reduction may be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the company’s plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Intel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.\n\nChief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger is spending heavily on research and development aimed at improving Intel’s technology and helping it return to prominence in the semiconductor industry. The company’s once-dominant position eroded under Gelsinger’s predecessors as rivals, such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have caught up and taken market share. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nIntel shares rose about 1% in late trading, reaching as high as $31.11, on the news.\n\nOther chipmakers led by Nvidia Corp. have sprinted ahead in the development of lucrative semiconductors tailored for demanding artificial intelligence-related tasks. Intel is also coming to grips with uneven demand for chips that run laptops and desktop computers, its main business.\n\nGelsinger, betting that Intel can improve its technology, embarked on a plan to build factories to manufacture semiconductors for other chipmakers. Last week, Intel hired Naga Chandrasekaran from Micron Technology Inc. as chief global operations officer, putting him in charge of the company’s overall manufacturing efforts.\n\nIntel reduced its workforce about 5% in 2023 to 124,800 by year’s end after announcing job cuts beginning in October 2022. It also has slowed spending in other areas. The company expected those cost reductions would save as much as $10 billion by 2025.\n\nAnalysts project that Intel will report that second-quarter revenue was flat, compared with a year earlier. Growth will pick up modestly in the second half of 2024, and total sales will increase 3% to $55.7 billion for the full year, according to Wall Street estimates. That would be the first annual revenue increase since 2021.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-30/intel-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-to-reduce-costs-fund-turnaround",

His reasoning was that GPUs weren’t that important for Intel, especially since they had Gaudi for their datacenter AI products. But then it became clear that Gaudi was a dead end, so he suddenly pivoted back to AI GPUs. And guess where he got the engineers? From CPU. He cancelled the Royal Core project and cut the Xeon team in half and moved them to GPUs. So now the Forest E-core server CPU line is killed after 2025. And his plan still failed cause all the best cpu engineers who were moved LEFT INTEL ENTIRELY due to outrage. And the CCG teams are pissed that they now have shitty CPU cores for their 2028-2029 products that they are in the middle of development for due to Royal’s cancellation.

AMD used to be what I bought bc they were cheaper, but they practically gave intel stuff away, and AMD costs more, but uses less energy.\n\nAMD isnt bothering to compete in the mobile market, the rumor is they're coming up with an ARM processor like the Apple M series, and not bothering to try to innovate on mobile in X86\\_64 bc Windows 11 on ARM, in a VM on a M1 Pro runs stuff really well, native on an AMD arm processor, with a radeon iGPU, would probably beat a Qualcomm ARM processor, and I don't know if Intel is working on ARM at all.\n\nMeanwhile intel is failing at deep learning, the DOE bought a really expensive supercomputer, let me check if it's working yet, it was at 50% of rated capacity, I guess it's working now, so if they can catch up with Nvidia on deep learning they might have some value, but I think the microcode issue will hurt the value of the company greatly.\n\nI mean if Dell Optiplex intel processors are failing, and intel doesn't have a fix, they'll switch to AMD.",
