  "selftext": "Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. \n\n**Apple**\n\n* Market cap: 3.6T\n* Current P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6\n* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits\n* Earnings growth: Low double digits\n* Net Margin: 25%\n\n **Microsoft**\n\n* Market cap: 3.2T\n* Microsoft P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8\n* Historical revenue growth: 15%\n* Earnings growth: 15-20%\n* Net margin: 35%\n\nLast week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",

Way too many funds and investors just buy apple blindly without giving it a second thought and just buy more as soon as they see a dip. Apple is apple. Way too many eyes on it for it to shoot too much higher or lower than where it needs to be. The only downside there has ever been to apple since forever is that you can’t own enough of it.",

I think you are 100% correct but I feel like somehow Apple will release an I-something that will get a pile of overdue features or copy features from other manufacturers and it will somehow be praised  as a revolution rivaling the second coming of Christ and cause share prices to skyrocket.",

Indonesia just banned the selling of iPhones due to Apple not following the law about how to produce them. China is seeing fast dropping demand - and I don't see them making more inroads in India, Brazil, Japan, South Korea - they just have too much competition and are too caught up in international trade geopolitics.",
