There's more interest in long form content, in huge budget TV shows, and there's tons of people making games, and lots of others that decided to go do their own thing on Youtube/tiktok/etc; talent is just incredibly spread out. It's not like in the 90's where the pinnacle of media arts endeavors was the movies, where TV was seen as several steps down from film, games were a small blip on the radar, and Twitch/Youtube/Tiktok/etc didn't exist.\n\nThere is, of course, the other problem where a lot of people at places like Disney are more interested in making movies to fight a culture war than to make money. If you make movies primarily for only half the country, or even less depending on how deep into politics/culture fights you want to get, well... you're going to get half or less than the profits you would normally get. And then there's DEI; if you pick someone to star in/write/etc something not because they're the best choice but for 'representation', there's a good chance it'll suck. \n\nIt'd be like if a rap music label suddenly decided they were going to sign 20% of white women from the Midwest/etc to be rappers to make sure representation was equal, and then were surprised that their sales dropped.",

      "body": " There were a lot of things we couldn't do as AMC CEO, but we were the fastest guys on the block at diluting shareholders and loved reminding our fellow CEOs of this fact. People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to run the company. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe running AMC. Intense, maybe. Even cerebral. But there was one day in our CEO experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at dilution, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Adam Aron and I were planning our final share offering. We needed to raise 100 million in capital to complete our plans and attain Dilution Ready status. Somewhere over wallstreetbets we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn to direct offerings and the stock was performing flawlessly. My projections were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be diluting real shares but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the apes in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren portfolios 80% below us, I could already see the coast of bankruptcy from the cash burn border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of DD and FUD, ahead of the apes. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Adam in the back seat. There he was, with no really good view of the incredible dilution before us, tasked with monitoring four different brokers. This was good practice for him for when we began diluting real shares, when a priority dark pool order from Citadel could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the orders, as during my entire CEO career I had controlled my own dilution. But it was part of the division of duties in this company and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on CNBC while we were diluting, however. Adam was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on TV, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in meme stock C-suites where the slightest media miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury.\n\nJust to get a sense of what Adam had to contend with, I pulled up the broker screens and monitored the orders along with him. The predominant retail chatter was from Robinhood, far below us, controlling daily apes in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled dilution and normally would not engage with them unless we needed to descend into their portfolios. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone ape asked his broker for a readout of his cost basis. The broker replied: \"Ape Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety dollars per share.\"\n\nNow the thing to understand about brokers, was that whether they were talking to a rookie ape on Robinhood, or to DFV himself, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional, tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \"Fidelity voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's financial system and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Fidelity reps, that all other brokers since then wanted to sound like that, and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the market we would be diluting in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to apes everywhere. Conversely, over the years, apes always wanted to ensure that, when posting, they sounded like DFV, or at least like Ryan Cohen. Better to go broke than sound bad on Reddit.\n\nJust moments after the ape's inquiry, a Citadel intern piped up on the dark pool, in a rather superior tone, asking for his short interest. \"I have you at one hundred and twenty-five percent of the float.\" Boy, I thought, Kenny really must think he is dazzling his hedge fund brethren. Then out of the blue, a Melvin Capital manager came up on the pool. You knew right away it was Melvin because he sounded very desperate to close his shorts. \"Citadel, Gabe 52 short interest check\". Before Kenny could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Gabe 52 has a Bloomberg terminal in that billion-dollar office, so why is he asking Kenny for a readout? Then I got it, ol' Gabe here is making sure that every meme stock shorter from Citadel to Point72 knows what true SI is. He's the most underwater dude in the market today, and he just wants everyone to know how much trouble he is having with his Melvin shorts. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: \"Gabe 52, Citadel, we have you at 420 percent SI.\"\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the offering button, I had to remind myself that Adam was in control of the dilution. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of cash and the opportunity will be lost. Those apes must be diluted, and diluted now. I thought about all of our media training and how important it was that we developed well as a management team and knew that to jump in on the dilution now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.\n\nSomewhere, 13 million shares above the apes, there was a CEO screaming inside his Armani suit. Then, I heard it. The click of the offering button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Adam and I had become a team. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Adam spoke: \"Apes of Reddit, AMC management, can you give us a share count?\" There was no hesitation, and the reply came as if was an everyday request. \"AMC management, I show you at one billion eight hundred and forty-two million shares outstanding.\"\n\nI think it was the forty-two million that I liked the best, so accurate and proud were the apes to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew they were smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Adam and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most silverback-like voice: \"Ah, apes, much thanks, we're showing closer to two billion on the money.\"\n\nFor a moment Adam was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the ape diamond hands, when Reddit came back with, \"Roger that AMC, Your dilution is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.\" It all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the meme stock craze, the apes had been diluted, all mortal shareholders on Reddit were forced to bow before the King of Dilution, and more importantly, Adam and I had crossed the threshold of being a management team. A fine day's work. We never heard another peep from those apes all the way to the bankruptcy. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest diluters out there.",
