  "selftext": "Besides doubling down on China, can we talk about why Burry is buying over 500k shares in a small healthcare company?\n\nBioAtla is up 14% after Burry and Scion Asset Management initiated a new stake of 633,959 shares in Q2. BioAtla is a cancer drug developer and is down 35% this year. I haven't done deep research yet but I'm interested in what you guys know about the company and why Burry might be interested in the stock at such depressed levels. I'm long biotech ($XBI) and ($ABBV) but overall the sector hasn't been performing and carries a decent amount of risk. Share any insight you have or informational resources.

      "body": "Knowing something of the cancer drug industry, this isn’t so much of a surprise.  Antibody Dug Conjugates (ADCs) are the new hotness but have actually been around a long time. The main issue with ADCs is “off-target” toxicity, where the ADC binds to and kills some normal tissues and tends to dictate how high a dose you can give. This company’s technology purported to “activate” the antibody or ADC only when it is near the tumor, which I assume will allow them to either use higher doses (higher efficacy) or treat patients with less side effects. Their portfolio is mostly “proven” targets to limit their risk to whether their platform actually works. \n\nTo me, looks like Burry is just following the pack on this one.",
