  "title": "Don't Bet on Apple's Stock to Surge After iPhone Announcement",
  "score": 482,
  "selftext": ">**TLDR: In the past five years, Apple's stock has generally declined on the day of an iPhone announcement. There is little reason to believe this year will be different.**\n\nI have seen some discussion that Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 announcement on September 9 might provide a spike in Apple's stock price, perhaps offering a nice options play.\n\nBased on the past five years of iPhone announcements—with the most-recent years being most analogous to this year's announcement than earlier years (being increasingly incremental upgrades rather than offering significant new technologies or features, etc.)—that seems to be a bad bet.\n\n# Apple Stock Price Changes Surrounding iPhone Announcements (as Percentage Increases or Decreases)\n\n||2019|2020|2021|2022|2023|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|**5 Days Before**|4.1%|9.9%|(4.6%)|(1.7%)|(5.5%)|\n|**Day of Announcement**|1.2%|(2.7%)|(1.0%)|0.9%|(1.7%)|\n|**5 Days After**|1.8%|(3.0%)|(3.2%)|(0.4%)|1.6%|\n\n# Is There Any Reason to Believe This Year's iPhone Models Will Result in Anything Different?\n\nNo, at least not based on the new features of the iPhone 16 lineup itself, as revealed by (trustworthy) rumors. Thus far, the most-exciting new feature is … [a new button](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/).\n\nBut perhaps the announcement will include something spectacular and unforeseen? Just don't bet on it.\n\n# Update Regarding the Availability of AI in iPhones\n\nA couple comments have noted the introduction of AI into iPhones. Just to clarify, [last year's \"Pro\" models already support AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/). That being said, the entirety of this year's iPhone lineup (i.e., the \"Pro\" and non-\"Pro\" models alike) are expected to support AI. Weigh that factor how you will.",
