  "selftext": "I own shares in ETF of Vanguard and Horizons that hold Tesla shares. I do not get to vote on the June 13th Tesla shareholder vote, so I wonder what are they going to vote? I can't find information online, is there a way to know before the vote happens? \n\nSecondly, is there a way to vote ourselves when holding ETF? It feels somewhat wrong to give all voting powers to these companies. \n\nEDIT: Vanguard is rolling out a feature that could solve this: https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/corporatesite/us/en/corp/articles/expanding-proxy-voting-choice.html",

I’d be shocked if they voted no again since Buckley just unexpectedly “retired” after his short tenure at the helm. He’s the same brains who blew a bunch of money getting in a pissing contest with Elon over buying the largest Twitter stake. Also one of the only major funds to not provide a Bitcoin ETF for clients and actively bar them from investing in other company’s crypto products coincidentally shortly after Tesla invested in Bitcoin and Elon actively supported crypto. \n\nYou can literally count on one hand how many major institutions voted against the original 2018 pay package while there were hundreds in favor. It passed with 73% support excluding biased votes like Elon and Kimbal. Include them and it passed with like 95% support.\n\nNot saying funds will always follow the board, but it’s a rounding error of 100%\n\nEdit: looks like dude blocked me for some reason so I can’t reply further down lol. Just wanted to share this to clearly cite that the majority of institutions most certainly didn’t follow vanguard:\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/news/tesla-vote-elon-musk-pay-package-tesla-stock/#:~:text=Vanguard%20voted%20against%20the%20Musk,in%20on%20the%20current%20votes.\n\n> Vanguard voted against the Musk pay package in 2018, while BlackRock and many others supported it.\n\nAnd also no clue where he’s pulling that they had 8% Tesla ownership in 2018. Vanguard’s own F13 filings show they had just 7M shares out of the 2.5B outstanding back then, which is a meagre 0.3% ownership. Dude’s just making things up hoping no one calls him out and blocking people who do.\n\nhttps://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/vanguard-group",

      "body": "Figured I'd help me on Elon Musk’s $56 Billion Compensation Plan\n\nElon Musk has a unique compensation plan designed to align his incentives with Tesla's long-term growth. This plan, approved by shareholders in 2018, is highly performance-based and does not include any regular salary or bonuses. Instead, Musk's compensation is tied to achieving specific, ambitious milestones. Here's a detailed look at the plan and the challenges involved:\n\nKey Specifics of the Compensation Plan:\n\n1. No Salary or Cash Bonuses: Musk does not receive a regular salary or cash bonuses from Tesla. His entire compensation is tied to the company’s performance.\n   \n2. Milestones and Tranches: The plan consists of 12 tranches. Each tranche is unlocked only if Tesla meets both market capitalization and operational milestones.\n\n3. Market Capitalization Milestones:\n   - The plan requires Tesla’s market capitalization to increase in $50 billion increments, starting from $100 billion, up to $650 billion.\n  \n - This means Tesla must reach market values of $150 billion, $200 billion, and so on, up to $650 billion.\n \n  - Achieving these milestones is extremely challenging, requiring significant growth in the company’s stock price, influenced by investor confidence, market conditions, and overall company performance.\n\n4. Operational Milestones:\n   - For each tranche to be unlocked, Tesla must also meet at least one of the following operational targets for the previous four consecutive quarters:\n  \n   - Revenue Milestones: Ranging from $20 billion to $55 billion.\n  \n   - Adjusted EBITDA Milestones: Ranging from $1.5 billion to $18 billion.\n\n5. Tranche Breakdown:\n   - **Tranche 1**: $100 billion market cap, $20 billion revenue or $1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 2**: $150 billion market cap, $22.5 billion revenue or $3 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 3**: $200 billion market cap, $25 billion revenue or $4.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 4**: $250 billion market cap, $27.5 billion revenue or $6 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 5**: $300 billion market cap, $30 billion revenue or $7.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 6**: $350 billion market cap, $32.5 billion revenue or $9 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 7**: $400 billion market cap, $35 billion revenue or $10.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 8**: $450 billion market cap, $37.5 billion revenue or $12 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 9**: $500 billion market cap, $40 billion revenue or $13.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 10**: $550 billion market cap, $42.5 billion revenue or $15 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 11**: $600 billion market cap, $45 billion revenue or $16.5 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n   - **Tranche 12**: $650 billion market cap, $55 billion revenue or $18 billion adjusted EBITDA.\n\n6. Stock Options: Upon achieving a tranche, Musk receives stock options to purchase Tesla shares at a pre-determined price. The value of these options depends on Tesla’s stock price.\n\n7. Potential Total Value: If all 12 tranches are achieved, Musk would have the right to purchase up to 20.3 million Tesla shares at a fixed price, potentially worth up to $56 billion based on the stock's current value.\n\n8. Difficulty and Achievements:\n   - These milestones are extremely difficult to achieve, requiring Tesla to perform exceptionally well in both market valuation and operational metrics.\n   - Despite these challenges, Elon Musk has managed to unlock several tranches, demonstrating his ability to drive Tesla’s extraordinary growth.\n   - Under his leadership, Tesla has become one of the most valuable companies globally, surpassing the initial market cap milestones and achieving significant revenue growth, reflecting the company’s expansion and innovation in electric vehicles and energy solutions.",
