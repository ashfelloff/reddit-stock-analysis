You can't just plug and play a replacement for an ASICS, if you even managed to fab one that wasn't obsolete by the time it was finished. \n\nNvidia has a 20 year head start on the support end.

As a result AMD doesn't even try and or want to compete with Nvidia in that space. So, from their perspective AMD doesn't want to create the \"BEST\" technology but rather what they are willing to believe consumers can afford. \n\nThis mindset is the problem. For enterprise this methodology doesn't scale at all. It's in fact, a horrible decision for AMD to make because enterprise can afford and they do want the very best someone has to offer. \n\nI'll use car racing as an analogy. FORD, Chevy, others don't compete in F1 racing. Although Ford is supposed to return in 2026. The reason is that is not their forte. \n\nIn terms of revenues F1 brings in $2 Billion annually while nascar brings in $660 Million. \n\nYou can't have the mentality that you wish to be down here because it's cheaper and then be upset when everything is happening up here and it's more expensive. \n\nAMD's next consumer GPU they have already stated they will not compete in the high-end for consumer cards.

However, I still wouldn't want to hold it right now.\n\nA better comparison might be Cisco.  They had a hardware product that had high demand and not much direct competition.  It was still overvalued.  Everything is right now, not just AI related stuff.  The SnP has a P/E of almost 30.  That's about 50% beyond historical average and won't sustain.",
