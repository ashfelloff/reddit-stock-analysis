If that ever happened it seems obvious that nobody would be able to sell and those in power would just quickly fix it so that they win, like always. They love their fantasy though. \nThe people in charge of the market are in charge. You can get lucky and make life changing money, but they are not going to allow thousands of people to realize trillions of dollars each. The market is made by and for them, and they only let average people play in it both to extract money from them and to not give the impression that the market is their personal money making/laundering toy. If it breaks and normal people think they’re getting a cent of their trillion dollar accounts they will literally just fucking turn it off. \n\nThere’s an interesting double-think phenomenon among them, where they believe in what I just said. They say the market is corrupt and crime ridden. But at the same time they completely trust the same exact corrupt system to allow them to cash out trillions of dollars (of the money belonging to the people who create and maintain the corrupt system) when the time comes.
