But you may be able to get away with it if $SPY decides to catapult itself downwards another 0.75% tomorrow (Down to $498.75 - an extra $3.75 more on the downside by tomorrow is possible, but we will see..

The market moves the way it wants to move, but just to entertain your question, I do think that we may be due for a quick bounce up in the short term due to the bearish moves we've been seeing in the market for the last couple of weeks. That is why I would have sold anywhere from $2.60-$3.80.. Sure gains are nice, but so is preserving capital. I cannot imagine how devastated you would feel if you had lost 80-90% of it all due to them not hitting. But that's just me. Let me know if you're still gonna go for it. I would at least maybe shave off a bit of the position, in case.. You could be 100% right and still not hit because of I.V. crush. Many factors to the equation, just try to think which is most probable and stick with it. Edit: grammar errors. Keep me posted!",
