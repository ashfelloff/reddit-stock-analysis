There are no guaranteed bets or investments that a person can take an action on with a 100% guarantee that they are not going to loose money.   So there is the element of chance for both actions.  Obviously with trading the goal should be the long term, unlike gambling where once you place a bet whether you win or you loose you dont have any future with that action, that one bet has passed.  Not so with trading, unless of course you loose all of your money, you can take a loss but in the future you might be able to gain it back if the stock changes.
