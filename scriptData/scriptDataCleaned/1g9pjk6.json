      "body": "One thing I’ll disagree with is FedEx predicting UPS moves. A year ago I’d agree with you, but since then their earnings movements have separated and it’s due to the different dynamics at play between the two now, with the swapping of big contracts and big fedex cuts versus big UPS expansion and investment. \n\nI don’t know which way UPS will move but just relying on FedExs last move is silly in my opinion. The rest of what you said is anecdotal experience working there, so can’t really be held up.",
