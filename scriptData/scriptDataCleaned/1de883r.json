Datacenter cooling and power management systems lack the flexibility to accommodate such changes effortlessly. Intel recognizes these constraints and offers drop-in replacements that are well-suited to our needs.\n\nRegarding margins, yes they are expected to decrease due to Intel's current reliance on TSMC for Lunar Lake production. However, despite using TSMC, Intel's valuation remains competitive because of its potential to switch manufacturers in the future‚Äîan option not available to others and their margins are fine. \n\nOn a related note, I hold a significant investment in TSMC.

I think anything that has lagged in that manner for that long becomes a \"show me\" story - the company needs to prove itself over some time, people expect some PR is going to turn things around overnight are likely to be disappointed.\n\nIt's certainly not a 0 but when it will start to turnaround who knows.

That‚Äôs in addition to the gains moving from 20A to the more advanced 18A node. These efficiencies are obviously incredibly important when it comes to the advancement of chip technology. Samsung and TSMC won‚Äôt have the ability utilize backside power until 2026.\n\nEUV lithography Machines- Intel bought all 5 of ASML‚Äôs 2024 machines, leaving its competitors with nothing until late 2025 at the earliest. These machines are the key to producing the most advanced chips in the world in the most efficient way possible with Intel planning on utilizing them for their 14A nodes. They will have, at minimum, a year head start on their rivals with how to best use this technology at a mass scale.\n\nChips act/subsidies: currently the largest beneficiary. Us government is heavily subsidizing their commercial fabs as well as one specific for national defense. Germany, Ireland and Israel are all giving massive subsidies to build their fabs.\n\nIFS: Intel's initiative to provide manufacturing services to other semiconductor companies. It leverages Intel's advanced manufacturing processes and technologies to produce custom chips for clients. This move marks Intel's expansion beyond designing and producing its own chips to offering its manufacturing capabilities to external customers, competing with other foundries like TSMC and Samsung Foundry. Intel aims to capitalize on its cutting-edge fabrication facilities and expertise to serve a broad range of customers in various industries.\n\nTSMC Geopolitics: TSMC's operations in Taiwan make it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions with China. Any disruption in the region could impact TSMC's supply chain and operations.\n\nMobileye- is an Israeli technology company specializing in the development of vision-based advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving technology. Mobileye's technology includes features like lane departure warning, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Intel sold of 1.5 billion worth and still own 88% of the company. The stock is up big this year.\n\nHealthcare: Intel has been involved in the healthcare sector for quite some time. Intel's technology is used in various healthcare applications, including medical devices, data analytics, and telehealth solutions\n\nFinancials: Intel's financials remain strong, with a solid balance sheet, consistent revenue growth, and healthy cash flow generation when not spending tens of billions on the most important fabrication plants in the world. Long history of returning value to shareholders.\n\nBut Reddit will tell you it‚Äôs traded sideways for 20 years and sucks not seeing where they‚Äôre headed.",

Now Intel has to catch up.\n\nBut Intel invests heavily in manufacturing in Europe and USA while AMD is solely depended on TSMC for producing its advanced chips.\n\nSo when China finally invades Taiwan in 5 or 10 years, AMD can shut down (or needs to buy producing capacities from Intel) while Intel will have a kind of a monopoly.\n\nBecause outside of Taiwan - who produces chips in that quality? South Korea, Japan, USA.\n\nSo in the worst case (for the World) china will invade Taiwan and Intel will swoop in and take over most of AMDs market share, because AMD can't produce anymore. \n\nIn the worst case for Intel they are creating chip production capacities that are needed worldwide. Even German companies producing 30 or 40nm chips are sought after for car parts and what not.\n\nAlso AMD is now doing what Intel did when they were in the lead: Not really innovating anymore. The Ryzen 8000 mobile processors have the same speed as the Ryzen 7000 processors (they just added AI). A Ryzen 7950x is only 30% faster than a Ryzen 5950X.\n\nSo AMD slowed down its improvement rate to a similar rate we saw with intel between the 6000 and 9000 versions where improvements from generation to generation where around or under 10%.\n\nHell, even an Intel i7-4770 would run okay for every casual user and with the right GPU even can run AAA games in Full HD. A  i7-13700k is just 100 to 200% faster, a CPU that is 10 years younger.\n\nSo if you solely look at AMD vs Intel - they will exchange market leader ship somwhere in the future.\n\n  \nNow - other players are entering the market stealing the Cake from Intel and AMD. Apple with its M-Processors, ARM and co. and they could disrupt the market.\n\nBut they also all need to produce their microchips and they don't have foundrys. And when China attacks Taiwan again - Intel is there with its foundries in Germany, USA and co.",

They are also inferior to AMD who is a competitor as well, but not as broad of an org as Intel or NVidia.\n\nRight now all the money is going to NVidia, and some of the money is going to AMD. Intel is government tied, but as NVidia takes up more government space it will push out Intel over time. If AMD starts to go further into the gov space, Intel could be entirely phased out over the next couple decades.\n\nIntel is in a cutting edge tech field and they are very behind innovation wise. You‚Äôre essentially betting on them to have a major internal overhaul and make leaps in innovation that pass the close to 5 generations they‚Äôre lagging behind NVidia or maybe 3.5 generations they‚Äôre lagging behind AMD. They theoretically have enough capital to do it, but I don‚Äôt think they have the leadership or organizational structure to take that kind of risk. And realistically, NVidia isn‚Äôt just stopping. So in the time it would take for them to catch up 5 generations, NVidia could be another 2 generations ahead still.\n\nSo overall: you‚Äôre betting on Intel to change their strategy. Which could happen, but hasn‚Äôt happened for around 20 years. So I wouldn‚Äôt, but if you want to then sure.\n\nI will say, from a purely trend perspective, this does look close to the bottom for them, so a short term 3-6 month position doesn‚Äôt look bad imo.",
