  "score": 77,
  "selftext": "After a substantial lost over the past few weeks I decided to take a closer look at my trade history and realized that 99% of my option trades taken over the past few months have been put options only. I keep telling myself to play both sides but I find myself buying put options thinking the stock will drop a bit. Maybe its because of my beliefs but I have no clue why because there have been plenty of times where calls were the obvious move. Maybe im just a g\\*y permabear, anyone else have this issue?",

Buy Breakouts. Or.\n2. Buy Low and Sell High (Reversals or Pullbacks.)\n\n\nIn a Bear Market its the same but in the opposite direction. You can likely make money 2 ways.\n\n\n1. Short Breakdowns. Or.\n2. Sell High and Buy Low. (Shorting Tops or Rallies.)\n\n\nThe strategy you are doing works well in a Bear Market. It will make you go broke in a Bull Market though.\n\n\nIt seems like you dont know what type of market you are in.\n\n\nAn easy way to figure this out is to draw Channels. If the channel on your time frame in inclining(Going Up.) Obviously, you're in a bullish environment. You want to be buying breakouts or when the market dips, You can Buy \"Low and Sell High\".\n\n\nJust about on every timeframe SPY is in Bullish environment. The money is made buying dips or breakouts. You do this until SPY has transitioned to either a sideways Range Bound Market or a declining Bearish Market.\n\n\nIn Range Bound Markets you do both strategies. Best of Luck!",

If you bet on trend reversals it‚Äôs important to understand when those can actually take place. The key word is‚Ä¶OpEx. \n\nLet‚Äôs have a look at the most recent trend changes in the market. \n\nAfter the parabolic move in Q1, we saw a major reversal starting in April. What happened end of march? Quarterly OpEx. \n\nWe then saw a massive downtrend that bottomed exactly on the 19th of April. What happened on the 19th of April? Monthly OpEx. \n\nAfter the 19th of April, we saw a massive uptrend until today. Now let‚Äôs see when the next OpEx takes place‚Ä¶oh it‚Äôs this fucking Friday. \n\nLooking at those dynamics, do you think it‚Äôs a good idea to bet on a trend change before OpEx? \n\nLook what they did before the fucking Corona crash. Open the SPY chart and look at it. In February 2020 they pumped SPX up by over 150 points despite a global pandemic and lockdown talks. When did it crash? They first day after February OpEx. Everyone that bought puts before got ripped into pieces. \n\nSo if you feel bearish, and expect a trend reversal, understand that those usually take place after OpEx. I rest my case",
