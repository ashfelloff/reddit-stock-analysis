The problem is that Boeing has decided to build shitty planes to save a few bucks (while ultimately losing far more money in the long run). \n\n>but 1 out of the 4500 has an issue.. I mea\n\nIf one out of 4500 planes had a serious risk of depressurizing or crashing every time they were flown, I would never get in one, and most other people wouldn't either. Just as you wouldn't drive a car with a 1 in 4500 chance of spontaneous combustion or self-crashing.",

                      "body": "my point Is, everyday,  these planes are allowed to fly.  Is it a shitty ceo who is cutting corners sure!! But I have seen and read articles that clearly say Boeing once an issue is present does recall the part or fix the issues thatre not working. I also am aware that planes are supposed to be constantly maintenance despite what everyone on here thinks.  You still need to maintain a fleet.  If the planes were not authorized to fly because of safety concerns I'm sure they would not be flying all day long.  Planes were falling out of the sky and losing altitude for years and years it's not just Boeing, there is so many factors.  And sure part of that factor is not being properly maintenanced and cutting corners.  I agree with that but I also think if it was what the news was making it look like a lot more planes would have parished.",
