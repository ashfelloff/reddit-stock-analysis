  "selftext": "July 2023: S&P 500 rallied +0.68% on Monday & Tuesday leading up to FOMC, flat on FOMC day, -0.64% Thursday after FOMC, +0.99% Friday.  Up 1% for the week.\n\nOctober 2023: 8-day win streak starting from Monday before FOMC to Wednesday of the following week. Up 1.05% on FOMC decision day and another 1.89% the Thursday after, and another 0.94% the Friday after.  Up 6.28% over that 8-day period.\n\nDecember 2023: Market rallied all 5 days of the week. Weekly gain 2.89%.\n\nJanuary 2024: Market rallied +0.7% leading up FOMC decision day. FOMC Day was negative, -1.61%, but recovered Thursday & Friday, +1.25% and +1.07%. Up 1.40% for the week.\n\nMarch 2024: Up +0.89% on FOMC Day & all 4 days between Monday-Thursday, dipping very slightly (-0.14%) on Friday. Up 2.3% for the week.\n\nMay 2024: Up +0.32% on Monday, Down -1.57% on Tuesday, Down -0.34% on FOMC Day, then up sharply on Thursday-Friday for a weekly gain of +0.57%\n\n**Over the past year, the smallest weekly gain was +0.57% in May, and the largest was +5.72% in October 2023.**\n\nJune 2024: S&P 500 up +0.52% Monday-Tuesday.\n\n**Trading strategy:** Due to enormous implied volatility, you can buy the SPX 5340/5345 call spread expiring June 14 for $3, risking $6 to gain $4. Alternatively, for a riskier play, you can buy the 5370/5375 spread also expiring June 14 for $2.5, an even-money bet, matching the lowest FOMC’s weekly gain over the past year. Or you can go to even higher strikes for higher potential ROI.\n\n**Analysis:** Whatever happens, Powell is going to be dovish tomorrow. It’s no coincidence the gains started after the FOMC stopped raising rates (the last increase was in July 2023), and ever since then, Powell & other FOMC governors have repeated again and again that further rate increases are effectively off the table. Steady interest rates + growing economy & corporate earnings = higher stock prices.\n\nIf tomorrow’s CPI report is cool, 3 rate cuts will be back on the table. Central bankers not just in the U.S. but around the world seem to be itching to lower rates as soon as inflation data is good enough in their respective countries/regions to give them political cover to do so.\n\nIf tomorrow’s CPI report is hot, Powell will have to stay “higher for longer,” but he’ll also reassure the markets that rate cuts are coming once inflation does come down. The stock market shrugged off the high inflation readings in Q1 and as long as (a) further tightening remains off the table; (b) rate cuts are still planned, this behavior will continue.",
