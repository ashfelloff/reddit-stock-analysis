  "selftext": "Listen up, degenerates. Pitney Bowes (PBI) is flying under everyone‚Äôs radar, but it‚Äôs about to pay off BIG TIME if you know where to look. \n\n**Here‚Äôs the scoop:**\n\nThey just dropped their Q3 results, and despite all the noise, they‚Äôre **CRUSHING IT** on their turnaround plan. They‚Äôre exiting their money-losing eCommerce biz, slashing costs, and optimizing cash like legends. \n\nThe juicy part? They raised their full-year Adjusted EBIT guidance to $355M-$360M, and if you slap a modest 15x multiple (where their peers trade) on that, we‚Äôre looking at an equity value of around **$3.5 BILLION**. That translates to a target price of **$19.63 per share**. This bad boy‚Äôs currently trading at **just $8.05**. Easy double over night. \n\nThis ain't just hopium. They‚Äôve been deleveraging like pros, bringing $117M back home from overseas, and stacking cash like they‚Äôre prepping for a hostile takeover. \n\nThe bears are sleeping on this one, but not us. $PBI has **ZERO analyst coverage** right now, meaning we‚Äôre getting in early before Wall Street catches on.\n\nTL;DR: $PBI is a classic turnaround play with 2x upside potential ‚Äî load up before the üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vwhdtybddlzd1.png?width=1054&format=png&auto=webp&s=9dce2a21836c2a2f040f35ca486904596f61195c\n\n",

Smart move dumping that garbage eCommerce business - [it's been bleeding money for years](https://beyondspx.com/article/pitney-bowes-pbi-a-turnaround-story-taking-shape).\n\nBut your math needs work. That $3.5B valuation is smoking crack. Their core business (SendTech + Presort) is solid but not THAT solid.\n\nThe real play here is the cost savings. They're targeting $120M-$160M in annual savings. Plus that sweet $240M cash they freed up. Balance sheet's getting sexier by the day.",

But I would say that we've mentioned that there's opportunities to accelerate our growth in Presort, both through organic advantages that we have as well as through M&A of tuck-in acquisitions that are very highly accretive.\n\nAnd SendTech is looking at -- has some specific initiatives to enter some new segments of the shipping business. So for example, that business has been primarily in the office-to-office shipping market and has a great opportunity to expand into the e-commerce SaaS shipping market, which is kind of an adjacent market that's large and potentially offers a great opportunity for us.",
