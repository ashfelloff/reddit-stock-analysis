I had previously bought AAL call options that expired in 2025 but it brought me down to 800k of capital from an original capital of 1.1 million I am now back to 916k.",

I am leaning towards closing the position and re-entering on monday morning.  \n\nI'm also holding 200 shares, how can I hedge this by selling a contract or two?",
