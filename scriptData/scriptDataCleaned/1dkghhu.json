  "selftext": "Iâ€™m a NVDA bull but Iâ€™ve been in the NVDA game for a while so Iâ€™ve started to notice trends. Earlier this week, I started buying puts expiring July 26, expecting NVDA to start to peak and trade flat this week and expecting the T+35 FTDs to start showing the results of the profit taking following NVDAâ€™s post-earnings rally (the same trend after their Q4 earnings report). As NVDA kept going higher, I kept doubling down. When NVDA became the largest company by market cap on Tuesday, I set an alert to buy puts an hour and a half after market open. I sold 15/50 puts at a 300%+ gain to have a slight profit over my entire trade and now Iâ€™m playing with house money. Iâ€™m expecting NVDA to drop to 130 or possibly even less by EOW so my next price target to sell 20 more puts will be 130.",
