                          "body": "Well I bought more LUNR since my last comment. Anyway, I only started looking at space stocks around June but here are my thoughts on the others: \n\nRKLB - At first I was skeptical but I've come around. I worried about competition with Starship since I thought it could greatly reduce cost-per-kg-to-orbit and change the industry in unknown ways. People talked up how RKLB's smaller rockets could take you to more specialized orbits, but I thought Starship could bring down the cost so much that an industry for \"last mile\" space tugs seemed possible. People also talked up the space systems division but I thought it was overvalued for that alone when comparing it to other space companies.  \n\nWhat changed my mind though was an interview I heard with Starfish Space's CEO. (They do on-orbit servicing to extend satellites' life spans by boosting their orbits with their own spacecraft; they're not publicly traded.) The guy talked about how constrained access to orbit was, basically saying that (as far as I remember) SpaceX was launching every 2-3 days, using about half of those for their own purposes for Starlink, and it was incredibly cheap and easy to sign up for launch (he said it used a web portal that was easier than purchasing a plane ticket), but that it was still incredibly difficult to find a slot that was anytime soon. He also said it was hard to hire people because there were so many space startups that there weren't enough potential hires to go around.  \n\nIn other words: there's far more demand for access to space than even SpaceX can fill, that demand is only going to increase with all the new companies, and maybe most importantly, if you want to put up a constellation of satellites (which RKLB wants to do for undisclosed purposes) it's currently an incredible advantage to have your own rockets to do it. \n\nSo while I still think Starship will change the industry I think there's enough demand and enough advantage from having your own access to space that for the next several years at least that won't matter too much to RKLB. (Though, I imagine a successful Starship commercial launch could cause some RKLB volatility. Who knows in which direction.) \n\nI don't have a position in them but I'd like to open one later. I'm not waiting for lower prices, I'm waiting to have more money. Whether they'll go up or down near term, who knows. If they're benefiting from an ASTS run up now they'll probably benefit from a LUNR run up at the end of the year. And as they make progress with Neutron and possibly announce the purpose of their constellation or start work on it I could see those being big catalysts. But, this stock has also dropped before on no news or market conditions. Long term I'm bullish, but I don't know if buying now you'd see red later or feel like you got it at a good price. Maybe both.  \n\nASTS - I was looking at it around $10, I think maybe even under $10, and decided not to buy. My reasoning was I was worried about competition from Starlink, and whether I was right or wrong about that won't be borne out for probably a few years. It didn't matter though. Short term though I didn't foresee the hype that would be kicked off by their new satellites being completed, or more charitably the rise in stock price from people learning about a company with good potential and all buying in early. So really it doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong because all that matters is gains and everyone who believed in the company has them. \n\nI am still worried about Starlink though. My thesis for investing in space stocks in the first place depends on SpaceX continuing to innovate (e.g. to bring down launch costs further) and I don't want to bet that they're be unable to solve issues with getting direct-to-cell satellites. I mean, they were able to land rockets, they've got good engineering, and they innovate quickly. They already have 100+ direct-to-cell (text only, I think) satellites and they're constantly improving, experimenting, and launching. Not to mention their incredibly wealthy and politically connected CEO. But, Space Mob has answers to all those worries and they're the ones with +1000% gains, so why listen to me?\n\nI also feel uncomfortable with how little I know about their tech. That could be on me but at least as far as I've looked I can't find a good deep dive on their technology that doesn't come from ASTS themselves or from an investor. Yeah, people invested in ASTS think ASTS is good, that's practically axiomatic, but I'd love a Scott Manley type to really dig into things. Probably no neutral party would want to do that though until ASTS is already pretty far along. \n\nIf I did believe in their future though I have no idea if buying in now would be good. Buying in a couple months ago sure, six months ago absolutely, but it's so volatile right now I have no idea. They're down so far today so maybe that's a good dip to buy, or maybe it will pull back further. Maybe it won't matter and it will continue to rise anyway going into September in anticipation of launch. \n\nWhatever your opinions on ASTS's long term prospects though they feel like the highest risk / highest reward bet in space stocks for the next month or so.",
