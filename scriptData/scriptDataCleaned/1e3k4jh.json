  "selftext": "Local Taiwanese news article, translated to English below.\n\nTLDR: NVDA's raising its orders for TSMC by 25% and estimates for GB200 sales have increased by 50%, up to 60k from 40k. Depending on the configuration (NVL36 vs NVL72), each one ranges between $1.8M - $3M. I'll let you regards do the Math.\n\nSource: [https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/8094994?from=edn\\_maintab\\_index](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5612/8094994?from=edn_maintab_index)\n\nPositions: leaps\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\n*According to reports from the supply chain, TSMC* [*(2330)*](https://money.udn.com/industry/company/2330) *is preparing to start producing NVIDIA’s latest Blackwell platform architecture graphics processor (GPU) in the near future. In response to strong customer demand, NVIDIA has increased its chip investment in TSMC by 25%, which not only means that the AI ​​market is booming Unprecedented, it also adds strong momentum to TSMC’s performance in the second half of the year and leaves the groundwork for raising its full-year outlook.*\n\n*TSMC will hold a legal meeting this Thursday (18th) and is currently in the silent period before the legal meeting. As of yesterday's deadline, no response from TSMC was received.*\n\n*The industry believes that with the news that TSMC has begun producing Blackwell platform architecture graphics processors (GPUs), it means that the countdown to the launch of Huida's AI server equipped with \"the most powerful AI chip on the surface\" will open a new page in the AI ​​industry, and is expected to become TSMC's The Dharma Conference is the focus of heated discussion.*\n\n*Analysts estimate that the average selling price (ASP) of the Huida B100 GPU built on the Blackwell architecture is US$30,000 to US$35,000, and the super chip GB200, which connects the Grace CPU and the B200 GPU in series, is priced between US$60,000 and US$70,000. The U.S. dollar is even higher, which means that Huida-related chips are the most expensive chips that TSMC has ever produced for terminals, and its investment in TSMC's operations is even more anticipated.*\n\n*Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU is known as the \"most powerful AI chip on the planet\". It is equipped with 208 billion transistors and is manufactured using TSMC's customized 4nm process. The GPU die is twice the mask size through a 10TB chip per second. The chip interconnect connects into a single, unified GPU and supports AI training and real-time large language model inference, with models scalable to 10 trillion parameters.*\n\n*According to industry insiders, major international manufacturers such as Amazon, Dell, Google, Meta, and Microsoft will introduce Huida's Blackwell architecture GPU to build AI servers, and the capacity exceeds expectations. To this end, Huida has increased its order for TSMC by about 25%. %.*\n\n*As Huida expands its Blackwell architecture GPU wafer production, in terms of the number of terminal server cabinets, shipments of GB200 NVL72 and GB200 NVL36 server cabinets have increased simultaneously, from the original expected combined shipment of 40,000 units. increased to 60,000 units, an increase of up to 50%, among which the total number of GB200 NVL36 reached 50,000 units.*\n\n*According to industry estimates, the average selling price of the GB200 NVL36 server cabinet is US$1.8 million, and the price of the GB200 NVL72 server cabinet is as high as US$3 million. GB200 NVL36 has 36 super chips GB200, 18 Grace CPUs, and 36 enhanced B200 GPUs; GB200 NVL72 has 72 super chips GB200, 36 Grace CPUs, and 72 B200 GPUs.*\n\n*Before the handover of the leadership in June, former TSMC Chairman Liu Deyin predicted that the demand for AI applications is now more optimistic than a year ago. \"This year is another year of great growth.\" Current Chairman Wei Zhejia also revealed that AI applications have just begun. , \"I'm as optimistic as everyone else.\"*",

It's almost always the same market movements. \n\nThese movesments are less correlated with other tech firms that arent directly selling the AI (eg. Meta, Google, Amazon). Like when institutions dumped NVDA twice this past month, they had also dumped TSM, AVGO, ARM. When one stock rose, the rest rose at the same time. Others like MU, INTC and AMD are more correlated together like another group for some reason.\n\nOf cos this is based on very short term observation so i might be wrong",

They have been putting out price increase comments to test the waters and seemingly have very little resistance. Same with Apple price increases.\n\nThis is about as close to a monopoly as it gets. They have about 60% market share and #2 Samsung is at 14%. For advanced chips, they have over 90% market share. That is crazy high.\n\nFabs take many years to build too. So it’s not like NVDA can just build some fabs real quick and build chips themselves. Apple is all-in on their own design M chips so can’t see them going back to Intel any time soon.\n\nThis cycle may not last forever but next 3-5 years should be incredible. They are raking in dough right now.\n\nI think everyone expects an earnings beat.\nI am predicting raising guidance, beat on margin and raising margin guidance due to price increases. Finally, less likely but still predicting is more capital spending acceleration AND raising dividend.\n\nWe will know in just a few days. I have $185 calls. Both 7/19 and Jan 2025. I normally exit the short term stuff before earnings when it’s this close as IV evaporates day if. But holding in this case. Could lose entire amount if stock drops below $185 at earnings.
