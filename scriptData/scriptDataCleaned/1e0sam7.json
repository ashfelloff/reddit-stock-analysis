Upon satisfactory technical progress and certain royalty payments, Quantumscape will grant PowerCo the license to mass produce battery cells based on QuantumScape’s technology platform.\n\n  \nDo you think solid state battery technology is viable to help the EV market move forward or is it vaporware that won't deliver?",
