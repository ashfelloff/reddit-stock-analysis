In addition, mRNA-based vaccines are directly translated through the host’s translational machinery and lack a bacterial or viral vector, resulting in a low risk of adverse vaccine reactions\n\nTo be very clear, \"safer\" is relative here. Traditional vaccines are already very safe to begin with, but that second point is likely what's causing the AZ vaccine to present with potential blood clotting issues just as a COVID infection does, albeit to a substantially lower degree with the vaccine. It's just not worth it to use that vaccine when mRNA versions exist that don't present the issue at all even if it is still generally safe by most standards.",

The Discernable difference here is that COVID predominantly localized in the respiratory system in a natural way. An intravenous/intra-arteial injection would be a systemic exposure across the whole body with a very high exposure in a very short amount of time. In the case of RNA vaccines, you'd get areas of the body creating spike proteins and having inflammatory reactions/damage that were not supposed to.\n\nThe spike protein (through natural infection or RNA instructions) is incredibly inflammatory to start with. Exposure to this in sensitive areas of your body (eg; heart) meant a very high potential for varying degrees of damage.\n\nThe odds of accidental intravenous/intra-arterial injection is between 1 in 3400 and as law as 1 in 54000 depending on the study. Coincidentally, these numbers align very closely with the reported adverse event rates recorded for both mRNA and Adenovirus vector vaccines.\n\nNobody talks about it though. Nurses in my social group always thought it was needless risky to instruct people not to aspirate the needles - cheap insurance.",

And I survived a clot on an artery of the medulla oblongata (bulbo raquídeo) with sequels/consecuences (sorry for my bas english).\nThat shit fucked my life. I'm mentally fine, and phisically I can walk and grab objects, but I lost A LOT of control and strength.\n\n\nJust take my advice: when someone shows some sort of parallisis, take them to a hospital. RUN! And if the stroke cannot be reverted, start rehabilitating soon, fast, and A LOT.",

If the mrna vaccines were not available, they'd probably still be using this one, maybe with more stringent criteria (i.e elder populations), as the society benefits would outweight the side effects. Most of their vaccine were sold to poorer countries that couldn't afford the mrna. With covid not being that threating anymore and with the updated vaccines that are mainly given to targeted populations, AZ's vaccine has no purpose whatsoever. I doubt this will have any impact on AZ's financials, although the stock price effects are a different thing.",

The concern with blood clots was known very early on...  I remember it being covered in the news.\n\nI don't think corners were cut or data manipulated in the way you're assuming...  almost all medications, vaccines, and treatments have risk, including risk of death from complications...  the question is always if the benefit outweighs risk, and given only 80 deaths due to clotting side effects vs whatever number of covid deaths were prevented, it would likely still be considered safe (if we didn't have other vaccine options available with lower risk).   I wouldn't expect a shit source like this with an agenda to mention those details, but just spinning the reporting into whatever sounds the most dramatic for their desired audience.\n\n\nEDIT... digging in a little more, the article tries to imply it was removed from the market because of these concerns...  it was not.  Risks were well known, came up again in a court transcript from February, and the article tries to say \"after it was revealed in court...\" as if that is connected.  It is not.   The company voluntarily removed their vaccine from the market, likely due to business reasons - competition with other covid vaccines that have lower associated risks likely makes a poor business case to continue supporting marketing and supply chain for a vaccine with low demand in the European market.   \n\nSeems it is only good news for the alt-right because it is expected they are too ignorant or gullible to fully understand what is being reported, and just read the spin as bias confirmation.  That is the intended audience for this publication, and I'm sure they love articles like this.",

Diagnosis took so long because A:It’s a rare disease and B:I don’t fit any of the criteria for developing it. I was active, fit and healthy before this illness, not at all overweight, and had never taken steroids or had radiotherapy/chemotherapy, these being the usual cause. \n\nAvascular necrosis is caused by a blood disorder which cuts off blood supply to bones in the hips/shoulders/knees. The bone then basically rots away. The last MRI showed that the top of my femur bone is pretty much gone, and my hip has collapsed. \n\nI’m at the point where I can no longer do anything for myself. I can’t walk, can’t work anymore and have had to claim disability. \n\nI’m having a total hip replacement next month. Hopefully this will alleviate the pain and make me mobile again. \n\nAfter lots of research into AVN, cases have been increasing in the last 3 years or so.
