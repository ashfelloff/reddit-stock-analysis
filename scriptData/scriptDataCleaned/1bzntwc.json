Faiz sebep, enflasyon sonuçtur). He kept dismissing central bank governors who attempted to raise the interest rates, and this policy came to be regarded as Erdoganomics. Erdogan's reading of the association between inflation and interest was simply defying the conventional economic wisdom and turning it upside down.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2023, Erdogan doubled down on keeping the interest rates and borrowing costs low, as he needed to stimulate the economic activity and reach higher annual growth figures to present to the electorate. Erdogan also backed up his anti-interest stance by underlining the Islamic understanding of the concept of interest, which is seen as an unjust enrichment of wealth. There are verses in the Qur'an that literally condemn giving or earning interest and deem the activity as a sin. When pressured, Erdogan did not hesitate to point to the canonical law to save the day. (tr. \"Nas var.\")\n\nBut came 2023, Erdoganomics was no longer sustainable. CPI reached triple-digit figures annually, around 120% for 2023 according to independent academics, and literally nobody trusts the official CPI data, which measures annual inflation around 65%. The administration burned the central bank's forex reserves to avoid raising the interest rates. The result? Central bank's net reserves dropped below -60 bn dollars in a couple of years. Imagine selling billions of dollars just to prove Erdoganomics is intact&viable. TRY thus tanked massively in between 2017-2023, with the road to further devaluation ahead.\n\nCouple these economic developments with the long-reigning social problems: jeopardized human rights and rule of law, institutionalized corruption, influx of millions of aliens etc.\n\nSo, Erdogan began bleeding at the polls. He failed to secure the presidential election in the first round. Just two weeks ago, for the first time ever, his party fell into the second place in the municipal elections. His party lost way too many votes in the industrialized and cosmopolitan cities, especially in Istanbul and Ankara.\n\nErdogan's ultimate aim has always been political survival. He simply ran out of cards to play. He had to backtrack from the experiment he initiated. He recently ceded the economy to the figures with actual economic expertise, appointing Simsek to the Ministry of Treasury and Finance, and Karahan to the central bank.\n\nNow he&the country will suffer the consequences of the world's most expensive economic experiment.",

In the past, it was the Western European pensioners (especially German and English) buying properties in Antalya, but for the last two years the city became a Russian oblast as we say.  \n\nI'd say the housing market is definitely overheated in the metropolises, it is now impossible for minimum wage earners to rent, let alone buy a house in Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir. The average rent in these cities exceed the monthly minimum wage.\n\nBut in the countryside, say central Anatolian towns or the east, housing prices continue to climb up because they are still pricing the wage hikes in January. And the costs of living have been much lower there, so civil servants in those cities can somewhat afford housing.\n\nLong story short, I expect a major correction in the turkish housing market (I mean how can housing in Istanbul be as expensive as Manhattan and London), but definitely not in the short term. Construction sector is what has been driving economic growth in the country for a decade, so the state would come up with new incentives to keep the bubble going (like buy a house, become a turkish citizen).",

We don't give a fuck about economics, we don't like systems, we don't care about future just give us fucking money and keep stable USD/TL.\n\nBefore you enter a market of this country, you should think many things not just once, at least thrice. You might think that US printing money, just watch the TCMB and see how the job is done! Which is another issue you should consider, because even stocks are up whatever%, you might still lose money in dollar currency. I'm too tired to post here the BİST 100 (in USD currency) ten-year performance, but you can check it. You will see BİST was ATH like 10 years ago.\n\nI forgot to wrote, this was nothing to do with experiment or sth like that. Don't listen if someone says this, Turkish people don't have the ability to analyze politics. It was all about elections, that's it.
