  "selftext": "The amount of underperformance is unrivaled. Six month ago it was the first time since the 1940s that small cap value underperformed SP500 over a 20 year period.(perhaps even longer, but the chart I had doesnt go back that far). Since that six months, the underperformance has widened even further 25%.\n\nThe top 10 names in the sp500 have typically been \\~19%, and was \\~27% at the peak of various bubbles. Now, it sits at 37%.\n\nAll this when there are interest rate cut forecasts for this year and the following year, which tends to help small cap value outperform (with that said, I remember when rates were going to rise in like 2012. They stayed on the floor for a decade even though every analyst was predicting rises every step of the way, so you could absolutely find a scenario being stuck at higher rates for a long long time)",

Sure the 1 & 15 may seem similar, but the level of innovation between them is immense.

Google glasses was incredibly innovative, untill the public realized they hated talking to people with them on. At the moment, they are innovating search as well due to the advent of AI\n\n\n\n>Windows XP was a much better experience overall than windows 11\n\nYou know I might agree with you on that one.

That does refute anything. \n\nEither way, don't get NVDA then if you dont like it, (BTW you don't need to spend an arm and a leg, a $300 GPU will get you an easy 60fps at  1440p on almost every game high settings, I've got one!) and it's also not a monopoly in gaming when you can buy other GPUs (like i did) from intel and amd, If anything it's nvdia is a monopoly in AI Inferencing chips for tech companies. Most wouldn't be caught dead with data centers running any chip other than one from NVDA! And for good reason!

And these are usually run by managers with MBAs. Most fund managers perform worse than an index fund.\n\nIf people that went to school for 6 years for finance fail to beat the market, what makes you think the average person can consistently beat the market?",

A decade of low interest rates resulted in a lot of older value companies loading up on debt to fund acquisitions, stock buybacks, etc. Growth companies like Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, etc have much less debt than value companies like AT&T.
