You have to remember that during a major recession, people are forced to sell their stocks at the absolute worst time just to survive. Stocks were extremely undervalued in 2009 and still quite undervalued in ‘10 and ‘11. It took until 2013 just to get back to the 2007 high. \n\nThe other thing to consider is that projected earnings growth is higher than it was then, and margins are significantly higher than they were then. So a higher multiple is justified. Add all of that together, and you get a pretty reasonable valuation for the stock market. Maybe high, but not “disconnected from reality” levels.",
