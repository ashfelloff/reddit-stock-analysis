              "body": "When the U.S. government placed Fannie Mae (FNMA) into conservatorship in 2008 during the financial crisis, it received certain rights as part of the bailout. One key element was the issuance of warrants to the U.S. Treasury, which gave the government the right to purchase up to 79.9% of Fannie Mae's common stock at a nominal price.\n\nSpecifically, the warrants allow the government to purchase this large stake in Fannie Mae for just $0.00001 per share, a move designed to give the Treasury significant potential upside if the company returned to profitability. The purpose of these warrants was to compensate the government (and ultimately taxpayers) for the risk it took in rescuing the company.\n\nThese warrants are still in place, and their exercise could significantly dilute the value of existing common shares if the government decides to convert them. The future of these warrants, along with other issues such as capital requirements and the company's potential exit from conservatorship, remains a major focus in discussions about the future of Fannie Mae",
