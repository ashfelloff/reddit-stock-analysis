I get that you're going to have tax on this but you've already done the trade so you're going to already have the deal with the tax. Situation. I would get it if you were worth 30 million, but if you're working, why are you looking a gift horse in the mouth?",

It pays a strong monthly dividend. You're basically loading up on long-term treasuries in an ETF but it's done through futures, like the fund is so that means you get to ride rates. If you look at where rates were during COVID and you look at the TLT chart, remember all those rate hikes? TLT goes straight down. Rate cuts, TLT up, how much? Hard to say, depends on how aggressive they get but just the cash generation aspect, the dividend payments. It's a good deal \n\nSecond, and there are lots of things that you could argue are good deals but here's the one you really have to think about. Your mental health, you did a really good job making a good deal of money. Coming from a working background that amount of money is what a lot of people are lucky to have when they're 65 years old. You did it earlier in life. If you screw this up and lose it, your mental health is going to suffer. You're feeling really good, things are going great, I don't have to point out all the posts of people who have lost fortunes in here. Don't be that guy, I don't think some of the guys in here actually recover after they take one of those massive losses. Depression, SSRIs, anxiety, that's their future",

I worked as an ER Tech a few yrs back, and one of the docs there (an emergency medicine Dr.) would always give me financial advice. The dude loved to trade stocks and do all sorts of things with this. You sir, basically provided this gentlemen the same sound advice that one of my old work friends suggested to me years ago.  At the time we were on shift and it got busy, so didn‚Äôt retouch the subject or go much more in-depth.  However, I clearly remember this man had one account that he said he had 1.3 million USD, and that the way it was set up it would generate 80+K a year in dividends. He would use that 80K to add to this same account, and add half of his yearly income to a different account. He basically lived off of half his work earnings per year. Guy only worked 10 shifts a month and made 220k a year.  Everything you are advising is exactly what I believe the Dr. had mentioned back then, and to this day I lost touch with him.  Honestly, I hope people run into your advice and take it serious because I have come across not one, but several very successful/ smart people that have vouched on this also. It is conservative, but in the long run it is aggressive passive income. \n\n\n\nIn my case, I honestly can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve been able to save much, or that I‚Äôm in any way financially stable (own a home, etc) I‚Äôm hoping that will change in the upcoming year or so. I finished a bachelors in radiologic sciences, and I am just barely starting that career path. Things are looking good so far, and falling into place. I‚Äôd say in CA averages about 120-150k a yr. I have very little knowledge in finances and investing, but am glad to join a community where there are genuine people with good intentions like yours.  Cheers dude, hope OP makes the wiser choice.",

People investing early, whatever that timescale means, would do well to sell as whatever event is attracting increasing attention nears and likely pulls in the more average or un savvy investors (regards). The sentiment may have basis but the stock price then tends to over run itself as lots of individual investors are naturally more emotional and flaky than institutional investors. \n\nThis commenter has the stock but aware of this volatility so might sell it.
