Dude not only been shilling China surpassing the US but the Yuan replacing the USD. Truly 🤡 tier stuff.\n\nRich people do not LOSE MONEY. They merely GET MORE TAX DEDUCTIONS. They'll squander and throw away their money one way or another. Some do it by buying yachts then selling them for less. Others burn their money away on clowns like Dalio or whatever hedge/bear managers they hire. Not really that different from WSB with robinhood/options/yolos.",
