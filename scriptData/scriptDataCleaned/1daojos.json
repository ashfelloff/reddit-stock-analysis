  "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/kkr-crowdstrike-godaddy-join-p-212736969.html\n\nKKR & Co. Inc., CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. and GoDaddy Inc. will join the S&P 500 as part of its latest quarterly weighting change. The companies will replace Robert Half Inc., Comerica Inc., and Illumina Inc, according to a press release from S&P Dow Jones Indices Friday. The changes are set to go into effect prior to the open of trading on Monday, June 24.\n\nNew York-based KKRâ€™s inclusion underscores the massive growth of the private investment business in recent years. KKR, founded in 1976 by Henry Kravis, Jerome Kohlberg and George Roberts, recently laid out a plan to reach at least $1 trillion of assets under management in five years, in part by courting retirees and individuals. Famous for its private equity moves, the firm has expanded across strategies from buyouts and credit to infrastructure, real estate and insurance.\n\n\nMeantime, CrowdStrike and GoDaddyâ€™s additions come as stock investors are flocking toward software companies in a bid to capture the growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Shares of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike rose 9% in after-hours trading. The stock has more than doubled over the past year to become the second-best performer in the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, surpassed only by Nvidia Corp.",
