I mean, who could have seen this coming? 16 million dollars! Can you believe it? It’s a big number, folks, a big, big number. And let me tell you, nobody loses money like I do. I lose the best money, the greatest money. People are saying it’s the best loss they’ve ever seen. Tremendous loss. Bigly.\n\nAnd you know, some people are saying, “Mr. Trump, how could this happen?” And I say, look, it’s not my fault. It’s China, it’s Sleepy Joe, it’s the deep state. They’re all conspiring against us, folks, and you know it. They don’t want to see me win. They don’t want to see DJT win because when DJT wins, America wins, and I win like nobody’s ever won before. But these crooks, these criminals, they, they just can’t stand it. So they make up this fake news about 16 million dollars disappearing, poof, just like that. But you know what? That’s fake money, anyway. Who needs it? We’ve got the real stuff, folks.\n\nAnd by the way, let me tell you, nobody knows more about stocks than I do. I’ve always been tremendous with stocks. The best, okay? They say, “Mr. Trump, you’re like a wizard with stocks!” And I say, yes, that’s true. I am. But sometimes, you know, the market just doesn’t get it, folks. It doesn’t appreciate greatness. It’s rigged, folks, totally rigged, just like the election.\n\nBut don’t worry, we’ll get it back, okay? Because I have a plan. It’s a tremendous plan. A plan so good that no one will ever lose money again. Not even a penny! And it’s going to be so beautiful, folks, so beautiful. You’ll see. Everyone’s going to be talking about it. They’ll say, “That Trump, he knows what he’s doing.” And believe me, when we’re done, DJT stock is going to be bigger than it’s ever been before. Just you watch. 16 million dollars? It’s going to look like pocket change. Tiny, so tiny. We’re going to turn this around so fast your head will spin. You’ll be dizzy with all the winning.\n\nSo, in conclusion, folks, remember this: I don’t lose money, okay? I don’t lose anything. This is all just a temporary hiccup, a bump in the road. And when we come back, and we will come back, folks, we’re going to be so much stronger. DJT is going to soar like you’ve never seen. Trust me. It’s going to be yuge. Absolutely yuge. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

Its implied, its how the stock market works, its largely institutionally owned.\n\nThe only reason DJT stock appreciated this past year aggressively is due to the upcoming election. If Donald trump loses, the stock will dump. If Donald trump wins, the stock will pump, largely driven by institutional forces.\n\nThe whole thing is also in a massive gray area, because he can essentially take political donations through the stock, and because nobody has ever been as brazenly selfish and stupid as trump, laws never had to be made for this type of outrageous ex-presidential behavior.\n\nJimmy Carter relinquished control of his farm to avoid any conflicts of interest when running for office and becoming president- today trump is taking backdoor political donations through a stock that has no intrinsic value.\n\nIt sounds quite pedestrian, and simple, because that is trumps relevant intelligence level (beside the main point) but when finance interns were pitching ideas to their hedge fund bosses, buying trumps stock in an election year probably sounded like a pretty easy way to make a quick buck to them, and I guess they turned out to be right.",
