I mean, who could have seen this coming? 16 million dollars! Can you believe it? It‚Äôs a big number, folks, a big, big number. And let me tell you, nobody loses money like I do. I lose the best money, the greatest money. People are saying it‚Äôs the best loss they‚Äôve ever seen. Tremendous loss. Bigly.\n\nAnd you know, some people are saying, ‚ÄúMr. Trump, how could this happen?‚Äù And I say, look, it‚Äôs not my fault. It‚Äôs China, it‚Äôs Sleepy Joe, it‚Äôs the deep state. They‚Äôre all conspiring against us, folks, and you know it. They don‚Äôt want to see me win. They don‚Äôt want to see DJT win because when DJT wins, America wins, and I win like nobody‚Äôs ever won before. But these crooks, these criminals, they, they just can‚Äôt stand it. So they make up this fake news about 16 million dollars disappearing, poof, just like that. But you know what? That‚Äôs fake money, anyway. Who needs it? We‚Äôve got the real stuff, folks.\n\nAnd by the way, let me tell you, nobody knows more about stocks than I do. I‚Äôve always been tremendous with stocks. The best, okay? They say, ‚ÄúMr. Trump, you‚Äôre like a wizard with stocks!‚Äù And I say, yes, that‚Äôs true. I am. But sometimes, you know, the market just doesn‚Äôt get it, folks. It doesn‚Äôt appreciate greatness. It‚Äôs rigged, folks, totally rigged, just like the election.\n\nBut don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get it back, okay? Because I have a plan. It‚Äôs a tremendous plan. A plan so good that no one will ever lose money again. Not even a penny! And it‚Äôs going to be so beautiful, folks, so beautiful. You‚Äôll see. Everyone‚Äôs going to be talking about it. They‚Äôll say, ‚ÄúThat Trump, he knows what he‚Äôs doing.‚Äù And believe me, when we‚Äôre done, DJT stock is going to be bigger than it‚Äôs ever been before. Just you watch. 16 million dollars? It‚Äôs going to look like pocket change. Tiny, so tiny. We‚Äôre going to turn this around so fast your head will spin. You‚Äôll be dizzy with all the winning.\n\nSo, in conclusion, folks, remember this: I don‚Äôt lose money, okay? I don‚Äôt lose anything. This is all just a temporary hiccup, a bump in the road. And when we come back, and we will come back, folks, we‚Äôre going to be so much stronger. DJT is going to soar like you‚Äôve never seen. Trust me. It‚Äôs going to be yuge. Absolutely yuge. Thank you. Thank you very much.",

Its implied, its how the stock market works, its largely institutionally owned.\n\nThe only reason DJT stock appreciated this past year aggressively is due to the upcoming election. If Donald trump loses, the stock will dump. If Donald trump wins, the stock will pump, largely driven by institutional forces.\n\nThe whole thing is also in a massive gray area, because he can essentially take political donations through the stock, and because nobody has ever been as brazenly selfish and stupid as trump, laws never had to be made for this type of outrageous ex-presidential behavior.\n\nJimmy Carter relinquished control of his farm to avoid any conflicts of interest when running for office and becoming president- today trump is taking backdoor political donations through a stock that has no intrinsic value.\n\nIt sounds quite pedestrian, and simple, because that is trumps relevant intelligence level (beside the main point) but when finance interns were pitching ideas to their hedge fund bosses, buying trumps stock in an election year probably sounded like a pretty easy way to make a quick buck to them, and I guess they turned out to be right.",
