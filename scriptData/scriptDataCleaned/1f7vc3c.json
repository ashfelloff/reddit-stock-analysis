It wasn't a rigged market. You bought a way OTM option, and it was expensive because there was a reasonable chance that a big earnings report might get the stock there. The earnings report passed, it didn't move that far, and after that there was fuck all chance the stock would get to your ludicrous strike price. Who was supposed to buy that option off you, now that there's 2 days to expiry and you'd need a 10% shift in price to make it profitable at expiry? Are they supposed to pay the same price, or similar, to what they would have paid when there was a huge catalyst coming before the expiry date? No, fuck no, your already remote-chance option is now a fucking pipe dream, so no asshole is going to pay a premium for it.\n\nIV crush is probably a great convenient shorthand for people who understand what an option is, but it has taken on the role amongst the regards of a mythical force that is doing gamblers dirty. This over-technicalisation has become something that people can use to sound knowledgeable while showing their whole ass by admitting their idiocy. Options have two parameters, strike and expiry, and the price is set by what people think the chance of profit is. The Greeks are a way to try and break this down into some constituent parts, they're not the cause of price changes.\n\nWhat do I hope to achieve from this? I don't know, fuck you. Long live the casino. Buy options that aren't stupid.\n\nP.s. I do not buy options that aren't stupid, but I don't whinge about it (much) afterwards.",

IV is nothing more or less than what a formula spits out to you after it has considered all the known variables that could explain the price of an option (known variables being things like: price of stock, the strike price of the option, date to expiry etc..). Whatever that formula can't attribute to the observable variables in order to explain the current price of the option, the formulas attributes that \"unknown\" factor to \"Implied Volatility\".\n\nSo basically, to make it very simple, it is saying to you, \"Look, here are all the known variables, and based on these known variables, the price of this option should be 'X', but since the price of the option in the market is NOT 'X', it is in fact 'Y', there is some unknown factor in play which is affecting the price of this option, and I will call this unknown factor as 'Implied Volatility'\"\n\nThere is a reason it is called IMPLIED, and not OBSERVABLE or ACTUAL. It is implied from what? From the current price of the option. It is a fake number that doesn't exist in reality. It is given to you so you can judge that this option is trading richly or cheaply than what it is supposed to be trading at, that's all (and to do that, looking at it by itself is useless; you need to compare it to the normal IV level the underlying is usually trading at).",
