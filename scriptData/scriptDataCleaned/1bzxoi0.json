This is their speculative opinion.\n\n![img](emote|t5_2th52|12787)",

The royalties had been split so many times due to passing down to kids, grandkids, etc, that they didn't pay hardly anything anymore. My dad was earning about $300 a month off his appx. 1/32 share.\n\nAll the while, he would get little offers from various royalty buyers to purchase his contract. Usually, the price was somewhere around $4-5k... until about 4 years ago.\n\nSuddenly, people started contacting my dad (also my aunt and uncle, who also had a 1/32 share) with offers of $100k+\n\nMy aunt and uncle both sold at different times, one at $100k and the other at $150k, but Dad held out.\n\nHe finally sold in the summer of 2022 for around $400k. That's $400k for a lease earning $300 a month in royalties.\n\n(He immediately bought an EV and a solar panel array.)\n\nRussia attacked Ukraine a few months later.\n\nOf course, it could all be coincidence.",
