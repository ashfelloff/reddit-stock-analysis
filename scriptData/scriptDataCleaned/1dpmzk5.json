The only thing they can sellout of is their rereleased retro shoes.\n\nNothing else sticks. They've increased the price of plain classics from 90 to 115\n\nThe generation that grew up being sneakerheads also ain't spending as much anymore\n\nYounger gen doesn't care about their retro releases because they didn't grow up with them. This has also brought a rise in new brands in the footwear space",

This worked in the beginning for the short term when it came to increasing the value of a sneaker but it failed them in their future acquisition of the younger generations as most people gave up trying to get their fav sneakers. Top with ugly designs, terrible color ways, and overpricing. The quality of their shoes also has gone down mind you.\n\nI don't see them recovering ever again. They aren't a quality brand.
