From what I’ve researched… it seems that six flags stock will cease to exist on July 2nd and cedar parks (FUN) will be the only ticker after the merger. Does this means that out of the money options become useless on the 2nd? \n\nIf that is the case, then why were my puts up on Friday? \n",

At that time, trading in the options of the previous entities will cease and all options on that security that were out-of-the-money will become worthless. Generally, this is determined by the very last closing price on that stock.",

Upon the closing of the Mergers, (i) Cedar Fair’s units, which currently trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “FUN” and (ii) Six Flags’ common stock, which currently trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SIX,” will cease to be listed on the NYSE following the closing of the Mergers and will each be deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Immediately following the closing of the Mergers, the combined company will be renamed “Six Flags Entertainment Corporation” and trading of the combined company’s common stock on the NYSE is expected to begin on the day following the Expected Closing Date, July 2, 2024, under the ticker symbol “FUN.”",
