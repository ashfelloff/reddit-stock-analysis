  "selftext": "I think people who keep saying that the Fed has a lot of ammo this time around don't realize that inflation is still well above target.  The Fed realizes that any pre-mature cuts, like what happened during the 70's stagflationary period, might re-ignite inflation.  They're somewhat backed into a corner.  My guess is they will think like economists: worry about the short term, because in the long run, we're all dead anyways.  However, they won't start emergency cuts because markets are falling.  They will cut if there's other bigger systemic issues like the money market fiasco in 2018.  The problem is when a year or so, inflation starts printing higher.  They will be fucked.  We'll be heading towards stagflation.",

You’re saying that corporations and investors, who currently own less than 1% of the total housing stock, are interested in propping up housing prices rather than letting them drop, despite their primary goal of maximizing profits. Even though buying at lower prices would let them acquire more properties at a better rate, you’re suggesting they prefer higher prices to avoid devaluing the small portion of the market they own? And this strategy would supposedly work, even though their market share is too small to exert significant control over national housing prices? And all this, during the average time-horizon of a downturn/recession?\n\nI absolutely agree that there is massive risk in continuing  to allow corporations to increase their ownership and position in the market, and at a point in the future, this will become a huge risk.
