He can exercise or sell at any point before that.\n\nIf at any point McD goes back to the $316 it was at, he could exercise these options, which requires loads of cash obviously. But let's se he did that and then immediately sold them, he would gain (316-300-9.78), so roughly $6 per option. Options are traded in bundles of 100. He has bought 60 bundles. So that would make it $36,000.\n\nInstead of exercising he can also sell the options, which will yield a similar return.",
