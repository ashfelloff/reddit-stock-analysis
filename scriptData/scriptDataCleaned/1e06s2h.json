  "selftext": "Just got back from the farmers market, prices are through the roof again, tomatoes $0.89 in June are now $1.29 - $1.49 for a way shittier quality. Everything was ~20%+ more expensive but consistently dogshit. A major factor for lower inflation in May and June was food price stagnation. Tomorrows CPI report should also show a small, negligible increase in CPI as expected, but next months report is gonna tank the markets as prices skyrocket once again",

Boba so mainstream now you can get it almost anywhere with boba icecream, canned boba tea, tea spots on most blocks in the West coast, at bakeries like 85degrees, fastfood places like Yoshinoya, or even at fucking Starbucks. If you're paying $9.13 at a nice tea place then you should get something nice like Taro MT with real Taro, Hokkaido MT or Oolong MT with grass jelly, real fruit in real teas like seasonal Mango in Jazmine rather generic powder pack or flavor shot, Strawberry Matcha MT if you're an IG addict, etcetcetc.",
