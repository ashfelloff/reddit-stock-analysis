Will Oracle offer real meaningful applications of the tech? Thats the billion dollar question. \n\n  \nI will caution... you are really comparing apples to oranges here. NVDA dropped because of unrealistic expectations not being met. They're still the best pure AI play long term (best analogy is selling shovels to gold miners) .\n\n  \nThe common thread however was GUIDANCE  is what lead to  both drops. NVDA didnt offer anything new or improved guidance (optimistic people were expecting this as NVDA has revised guidance radically in the past leading to massive gains). DG's guidance was revised lower. \n\n  \nYou need to look into the OI and when those purchases occurred. Market has been pretty volatile in the last 3 months, these could be options bought when everyone thought we were drilling to a major correction. stock was at 124 on 8/7, so 120 was not out of the question by any means. OI on calls up from 140-160 is like 50k-ish combined. I'd guess max pain is 140 based on OI",
