The US alone uses 1.3 million megawatts. So you’d need roughly 187 *million* battery farms of the same size as the Hornsdale Power Reserve to run the IS on battery power for one day. \n\nAt a cost of $21.6 quadrillion US dollars. Yes, costs have come down since it was built so you’d think it would cost less per mwh but there’s nowhere near enough lithium available to do it at this scale so it’s a moot point anyway. \n\nAnd that’s just the US. To put the world’s power generation on battery power, it’d be $144 quadrillion. That’s the entire GDP of the world for well over 100 years.",

The only thing thing that can potentially disrupt the Nuclear Imperative for terrestrial power is space based on solar.\nThe hyperscalers are already talking about 5GW data centers. Datacenters require 24/7 clean, baseload power. That's not what solar or wind farming offer. At today's average efficiency and capacity factors, it would require ~160k acres of pv to power a 5GW datacenter. Then you would still need overbuild, discreet redundant pv fields in diverse geographies, the storage and transmission infrastructure.\nAnd the datacenters likely won't stop at 5GW.\nLand limits and decarbonization (nuclear produces about 1/3 of the CO2 during its lifecycle as solar) will be their driving factors.

The up front capital costs are enormous, and it takes decades to recoup the investment. Making things worse, many states and countries have deregulated their electricity grids, which has completely killed investment in nuclear. When electricity prices are allowed to fluctuate, nuclear becomes too risky. \n\nNuclear only works with a regulated electricity grid (which delivers stable prices and guaranteed return on investment), and it also requires government subsidies.",

Soon all those major uranium producers will be forced to buy uranium from current production of smaller producers, taking those pounds away from end users. \n\nCompanies like Peninsula Energy, Lotus Resources, Paladin Energy, EnCore Energy, will significantly benefit from this. Why?\n\nBecause they have some future production left they didn't commit to end users yet. The consequence is that those uncommited pounds can be sold at the spotprice to those major producers creating huge earnings to those smaller producers\n\nTheir future uranium production will not solve the annual deficit, but they will greatly benefit from it.\n\n**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own due diligence before investing**\n\nCheers",

Xi's first foreign trip after covid started with Khazakhstan, that's how strategic this relationship is. What this means, most likely, is that uranium prices in the west will go up regardles of the AI situation, making it less competitive against coal/gas/renevables.\n\nTL;DR  \nUranium is a secondary bet on AI and if it fails (and unless SMRs turn out to be the future, and real quick) there's no nuclear renaissance in the close future.",
