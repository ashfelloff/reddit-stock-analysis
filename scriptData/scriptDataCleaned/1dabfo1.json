That massive dip was when NVDA tanked 10% and I was holding some long dated calls. Now I focus just on day trades and no longer hold overnight. I sleep in peace.",

I always check for the expiration date, but my goal was to buy the dip ASAP as I saw it touch the level of support I had drawn. I saw the account value drop about 8K in a matter of seconds and then I realized my mistake and sold it as soon as I saw the first green candle.",
