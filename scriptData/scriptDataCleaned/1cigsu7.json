      "body": "Options trading should be classified as a form of gambling. You will never be able to anticipate global news and investor sentiment before it happens, and high frequency algorithmic trading done by institutions will not only be ahead in terms of comprehending the news, they are literally hired wired directly into the stock market servers so that their trades will always be executed near instantaneously.\n\nBig US banks like JP Morgan essentially make their money off fools. If people instead actually invested their money, like how pension funds do, where they typically only sell a small fraction of their position each month and keep the rest invested, then naturally you'd make money, as the market will continue to accumulate more and more funds as the population and wages increase.\n\nThere is no get rich quick scheme that will work. Take your hard earned money and put it to work for *you*, and stop lining the pockets of US banks execs with your cash!",
