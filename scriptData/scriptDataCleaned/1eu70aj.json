I'm guessing the union will push for a 20% or higher increase and higher starting wages, not sure what Boeing will be able to come up with seeing as they're hemorrhaging cash. They need to increase their starting wages though, the current IAM contract has aerospace workers getting paid the same or less than they can make at fast food restaurants in the area, while dangling a carrot of ~80k+ salaries after ~8 years or whatever their vesting period is. Their current pay structure doesn't attract the \"cream of the crop\" as evidenced by the door plugs coming off midflight.\n\nhttps://www.iam751.org/",
