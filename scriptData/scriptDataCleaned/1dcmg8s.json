  "score": 66,
  "selftext": "**The TL;DR**\n\n* **SG&A Cuts Is The Only Way to Grow** - Given the current state of the US pet industry, the only way Petco can meaningfully grow profits is through cutting SG&A. Every 1% point of SG&A cut, adds \\~6% points of EBITDA growth\n\n* **Prior Leadership Didn't Touch SG&A - Now They're Out** - SG&A spend has conspicuously grown while Petco struggled. It's not surprising then that the CEO, COO, and \"Chief Customer Officer\" have been pushed out. Petco's Board clearly wants more bold leadership to turnaround the struggling pet retailer\n\n* **Ample Room to Reduce SG&A** - Comparing current SG&A spend against (i) historical levels as well as (ii) Petsmart indicate there's well over $215M of SG&A reduction opportunity\n\n* **Margin of Safety on 2024 Performance** - Given that market share losses are abating and gross margins are stabilizing, current trends imply Petco's 2024E Adj. EPS will be $0.00. However, the consensus analyst forecast is for $(0.05). Petco’s financial performance thus has room to underperform against recent trends, limiting near-term downside risk on the stock\n\n* **Only Need to Be Right \\~10% Of The Time** – If new leadership is able to cut $215M of SG&A spend, we could see the stock rise up to $13.46 a share (+269%). The downside to Petco’s stock price is likely $2.45 (-33%), the price before Petco’s 1Q 2024 earnings. While speculative on how new leadership will act, this bet only needs to work \\~10% of the time to be profitable\n\nThis is not financial advice / recommendation to invest in Petco. I'm just memorializing my reasons for buying Petco. Currently holding 13,750 shares.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/h66l9iyi4r5d1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=533c616defc81ed5426b1a708fc4e9fc7c63185f\n\n**Cutting SG&A is the Only Way to Meaningfully Grow EBITDA**\n\nWe can think of how Petco can grow profits with a simple framework: either (i) increase revenue, (ii) expand gross margins, or (iii) cut SG&A spend.\n\nThe opportunity to grow revenue is very small. The US pet industry is forecasted to grow 2% this year. Petco, unfortunately, has a revenue mix that skews more heavily towards supplies & live animals (35% of Petco LTM revenue vs. 21% for the industry), which is forecasted to not grow at all. With Petco struggling to maintain market share and low overall market growth, Petco cannot rely on revenue growth to grow profits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ggv80zll4r5d1.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d90f45eec8c63597a1aab270c2706b537e36885\n\nFurthermore, Petco's gross margin faces headwinds. Sales of discretionary Supplies & Companion Animals (e.g., toys, clothes, litter boxes) -- which are \\~70 points higher margin than Consumables (e.g., pet food, treats) -- have been declining as pet owners focused on essentials in the face of high inflation. What's more, Petco began introducing value brands (Fancy Feast, Pedigree) to its merchandising strategy last year, further dragging margins. With these headwinds at play, Petco's efforts to squeeze out gross margin improvement amounts to little more than running just to stay-in-place.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8q2sz2cp4r5d1.png?width=1075&format=png&auto=webp&s=e0a58a6170a5d9a60af688f477d6bb5cd2bd4cab\n\n**Prior Management Let SG&A Grow, Despite Challenging Market**\n\nThat leaves cutting SG&A spend to grow EBITDA. Curiously, SG&A spend has actually continuously grown year-over-year. Progress on the $150M of run-rate cost savings announced in 2Q 2023 (of which $40M was supposed to be achieved in year one, much of it in G&A) are nowhere to be seen.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/su3ilzbs4r5d1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=bca83e938f8e16a7ef81820d8191e996b845ee10\n\n**Ample Room to Reduce SG&A**\n\nThere should be opportunity to cut SG&A spend, however. Historically, Petco spent between 32-35% of its revenue on SG&A. Petsmart, a lower-end pet retail chain, historically spent between 25-27% of its revenue on SG&A. If Petco were to reduce its SG&A spend back to historical levels, there would be $215M of EBITDA uplift. Notably, this would only amount to a 9% reduction in SG&A spend but generate a 59% lift to EBITDA.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7v67faev4r5d1.png?width=1037&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7871f479e0cbe1b0e48f74723b3b92165c114db\n\nIt's notable that Ron Coughlin (Petco's prior CEO) did not try to cut SG&A.  He joined Petco in 2018 when it was struggling against ecommerce competition and revamped Petco's strategy -- focusing on omnichannel selling, a premium merchandising assortment and a vet hospital network buildout.  Under his leadership, Petco went from declining comparable sales to 18 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth.\n\nAs much as that performance deserves respect, he also benefitted from a strong pet retailing backdrop.  During his 5 years at Petco, the US pet industry grew at a 10% CAGR, boosted by a surge of pet adoptions during COVID.  Now the US Pet Industry has entered a period of low growth (2% growth for 2024E).  I find it reasonable (and astute) that the Board would want new leadership.  Ron drove a turnaround in Petco focusing on growing revenue with a strong pet industry backdrop.  Today, Petco needs leadership that's focused on cost containment to weather the next few years.\n\n**Margin of Safety on 2024 Performance**\n\nWhat prior management has done is stabilized the business. Last year management announced an \"operational reset\" whereby Petco would start offering value brands and drive gross margin improvement with merchandising optimization & supply chain efficiency.\n\nWith the 1Q 2024 earnings report and 2Q 2024 guidance ($1.525B of revenue and $(0.02) EPS), we’re now seeing Petco’s rate of market share loss abating and gross margins stabilizing. Continuation of these trends would result in 2024 Revenue of $6.21B and Adj. EPS of $0.00.\n\nHowever, consensus analyst forecasts are more conservative ($6.15B of Revenue and $(0.05) of EPS), which would only happen if either (i) Petco misses its 2Q 2024 guidance or (ii) its performance deteriorated in 2H 2024. Perhaps analysts feel the need for extra conservatism given last year 3Q’23 miss on Revenue and EPS. Or perhaps analysts feel the need to bake in extra conservatism because Petco is not providing full year guidance given the management transition. Ultimately though, that conservatism creates a margin of safety for share price performance and skews the risk in favor of Petco beating analyst forecast.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo0tzkvz4r5d1.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=c446470845f8b2fb65e62221d4eb0b00324ef9fc\n\n**$13.46 – Upside Target on Share Price**\n\nGrowing EBITDA is absolutely critical to unlocking value with Petco.  Currently, Petco trades at a discount to its 2015 Buyout and 2021 IPO valuation.  Much of this is due to Petco’s bleak prospects – a low growth market and gross margin headwinds.  Additionally, with EBITDA now at $366M and interest expense at $145M, Petco struggles to generate sufficient FCF to invest in the business, such as opening more vet hospitals.\n\nCutting SG&A spend by $215M would put the company back in a position to invest & drive secular growth. I would expect the valuation of the company to re-rate back to 9.0x EBITDA, translating to a $13.46 share price (269% premium to current levels).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9atz4b35r5d1.png?width=1052&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fd5f16fc5dc24ac622e5492e2253885d1994b29\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nI'm an outsider sitting behind a desk with no experience in pet retailing. Perhaps prior leadership already looked into cutting SG&A spend and had a good reason to leave it untouched.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the leadership ranks have been shaken up at Petco.  The stock is down big from its 2021 IPO price of $18 a share and Petco's private equity owners (CVC Capital Partners and CPPIB) now are coming on their 9th year of holding this investment.  As far as I can tell, they did not pull a dividend recap during their hold period and have not recouped their investment yet.  They need the stock price up and fast.\n\nSo while I'm speculating on how new leadership will act, I think it's a well-educated guess.  And that I only need to be right \\~10% of the time, I think this is a positive EV bet.",

I think we're still early in the turnaround.\n\n**March 13, 2024** - Petco announces CEO transition alongside 4Q 2023 earnings result. Ron Coughlin -- the CEO that successfully arrested Petco's market share losses to ecommerce players and led the company to 18 consecutive quarters of comparable sales growth is ousted.  Petco results are in-line with expectations but withdraws full year guidance given the management transition. Stock goes from $2.52 to $2.06 (-18%) on the news\n\n**April 4, 2024** - Petco files to the SEC (but no press release) that they terminated their Chief Customer Officer\n\n**Month of April 2024** - Stock continues to trade down to an all-time low of $1.50 a share\n\n**May 14, 2024** - Petco announces the appointment of Glenn Murphy as Executive Chairman. Glenn has a track record of leading turnarounds (notably Lululemon -- where he was named co-chairman in 2017 when the stock price was $50.63 vs current share price of $305).  As part of Glenn's appointment, he buys up $2.5M worth of Petco stock at $1.70 a share with a 2-year lock-up period.  Glenn will be helping Petco find a new CEO.  Stock rises 28% on the news to $2.61 a share\n\n**May 22, 2024** - Petco announces 1Q 2024 earnings release that beats analyst EPS expectations by $0.02. Importantly, 1Q 2024 product gross margins jumped to 38.1% (170 bps sequential improvement over 4Q 2023 and notably break from the down trend with the last 6 quarters of data available). 2Q 2024 guidance of $1.525B of revenue and $(0.02) EPS implies a stabilization of the business.  Stock rises 18% to $2.88 a share.\n\n**May 28, 2024** - Petco announces an \"evolution\" of their leadership team. They bring an outsider (James Roth, previously with Abercrombie & Fitch) to be their Chief Stores Officer and promotes an internal hire to Interim Chief Merchant.  They also quietly announced in the press release the departure of their Chief Operating Officer with no intention of replacing.  Stock trades down 4.5% on the day to $3.42 though unclear how much the press release impacted that movement as the stock's daily movements have become more volatile.\n\n**May 23, 2024 - Present** - Stock has been on an upward trend since the 1Q 2024 earnings release with volatile daily movements, reaching a near-term high of $4.38 a share. My best guess is this is from momentum traders that had shorts on Petco covering their position (as of May 15, 2024 -- 32% of public float was shorted) resulting in quick but short-lived pumps to the stock",

It remains to be seen how Petco trades tomorrow but Joel Anderson & the Board think it's likely the stock will rally on the announcement of the new CEO appointment.\n\nIn Joel's offer letter, his $5M of option grants has the ability to increase based on the rise in the 30-day VWAP between (x) the announcement of Joel's appointment (July 17, 2024) and (y) Joel's start date (July 29, 2024).  Further the options have a strike price of $5.00 and $7.50 but there's language to ensure his options strike price will not be less than the trading price of Petco on the grant date (i.e., July 29, 2024).  \n\nIt's pretty interesting stuff. I interpret this as Joel saying to the Board, \"if my mere appointment to CEO causes the stock to rise, I want to get compensated for it\".  And the Board saying, \"I fear that Joel's options will become in-the-money between now and July 29, 2024 and so I need an ability to adjust the strike price upwards\".\n\nNext couple of trading sessions will be interesting for sure\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1826470/000119312524180399/d845993d8k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1826470/000119312524180399/d845993d8k.htm)",

There's no cash flow to spend on remodeling stores or opening up new vet clinics. I'd only see slashing SG&A spend to grow\n\nAnd I think there's a ton of pressure for whoever comes in to do something big to grow EBITDA. CVC Capital / CPPIB have been holding onto their investment for 9 years now. I doubt they're going to hire a CEO who says they're gonna grow revenue or expand gross margins, cause that's what Ron Coughlin tried to do. At best that strategy allows them to tread water. What they're going to want is a CEO that's going to be ruthless with SG&A spend",

I would estimate that the remaining \\~$1.2B of SG&A expense is mostly payroll and benefit costs (e.g., health insurance)",

That means Petco is gonna have a horrible quarter. \n\nThe only way brick and mortar store can compete with Chewy is via service that require physical presence, like vet care, boarding and grooming.
