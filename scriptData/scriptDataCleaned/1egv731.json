Like if you have an option that is currently at +20% gain, just set a stop loss around 15%. Then once it's at +50% gain, change your stop loss to 35-40%. That way, your option can still run higher if you want to let it, but you'll lock in profit no matter what.

Take a break and reevaluate your next move. Over time that will grow and snowball \n\n- if it‚Äôs stressing you out do not do overly short term trades that are out of the money or risky. Buy longer term in the money safer contracts. Even if it‚Äôs just 2-3 weeks. It lowers profits but makes gains far more steady and consistent. And even losses are significantly lowered and quickly won back. That way you‚Äôre not constantly watching every movement stressed that option expiring soon is gonna go down",
