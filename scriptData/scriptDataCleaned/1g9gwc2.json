So here are predictions I have found:\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\nUBS says SP&500 could reach 6,600 by the end of 2025 which is 13% up from current level.\n\nGoldman Sachs says S&P500 will reach 6,000 by the end of 2024 and 6,300 by the end of 2025.\n\nNEGATIVE:\n\nBarry Bannister (chief equity strategist at Stifel) says that S&P500 in 2025 will return to where 2024 began (that is at 4,609).\n\n\nIf you know for any other prediction, write it in the comment.",

People tend to only cite predictions when they come true, but incorrect predictions are lost. I feel like we should hold people who make predictions accountable for both correct and incorrect ones, in order to deter blanket statements and encourage people to give better explanations when their predictions fail to come true. ",

                  "body": "I do combinations of tons of games. \n\nI do almost exclusively two team teaser's. (A teaser gives you the actual line plus 6 points in your favor) (In some cases I also use alternate lines or alternate stats like if a rcvr is set for 38 yards maybe I will buy over 25.5 yards and parlay that with a money line college football favorite anything to get close to somewhere between even money to -120ish.)\n\nSo for example this past week, I bet on:\n\nRams +3.5\nChargers +4\nWashington -5\nChiefs +3.5\nEagles +2.5\nSeattle and ATL over 41.5\nLions +8\nJaguars +0.5\nBroncos/saints over 32.5\n(I had detr/min over total but I forgot the number)\nUGA +9.5\nNotre dame -7.5\nBYU - 2\nOregon total under 66\n\nAlot of those I would have lost with the normal line. But because I teased it I got a lot of wins that could have been losers with a single -110 side or total \n\n(And I bet a few others - those are the ones I remember off top of my head and a quick look at my paper). I made like 50+ different two team teaser's in a round robin style mix of all these different bets. Takes me a few hours to mix around all the bets.....but I don't really do it straight for two hours cause i don't really have an excel doc to mix them properly - I just do it based on which games are starting soon. Put in a couple bets. Watch a game for a bit do a couple more. Watch a bit do a few more. Etc. it's part of my afternoon routine both Saturday and Sunday. And I put in a few bets through out the week whenever I hear news that says my opinion on a game I will buy 4-5 teasers on that particular game. I write them all down and keep track on paper so I don't end up with too many copies of the same bet and risk too much on variance.\n\nMost folks say - it's dumb to play a teaser cause you need two things to happen - but when I run 50+ of them - I have like 3-4 versions of each bet so every one that misses I lose 3-4 bets. Everyone that wins I win 3-4 bets. \n\nBut no one realizes how often the book makers are right on. You could literally bet every game. Bet both sides of every NFL game. Just the spread +6 (or some totals if you feel it's perfect)\n\nLast night if you bet a teaser on bucks and ravens - you had buccs +10.5 and ravens +1.5 results - ravens won by 10. You win both bets. \n\nIf you had a teaser on chargers/Cardinals you had chargers + 4 or Cardinals +8 results - Cardinals won by 2. You win both bets. \n\nCause the odds makers get it pretty close almost Everytime.(But not Everytime of course)\n\nAnd if you have +6 points in your advantage you would probably come out ahead every week. Add in there a little bit of sports knowledge and intuition to avoid a few losers and you can be profitable.\n\nSometimes if a teaser would result in landing on a key number I will buy +6.5 or +7 instead of +6. (Like if real line is -3... +6 would give you +3. I need plus 3.5 for it to be a profitable play cause so many games are won by exactly 3 points) \n\nI had two weekends last year where I lost money. The other 16-17 weeks I was plus money. \n\nThis year I am plus money on 6 of 7 weeks and the week I lost was because I bet too much on the Padres (baseball) as a gut feeling. Wasn't related to football at all. If I stick to my teasers game I do pretty well.\n\nI don't need subscribers. In fact I don't really enjoy sharing my complicated ass system because if the books saw thousands of people doing my system they might shut it down somehow or make teasers -150 instead of -120 or minus -130.",

For example, **Goldman Sachs** raised its target for the S&P 500 to **4,900** by the end of 2022, implying a 4% gain for the year. **UBS** was even more optimistic, setting a target of **5,000**, which would represent a 12% increase from 2021 levels.\n\nThese forecasts were based on expectations of continued earnings growth and a favorable economic environment\n\n.

Last but not least all the stocks are already priced at waaaaayyy overhyped forward multiples… if you look at the 10-15 year charts it  is pretty scary because there is simply no way it can continue the trend. The COVID pandemic literally caused the markets to sky rocket simply because of FOMO and conventional/retail investors, then Crypto craze and now AI oblivion… what gives???",
