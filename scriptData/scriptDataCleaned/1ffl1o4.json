The identities of these investors are uncertain, but such a significant move in LUNR often signals that someone has privileged information.\n\nToday, Benzinga's options scanner spotted 10 options trades for Intuitive Machines. This is not a typical pattern.\n\nThe sentiment among these major traders is split, with 70% bullish and 20% bearish. Among all the options we identified, there was one put, amounting to $53,400, and 9 calls, totaling $488,000.”",

If they drop 10% or so and still close to strike price, I might double down. I don’t know if this is a wise strategy but I figure if I spend $1,000 on ten stocks at around $100 each stock in total, I hope maybe 3 expire worthless, two I sell around break even and four I sell at over 100% profit. Sometimes 2–300% quick profit. With my simple mind and simple math, I’m just looking for 20–50% overall profit in the entire scenario I described. I also wait until the market drops on consecutive days and then I place a call buy order on these ten stocks I think will go up and have decent volume and IV. \nWhat do you think?",
