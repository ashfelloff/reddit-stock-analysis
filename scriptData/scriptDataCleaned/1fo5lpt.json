  "selftext": "I hunt Aoudad in the Permian Basin. Specific the border of NM and TX. I‚Äôve done this for years. This year was strange. Tons of tech bros down there. Mostly on the TX side. They were hanging out with the rich oil guys. Or hanging out by themselves and being all standoffish and weird. \n\nI‚Äôve never seen a tech bro in this part of the world before. There‚Äôs something wrong, and I‚Äôd like to make some money off it. \n\nAny ideas? ",

There can be all sorts of issues around intellectual property.\n\nEdit: I should add the obvious potential conflict of interest where Company 1 and Company 2 do business together.

CNG (compressed natural gas) is a fuel for large scale generators.   No need to hook to the grid. \n\nChevron, Oxydental, and ExxonMobil are major Permean Basin players. \n\nCrypto processing doesn't require many people to handle the operation.  Its basically a plug and monitor situation. With an ocassional component being replaced in the data center.   Much like a modern telephone switching station.  \n\nOnce it's built. An entire operation can be staffed with fewer than 20 people. \n\nEven houses in and around the basin are dirt cheap.
