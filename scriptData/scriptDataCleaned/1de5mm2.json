  "selftext": "* **April** **CPI rose 3.3% over the last 12 months vs the expected 3.4%**\n* **Over the prior month, CPI-U (CPI for All Urban Consumers) has remained unchanged on a seasonally adjusted basis, a deceleration from April's 0.3% month-over-month increase. That would also be the smallest month-over-month rise since October 2023.**\n* **Energy prices fell in May on seasonally adjusted basis due to a decline in gasoline prices. This is a relief for consumers after gas prices had increased in April and March.  Gas prices are likely to continue to decline in the near-term with the lowering of crude prices.**\n* **Core CPI** (Strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas) **is 3.4% vs the expected rise of 3.5% over last year, which is a significant slowdown from the 3.6% annual increase seen in April and the 3.8% in March.**\n\nThe economy would benefit drastically if the interest hike reached a peak, and started to turn around.\n\nLoans are much less likely to go on to default as inflation comes down.\n\nA study by credit agency TransUnion has shown that inflation pushes borrowers with low FICO scores to default. Default is always a concern for investors of lending institutions.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell is more likely to cut the rate this year sooner than later as inflation comes down.\n\nThe CPI report, interest rate hikes, house prices and rents, wage growth, job openings, unemployment rate, international conflicts, and trade wars all play a significant role in guiding the market's microenvironment.\n\n\"In May, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers was unchanged, seasonally adjusted, and rose 3.3 percent over the last 12 months, not seasonally adjusted. The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.2 percent in May (SA); up 3.4 percent over the year (NSA).\"\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)",

They were stuck with a tough decision, do you set up a system to carefully vet people and give them money, but risk destroying many jobs in the interim because this vetting and oversight takes a lot of time to set up, or do you just give the money out in a crude way to save business while also giving money to businesses who don’t need it.\n\nThis is just a tough decision.

Most peoples buying power is lower than it was before.\n\nI encourage you to actually discuss these issues in good faith, because so far you don't seem to know how. \n\nEither that or you can't read. Go back and look at my comment. \"Wage growth has been outpacing inflation for the past **year.**\"\n\nI never said anything about wage growth since the *pandemic*. You can choose whatever arbitrary point in time you'd like to make whatever point you'd like, but you won't get around the fact that both the recent and current trend has been for wages to outpace inflation, which is the only thing that matters at this point and time. \n\nIn case you hadn't realized, the once in a century pandemic is over.\n\n>If their buying power is lower they buy less goods and services by definition if they buy less goods and services there is less growth.\n\nAnd yet that hasn't been occurring, which you'd realize if you had been paying attention. Consumer spending has remained high, which is what has been driving inflation.\n\nYou can't help but seem to get everything wrong. \n\n>Also this trend predates the pandemic. Every penny of median wage growth for decades has been Women growing closer to boomer men wages. If you are an uneducated male your wages have absolutely plummeted compared to boomer era.\n\nNo, it doesn't. As you can see [here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1351276/wage-growth-vs-inflation-us/) prior to March 2021 wage growth was outpacing inflation. \n\nAs for uneducated men, I'm not giving that much credence without a source, but your take is still bizarre even if that part is true since it doesn't include educated men, and ignores the reality that growth isn't linear or even among all segments of society, something everyone ought to know. \n\n>S&P valuation is absurd even with their historical earnings. There is too much dry powder and no one has anywhere to park their money.\n\nWhich you just base on big numbers being scary. Based on earnings growth and forward forecast it's really not. \n\n>There is lots of deflationary pressures coming. Social security is going to be insolvent in less than a decade.\n\nThere's an easy fix as long as there's the political will. Remove the cap and SS will be solvent indefinitely. \n\n>Average age is increasing rapidly. Young people have less discretionary spending.\n\nThe first one is true, the second is more nuanced, since young people have had no problem spending recently. \n\n> There are other speculative/politically charged things I wont bring up to distract from the general idea but the growth projections needed to justify current valuations are frankly absurd.\n\nPretty much everything you've said is politically charged/speculative, and mostly wrong, lacking context, or irrelevant.",

My hunch is these tech companies were getting smashed on profits and decided to roll this out to save their asses, and then it took off and instead of telling clients, “Hey this isn’t a good fit for what you’re looking for at it’s current stage.” They said, “Hell yeah it can do X,Y,Z, and keep your wife happy with you”.

What that means is that inflation was so low the second half of 2023 that even low numbers in the second half of 2024 may not have a big impact on the YoY number.\n\nThat being said, low MoM numbers on a consistent basis will still give the fed confidence to cut rates because they understand the base effect and it's impact on YoY. Basically, the second half of 2023 had inflation on target, it increased the first few months of this year, now we need to see what happens going forward. If it trends back down, then the start of 2024 is an outlier and regardless of the YoY number the fed will probably cut.\n\nThe devil, as always, is in the details.

      "body": "Umm... All of this inflation stuff is pretty irrelevant now. While everyone was watching the Fed, Saudi Arabia just gutted the US Dollar...\n\n**US-Saudi petrodollar deal ends after 50 years**\n\nThe US-Saudi Arabia petrodollar deal, a pivotal arrangement in global finance, has ended after 50 years. This landmark deal, initiated on June 8, 1974, required the exchange of only US dollars for crude oil exports, bolstering the dollar's dominance.\n\nThe 50-year-old petrodollar agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia just expired, after Saudi Arabia made no attempt to renew the deal. The term “petrodollar” refers to the U.S. dollar’s role as the currency used for crude oil transactions on the world market. This arrangement has its roots in the 1970s when the United States and Saudi Arabia struck a deal shortly after the U.S. went off the gold standard that would go on to have far-reaching consequences for the global economy. In the history of global finance, few agreements have wielded as many benefits as the petrodollar pact did for the U.S. economy.\n\nThe petrodollar agreement, formalized after the U.S. left the gold standard, stipulated that Saudi Arabia would price its oil exports exclusively in U.S. dollars and invest its surplus oil revenues in U.S. Treasury bonds. In return, the U.S. provided military support and protection to the kingdom. This arrangement was a win-win situation for both; the U.S. gained a stable source of oil and a captive market for its debt, while Saudi Arabia secured its economic and overall security.\n\n**Dollar's Status as the Reserve Currency**\n\nOil being denominated in U.S. dollars alone has significance beyond the categories of oil and finance. By mandating that all international oil sales must be settled in U.S. dollars (DXY), the agreement elevated the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency. This, in turn, has profoundly impacted the U.S. economy. The global demand for dollars to purchase oil has helped to keep the currency strong, making imports relatively cheap for American consumers. Additionally, the influx of foreign capital into U.S. Treasury bonds has supported low interest rates and a robust bond market.\n\nIn his recent book, Bonfire of the Sanities (December 2023), bestselling author and investment manager David Wright argues the strength of the dollar is a key factor behind America’s high standard of living. Wright declares that the reason why people in the U.S. enjoy “as high of a standard of living as we do is because the dollar is strong.” Wright then explains this strength is partly because of faith in our economy “and because crude oil can’t be bought or sold internationally without U.S. dollars.”\n\nConversely, the petrodollar’s demise may significantly impact the global economic order. **The agreement between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia expired on June 9, 2024.** This expiration has far-reaching implications, as it has the potential to disrupt the global financial order.\n\n**Saudi Arabia’s decision to end its 50-year petrodollar agreement with the United States. Here are the key points:**\n\n**Petrodollar System Shift:**\n\nThe petrodollar system, established in 1974, requiring all oil sales to done only with the US dollar. Saudi Arabia played a central role by pricing its oil exclusively in dollars. However, the recent decision allows Saudi Arabia to sell oil and other goods in multiple currencies, including the Chinese RMB, Euros, Yen, and Yuan, rather than exclusively in US dollars. This shift signifies a major departure from the petrodollar system and is expected to accelerate the global move away from the US dollar.\n\n**Impact on US Debt:**\n\n* The petrodollar system allowed the US to maintain demand for its currency, supporting its financial markets and enabling deficit spending.\n* With Saudi Arabia diversifying its oil sales away from the dollar, there could be a decline in global demand for the greenback.\n* As the dollar’s status weakens, the US may face challenges in monetizing debt and accumulating large deficits without inflation concerns.\n\n**U.S. Dollar’s Future**\n\nThe petrodollar’s expiration dramatically weakens the U.S. dollar and, by extension, the U.S. financial markets. If oil were to be priced in a currency other than the dollar, it could lead to a decline in global demand for the greenback. This, in turn, could result in higher inflation, higher interest rates, and a weaker bond market in the United States.",
