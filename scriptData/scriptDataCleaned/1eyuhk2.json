          "body": "He bought a put, at a higher strike. He tied a second order to sell a put at a lower strike with the same expiration. This sold put helps finance (reduce the cost) of the long put position; however, it caps his potential gains, especially if you hold into close. The higher strike put must be worth more than the lower strike put (for reasons of arbitrage) so he does not lose any money from selling the attached put.\n\nSuppose you buy a 550 put on some cash settled instrument, and sell the 540p, and hold both to expiration. Your cost of the position is the 550 minus 540, which is less than the 550, making it cheaper to enter the position. If the security ends at 544, he gets 6 dollars times any multipliers. That means that this hypothetical trader's optimal outcome is if it ends at exactly 540. However, so long as the close is not the price of the 540 put below 540, then this trader hasn't lost out on any potential gain: say the 550 was worth 4 and the 540 worth 1. Then if it ends at:\n* 544, you profit 3 with the short leg, and 2 without.\n* 539, you profit 7 with the short leg, and also 7 without (since your short leg credited you a dollar to enter, but also paid out a dollar at expiry)\n* 550+, then both positions would expire worthless, but one cost you 4 to enter (550 only) whereas entering with the short leg cost 3.\n\nHe said that the last minute spike took away some gains, which means he intended to (and did) hold through close; SPXW expires at 3pm CDT, and settles into cash. If you are interested in the theory of options, I recommend taking a look at natenberg or Akuna's options 101, which is free. It is very simplified but can provide a little perspective on how the industry views options.",

This screenshot shows ONLY the entry, he didn‚Äôt post the closure of this trade, notice the time stamp for both entries. This is normal for spreads, because they don‚Äôt expire the same way as the typical long calls/puts.)\n\n1. He paid $942 to BTO (buy to open) the 5590p, and he got paid $192 to STO (sell to open) the 5550p.\nTherefore, his actual cost to open the trade was exactly $750 ($942-$192=$750)\n2. With a bearish debit spread you make money on the downside with limited risk and cost.\n-His max loss here is $750.\n-His max gain here is $19,500.

The lower the price of the underlying below the strikes he chose the more money he makes on the trade until capped. \n4.
