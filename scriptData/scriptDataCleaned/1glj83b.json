          "body": "Disagree with this take. Tesla is the only automaker turning a profit on their EV’s, so cutting subsidies is far more damaging to competitors who are already losing money on every unit sold. Most of them have already come out and said they can’t match Tesla’s pricing. The best selling EVs in the US right now are the model 3, the model Y and the cybertruck. If competitors lose the $7500 EV credit then it’s literally game over for them. They’re already falling behind and Tesla will just keep applying pricing pressure until they fold.\n\nIt’s the exact same strategy that megacorps like Walmart and McDonalds have been using for years. They’re some of the biggest advocates for raising the minimum wage because even though it impacts all employers equally, it does the most damage to small business competitors who aren’t as profitable and can’t afford the cost increase.",

                  "body": "Yeah so a few major glaring issues with that post lol.\n\nFirst off, the dude’s numbers are way off. He says he’s “conservatively” assuming only 40% of Tesla’s are claiming the EV credit, which bangs out to 155k vehicles. But we can literally look at the official US EV numbers to see Tesla only delivered 140k vehicles in the US during that timeframe. So his “conservative” estimate is already over predicting by 10%. Then subtract the percent of model 3’s that were RWD and long range models since those didn’t qualify for the EV credit in Q1 when this post was written, which is ~20% of the delivered vehicles. Then subtract the model S, X, and cybertrucks since none of those qualify, which is ~5% of delivered vehicles.\n\nYou quickly find this guy did absolutely no research and his “conservative” estimate is literally 35% higher than a possible number, and 50% above an actual conservative number. \n\nThen there’s the issue of Tesla taking a bunch of write-downs in Q1, which obviously was a one-time impact to profitability that this guy fails to mention. Notice how Tesla’s net income in Q3 was nearly double what it was in Q1 and none of his math would hold up anymore? It’s because Tesla’s auto margins are profitable. Which was already obvious to anyone who’s actually read their financials.\n\nCrazy how many upvotes and shares something so misinformed managed to get.",

If there’s one thing Trump hates more than anything, it’s other people stealing his spotlight. \nHe visibly despised Musk bouncing around like a toddler on the campaign stage.\n\nB. Musk’s  Twitter is a competitor for Truth Social. Every $ spent by advertisers on Twitter isn’t going into the personal coffers of the Trump family. \n\nC. Trump knows no loyalty. Musk was a useful idiot to get him elected. He can’t get re-elected and he doesn’t care about the future of the Republican party and who will finance it.",
