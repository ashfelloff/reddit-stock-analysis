I think gates being in software and never hardware, as well as retired for like 14+ years at that point, were things that got more attention. \n\n I think the engineers already tore holes in all the technical stuff (before I got there) about nanobots and 5g and such. \n\n I mean a year or two after that, I took part in a clinical trial where they put an RFID chip in a prep pill (reduces chances of hiv in gay men by 98%), it turned a pill that’s easy to swallow into one they needed its own glass of water, I needed to wear a thing half the height of the iPhone 13, twice as deep as it is with a leather otter box case, and about as wide, with an array of gold antennas, it would need to wait for me to digest it for the rfid reader to register the pill, transmit the data via Bluetooth to my iPhone, and I needed to pair it a few times, and then an app I installed and gave permission to access Bluetooth sent it via 5g to my doctors office. \n\nAll with lots of consent forms. So that’s what it takes to “track” a pill, like a bigger pill for one, a reader on a carabiner for 30-45 minutes while it digests, and a Bluetooth connection to a phone. \n\n The reader 40% larger than a 1990s pager, that gold antenna was needed, and didn’t always read the chip. All it did was tell it it got digested. At the time they thought you needed to take prep every day of the week or it wouldn’t work, now there is some “prep on demand” where I can take 2 pills after I have sex and then for like 7-14 days after and I’m good.",
