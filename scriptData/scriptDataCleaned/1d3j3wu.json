I saw it in your username and I had a neighbor named Nick Thompson quite a few years ago who I have been trying to find. I‚Äôve been trying to find you because I lent you my tent back in 2007 for a camping trip and I never got it back. My kids are now old enough to go on trips with their friends and they‚Äôd love to use that tent. I remember you were foreclosed on because you couldn‚Äôt actually afford to live in my neighborhood (which I‚Äôm not upset about) but I do find it offensive if you borrowed that tent to live in because of the foreclosure. It‚Äôs honestly the lying that bothers me more than anything if this is the case. Send me a DM so I can get my tent back if you have it and if you‚Äôre living in it I will start the eviction process immediately.",

But also took some gains when it hit 14 in 2022.\n\nSo whats different: whenever this stock dropped, it was because of dilution. They took every chance, when it pumped, to fill up with money. Because dilution was their only way to get money. \nBut the news, why this stock is skyrocking right now is, that they officially said no more dilution for ar least 2024. Because their tech now is tested and proven, now they are even signing contracts (AT&T, Verizon) where they are getting money upfront. And they will generate income as soon as the 5 sats are launched in Q3.\n\nSo yeah, maybe they will fool me again, but i am willing to risk it.",
