Surprised investor sentiment is holding strong and that the stock market has NOT reacted negatively to the port strike that could decimate supply chains, erode consumer confidence and cause inflation. I checked most large news outlets and the none are touting this seismic event.  Wth is going on? The ports striking are every east coast and gulf ports. All ports are closed! ",

In a few articles that I read, the industry seemed to be either dusting off COVID pandemic playbooks to handle denied goods, and have been buying a ton of inventory ahead of this. The reports on the docks is they're moving an incredible amount of inventory ahead of the strike. Some person was even quoted greater than we'd ever expect.\n\nI suspect if the strike ends quickish, these companies could have a lot of extra inventory on hand and could hurt earnings/forward guidance. \n\nWill try to find the links and will edit/add if i can, but google will likely get you there too.\n\nOne article: \nhttps://www.ft.com/content/7fdd7d4a-794c-46f2-95c5-aa317a5163a4",

Also, if it really does last a week, then I suspect this changes the entire Fed's position. This likely will increase inflation, this could cause shelves to be empty again.

People who are long stocks like ZIM & AMKBY (Maersk) have been giddy with excitement about the possibility.  As one of those people I’m not sure I actually thought it would happen.  Been reading and watching a bunch of stuff in the last 2 weeks about it and biggest takeaway is that even if it lasts only a week or so the fallout will be measured in months because of the back up in the global supply chain that is created everywhere because of how much volume is handled in US East & Gulf coast ports.  \n\nOnly thing I can think of that explains this is that the current US president is asleep at the wheel and doesn’t have the bandwidth to deal with this.  Everything he’s got is focused on the wars in Israel & Ukraine…and the rest of his administration/The DNC is focused on trying to get a Democrat elected to replace him.  If it actually happens it’s gonna be a catastrophe with a bunch of losers and a few winners…mainly shipping companies due to rates going higher than during Covid because demand will far outpace supply if the log jam backs up more than a week or 2.",

You'll see shortages in the Northeast first, since they are the furthest from the west coast rails. Expect shortages of international produce first.
