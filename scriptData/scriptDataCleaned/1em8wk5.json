  "selftext": "Disney reported its fiscal third-quarter earnings Wednesday, topping analyst estimates as its combined streaming businesses turned a profit earlier than expected.\n\nHere is what Disney reported compared with what Wall Street expected, according to LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.39 adjusted vs. $1.19 expected\n\nRevenue: $23.16 billion vs. $23.07 billion expected\n\nThe company’s total segment operating income increased 19% to $4.225 billion compared with the same period last year, led by the positive results for Disney’s entertainment unit, particularly streaming. \n\nDisney’s combined streaming business, which consists of Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+, together turned a profit for the first time — and it happened a quarter earlier than the company had expected.\n\nThe combined streaming business posted an operating profit of $47 million compared with a loss of $512 million in the same quarter last year. However, without ESPN+, the direct-to-consumer streaming unit reported a loss of $19 million.\n\nMeanwhile, last quarter, Disney+ and Hulu together turned a profit, but when combined with ESPN+, the streaming businesses suffered a loss.\n\nDisney recently changed how it reports its segments, with ESPN falling under its sports unit, and Disney+ and Hulu being counted as part of the direct-to-consumer entertainment segment. Disney and its peers have been focused on streaming reaching profitability as the traditional TV business bleeds customers.\n\nDisney+ Core subscribers — which excludes Disney+ Hotstar in India and other countries in the region — increased by 1% to 118.3 million, despite the company’s earlier guidance it wouldn’t add new customers during the fiscal third quarter. Total Hulu subscribers grew 2% to 51.1 million.\n\nRevenue for the entertainment segment was up 4% to $10.58 billion, driven largely by subscription revenue growth due to price increases and customer growth for Disney+ Core. The company announced further streaming price hikes on Tuesday. Revenue for the traditional TV networks was down 7%.\n\nDisney’s overall revenue increased 4% to $23.155 billion compared with the same period last year.\n\nHowever, while Disney’s entertainment and sports divisions drove earnings, the U.S. theme parks business was impacted by slowing consumer demand and inflation.\n\n“The portfolio is working well,” Disney CFO Hugh Johnston said. “Yes there was softness in the domestic parks, but the entertainment division’s profit tripled in the quarter.” \n\nDisney’s parks have been a key profit driver, and the company has pledged to spend roughly $60 billion on its theme parks over the next decade.\n\nRevenue for the overall experiences unit, which includes domestic and international parks and experiences, as well as consumer products, was up 2% to $8.386 billion. \n\nOperating income for U.S. parks was down 6%, while international parks operating income was up 2%. The company attributed the decrease in operating income at the domestic parks to higher costs driven by inflation, as well as increased technology spending and new guest offerings.\n\nThis carried over from the previous quarter, when Disneyland Resort in California was under pressure with lower profits, with executives citing similar reasons.\n\nLast month Comcast’s earnings were weighed down by its Universal theme parks, which the company attributed to increased competition from cruises and international tourism. Despite this, Comcast executives said they remained “bullish” on the business, especially with a new theme park opening in 2025.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/07/disney-dis-q3-earnings-report-2024.html",

These studios all cut back a lot at the same time. \n\nWhich is great, for NOW. There is a glut of content so the consumer is fine with not getting a bunch of new shows but early next year it’ll be another story and by then maybe smaller players and YouTube/social media  might be  filling that void and Disney would really be behind. Plus the overly reliance on two franchises that’s heavily white male dominated not matter how hard they’ve tried otherwise. \n\nNot to mention Warner that still is knee deep into broadcast and doesn’t want to let go. Even with massive debt. And I’d be crazy to say that they’ve placed all their eggs into that new Superman basket and if it fails oh my goodness that studio is going under.\n\nIt’ll be an interesting time for media.",

      "body": "I have owned Disney for 4 years - one of my worst performers. Went to DisneyWorld in June with my family. Not very impressed. Didn’t even ride but one rollercoaster. Guardians of the Galaxy and Tron.  You had to do a virtual line at 7am and 1pm then go when they told you to go. Them stand in line and pay $20 more to ride it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. I have been dollar cost averaging for 4 years and I’m down about 32%. I still buy some every month but I keep asking myself why? I will get out soon just like I did with Nike, PayPal and Crown Castle three other dogs.",
