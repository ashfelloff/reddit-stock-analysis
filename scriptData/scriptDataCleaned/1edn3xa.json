  "score": 57,
  "selftext": "LLY and NVO have been hit hard over the last couple weeks over news of potential competition from other pharma companies for weight loss drugs.  But I feel like the sell off has been largely an overreaction since the competition is still several years at best from getting their drugs to market.  They're only at phase 2 drug trials.  \n\nBut anyways, do people think LLY and NVO are good buys right now especially since they are about to release their earnings in early Aug?",
