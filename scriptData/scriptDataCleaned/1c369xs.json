  "score": 116,
  "selftext": "There's seemingly major buy pressure for a stock that is still artificially tanking.\nRivian hasn't been doing well as a company since interest rate increases & the price of EV's drastically falling due to competition within their own used car markets and consumer skepticism about large EV and truck mile ranges.\n\nLarge institutions owned almost 90% of RIVN since IPO and r holding the bag on major losses. To regain cost basis they have been shorting Rivian into the ground.\n\nEven though it was almost entirely held by institutions during IPO, somehow with only a 12% decrease in institutional ownership (some of the only shareholders) this accounted for almost a 70% decrease in price.\n\nWhile I can only add one image, more than half of the put volume is still out of the money by a lot, and short interest for this stock is thru the roof at an all time high. if the stock were to rally 10-20% it could put these institutions in a very tough spot & I just don't see the end goal here.\n\nThey have a signed contract with Amazon set to deliver 100k delivery vans and the ceo is clear that they will be in an overall positive profit margin by Q42024. They have more assets to liability.\n\nWhich leaves me to 1 conclusion. These shak' quant analysts r shorting this stock for coke money.\n\nI already have $14.000 worth of 2.5 leaps expiring January of next year but I want to hear what you all think!",

The whole public policy conversion to BEV was stupid to begin with IMO considering no place in the US can support the infrastructure or adoption curves that idiots seem to project. No one makes BEVs profitably. Sentiment hasn’t been good lately. Other automakers are taking it on the chin. Oh well, I think RIVN navigates it better than most.\n\nThe problem is the failure of Fisker (now) and Polestar (in the near future) will hurt RIVN stock price. The fact that it is still so highly institutionally held is good. The fact that Amazon has a large stake is good. It needs to navigate the choppy waters of negative sentiment and failures of their competition while improving their fiscal performance.\n\nTo all the naysayers who think a company must be profitable in order to see positive price action, I would say CVNA seems to be doing quite well despite a worse balance sheet. It’s all how the market handles it and it’s bullshit that a POS company like CVNA is crushing it lately while literally closer to BK than Rivian and yet a decent company like RIVN gets pummeled.\n\nI’m in it for 4-5k shares CB $9.89 and think it’s a pretty safe bet.

If they don’t beat or exceed their production target of 57k, the company will fail.\n\nTo a larger understanding, auto companies function by production a little differently than most manufacturers. While most manufacturers want to produce where their marginal costs and marginal revenues line up, auto manufacturers want to produce where their average variable cost is the lowest. \n\nIf you charted average variable costs, with X being the quantity, and Y being cost, it typically looks like a Nike swoosh. Your AVC is extremely high in the low production level, before hitting a pit. The reason auto manufacturers want to minimize AVC is of the very complex supply chain that autos have to stay active, and the falloff of revenue from excess supply. If auto manufacturers over produce, the autos are sold at a discount either on a clearance as the next year models will be coming out, or in secondary markets. As a production cycle nears the end of its year, usually around June and July for the big three, the risk cost to hold the vehicle rises rapidly.\n\nRIVN has never been able to escape the low production/ High variable cost end of this hypothetical chart. Even at 57k production this year, they will be in the left side of the Nike swoosh of AVC. It’s a recipe for failure, and if a manufacturer can’t cover AVC, they reach a dreaded shutdown point, where there is no reason to keep producing.\n\nThey had a lot of high hopes from the IPO, but they’ve failed every checkpoint they’ve ever come across.",

Maybe take a look at a footprint chart or DOM history and you'll see a more thorough story of what's actually happening.\n\nClaiming that price is dropping makes no sense while looking at the order book *alone* is like crossing the street while looking only to the left and not the right.  You're missing extremely important information and your ass is going to get wrecked for it.  Evidence being this confused post you're making right now.  Hell, a collection of limit orders (the order book you're staring at right now) is *literally incapable* of moving the price; only active orders hitting the bid or ask can do that.  Remember that, it's kind of important!\n\nConsider this scenario to help this make more sense:  The price of thing is $10.  There's a bunch of limit orders within whatever price range you're watching right now and they're fairly even.   Some news hits or whatever and the price begins moving up, towards $11.  Then it hits $12.  It breaks out of range and is continuing to move, aggressively now.  Plenty of active traders are going to view this as a breakout opportunity, as a new trend, etc and want to act; Now your limit orders consist of tons of prior longs looking to exit and capture profit; however, anyone wanting to buy in at this point is probably only going to actually get filled if they buy at market rather than placing a limit.\n\nThus, a seemingly strange circumstance in which the price is moving up, but the order book is showing outsized sell pressure.  Active orders will continue pushing the price up so long as delta continues piercing through the sell pressure.  It's no surprise that limit orders on the buy side lag when the price is continually moving in that direction.\n\n\n\nI guarantee that if you had a DOM heatmap open you'd be seeing *heavy* amounts of active sells at the same time you saw this order book.",
