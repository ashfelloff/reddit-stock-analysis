  "selftext": "Nvidia Thesis ($200 PT by Dec-2025, 53% Gross, 38% IRR)\n\nP.S.: Not financial advice, just my quick read-through of fundamentals\n\nNvidia is the world’s largest chip company, spearheading the global AI revolution. It holds a dominant 98% market share in Data Center GPUs.\nLast fiscal year, Nvidia generated $60 billion in revenue, with ~80% coming from its Data Center segment. This year, revenue is expected to double to $120B, with ~$105B coming from Data Centers.\nI believe there’s a ~50% upside in the stock by the end of 2025, translating to a 38% IRR. The current street estimates for Nvidia’s Data Center revenue in 2025 and 2026 stand at $150B and $170B, respectively. However, I find these projections conservative. My analysis points to $200B in 2026 Data Center revenue, translating to ~$5 EPS in CY2026. Applying a 40x NTM PE (Nvidia’s typical trading multiple) yields a $200 price target by the end of 2025.\nKey Reasons for My Bullish Thesis:\n1. We are in the early stages of the AI Arms Race.\n    * Hyperscalers have spent $200B on capex over the last two years, with plans to spend $700B over the next 2.5 years—much of it allocated to AI and GPUs.\n    * Microsoft currently operates 192 data centers and plans to scale to 900 by 2028. If Microsoft is this aggressive, other hyperscalers are likely to pursue similar aggressive expansion plans.\n    * Large Language Model (LLM) capacity is doubling every six months. For instance, Claude 3’s context window (now 200K tokens) is projected to increase to 1 million tokens by next year. Such improvements necessitate hyper-demand growth for powerful GPUs that can serve both training and inferencing. There isn't any chip, apart from NVIDIA's Blackwell, that can meet this demand.\n2. Supply Chain Insights: Have been looking into supply chain data, and all data points reflect\n    * TSMC’s CoWoS production, crucial for Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture, is set to grow from 15,000 units/month in 2023 to 40,000 by late 2024—a ~3x increase.\n    * Applied Materials has revised its HBM packaging revenue forecast from 4x to 6x growth this year.\n    * SK Hynix and Samsung are reallocating 20% of their DRAM production to HBM3e.\n    * AMD’s CEO estimates the AI chip market will be worth $400 billion by 2027; Intel's CEO puts the number at $1 trillion by 2030\n3. Blackwell Product Roadmap:\n    * Nvidia is transitioning from a 2-year to a 1-year product cycle. The B100 and GB200 chips will ship later this year, with the B200 expected in early 2025. This is one of the most aggressive product roadmaps in industry's history. In my estimate, NVIDIA could sell 60,000 units of GB200 systems with $2M per unit price, driving $120B in annual revenue in 2025 from GB200 alone.",

Return on AI spend is irrelevant to Nvidia’s valuation since they simply sell hardware to customers. Customers have gone from giving them $16b annually to now $100b annually and then $150b annually next year. Even if capex spending stopped growing next year, Nvidia is looking at $150b per year revenue with 75% margins. Not bad. Btw, this is already being priced in by Wall Street. This year the forecast is 100% year on year growth, dropping to 50% next year, then 15% in 2026. No one is expecting perpetual hyper growth. On the flip side, any growth above expectations would be a tailwind for Nvidia. \n\n2. Big tech are able to afford massive capex on AI because they are insanely profitable. Cutting capex would just go to their bottom line, resulting in a higher dividend, more stock buy backs, or more investment. Not bad either.\n\nPeople keep making circular arguments about Nvidia when their time would be better spent reading the financial statements of the involved principals. One last point: assuming Capex plummets, Nvidia is sitting on a pile of cash and can just buy back stock to prop up its valuation until spend increases again.",

Do you think Microsoft is just going to sit and shovel money into Nvidia's coffers forever if it turns out they're not making any return?\n\n\n> No one is expecting perpetual hyper growth. \n\n\nYes but along with the growth you've mentioned, they have to maintain this revenue and profit too.\n\n\nI just think there's so much risk with this stock and not a lot of alpha to be had at these valuations,e ven with optimistic numbers. But good luck to you, we'll find out who's right in a couple of years 👍",

Ai has not been over invested because it's literally currently changing the world and how people work and do things around the world, you probably only think it's funny generated texts /images/ videos and that's is buggy but it's not and I can't prove it to you in this answer, you will have to search for what ai is doing that's revolutionary on Google (note : I use ai every day at my job and it's day and night). Also Nvidia is not just sitting there thinking that it's future revenue will only depend on its data center GPUs, it's creating an ecosystem for all these customers to use and much more thing.

Supply chain challenges - As I mentioned in the post, Blackwell is the most aggressive product roadmap in chip history. And chips are manufactured with a long supply chain with multiple players involved and dependencies in different products. Two products that are acting as the bottleneck right now are CoWoS packaging (produced by TSMC) and HBM3e memory (done by Samsung and SK Hynix). Without this Blackwell chip cannot be produced. If these bottlenecks elevate or are not scaled up soon, NVIDIA would have to lose out on revenue \n\n2. Power infrastructure - Blackwell run data centers are power guzzlers. On the demand side (hyperscalers), things are still not figured out as to how exactly will this power be supplied at scale.

Your reasoning is that it's a typical multiple for NVDA, but naturally one would expect a lower multiple as growth eventually will show signs of slowing and growth potential will get smaller.\n\nAs I said, your estimates would put NVDA at a 5.5T market cap, and there's only so much growth that is actually possible.\n\nAnd that's if NVDA beats expectations which are priced in and already sky high.",

              "body": "Not saying infinitely - but no one knows until a sampling after ~2-3 orders of magnitude yields disappointing results (and it would have to be true not just for the algorithm in use, but all possible algorithms). Until that point, people will continue to pay to get access to the next level. We've barely seen 1 hardware generation so far, and to suggest the nth limit is at 2nd or 3rd generation is... very likely incorrect.\n\n\nModel collapse theory isn't even strong as synthetic data is already useful (for distillation at worst, self-play at best).\n\n\nMy thesis for NVDA is very simple:\n\nMachine learning/accelerated computing (ML/AC) is extraordinarily powerful, more so than anyone thought for the preceding decades before chatGPT (the Alexnet surprise was met with criticism of the dataset well before acceptance of the methods, and that is already over a decade ago).\n\n\nML/AC outcomes are directly associated to scale - nothing exciting happens at small scales, everything we will ever want is behind scale-walls (read Suttons The Bitter Lesson).\n\n\nML/AC infrastructure at SOTA scales is an extraordinarily hard problem from every angle: processing/design, heat, energy, networking, manufacturing, assembly, etc.\n\n\nThose who wish to leverage the capabilities of ML/AC and DO NOT want to deal with the infrastructure problem vastly outnumber those who would welcome the challenge (basically only Mag7 will consider it), and the markets those who DO NOT  want to deal with it are trying to address are essentially infinite - can't list and count markets that don't exist and could never exist without the new technological capabilities ML/AC unlocks.\n\n\nAnd NVDA has owned this moment not due to luck - at least not due to luck to the extent that those who call them lucky believe; Jensen et al have been squarely focused on this no later than alexnet - and they used this conviction to spend serious man-hours/resources developing for 0-billion dollar markets. (Cuda, omniverse, isaac lab, drive sim, etc.)\n\n\n\nSo when you consider the tangential opportunities this next-gen ML/AC is growing towards - we can just choose robotics as one example - you have all these firms competing at the edge to be the first with the best solution (drop-in blue-collar replacements) as the TAM of these applications is on the order of 100B-T, NVDA is the only viable option, with all others requiring further efforts on the end-user that are irrelevant to their problem. (Theres a reason pretty much every newly minted robotics firm is using NVDA robotics platforms).\n\n\nThis is exactly why Google still buys so much NVDA - they are squeezed by their end-users who demand the platforms NVDA has developed as the maturity of the platforms is directly related to the rate of progress they can make. If Google had the same ecosystem around their TPUs I would not be nearly as singularly bullish on NVDA as I am.\n\n\n\nNVDA is so far ahead here that even their competitor (AMD) isn't competing with them - look at the earnings growth deltas between these two over the last 2 years - it is an empircal truth (the best kind of truth in ML/AC). And for AMD to seriously compete, they would need to operate in a manner antithetical to how they operate (read: they'd need to spend billions on software development that their earnings cannot support). The reason AMD wins most console bids is the same reason they don't have the ecosystem - they are a bargain option for those willing to do more software leg work.\n\n\nAnd there are a lot more opportunities than LLMs and Robots - just try and count them.\n\n\n\nIf matrix math is really the secret sauce here, the winner in the chip space will be whoever has the most plush red-carpet all the way to the end-users. And it will be a compounding win for at least 3-5 years due to the complexity of even existing in the space.",
