Unlike the Ma Bell break up, individual companies could still service different parts of the US.  What Google is providing is a search engine.  Unlike phone lines that are physical in nature, same with the people placing calls from a land line.  Googles search engine is nothing but code that lives on servers, aside from doing like the Chinese and blocking it from a country you can’t stop the bleed over effects from people using it all over the globe.  \n\nSo they break Google up and the search engine is the only asset left inside Google, the federal government hasn’t accomplished anything except forcing Google to divest of assets.  The search engine is still one of the best around as evidenced by the majority of people around the globe that use it, myself included.  My firm is partnered with Microsoft, our default browser is automatically set to Edge, everyone on my team has switched it to Google.  I get that it’s a small sample size but a whole lot of people like the search engine, so Google is still at an impasse that they made a product that is currently used by to many people for governments to be happy with them.  \n\nI saw an article the other day, unfortunately I don’t have the link, but it was regarding the European deal.  Google agreed to give an option of 4 search engines upon the set up of a new Android phone.  So each new Android  phone set up in Europe the user gets the option of Google or 3 other choices.  The user can still go out and manually download anyone they want if the choice they want doesn’t come up.  Google saw less than 1% loss of users.",

I would argue that if they force Google to share the data that users have given google (ie your search history) then the answer would be a resounding, no . . . Fuck No . . . I believe you'd get yer ass kicked for saying something like that.\n\n* **Forcing Google to share your search queries, clicks, and results with competitors risks your privacy and security.** - Bad news. Can you imagine all the data breaches about the journey of your psyche over the past 20 years?!\n* **Hampering Google’s AI tools risks holding back American innovation at a critical moment.** I'd agree that you should let the big US players compete here and Google has been an overwhelming force of innovation (much of it shared)\n* **Splitting off Chrome or Android would break them — and many other things.** I don't think this matters much. They're both already open sourced. It'd be a slightly more janky experience for users but I don't think there's tons stopping anyone from making a new browser today or phone OS. \n* **Changes to the online advertising market would make online ads less valuable for publishers and merchants, and less useful for consumers.** - no opinion here one way or the other. \n* **Unreasonable restrictions on how Google promotes our search engine would create friction for consumers and harm businesses.** The case that the DOJ won was about Google paying to be the default search engine on your devices whether from Apple (Mac, Safari and iPhone) or Samsung or various laptops, etc.. I personally think that they were paying way too much for this anyway and it wasn't a great value for shareholders. I mean $20B / year to Apple alone? To me as a consumer hat's crazy. Think of all the Advertising they could have done instead to just advertise Google search. I'd say make your point in wrapped busses, billboards, superbowl commercials. People Google things because it has the best user experience not because they can't update their default settings.",
