  "selftext": "Good Afternoon,\n\nToday I present to you a theory that I have thought about the past month or so but has recently opened my eyes again with Cramers recent X post history.  We all know the Inverse Cramer rule.  Cramer picks a stock, either supports it as a buy or sell, we inverse this and make millions.  \n\n  \nToday Cramer has posted an image on X of a bountiful basket of tomatoes he recently harvested this weekend.  He does this on occasion showing his harvest of either tomatoes, zucchinis, or a variety of other crops.  At first glance, you would just think that this an old man showing the crops he picked on his weekend off.  But if you take another look and scroll through his past posts, you would notice a correlation between what crops he picks and the state of the market afterwards.\n\n  \nBelow is a chart I meticulously constructed to show off this theory.  You will notice that when he posts a picture of tomatoes, the market has a green day.  If he posts zucchinis, the market has a red day.  \n\nSimply put, Any Red Vegetable/fruit = Green day soon    Any Green Vegetable/fruit = Red day soon\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2iq1n8339pgd1.png?width=1283&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5002cf3358ac51e582fbe1207c91f7c47f46c08\n\nYou can also see on the 26th when SPX was forming a sort of base, he posts a picture of both tomatoes AND zucchinis.  This predicted the move after with the market moving upwards followed by the dump afterwards the next day.\n\nYou may back-test my theory if you wish.  This is still ongoing and will require further posts of Cramer with his crops.  I will be following closely. \n\nTLDR: Expect face-ripping green next week.\n\n  ",
