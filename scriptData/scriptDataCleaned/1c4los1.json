Many will be left with nothing when all is said and done. And that's not even touching on the millions of families who lost loved ones to Covid by refusing to wear masks, social distance, get vaccinated (by the vaccines Trump helped expedite no less), and who insisted on treating themselves with hydrochloriqine and ivermectin instead of going to the hospital or the millions of families broken asunder by devotion to Trump over one's own flesh and blood. \n\nBut will the Trumpers ever blame Trump, the man known to be a grifter, liar, and conman before going into politics for their misfortunes? lol nope, because that would require them to acknowledge that they were wrong and that they were duped. Far easier just to blame the deep state, and Hollywood, and liberals instead of admitting any of it was their fault, or that the people who tried to warn them for years that they were being sold lies were right. \n\n\"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled.\" - Mark Twain",
