Weight loss goes beyond GLP1.  There is still value in this category regardless of what happens long term with GLP1\n3. They virtually almost always beat guidance and have regularly exceeded it for years now.  They upped guide to 1.37-1.4B for this year and said weight loss is at a 100m run rate.  So if the category was 0 this would make 1.27 on the conservative end which is still up over 50% YoY.  \n4. hims never needed weight loss to succeed it has always been an additional tailwind.  That’s what people are missing here.  \n5.  They are constantly adding new products and categories.  They’ve shown great succcess at growing the business \n\nThe real negative bearish points isn’t GLP1. It’s their trust pilot and Glassdoor ratings.  It’s obvious the employees are worked hard and their customer service is bad.  I’d also add that their moat isn’t amazing right now.  I expect more companies to enter into the space and compete aggressively",
