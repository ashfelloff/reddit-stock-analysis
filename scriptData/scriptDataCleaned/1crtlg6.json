They make $500 immediately (since calls are groups of 100 shares), and then if their $14 shares got exercised at $30 (bought from them) then they profit $16 per share for $1600. So they still made $2100 in profit. Only difference is that if they originally just sat on their 100 shares they could have sold them at the current price of $50 each and would have made $3600, so they are simply profiting less than they could have.",
