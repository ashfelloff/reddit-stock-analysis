But I bought with the intention of holding so I held. \n\nI'm not going to say I have regrets... but I do think a lot about that moment I saw green. It didn't last long, just a brief oasis in a red desert... but I can't get it out of my head.\n\nI have faith, though, that I will see the day when the desert turns green for good.",

Large moat - 3500 patents and FCC approval of AST sharing the bandwidth with ATT, VZ and others. Lots of high barriers to entry (why would VZ switch?). Competition is 2-3 years behind and MNOs have no good reason to switch.\n3. Right team - CEO had prior exit of satellite telecom Co for $550M. CTOs of ATT, VZ and AMT on board of directors.\n4. Large addressable market and need - dead zones everywhere, rural 5g, firstnet, 2BN without cell service, IOT etc.\n5. Go to market - partnering with MNOs. Sat service 1/10th cost of towers, not trying to compete with incumbents but leverage their customers as white label service. American tower is a big investor.\n6. Analysts - normally, I don't take stock in this but when respected analysts throw out numbers between 600 and 1600 per share and it's at 29, that's quite a leap. Cramer says don't buy and other investment firms that want in are trying to shake retailers out of it. Cramer is notorious for giving bad advice in service of hedgies. The manipulation is laughable. I remember seeing large 200k share sell orders placed at 4:01PM on Friday so people see them and they most certainly were canceled before Monday. Who places an order like that at that time?",
