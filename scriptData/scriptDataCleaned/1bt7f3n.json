The price action here is them putting their money where their mouth is. It’s interesting seeing this happen on the first day of the 2nd quarter of the year",

It was the only option because of ZIRP.\n\nAnd despite five rounds of QE, inflation didn't budge.\n\nThe Feds want to go back to ZIRP, so that they can roll treasuries into cheap paper again. Debt service has already passed defense on the P&L, and it is only going to go higher as LT debt is rolled into higher paper.\n\nWe need ZIRP to keep the deficit in check. That is superior to 4-5% inflation.\n\n(I'm not advocating for ZIRP, I'm just pointing out that it is superior to 4-5% inflation.)",

The banks did as well, choosing to finance projects for 5-7 years max on a 20-25 yr amortization with a balloon. \n\nComplex international players have been shoveling money into US-based fixed assets because they knew it was coming, they just needed a catalyst.",

If supply chain and port congestion were the only culprits they would not have floated roll back of tariffs as a possible solution in 2021 and 2022.  Lower tariffs = more imports... and yet the supply chain and ports....???  Think it through. \n\nM2 spike through 2020, inflation spikes starting early 2021 and continues rising.  \n\nSupply chain means industry and consumers are to blame, but not the government, FED, or the dear old economists who only get things slightly right when looking backwards.\n\n\n Same as it always was.",

I work with top economists daily, including those at the Federal Reserve, and the last 10 years of blowing up money supply created an extremely ripe environment for inflation spikes.  Where did OP even talk about COVID checks?  Are you denying the extreme and well documented money printing that occurred during COVID?  Do you understand that the overwhelming vast majority of money supply inflation was not stimulus checks?",

          "body": "10 year rate is not about whether the Fed cuts rate in June or July or December, but it's definitely about how low the Fed cuts rate to for this cycle. You can view this as \"short term\" neutral rate, and right now the Fed's thinking it should be around 3.25% (March SEP, end of 2026 Fed fund rate when inflation is at 2%). I say \"short term\" neutral rate because the Fed will deny it for now and say long term neutral rate is still 2.5%, but we know they'll change their tone eventually and shift their long term Fed fund rate up to that number.\n\nAnyways if inflation is coming down very slowly even when rates is at 5.5%, that suggest that rates aren't that restrictive and the long term Fed fund rate should be higher than 2.5%, definitely above 3% and likely around 3.5-4% (assuming 2% inflation).\n\nNow if inflation is coming down so slowly, there's a chance the Fed will not even go back to neutral, but do a \"mid cycle adjustment\", stay restrictive, and allow inflation to slowly go down to 2%, similar to Greenspan in 1995. In the mid 1990s, Greenspan hiked rates from 3 to 6% to prevent 3% inflation from getting out of control, and then only cut rates down to 5.25% and held it for couple years before hiking rates again. We all know how Powell and Fed Jefferson loves to refer to the 1995 soft landing cycle, probably the only soft landing in the last 60 years, so it's likely they'll follow Greenspan's footstep.\n\nBasically 12 months ago we were already at 5% fed fund rate, and the interest rate sensitive sectors like manufacturing and housing seems to be bottoming out and accelerating, so the rate hike lag debate seems to be thrown out the window now.",
