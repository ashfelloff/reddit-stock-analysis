With the added risk of dilution, or even the stock going to zero.\n\nI have been in your position, it sucks I know. But I have learned to cut losses and deploy capital elsewhere. The loss can be used for tax harvesting. Advice for the future: Manage the risk - predetermine how much you are willing to lose, and use a stop loss to enforce it.",
