I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\nNews: [US Hiring Slows to Weakest Pace Since Start of Year in ADP Data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/us-companies-add-fewer-jobs-than-forecast-adp-data-show)\n\n**CRWD-** Reported Q1 earnings that topped estimates, hiked full-year revenue guidance. $0.93 vs $0.89 expected. Traded this yesterday after earnings release, worth watching the $350 level today.  \n\n**NVDA-** Broke the 1150 level I was watching previously, currently long. Probably the most interesting stock I’m looking at today.\n\n**HPE-** Beat earnings due to sale of servers meant to handle AI work-10% beat on AI server sales, $0.42 vs $0.39 EPS\n\n**WKME-** SAP enters agreement to purchase WKME at $14/share, all-cash transaction.\n\n**GME-** Still interested in the $25 level, currently still short calls.  No change in DFV’s position.\n\n**Earnings today** : LULU",
