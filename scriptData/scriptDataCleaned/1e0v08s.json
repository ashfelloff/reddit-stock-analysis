If you're thinking \"a 50% gain on my 15k puts me back on track\" you're just bound to lose huge chunks of money until you blow the account. Pretend you only have 2k and play it safe. A 6 month SPY call is fairly likely to make some money. It won't be a 10 bagger, but it's a safe play. Nothing is guaranteed, but whatever you're doing so far is not working.",

In this market, you can easily turn a small amount into a massive amount. This year alone i started with 100 dollars in my newest account and ive already made over 100k. I started in march i think. Sure every once in a while i get greedy, but when i get burned, its nothing detrimental to my account. Ive never put in more than 15k in a single trade. Most of the time in doing about 5-10k. Most people on wsb are betting their entire accounts and thats why you see these massive losses.",
