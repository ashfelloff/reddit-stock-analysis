Depending on if certain buys or sells trigger, I'll readjust my positions accordingly until I sell most if not all of my contracts throughout the day. My success/luck comes from a series of smaller gains aiming for +10 to 20%. No crazy multi-baggers here (I'm a failure to WSB). \n\nFor cutting losses, it's difficult to measure since I play both calls and puts and will typically end up with one or the other after selling all of the profiting contracts.
