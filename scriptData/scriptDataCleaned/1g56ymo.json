  "selftext": "Already heavily in semi-industry, so some diversification but stay close to tech industry (focus in smaller-cap high growth).\n\nSo far, I can only think of\n\ndata/cloud-related software Pro: fast-scale up, high gross margin. Cons: saas are growing slower and AI-capex return are worrying investors. Examples: servicenow, datadog etc. I also think about cloud cybersecurity stock like cloudflare (might benefit from more datacenter usages) but cybersecurity stock underperforms relative to others.\n\nNuclear power stocks, pro: real demand from data center (unlike cloud-software, capex surely pays off). cons: slow-scale up,  and regulation; Small modular reactors is easier comparing to traditional ones, but such manufacturing is U.S. weakness and could be potentially overwhelmed by China supply chain.\n\nthe recent hyped going much earlier than any of these reactors been built or put into use. Sounds like already miss out.  Not so sure about the moat and gross margin ?\n\nwhich one is better to go?",

Last year the yellow cake price doubled without even a whisper of new demand to be built. It's now a sellers market after a decade of buyers setting the prices they want to pay.\n\nPeople who talk about how long nuclear takes to build don't realise China have been constructing new reactors in 5 years (the Koreans 6-8, Russia similar) and you have to buy the fuel components and services 2-3 years in advance so it can be converted, enriched and fabricated in time to put in the reactor. The timelines are way shorter than US-focused observers realise.",

The uranium spot price is still well below where it reached earlier this year, so there's still a lot of room to run between now and 2030 when supply is/was predicted to begin closing the gap on demand.

FOMO is real, I get caught by it all the time, but big pullbacks are common. Uranium gets linked to energy (oil especially) so can offer discounts when that falls and there's no specific pro-nuclear catalyst to balance it out.
