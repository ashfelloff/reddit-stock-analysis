It's a COVID play that has been done. \n\nTwilio is great. I've used the products; however, Microsoft and others have competing platforms now. It will be interesting to see how they compete going forward and whether Microsoft manages to advertise competing solutions.\n\nOkta is a great and unique product. \n\nCloudflare is also excellent. I've used all the products at work. This space has plenty of competition, but there is also so much room for growth it would be hard for stocks in the space not to perform.\n\nBlock fails my ethical filter with its microloans.\n\nI love SHOP, but I've never understood how successful it has been. It's great, but I don't think it's unique, and I'm not sure why the competition has been so slow in this space. \n\nI thought PayPal or Google would compete with SHOP, but they have yet to present an exciting product.",

              "body": "I wouldn't have a crack at pharma or semiconductors. \n\nI love many semiconductor companies, but they've always been priced too high for me to personally invest in them. The Chinese companies in the space would be interesting to watch. From what I've heard, SMIC has a lot of government support and no doubt China wants to break its dependence on Taiwan and the USA in this space. I'd expect it to get a lot of government support from China.   Particularly if Trump wins and the relationship with China gets worse.  Backing companies with solid government support can give it a bit of a tailwind; many other companies in the space are priced for perfection. \n\nEveryone wants to buy NVIDIA and AMD, and there is some speculation Intel will do well under Trump, too.  They are just so hot. I wonder if I could buy them even if I love the companies and products.\n\nMy favourite stock at the moment is Microsoft.\n\nCloud services are strong.\n\nIt bundles AI into its products.\n\nIt's providing a solid platform for others to build AI solutions.\n\nIt has many products but could do a better job selling them, so it has room for growth. \n\nIt's got services income from consulting.\n\nIts search business is primed for growth, which should help advertising incomes. It really could eat a bit of Googles income here. \n\nIt will never be a crazy winner like the micro caps, but I reckon it will probably outperform the broader market for a few years. \n\nIm a pretty boring Market Cap style investor, but I do have a pretty succesful satellite portfolio of mostly Microsoft from before the big cloud run up.",
