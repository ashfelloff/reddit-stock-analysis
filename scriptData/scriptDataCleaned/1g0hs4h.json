You wanna fix supply, there is your supply and it cost tax payers $0 to do.\n\nEdit: seriously, fuck these folks. The reason they bought up all this property to begin with is in the lead up to ‘08 they gave all these unqualified buyers loans on homes, those homes were later foreclosed on, the tax payer gave these banks a cash infusion through OUR money, and then they proceeded to use our money to buy up all the houses meant for actual people to own, which then lead to a housing shortage and now Americans can’t afford homes all while the corporate landlords also jacked up rental prices. Fuck these parasites. The fact as a society we aren’t dragging these people out of their beds at night and tossing them in the nearest river with cement shoes shows how subservient to rich people the American public has become.",
