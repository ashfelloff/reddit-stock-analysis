I bought them because I was looking at options and they seemed underpriced compared to the market. 520p was at 1.65 when SPY was at ~518.70. \n\nThat meant I already had a $1.30 worth of value for only $.35 more with a full day left(yes some loss on overnight theta). I set a sell order for 4.14 yesterday before bed and watched the market tank into it randomly. \n\nCouldn't figure out why the DOW lost 300 points in like 20 minutes, but it seemed like a good time to sell the 4/12's when the 4/9's were hitting, take the W, and wait to reassess.",
