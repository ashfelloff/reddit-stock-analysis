Got tired of losing my hard earned money and learned about a trailing stop this month and I’m green on the week. What’s your 0dte strategy that you guys go through before placing a trade. Some of y’all’s charts look like stairs going up and that’s what my weekly is looking like. I might just drop it into nvidia weekly calls",
