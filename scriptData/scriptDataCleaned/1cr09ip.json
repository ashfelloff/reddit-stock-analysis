  "score": 140,
  "selftext": "Nova Vax (NVAX) squeezed over 100% after market close on Thursday and premarket Friday after first quarter earnings were announced. Options went bananas with one person here turning $160 into $15.5k literally a 100x bagger play overnight. Feeling a little sad we didn’t see it right in front of our faces? The good news is we’re still extremely early on this play. If you’ve been waiting for something juicy for a while to sink your teeth into I’m happy to share this play with you! Let me show you why you should invest in NVAX. \n\n \n\n[NovaVax is now trading at around $10 a share](https://i.redd.it/r389xylfb70d1.gif)\n\nIn the past before the Pandemic in the before time of 2012 this stock squeezed from $20 all the way to $300 and came back down. Again in 2019 this stock was at a low of $3.54 a share and squeezed all the way up to $331 a share. There is a historical precedent for this stock squeezing 10 times from $5 to $100+ and It’s a cycle that happens every 3-4 years. Why can’t it happen one more time? I believe it can and will happen again this year.\n\n \n\nNVAX stock has been beaten down since its Pandemic highs all the way back down bouncing off $3.54 a share. With the latest announcement of the Sanofi partnership, this agreement breathes new life into NVAX. Along with fears of looming bankruptcy put to rest, it looks like blue skies ahead for the company. If you look into who owns most of the float it’s institutional share holders with the likes of Black Rock, Van Guard, State Street, JP Morgan and other financial industry leaders. It is hard to see another significant decrease in share price from here. Their financials should improve and the outlook on the company will only improve from here bringing it to a “buy” rating. The worst days are over. \n\n \n\nThis is one of the most highly shorted stocks on the market right now. With over 50M in short interest, short sellers were forced to take a $250M loss on Friday. Short sellers are very much still heavily invested and will actively try and bring the price back down. We all hate short sellers so maybe NVAX has something else up their sleeve just waiting to drop. We can take advantage of this situation to squeeze the stock higher forcing shorts to cover causing a massive squeeze unlike anything we’ve seen before. The next squeeze trigger price i believe is $20-$24, if shorts can’t keep the price below this level it will cause a massive rip to the $60+ range which would catapult this stock into the stratosphere. Options on this play will make many people here a massive bag. \n\n \n\nMy position is 60 $10c Jan 2026 with a $21k buy in. If share price gets to $40 by next May my calls will print $200k profit. I believe we will see that share price in only a couple months. Shorter dated calls are pennies. I honestly can’t believe I’m the first person here to post about this play. I want to help my fellow regards get rich. Another positive news catalyst, or just regards buying can trigger the next leg up. If i would have done any due diligence on this company before Friday i would have gone balls deep in calls. We still have a chance to make it big with this stock! \n\nYoutube DD:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1nwTZUSRsg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1nwTZUSRsg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKRGgErSChg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKRGgErSChg)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DroD2nK3ASo&t=52s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DroD2nK3ASo&t=52s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjL1tlu1uDc&t=86s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjL1tlu1uDc&t=86s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc6N9VB\\_nFc&t=615s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oc6N9VB_nFc&t=615s)  \n",

Moderna is finishing stage 3 or completed but no news since late 2023. Making a vaccine with mRna isn't easy. It's from my understanding. Having a cell produce a strand of protein. Like how they make lab grown meat? Once again google it.\n\n\n Which is effective and has less side effects. mRNA is some crazy way of making an vaccine if you read about it. I for so many side effects from my last covid shot. Bumps on skin. Red spot at injection site that was there for months a bunch of stuff that was very off that I never had.",
