  "selftext": "I bought long calls on Wednesday when TQQQ tanked and thought it would get higher on Friday. I purchased a 2DTE OTM call at like .11. I'm just buying and selling the premiums, but all the tutorials I found said that unless the call goes in the money, its worthless. But I deff could sell that option for 4x before it hit the strike. \n\nI don't understand why this was so profitable or how \"lucky\" I got, so please tell me how regarded I was and why I shouldn't put any more than burger meal money on options. I keep hearing words like \"LEAP\", Long Straddles, and buying puts for catalyst events of biotech companies, which sounds fun, but probably not wise for a poor on food stamps, eh?\n\nOr do I full send the ADHD that put me on disability in the first place?",

Just focus on learning to be better and don't think you're invincible. It took me losing a lot of money before I realized I suck at day trading but I'm decent at following trends and getting value from that. Also a hell of a lot of luck thrown in. No single trading strategy works for everybody so just play it slow (unlike I did) until you figure out what trading style suits you. Also stop buying weeklies until you have a much better grasp on the market. And don't be upset when you inevitably blow up one or two or three accounts lol",
