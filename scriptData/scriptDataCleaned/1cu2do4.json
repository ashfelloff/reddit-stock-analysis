Not even talking about the $$$ needed just to operate these in cold environments since they use superconductors.\n\nThere are a ton of use cases developed by scientists already like: Simulations for Materials in Materials Science research, Quantum Encryption protocols, drug development via protein simulation/emulation, and other research adjacent ventures. The caveat is, this is academic primarily and we don't think there will be QCs  that functionally displace 100% classical computers. If anything, a lot of QC researchers believe we will have hybrid systems since classical computers do have a history of being decent at some NP problems that aren't any better in the QC world. (But this runs up against the issue of P vs NP which we haven't solved yet)",

The problem is when you have a multi-step complicated hashing algorithm like they have for crypto, each one of those calculations is going to give you a range to work with. You then need to take all the possible values in each of those ranges and compare them to every other possible value in every other range. By the time you get done, you just spent a lot of money on quantum computing time, and you are still pretty far from your answer. If it becomes more practical and affordable, it will be a much faster way to mine than what we do right now with specialized ASICs, but it wouldn't be just an instantaneous solution.",
