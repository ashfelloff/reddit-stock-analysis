When I realized NVDA was going to keep going up I rolled for some early gains, kept my leverage the same, and tried my hand at those $130.5 strikes and it was good. Iâ€™m messing around and getting more comfortable with spreads. Iâ€™ll be damned if I lose my cool now. I donâ€™t need a rocket ship, although this was a big gain. Iâ€™m going to try and keep being smart about my plays.",

          "body": "I was manually creating and messing around with debit spreads while working these positions. In fact I learned the hard way I had accidentally locked myself into not being able to take profits earlier when NVDA jumped the first time earlier in the day because I had used the $130.5 calls to sell the same number of $133 calls, thinking I was being cheeky and collecting on premium while it was running high. Instead it just meant I couldnâ€™t dump my calls when they would have netted me 7k, instead of the 4k they got me later. Not that Iâ€™m complaining, but it was definitely a learning experience. I ended up buying back 3 of those $133 calls, selling 3 of the now freed $130.5 calls, and buying back the rest of the $133 calls while NVDA was in one of its last dumps, then finally sold the last of the $130.5 calls when it high around $132.50~. It was a hell of a rollercoaster from start to finish. I have a lot to learn still.",
