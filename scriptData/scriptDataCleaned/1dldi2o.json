              "body": "Indeed, there's so many problems with air taxi businesses. Just off the top of my head from what I've read about this sector.\n\n* FAA regulations limit how many hours their pilots can fly in a month, which makes it way more costly to recruit enough pilots to meet the demand.\n\n* You can't just land an air taxi wherever you want. Which means that if you want to ride in one you first have to drive to the the air taxi location. And then the air taxi can't bring you directly to your destination, so unless the nearing landing spot just so happens to be within easy walking distance you'll probably have to get a land taxi or something to travel the last few miles or so to your destination.\n\n* And because of the above, air taxi's often end up taking MORE time then just driving to your destination in the first place, all while being more expensive to.\n\n* And this isn't even getting into the costs of the air taxis themselves, the margins of the business, etc.",

This company planning this service doesn't mean they succeed at implementing the service, or succeed financially.\n\nThe other thing is, OK, let's assume they succeed at implementing their flying taxi service. They claim they'll be able to do SF to San Jose in 10 minutes. That's cool. The problem is they're only going to have one heliport per city to start. If you need to uber for 15 minutes to the port, then wait for the helicopter for 20 minutes, then fly for 12 minutes, then uber for 12 minutes again, it becomes a lot less attractive than actually flying point to point. You definitely won't save any money, and you might not even save any time, so it's not clear that this service will become profitable. It definitely has novelty value, but robotaxis are coming, and they'll take you from SF to San Jose point to point... Also Uber is already here and it already does that, if you can tolerate having a human driver.",
