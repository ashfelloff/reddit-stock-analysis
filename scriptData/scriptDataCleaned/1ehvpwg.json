Intel nearly killed AMD and now they're trying to beat Intel at it's own game.\n\nIntel is bringing in people from outside the company and they are trying to fix expenses and company culture. Can Intel come back from this? Wouldn't be the first time a tech company nearly dies and roars back. It won't be anytime soon though.\n\nSad thing is I sold at 35.50/share and decoded to rebuy. I had $47,000 in cash and could have bought 2000 shares with no margin. Essentially a loss of $32,000 in a few weeks ($16,000 or so in one day).\n\nIt will be okay.",
