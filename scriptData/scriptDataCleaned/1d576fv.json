A stay at home mom brings value to the home and saves the cost of daycare, and all these dudes on here act like a woman in that scenario doesn’t deserve shit. \n\nI’m married and I’m a mom. I’m married to a fireman who is gone a lot, and even though I had a career before we married, mine has always taken a backseat to childcare responsibilities. I work full-time in education, so my days off coincide with our kids. Meanwhile, my husband can go off on long deployments, take overtime shifts, and do side hustles in the fire industry because no matter what, he knows I can care for our kids. He can make more in overtime than I make in a year. I don’t have the same luxury. I work at the school where our kids attend, but I would make much more working in neighboring areas. But that wouldn’t work with my childcare responsibilities. I also took time off when kids came along, because we had no family near us to help. Again, my career suffered and my pension won’t be as good as it could have been. But that’s okay because we are a team. We will share our retirement. \n\nMy point being that I detest men who enjoy the benefits of a SAHM, and then have no moral issue with leaving them high and dry in a divorce. Fuck that.",

This comment is the fucking spirit animal of the exact shit I'm walking through rn. \n\nMy girl was a put together independent adult with aspirations and lots of ambition. My current girl spends 12 hrs a day doing instacart to get enough to still have me foot all the bills. Except you know the ones she didn't tell me weren't being paid with my money and I had to surprise come out of pocket on. Those are the good days. The bad days I will hear come home and an hour later she hasn't come through the door. I'll walk outside at daybreak to find her overdosed on fentanyl again. \n\nMy daughter fucking left too. She's almost an adult now but she brought the feds into our lives and gave me complex PTSD with the shit that was going on. Now I love with the knowledge that I will never be able to see her as less than a monster. \n\nSo yep. I am sad too my dude. I would trade every fucking cool thing I have made and earned these last 8 years just to have them back, but I think we both know that's not happening. \n\nIt's just some fucked rock bottoms for them to grow some fucking gratitude for what they had, but it will only benefit the lives of those that they decide to be around long after the dage and healing and growth happens. You know, if it ever does. We won't get to be a part of it, so fuck it. Fuck that. Fuck them. \n\nTake care of you. I'll take care of me and we will both see a better day. The rubble has to clear or I have to die but eventually one of those two will happen and the pain will stop. \n\nUntil then keep your head up dawg. We aren't suffering alone. It's just more problems and every problem has a solution. Even in unfortunate circumstances where that solution is time and distance.",

Which is kind of understandable with the pressure, 80-hour weeks, and probable sleep deprivation you’re dealing with. Finally, divorces are expensive. They can be north of 100 grand expensive, even for regular people. And that’s before the spousal support (usually estimated at your current earning level) starts.  Parenting time is usually split 50-50 by judges except in truly extraordinary and horrific circumstances. If anything, favor may be given to the primary caregiver. Get some sleep, take a minute, and think things through. You loved her once. You both sound completely depressed and burned out. Good luck. \nBTW, babies are hard.
