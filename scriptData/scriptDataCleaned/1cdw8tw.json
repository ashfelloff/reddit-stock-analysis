Taking a step back after a close call might give you some fresh perspective. If you ever decide to give the market another go, or if you want to explore less turbulent investing waters, there‚Äôs a ton of strategies out there. Until then, focusing on what you‚Äôve learned from the experience is priceless. If you need help, I can share your some resources that I used when I was starting",
