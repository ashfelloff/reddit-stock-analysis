People have been working on RAG assisted LLMss for search for a year now, and results are pretty poor when the data set becomes large, and you have to spend a shitload of money on ML engineers to work on it and then come back with mediocre results. Literally every company is trying this.\n\nYou know what's great for searching documents? Search engines. That's solid and well understood computer science, and you can run an Elasticsearch server for a few hundred dollars a year, and the engineer working on it will cost $200k/year less then an ML engineer building a novel LLM with RAG.\n\nI use LLMs all the time, but outside of ChatGPT, they all kind of suck. Building a server rack for tens of thousands of dollars that will let you run an LLM that has 1/10th the capability of GPT-4o that costs a few cents per query is just a massive waste of money",

They weren't competing with Apple for fab access when designing Blackwell because Apple is already fully on next node (3nm). \n\nApple is still TSMC's largest and most important client by far. So long as Apple pays the lockout premiums which they seem perfectly fine doing, they will likely continue to get preferential treatment / earlier exclusivity from TSMC while Nvidia competes with AMD and Qualcomm for fab time on the previous node. \n\nTSMC does not care about Nvidia's success, they care about extracting as much profit as possible, and that path is currently Apple focused for their latest tech.",
