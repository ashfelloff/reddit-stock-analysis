  "selftext": "Hey all, just a quick question.\n\n  \nLooking at things like SWPPX, SPY, VOO, etc --- they all track the S&P 500, but they also have returned slightly different growth over time. Do they not all track the same stocks and should therefore logically return the same amount? Is it just a difference in expense ratios? Slight difference in dividends?\n\n  \nThanks",
