  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nThe recent interest in Grindr prompted me to take a closer look at this company. Just wanted to point out something I haven't seen anyone else call attention to:\n\nGRND has grown its revenue and earnings every year since 2016:\n\n|Year|Revenue (Millions USD)|Adjusted EBITDA (Millions USD)|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2024 (proj)|330M|139M|\n|2023|260M|109M|\n|2022|195M|86M|\n|2021|147M|77M|\n|2020|113M|51M|\n|2019|109M|49M|\n|2018|87M|22M|\n|2017|66M|11M|\n|2016|55M|8M|\n\nSources:\n\n* [https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2024/Grindr-Inc.-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2023-Revenue-Growth-of-33/default.aspx](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2024/Grindr-Inc.-Reports-Fiscal-Year-2023-Revenue-Growth-of-33/default.aspx)\n* Page 13 of 2022 Investor Presentation [https://s201.q4cdn.com/840224656/files/doc\\_presentation/2022/05/Grindr-Investor-Presentation-2022.05.10.pdf](https://s201.q4cdn.com/840224656/files/doc_presentation/2022/05/Grindr-Investor-Presentation-2022.05.10.pdf)\n\nAs insane as these numbers are, the crazy thing is, the app has barely began monetizing its users. Another thing that stands out that the average Grindr user spends 60 minutes a day on the app, which is 2x compared to other apps.\n\nLooking at the history of the company, Grindr was first founded back in 2009 and it's since built up a large brand name. According to Reuters, from 2016 to 2020, it was owned by a Chinese video game development firm, but it was sold off for $608 million due to national security risks. Then, in Q3 of 2022, they got new management and a new CEO (George Arison) who has outlined ambitious plans for expansion beyond just hookups/dating.\n\nArison is also keen on using AI to boost revenue like partnering with Ex-human, potentially for virtual companions capable of sexting, flirting, and maintaining an ongoing relationship. In the press release: \"Grindr expects to release prototypes of some AI functionality in 2024,\" and in previous earnings calls, CEO George Arison has hinted that more will be revealed on Investors Day coming up on June 26th.\n\nSources:\n\n* [Grindr CEO: We are early in our monetization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtE3krGBzb4)\n* [https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/02/grindr-hires-athena-expansion)\n* [https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Forms-Exclusive-Partnership-with-Ex-Human-to-Enhance-User-Experience-Using-Artificial-Intelligence/default.aspx](https://investors.grindr.com/news/news-details/2023/Grindr-Forms-Exclusive-Partnership-with-Ex-Human-to-Enhance-User-Experience-Using-Artificial-Intelligence/default.aspx)\n\nAnyway, under the new management, stock has a loooott of runway to continue this growth for the next decade at least.",
