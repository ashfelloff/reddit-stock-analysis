  "selftext": "During the greatest bull run in modern history, Japan's market hit an all-time high [PE ratio of 112.3](https://augurecon.com/indicator/japan/cape). Enjoy what you're seeing, because we're only at [\\~35 today](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe). With no end in sight to the current market run, trying to value current fundamentals is insanity. There will be a pull back one day, but until then the market will continue to go exponential. you CAN get rich before then. People forget that before the great Depression people made a fuck-ton money and a lot of them got out before. Now we have circuit breakers and endless money printing and yet people are still afraid of a correction? [Even bears should invest at least in a high-yield bond ETF](https://etfdb.com/etfs/asset-class/bond/#etfs__dividends&sort_name=dividend_yield&sort_order=desc&page=1), some of which are yielding 15%(!) dividends. I'll spell it out for the financially illiterate: that means the safest asset class right now still lets you double your initial investment in 5 years.\n\nTl;dr: If you haven't been paying attention to the market, all you should know is today, in the year of our lord 2024, rationality is irrational. Up is down, left is right. Why can't NVDA/NVDU hit 200 EOY?",
