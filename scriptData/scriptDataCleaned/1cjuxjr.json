When most of us became a jobless social burden, the government did not need us. But does AI produce a good tax income?  Is AI a consumer? If AI starts to cause job loss and increase the unemployment rate, there is a potential birth rate drop, leading to recession and depression. Assuming the AI impact will continue when the government realizes a negative effect on its tax income due to AI, they must fix the abuse of AI. My question: do AI and corps need a government?
