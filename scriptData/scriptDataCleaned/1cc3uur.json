  "title": "Hell is coming. For Chipotle (CMG)",
  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "CMG has run up 69% since the October 2023 lows, and I believe hedge funds are looking to exit at around this level. Notice the heavy selling on 3/20 once price hit $3000. Looming 50:1 stock split is not until June so no worries about the poors pumping the stock. \n\n**Catalyst:**\nEarnings today after close. As you may know, California recently raised its minimum wage for chain fast food companies to $20/hr, and it just took effect beginning of April. Chipotle has had to raise its prices there (again), and now people are paying $12-15 for a gentrified burrito. With the repeated price increases and the possible staff reductions, Becky might decide to visit an actual Mexican restaurant. California makes up 14% of their locations, so while this will not end their bloodline, I believe they may update their guidance in this earnings call. Whoever the hell is buying at this price is paying out 5-7 years worth of potential growth in advance. \n\n**Hedge Funds:**\nAckman reduced position in Q4 2023, and it's not yet known if he sold any in Q1 2024 yet because 13F's are not out yet. Maybe that was him on 3/20?\n\n**Potential risks:**\n\n• Price increases may lead to increased revenue if people don't stop coming in.\n\n• They may use minimum wage as an excuse to reduce staff, reducing payroll costs to slave drive the shit out of 1 remaining worker behind the counter, leading to possible increased earnings.\n\n• I am just a regard like you and I have no idea what I'm talking about. \n\n**Positions:** 2600p 5/17. May expiry because (1) IV is insane for weeklies and (2) may not sell off instantly after earnings. [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/rnfv7tq.jpg)",

Americans are too stupid to budget accordingly and far to lazy to make the same burrito for a fourth the cost.\n\nThe food is decent, and the teas and lemonade are actually pretty good. For a burrito without the drink, it's 13 dollars they put a scoop of chicken on it that costs them at bulk about a 1.20 the rest of the ingredients are a dollar at most. They make probably 5x the cost on every burrito sold to dumb Americans.\n\n\nUnless Chipotle beef is linked to mad cow disease and people start dropping like flies, Chipotle will never go down again.",
