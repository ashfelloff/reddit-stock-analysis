I am an ex-prop shop trader who trades equities.\n\n\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, and stocks not on here on any given day! I only hold MAG7/general broad market indices long-term, unless otherwise noted in the ticker. If you use old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\n\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\n\n\nSome stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\\\\\_?” or “Is \\\\\\_\\\\\\_\\\\\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\n\n\nNews: [AT&T Says New Hack Includes Records of Customer Calls, Texts](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-12/at-t-says-new-hack-includes-records-of-customer-calls-texts)\n\n\n\nWe saw the markets sell off yesterday due to the CPI news, think we’re going to have a relatively flat day today. Trying to post earlier, if this post gets more traction I'll try to post earlier, otherwise will revert to the regularly scheduled post times.\n\n\n\n[TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - We saw TSLA delay their Robotaxi Event from August to October, watching for some form of bounce in the stock. Currently long, but will remain agile (as usual) if we selloff at the open.\n\n\n\n[NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) - We also saw this turn more strongly than the other Mag7 stocks because of the close to 15% move we saw it make in the past week. No opinion on this yet, but watching for a setup.\n\n\n\n[T](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=T&p=d) - Announces massive hack of customer data, includes records of customer calls/texts.\n\n\n\n[SNOW](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SNOW&p=d) - AT&T ($T) had their customer data illegaly downloaded from a workspace on a third-party cloud platform (identified as SNOW’s). Might be user error/social engineering (not sure) rather than a cybersecurity issue, so we might see a reversal of this move at the open. However, it should noted that there were no multifactor authentication safeguards in place in previous hacks of SNOW.\n\n\n\n[JPM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=JPM&p=d) - Reports $4.40 vs $4.19 expected EPS. NI at $18B was up 25% from the same period a year ago due to exchange of shares in Visa that provided $8B in gains.\n\n\n\nEarnings: None I’m interested in\n\n\n\nIPOs: None I’m interested in",
