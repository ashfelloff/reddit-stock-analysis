  "selftext": "It is looking like the US DOJ no longer thinks it is OK for Google to pay Apple to be the default search engine on iOS, MacOS, etc.\n\nThe most likely resolution will be that the first time you turn on your iPhone you are given a screen with the different search engines in a random list.\n\nYou then choose your search engine.  Free to change later but likely most will not.  This will be basically you choosing your default search engine.\n\nObviously this would be very bad for Apple.  Today, Apple sells the access to their customers and Google has been reported to pay Apple over $15 billion per year.  Some estimate over $20 billion.\n\nI believe this is going to be the toughest decision yet needed to be made by Tim Cook.   He could have Apple try to create their own search engine and then sell advertising with the new Apple search engine to try to replace the lost revenue.\n\nThen Apple would be one of the search engine options when you first turn on your iPhone and the hope would be people would choose the Apple option over the Google option.\n\nWhat other options does Tim Cook have to replace the Google money?",

Macbooks (including the software) are used by, and considered the premium product by million and millions of industry professionals in so many fields.\n\nAnd yet, make up about 10% of the global PC market. So, it's a niche product. You're letting a US bias skew your argument. If Apple computers vanished tomorrow it would barely affect anything because PC and Linux run the vast and overwhelming majority of the world. And... beyond their operating system, they don't really make any software other than some apps to run on their OS.\n\n>Designers\nSoftware engineers\nProject managers\nAcademia\nPhotographers\nMusic\n\nAnd yet *every single one of those* professions can use PCs or Linux. I used to work in the film industry. Avid, Pro Tools, etc. used to be exclusively Mac. Now, everything runs on PCs because, as it turns out, Macs are extremely overpriced and have no actual value over a Windows PC. So, there was a massive shift in the industry to put things on PCs.\n\nSoftware engineers like linux based things, but running a VM in Windows can accomplish that and allow you to interact with the rest of the professional world without people wanting to strangle the person because Mac can't format a fucking Word document correctly.\n\nAcademia, no one really uses Mac beyond personal computers. Having spent about a decade in higher education, yeah... only the kids were using Macs.\n\nAnd it doesn't indicate that a lot of people like the software, literally the data shows the vast and overwhelming majority of the world does *not* prefer Apple products and their \"software\" consists of an OS that can only be used on their hardware.\n\nThe success of Apple is their hardware, it always has been, well... that and marketing to gullible people who think computers and phones are some type of status symbol. But, as it turns out, the majority of the world's population and businesses don't actually care and use the cheaper, better option.",

If you own a market in 200BC, and some shop locations are better than others, you charge more for those spots and increase your revenue.\n\nIts not wrong of Apple to do that, as anyone can pay, and Google is certainly not wrong for wanting the best possible placement for its products.\n\nI think this is more of a cumulative thing due to the overall behavior of both companies.

The government is loath to punish a company simply for being successful.\n* For a non-monopoly provider, making exclusive contracts for placement or positioning of your product is also not something that would trigger anti-trust issues.\n* However, when you have a dominant market position, as Google has with Search, and you create exclusive contracts for placement of your product that exclude other providers, it can trigger anti-trust issues under the Sherman Act.\n\nThere are several remedies - but the most obvious is the deal between Google and Apple to make Google the default search engine on iOS will be unwound.   Instead, Apple will likely have to give iOS users a choice of search engines.    Google will likely appeal - so the final determination could be months or years away.\n\nThe immediate impact (once appeals, etc. are concluded) is likely pretty small - most iOS users will likely choose Google as their search engine because it is by far the most popular search engine across all platforms and has the best recognition in the market.   Google still dominates on Windows where Bing is installed as the default search engine.  One of the first things people do with a new Windows install is disable Bing, Edge, Cortana and OneDrive.\n\nLong term however, this will open an opportunity for other search engines and search technologies.",
