  "selftext": "FTX caused a major concern among investors in 2022 regarding the security of their cryptocurrency holdings.. But, if a crypto exchange goes bankrupt, there might be a chance to change customer deposits into dollars and pay them back if crypto prices go up again. This strategy wasn't used for FTX, but it was thought about when Mt. Gox went bankrupt around ten years ago.. Nevertheless, executing such a strategy without legal repercussions seems damn near impossible.  \n\nWhen need a Michael Lewis sequel.  ",
