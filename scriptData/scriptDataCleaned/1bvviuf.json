  "selftext": "Hello, fellow regards,\n\nI hope everybody here is buying puts on DJT. It is quite literally the most overvalued stock I've seen in all my years as an investor. Since this company is so unprofitable it does not even have a PE ratio. Let's just use a PS ratio instead. You do the math and end up with 4c per share of sales. Most tech stocks trade at 5.5 PE (in this case we'll use PS) = a fair valuation of 22c/share.\n\nThe amount of downside potential on this is crazy. \n\nMy position: \n\nAbout 15K total, puts expiring on 04/26 and 05/03 @ $30, $25, $20, and $15. \n\nJust my 2c, but I think this is a real money maker!",

It's been an effective strategy on their part and the amount of shares available to short is awfully small and very expensive to borrow to short.  It's crazy, but it's starting to taper off.
