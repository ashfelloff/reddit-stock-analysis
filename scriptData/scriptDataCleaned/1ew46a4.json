Approximately a year forward from there, when RKLB announces its constellation the stock will probably skyrocket again.\n\nAs the TAM of the space industry is growing and the race for militaries and big tech companies to own a share of the constellations in space, to not fall behind, starts to accelerate, I’ll be glad that i kept my shares for the long term.\n\nPersonally my portfolio is widely concentrated in RKLB and I’m following the company closely and have been doing so for the past two years.
