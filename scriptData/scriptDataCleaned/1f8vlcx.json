That’s assuming starting at 18 and averaging a $60k salary (so $1k a month investment following 20%) per month.\n\nAt 65 just “living off the interest” would be $645k annually. The real question is tho if $645k a year is even worth anything in 47 years. The median household income is 5x what it was 47 years ago so in another 47 years that $645k should be just about double the median household income, not a lavish life but still very comfortable for a 65 year old who should in theory have a paid off house and no dependents.",

If this was all done the same year you’d be fine, but as the gain was done in a separate tax year you’d still owe taxes on the realized gains this year and only be able to recoup $3k. Is my thinking correct on this? Those taxes on those gains are going to hit hard if this is the case. Gaining money is so much more difficult than losing it.",
