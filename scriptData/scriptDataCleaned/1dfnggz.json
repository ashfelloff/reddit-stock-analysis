Nice.  \nI just started playing this week, so I'm waaay behind and it'll take several months before I even show up on the leaderboard. I'm also flairless and vastly unknown around here.\n\nI'm penning this letter to respectfully ask you to keep racking up those wins and keep the distance as far away from me to ever catch up with you. Of course, I wouldn't dare question your skills. I'm just hoping this is something you do not decide to abandon down the road.\n\nI might be a random stranger sitting far up in the nosebleeds *now*, but if I am to test myself against the best--which is currently you--then I want the best to be at their best.\n\nKeep it up.  \nHappy Cake Day.",

All the excitement of a gamble, none of the decency of a clear loss. \n- /u/GraceBoorFan is extremely frustrated and blames a bear pennant for their woes. /u/_Rexfest_ found joy in the misery of others.\n- There's speculation that streaming BVOD will be the end of movie theatres based on low attendance.
