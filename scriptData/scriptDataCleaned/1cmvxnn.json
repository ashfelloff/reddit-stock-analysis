  "selftext": "This has to be the craziest market ever. Many economic indicators are screaming recession but yet we are at all time highs. I have few points I would like to share.\n\n* Jobs report has been revised down for 10 months straight, skipping December 2023. Even the latest job report of 175k was below expected. Many being part time jobs\n* Yield curve 2yr/10yr has been inverted for 673 days, counting today.\n* Yield curve 3month/10yr has been inverted for 561 days, counting today.\n* Reverse repo has been falling but is at 475$ Billion - cushion to the system.\n* Banks are underwater from low yield Treasuries and Commercial Real Estate. [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/why-hundreds-of-us-banks-may-be-at-risk-of-failure.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/01/why-hundreds-of-us-banks-may-be-at-risk-of-failure.html)\n* Bullshit growth rate of GDP at 1.6% - probably be revised down.\n* Fed has already over tightened but can't cut b/c of the inflation rate, and the inflation rate is not going to come down anytime soon. 1.6$ Trillion in Federal Deficit this year\n* 7.6$ Trillion of Debt is maturing this year, U.S Treasury doesn't have that kind of money lying around so they are going to sell treasuries to pay off the principal of the ones that are maturing. Just like when a broke consumer pays one credit card off with another. The problem being the debt that is maturing was locked in at 1-1.5% but now it has to be given at 4-5% which adds to the cost to service all that debt.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-6-trillion-us-government-040643412.html)\n\n* Oracle of Omaha is holding on to the biggest stock pile of cash/cash equivalents ever - 188$ Billion Dollars\n\nSo that means inflation is not coming down below 2% anytime soon yet the growth of the economy is slowing down - STAGFLATION and  eventually a serious depression. The only real question is there has been Quantitative Easing that has happened 4 times. Fed's balance sheet was at 900$ Billion before it all started, it stands at 7.36$ Trillion - How high will it go this time when they inevitably print again to avoid the pain and kick the can down the road?",

I was walking by a Subway a few days ago and their foot-longs were (no joke) priced at $14.99 - $16.99 and it was empty at peak weekend rush time. lol don't think that location is long for the world.\n\nA lot of the brewpubs, hipster restaurants, and microbewery places here that would have been slammed pack to the gills in 2019 are almost like ghost towns these days. There's still a number of places doing well and busy (mostly some brunch ones) but it's clear that people don't have the money to spend that we used to have 5 years ago. Traffic is also noticeably lighter this year during rush hour which isn't a good sign either.\n\nIf I had to describe the general atmosphere, it's one of uneasy malaise, a sort of catatonic *waiting for the other shoe to drop* vibe writ large. Way more people on edge these days too but more of a low-key frog boiling in a pot type.\n\nIf anyone leaves their house and walks out in the world, the signs are actually rather dire.

      "body": "The US's proxy wars in Ukraine and Israel are holding off the recession you are talking about. They're already struggling to get public support for the billions in aid (aka loans) - there would be borderline ZERO public support if the general public felt they were in a recession, and that would put a halt to what the US is trying to do in Ukraine and Israel. So far via Ukraine the US has acquired over 30% of their agricultural land by putting them in debt via those loans and there is a lot of work left to do - Blackrock got the contract to rebuild Ukraine once it's flattened and that will ease building US military bases on Russias doorstep. \n\nGaza has that enormous oil field they found in the ocean just off the coast and they are already building an airstrip there + Israel is basically running a demolition program in Palestine that will help the US also set up shop and strengthen its hold in the Middle East. \n\nIf you are worried about a recession zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Anything can happen but the US didnt destabilize international tensions now by coincidence.",
