But I watched a little more, once they got to the scene where Willem starts getting upset over the other guy not liking his lobster, I had to shut it off. I can’t imagine the pressure of making a movie like that. Where majority of it is in one small set, that light house.  The movie is either going to hit a target audience, or flop. It’s not something kids or families could go see.",
