The marketing strategy for 90hz refresh rate on iphone 15 is outrageous in 2024 and only reason it works because of diehard fans who arent evenly technically apt to tell the difference between 60 and 90. \n\nWith the rise of gaming industry, more younger generations will know the difference and will look for those difference without having to pay the premium prices. Apple isnt even competing in that area which if they did, they could really monopolize this entire industry.\n\nShame how a little bit of profit blinds a corporation",
