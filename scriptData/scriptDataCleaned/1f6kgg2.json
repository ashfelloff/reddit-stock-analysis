Kroger is 15x DG. Target is 2.5x. If it's not for the FTC, Walmart can wake up on any day of the week and ask its suppliers to stop supplying to DG and most suppliers would. \n\nHere's an infamous story of how Walmart almost killed a pickle food maker over **ONE PENNY of cost.**\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20230830021441/https://www.fastcompany.com/47593/wal-mart-you-dont-know-2\n\n\n**Source:** I used to work for a F500 consumer goods conglomerate.

Hah) I'm not sure if you've ever shopped there, but it's pretty obvious that the way the stores are being run can't be sustained. And that's the DG's in \"good\" parts of towns. Some DGs literally get robbed daily, and the clerks are like, \"bruh, I don't even have a cash register anymore.\" \n\nThe stores get overstocked with bullshit orders being shoved into stores by the higher-ups, but those same higher-ups won't provide security or staff employed to stock inventory.
