Its operations had been burning through about $1 billion a month before the strike.\n\nBoeing ended September with $10.3 billion in cash and securities, close to the minimum amount the company has said it needs to operate.¬†\n\nThe new $10 billion credit agreement is in addition to about $10 billion in existing, untapped revolving credit agreements. Boeing has $45 billion in net debt.\n\n‚ÄúThese are two prudent steps to support the company‚Äôs access to liquidity,‚Äù Boeing said in a statement. Boeing shares, which began the year around $250, were little changed in premarket trading near $150.\n\nCredit-rating firms have warned that the company needed to raise capital and that its debt could be downgraded to junk status.\n\nThe company on Friday said it would [cut roughly 17,000 jobs](https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/boeing-to-cut-10-of-workers-delay-new-plane-394370d5?mod=article_inline) and warned of deeper losses as production of most planes, including its bestselling 737, [is halted](https://www.wsj.com/business/boeing-strike-union-workers-walk-off-af5703df?mod=article_inline) amid a machinists‚Äô strike under way since Sept. 13.",

But it is a pretty significant liability when facing an economic downturn. \n\nIf times are tough you can preserve cashflow by firing or reducing bonuses.
