  "selftext": "^\nMy position \nFellow degenerates, we stand on the brink of history. Forget SMCI, QQQ, even Tesla! Today, we fight for the future, the next great titan:INTEL ($INTC). This isn’t just a stock, this is the Infinity Stone of Tech Stocks. 💎🦍\n\nWe all laughed when Intel fell behind, when AMD and Nvidia seemed like the Thanos of chips. But Intel is Iron Man, baby. Old, reliable, and gearing up for the comeback of the century.\n\nThe Vision: Intel's long game is power efficiency, AI chips, and their 7nm breakthrough. You thought they were snapped out of existence? Wrong! They’ve been in the Quantum Realm, grinding to make sure they can snap the competition away. They’re about to snap their competition into dust.\n\nThe Play: \nOptions? You want 'em? Load up. Shares? Stack 'em. We’re not just hodling, we’re creating the next big **moon mission**. They’ve got Arc GPUs, Meteor Lake, and a battle plan to take down the chip overlords.\n\nTHE BULL CASE:\n- AI Chips: Think Wakanda tech. Ready to change the world.\n\nWe’re all in this together. Remember how the Avengers fought against impossible. They may have fallen, but they’re about to RISE UP.\n\n💎🦍 HODL. BUY. BELIEVE.\n\nIntel isn't just a stock. It’s a movement. The SNAP is coming.\n\nAVENGERS, ASSEMBLE!",

The corruption in the market does not care for rules. Those are just for me, and you lol. $NVDIA is an example of that when you know a lot of it is owned by 4 billionaires. The fact that they are in talks with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who, let's be honest, have enormous connections and are known crooks. Also, geo politically, we don't know what will happen after the elections. Intel is 75% USA made, so if something pops in Asia or the whole russia china coalition, we still have homemade stuff, which is $INTC. Also, $INTC is the best on board CPU for autonomous robots, and that market is expected to grow significantly in the next few years. $TSLA and Amazon are already on it, and so is china. At the end of the day, we are all speculating!",
