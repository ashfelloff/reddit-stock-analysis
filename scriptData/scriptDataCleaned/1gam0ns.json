                  "body": "Options are pretty easy to understand. Calls (long/bullish), sell covered calls (short term bearish, premium harvesting while bag holding), puts (short/bearish) make up the vast majority of plays. IV (implied volatility), Time, and strike make up the bulk of the options price. It is derived from the black scholes model. OP is bullish for the medium term. He is paying a fat premium for time. When you play LEAPs (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities, technically 1 year or more but most people lump 4-6+ months into the leaps category) time decay is the enemy. Every day your contract loses value due to change in time period until expiration. The IV is basically the \"hype\" or expected movement of a company. If a company moves around alot (has a high beta) or has some big event (earnings, product release, SEC hearing, FDA clinical hold) you will see high IV. People expect it to move so they sell contracts at a markup because they know it will most likely move in that direction (up or down). Finally you have the strike price. This is where you're placing your bet. ATM (at the money), OTM (out of the money), ITM (in the money). You will pay a premium for ITM and pay slightly more for ATM compared to OTM. This comes down to basic probability. You want to be above the strike for calls and below the strike for puts. OP bought OTM calls on a stock that no one has any expectations for. They are wearing the dunce hat currently, hence all the grandma memes. His contracts carry mostly time value. The probability that INTC will be ITM by MAR 2024 is relatively low. But it doesn't have to be, it just has to be trending positive. Most people play hot potato with contracts. They buy when there is a dip and sell when it pops, trying to dump them quickly. The large players use options to hedge positions, small guys, lottos. If you hold a contract till expiration that is OTM, it turns into a pumpkin and its worthless.",
