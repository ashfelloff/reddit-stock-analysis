Their market share is going down as Asian phones take over. Their products only have minor improvements from generation to generation and they are highly behind on any AI play. Their marketing for titanium phone cases and now, a new and improved button, are lack-luster. The new lawsuit stifles the apple store as well. The only thing they have is the security that their phone programming language is incompatible with other things. Once AI hits the open market and someone gets their pc to brute force attack that security protocol, it's game over.",
