We will no longer get all of our vacation as a lump sum on our anniversary date instead you will get 1 hour for every 17hrs u work. (16 at 5yrs. 15 at 10+) so roughly 2 hrs a week. So good luck planning a vacation  off anywhere within the first 6 months of ur anniversary date. \n\nAlthough juneteenth is a new federal holiday they gave us a floating holiday that can be denied by management.\n\nThe attenance changed so you can no longer notify tardy/absence at your conveinence and it is no longer handled by ur direct boss just straight to HR. You must call into work prior to shift start which is 5am for 1st shift. Normally if u r tardy you just have to cover the missing time with vacation/sick\n\nWe work on a 3 strikes ur fired rule. So if youre stuck in traffic and ur phone is dead. Or u slept thru ur alarm. Or ur in the hospital. You will automaticly get strikes and fired even though you have pto to cover.\n\nOther thing to note about the shit contract. Its not 25% pay increase. Its 11%. 4%. 4%. 6%. They took out our yearly bonus that was average of 3.7% but can go up to 6% of our yearly pay.",
