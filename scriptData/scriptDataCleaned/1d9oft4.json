Some daily gains seem to actually be sticking, which is nice.\n\nIt's still fairly volatile, so it can be a rollercoaster ride at times, but I'm patient and long on it.\n\nToday's increase is due to the unveiling of the refreshed R1T and R1S.  I don't expect any major upward moves until R2 launch though.",
