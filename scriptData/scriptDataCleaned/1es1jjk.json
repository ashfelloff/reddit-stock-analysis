  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop shop equity trader.  \nThis is a daily watchlist for trading: I might trade all/none of the stocks listed, and even stocks not listed! I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.  \nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Housing Costs Drive Most of Monthly Gains in US CPI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-08-14/us-cpi-report-for-july)\n\n- **[K](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=K&p=d)** - Bought by Mars in $36B deal. Acquisition price is $83.50. I don’t normally put in acquisitions but this is huge, and could see regulatory pushback considering how consolidated the industry is.\n- **[DKNG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=DKNG&p=d)** - Stated that it has decided to not establish the gaming tax surcharge.\n- **[CMG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CMG&p=d) / [SBUX](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SBUX&p=d)** - CEO of CMG becomes new CEO of SBUX, worth watching both stocks to see how the market reacts on the second day. Watching for another small selloff in CMG.\n- **[SMH](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SMH&p=d)** - Watching the entire semis market because of how strong it has been for the past week.  \n  Other semi-related stocks/ETFs I’m watching: **[AMD](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d) / [ARM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ARM&p=d) / [MU](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MU&p=d) / [SOXL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SOXL&p=d) / [NVDA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDA&p=d) / [NVDL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NVDL&p=d)**. Still long NVDA.\n- **[ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)** - Earnings today—likely won’t be taking a position in this until earnings are released, but will be cognizant of opportunities to be long/short if we make any massive moves intraday. Biased long towards earnings mainly because the stock reacts explosively even on marginal catalysts, but will wait until after the earnings announcement to make a trade. Small position long.\n\nEarnings: **[CSCO](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CSCO&p=d), [ASTS](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d)**\n",
