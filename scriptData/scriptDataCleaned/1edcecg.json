I appreciate the friendly competition, good sir, and I thank you for taking the time to  summarize the first google result for \"meta earnings expectations\" for us here in wsb. But unfortunately for you, your wife's boyfriend and I will be riding these puts to fuckin Valhalla.\n\n\"CPMs are up, that's bullish\" is such an oversimplification and I get it, it makes a lot of sense when you have no actual understanding of the ads platform. Increasing prices should be a good thing, but charging too much can be bad for a business if you end up pricing out a huge chunk of your customers which is my whole argument. At the end of the day, CPMs are a vanity metric that generally don't affect decision making internally at companies. All that really matters is your return on ad dollars. CPM up 19% is still a loss if overall spend is down 25%\n\nAnd there are a lot of reasons CPMs could be up. You'll often hear meta reference the ever growing number of users. But here's the thing, when you run an ad campaign optimized for conversions, your ads aren't being shown to every single user on meta. The reality is, probably 80% of metas users are broke as fuck and never buy shit. Nobody but fuckin temu and microtransaction mobile game developers advertise to this audience.\n\nThat means meta derives most of its revenue from the other 20% of users who actually convert and who are the reason people like me spend so much fuckin money on meta. Well guess what, good sir. We're in a recession. The consumer is weakening. Karens all over the country have less disposable income to spend on my drop shit, hand crafted European textiles. Only your wife's boyfriend can afford my high end cum rags at this point cuz the dudes *fucking* ***loaded***.\n\nSo this pool of buyers, that last year was 20% of total users, may be 15% of users this year. CPMs are a supply and demand metric. This means it's not necessarily demand driving up prices, it could also be a lack of supply. If CPMs are going up due to weakening supply of converting users, aka facebook customers are having to pay more for less, the reality is that facebooks customers just start spending less because they can no longer afford to acquire customers at the increased cost. I guess I didn't clarify in my original post, but our facebook spend is down almost 30% YTD and its a similar story for many of the members of my fake network of wannabe entrepreneurs.\n\nMETAs a beast of a business. I started my company at 23 with 10k and pretty much no experience, and over 6 years have grown it into a business doing 9m in revenue. And of that 9m, Zuck keeps 40-50% of it while I get to keep 10% or less. That's a great fucking business. But there's thousands of people with similar stories, who make up a huge chunk of metas annual revenue. These people almost all unanimously agree that meta has been completely fucked up this year. Some have stopped spending entirely, some are still growing, but most that I know of are flat or down. Once my puts print, I'll roll half of them into META shares because its a great long term hold. But Metas core product is failing right now, you know, the one that generates all the revenue. Advertisers are spending less. Zuck is primed to take a fat dump. \n\nIt's not too late to switch to puts bud <3",

Last earnings report they grew advertising around 27% but the stock tanked based on mainly their capex guidance which the street didn't like. \n\nI expect them again to report good earnings especially since its an election year and again say that they will remain consistent with their capex spending or perhaps slightly higher capex. I expect them to say that AI is helping them with their targeted ads and that that is helping advertisers fine tune their ads. \n\nI expect them to continue to defend their AI expenditures by saying that there will be monetization opportunities in the future and that they expect to be competitive with the closed source LLMs like open ai next year. \n\nThe stock tanked last earnings because of capex and I assume that aside from the recent tankage with the rest of the market, some of the recent tankage from a high of 542 or so down to the 440s was also because of google not showing much return for ai expenditures.\n\nI think the capex downside is already built into the stock and that if they have a reasonable beat, the stock should go up after earnings. \n\nI think the street has already built in that all the big companies will be consistent with capex. But that should be good news for nvda and the like, but they are also down in the dumps. \n\nI think in the next month or two we will hopefully see a big rally in both meta and nvda - for nvda, especially after they report blowout earnings and great guidance.",

      "body": "Also, what is the alternative? If there was a better platform that delivered better ROI for ads then Ok, META's business would be challenged, but we would see that in several Qs. I do not know of any such a thing. I am long META too, 339k on shares roughly 3% down, been buying the dip plus 7 calls exp 9 august 470 strike (down 10%)  and 5 calls exp nov 15 470 strike. (Down 4%) Which makes my META position overall stocks and options roughly 18% of my portfolio. \n\nFinally, my large stake on META comes from PE ratio analysis. If EPS comes in 4.71 flat from last Q, no growth whatsoever, TTM EPS would be 19.14. the stock has traded at average in last 8Qs at 28 times earnings at the close of 10Q filings which puts the price at 538. The PE Ratio has been 25.4 at the lowest (416 price) and 31.8 at the highest (2Qs ago) which would put the price at 726. \n\nThat is earnings growth coming in flat... Below analyst expectations btw. \n\nThen you add the AI factor. Just like it happened with threads, META is the single most effective platform after AAPL to roll out anything new (except hardware ofc) will be interesting to see how the rollout of AI accross all Meta properties is going along. \n\nThe thing about META is that is has had a tremendous run, people have been taking profits and expecting a downturn. NVDA was trading at 70+ PE, its normal to have a significant correction. But META EPS growth has been spectacular.",
