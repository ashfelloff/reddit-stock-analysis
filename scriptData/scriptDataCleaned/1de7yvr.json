It was insane how big the headcount got to.\n\nThat said yeah Elon is just dumb as shit and was not actually smart about anything: he just spent $50 billion buying a vanity project and then realized that it was basically hemorrhaging money and he just wasted a significant chunk of his networth desperately unplugging cables and smashing servers and firing random people hoping to make it stick.

A corporate costume to don which effectively obscures their identities for those times when they want to try to send it, doing shit that would likely ruin their careers under normal business conditions, even if such shit were to succeed.  \n\nSo they stand silently behind elon, let him play up the manchild maybe-genius persona - the entertaining showman-savant who can raise otherwise improbable sums of capital from starstruck sources whose funding decisions are similarly deflected from direct scrutiny by his non-stop firehose of distracting behavior, and get a little more risk-off wiggle room as long as they understand the tacit agreement to indulge his ego and let him LARP as Tony Stark / Howard Hughes.",
