                  "body": ">Just the 3 Star Wars sequels movie alone grossed $5.5b which more than paid off the investment.\n\nDisney doesn't take 100% of ticket sales. Generally speaking, these major tentpoles need to hit 2.5x production cost before they break even. The producers get roughly 55% of NA ticket sales, 45% of EU ticket sales, and 25% of the China ticket sales. You can ballpark that out to around 50% take of ticket sales for the average film, as NA is the biggest market, but that's the breakdown. And the remaining 0.5x for break even is to account for marketing expenditure, which of course varies from film to film, but works pretty well as a rule of thumb. The three sequel films, financial success that they were, have been the bright spot for Disney's handling of the franchise. They haven't had a theatrical release since Solo bombed. Their D+ shows outside of Mandalorian have largely underperformed and declined in viewership from release to release, and that trend doesn't appear to be changing for the upcoming Acolyte. They spent $2B on a hotel/attraction that closed after less than 2 years. \n\n>That’s not even counting the main money maker for Star Wars, toys and merchandise. $8b for both Marvel and Lucasfilm was a steal, and that happened under Iger. \n\nAgree. And they picked up ILM and some other franchises in the process. But on the Star Wars front, a lot of that value is coming from characters from legacy content, not the Disney era content.\n\n>Iger was CEO in 2005 where Disney stock price was $20. It is $118 now. I’d say Bob did pretty great the past 2 decades.\n\nIt's a tale of two halves to me. When Iger left the first time around, I'd agree with you that his tenure looked great. Since his return, it's been a different story. Disney+ is $11B in the hole since launching in 2019, and because Disney has decided to go all in there, they're losing out on rentals that previously helped out many movies turn from theatrical duds into long-term revenue generators in the process. It is *supposed* to hit profitability this year, but I kind of doubt that it will. Marvel and Star Wars seem directionless at the moment, to the extent that some people are predicting the end of the blockbuster. Parks continues to be the best performer, but Disney has all but lost the battle with DeSantis in what was largely a self inflicted wound over culture war nonsense. Consumer sentiment around Disney has declined from its 2019 highs. And the stock is valued at half of its all time highs.  \n\nI'm not surprised that Iger survived here, as you noted the 6x return to date. But I also don't think he has a great plan moving forward. Guess we'll see, now that he has the time.",
