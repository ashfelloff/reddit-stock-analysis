  "selftext": "TSLA went up because it had a worse quarter than projected... because?\n\n* There will be a \"model 2\" - by the way it will not require modification in manufacturing.  No that's not model 2, it's just model 3 at a lower price point.  Read margins to contract\n* Robotaxi... ?\n\nThe stock will be a good buy at $120 - no reason to get in right now.  It's a dead cat's bounce and will fade.\n\nPS - I should add one more thing.  Long term, this decline is better for TSLA as this gives them time to take lead from their US and EU competitors.  Chinese are doing well, but they will not out innovate TSLA long term.  But that story will take another 2-3 years to play out.  In short term, I am suggesting TSLA will do poorly.  ",

But over 90% of their revenues come from selling cars and most of their shrinking profit margin comes from Shanghai gigafactory which just raised the tax rate to 25% from 15% for 2024 onwards. To illustrate how overvalued they would still be, based on estimated 2024 earnings NVDA trades at about 35 p/e. Let’s be generous with Tesla and say they make $1.5b net income each quarter in the next 3 quarters which is probably too optimistic given their layoffs and declining sales and production. If we add $1.2b net income from this quarter we get $5.7b of net income. Tesla trades at about $450b market cap. This means tesla is trading at 78x forward earnings and the numbers I used were generous. So where is Tesla going to get the revenue to justify this valuation? If you believe Tesla will be the company to solve autonomous driving you have not been paying attention, Google has an entire business in addition to owning Waymo which is miles further along than Tesla in autonomous driving and is valued on 2024 earnings at 23 P/E.",

The layoffs will cut operating costs and increase net income, not decrease it. Elon's gonna do the usual \"produce the same output with less resource\", similar to what other tech companies did in 2022 and 2023. Declining sales is a function of long term bond yields. Long term bond yield is likely near its peak, at least for the year right now. That means any sign of economy weakening will bring it down, and possibly even bring it down hard, supporting car sales. China sales have also been weak due to Chinese economy being in recession for a year or more now (similar to Apple sales), but it's showing signs of bottoming out and recovering",

                      "body": "Many things contradictory in your post. For one, past net income doesn't matter, only future net income does, and China has started a price war with Tesla which Tesla simply cannot win outside of America. Layoffs, specifically what Tesla did with regards to factory workers is bad, because car production has flat costs and only is profitable with economies of scale. In addition, Tesla had 5.5% margins last quarter and this likely only gets worse as they are going to have to continue lowering their car prices to get sales. Total company net income divided by cars delivered is down to $3000 the lowest since 2020, and is not likely to get better with the competition from China, running factories under capacity, loss of preferential tax treatment, etc. Tech companies can produce the same with less resources because their margins are so high, and do not require massive capex spending. Tesla does not have that luxury. I know how bond rates affect the economy, and I expect them to be flat or even increase later this year.\n\nAnd on your last point, China is absolutely NOT in a recession, the reason Apple and Tesla are doing poorly in China is because native brands are simply outcompeting them. Apple is getting outcompeted by Vivo, Huawei. Tesla is getting outcompeted by the massive amounts of EV companies, most notably BYD. BYD still sold more cars YoY Q1 2024 in China, whereas Tesla had a decrease YoY Q1 2024 in China.",

Because to reach higher volumes you need to have a cheaper price point to increase demand. This only becomes possible with lower costs if you need to keep good margin.\n\n\nNow they say in the earning call we dropped cogs as much as the price so margin model 3/y is actually stable despite price cuts. Ok so you basically go to a model 2 (lower price point with lower cogs) without actually designing a new model.\n\n\nIMO in both scenario's the margin at volumes of 10 million cars/year will be 0. Why would margins be higher than current gas cars? Yeah tesla has potential for higher margins due to being vertically integrated, but this impact is low.\n\n\nWhere it all depends on is whether Tesla will solve autonomy in the coming years  If you believe they will be the first ones to do, then you should invest. If you dont think so then sell any stock. Because the money you make with having a temporary monopoly on selling FSD is enormous.",
