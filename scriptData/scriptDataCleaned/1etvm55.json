As to why:\n\nMonopoly ruling in the US is just the clear headwind. \n\nThe market generally took a bit of a dip (I find it super funny the dip that one Monday and then the week ends flat basically) based off of weakening economic data. I don't know what the forecasts are saying about recession chance (or if those forecasts are to be believed after predicting a '100%' chance of recession in 2022). \n\nMaybe there are some that think that we are going into: 'slower economy + Fed not decreasing rates' and that this is creating sell pressure. GOOG is pretty exposed to the consumer economy as it is basically mostly advertising so a recession would be an issue to GOOG. Just to be clear: I think that the Fed is going to go down by 25 bp (maybe 50?) so this isn't people like me creating sell pressure.",

Oh everybody's on LLMs let's triple down on them. Let's plaster LLMs every hole we can find. \n\nGoogle and all other big tech companies need a strong engineer as a CEO, not some glorified PM like this guy.\n\nThe whole cloud division execs are pretty much ex-Oracle mafia. The culture is so broken there it is frightening. They keep acquiring meaningless companies which can be done within months inside Google. Cloud has more headcount then rest of the company. Go figure. Essentially the newly hired Oracle execs have no idea what Google is even capable of because they think Google is like Oracle.\n\nAlso it used to be that managers had 10-20 directs. Now the fan out is around 5 *on average* again thanks to Cloud. Basically everybody wants to be a manager and everybody defers decisions to their manager. So there is a useless middle management layer who's afraid to call the shots.\n\nGoogle arguably has the best software infrastructure company in the world. The amount of automation and tooling within the company is unmatched yet it's trailing all the other companies. The quality of the engineers and infrastructure should be pumping out world class products.\n\nHowever there is no cohesion. There is no strong engineering centric management and this is the outcome.\n\nIf Google's CEO was Satya, Google could've been easily the most valuable company at the moment.",

It feels like a lack of depth and desire to get things done the right way. A lot of quick and immediate growth desires, and tons of unnecessary understanding of true risk. Nothing demonstrates this issue more clearly than the recent Crowdstrike outage where any halfway competent technical leader could have prevented their problem. They are a warning sign of a much bigger problem. I work with the US Government regularly and it is scary how much stuff is held together with tape. I work with Microsoft on the regular and it is absurd how little they even understand about their own problems and environments. The biggest issue is that we have a ton of old guys that have no business being in charge, still in charge. Also we get a ton of guys that  get managed to \"meaningless\" positions that are not so meaningless when things go wrong.

I give you that but I'm certain that anyone worth half of his salt would've been as successful given the opportunity. His quality would've outshined if he had done something unexpected contrary to the general market sentiment. I've never seen him take any risks. His whole career is just being at the right place right time. That's it. Google engineers took care of the rest and he certainly didn't mess it. What a big achivement!\n\nLet's grant the Waymo acquisition to Pichai but we don't know whether it'll be a commercial success or not. As is, it is certainly not. I wouldn't even factor that in to Google cashflows yet. If it becomes a success eventually, I'll give him that. But that would be a pretty weak rap sheet for a CEO of 10 years who took over arguably one of the best companies in the world in terms of intellectual power and infrastructure. \n\nMy point is he is a terrible CEO for any American corporate.

In 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil under the Sherman Antitrust Act, while Rockefeller, born in 1839, lived until 1937. Though he had retired from active management, he was still the largest shareholder. Interestingly, the breakup significantly increased his wealth, as the value of the individual companies' shares surged after the split. So my point is its better to hold rather than sell the Google stock.",
