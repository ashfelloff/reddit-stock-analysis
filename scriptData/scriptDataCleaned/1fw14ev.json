  "selftext": "I've shifted my entire S&P 500 holdings into Intel, and here's why:\n\nThe AI Revolution:  \n NVIDIA currently dominates the AI technology landscape, and that‚Äôs indisputable. Their unmatched tech and visionary leadership have set the bar high. However, with the U.S. aiming to maintain its global leadership, relying on a single company for AI tech could become a security risk and a bottleneck in innovation.\n\nWhy Intel Could Be the Game-Changer?  \nIntel (INTC) is uniquely positioned to disrupt NVIDIA's monopoly. Alongside AMD, Intel possesses the expertise and resources needed to engineer AI chips.   \nEnter Gaudi 3. If Gaudi 3 lives up to the hype, Intel‚Äôs stock could potentially skyrocket, doubling in value in a matter of months hands down.\n\nGovernment Backing: The U.S. government and major institutions are already showing their support for Intel, recognizing its strategic importance in the tech race.\n\nPositive Vibes: Reviews for Intel's Arrow Lake architecture are rolling in with strong positives, indicating that Intel's on the right track to regain dominance.\n\nDiamond Hands Ready: This isn't just a strategy; it‚Äôs a calculated move anticipating a shift in the tech landscape. Intel could lead the next wave of AI innovation.\n\n[Positions or ban](https://preview.redd.it/pzvl7nsi6rsd1.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c810276f41ae6a82dfd9c66bbb62fd2a4028d5d)\n\n\n\nRemember I'm just a mokey with a keyboard, do your own research and this is not financial advice.

So the only hope for intel to get into ai race are software giants like Msft, who have resources to invest into development of the needed software for gaugi.

He made wrong choices for a series of years paid himself an excess of 100 million dollars for nonperformance. And now the company throws out ideas of potentially divesting and selling off parts which was more done tactfully to get people talking well the some of the parts are worth more than the whole company. And you have a failure like was running Starbucks gets thrown out they bring in a turnaround expert in the stock pops that's why Intel got the attention but what if they throw gelsinger out what if they get somebody new what if they sell the company and parts. \nText you have Intel who's 100% woke dei gets all this money from the government. \nAre you aware of the requirements for building the Fab facility in California? I would say you're not because they have so many requirements for what the composition of the workforce must be and it's not white. Employment practices are based off of identification so they have to base hiring for the construction of these fat facilities based off of how people identify themselves so if you say yeah I'm a guy nope I'm a girl nope those quotas are filled we need others.. it also has to be 51% women workers building last time I've been to job sites I don't see 51% women swinging a hammer putting in rivets and iron worker. \nSo this Fab facility that's courtesy of the taxpayer money cuz the government's betting on winning and losers we know how that always turns out just look at solyndra with Obama and every other company that he put billions of dollars in as kickbacks and payoffs to his friends oh yeah I'll save you the trouble they all went to zero their bankrupt.. so these fat facilities best case scenario are not going to be up and running until 2029. Wall Street doesn't wait around 4 years number one number two they're not going to get it done by 2029 because nothing is ever done on time it always takes longer so you're probably talking Midway 29 or 2030 before they're up and running and starting to generate dollar one in revenue that's a long time from today. \nTheir balance of their business the chip business they missed the boat they went the wrong direction they zigged when they should have zagged. \nIf I owned Intel and I don't think God I would be selling cover calls against it every week a dollar or so higher than the current price to try to generate a return on the investment. \nIf I wanted to buy and tell and I don't I would be selling puts a dollar or so below the current market and collecting the premium for a very short period weekly basis at the stock falls and closes below that strike you get put the stock you on it but you collected the premium and then I'd start selling calls against it the following week. \nI think this approach of selling calls is going to generate a far greater return then the oscillations and gyrations of the stock relative to broader market conditions within the sector",
