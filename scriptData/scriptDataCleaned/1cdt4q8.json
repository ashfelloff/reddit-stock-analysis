The cost of labor going up always hurts the biggest employers. \n\nThere’s also housing costs. If you already own a home, you don’t care so much about what the current interest rate is or that short term rentals are driving up the price of long term. If you rent, you are in constant fear of rent increases and eviction.\n\nSo if poor people are experiencing inflation more than the rest of the economy, it’s easy to see why popular sentiment believes inflation is up.
