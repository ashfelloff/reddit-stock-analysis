Play: calls at $167.5, expiring 10/25. Those calls are trading at .30 cents a contract, figuring there will be FOMO pre earnings and cause it to shoot up, will sell the hype. Let me know your thoughts ",

Their earnings are flat, their revenue is flat, and their valuation is through the roof (like everything else on the market).\n\nThey have basically ceded the GPU war to NVidia, so long term, their only road to growth will come from continuing to take Intel's share of the pie. I think they will continue to execute on that very well, but there's not a ton of meat on that bone. And the valuation is already really aggressive for a company with flat earnings and limited prospects to increase them.\n\nGood company, bad price.
