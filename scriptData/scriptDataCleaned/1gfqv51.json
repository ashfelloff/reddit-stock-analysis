Seriously - can‚Äôt they spend the effort on wording it without sounding like complete downies?\n\nGiven the accounting fees likely involved in this, this has got to be a significant issue.\n\nThere is movement across the big 4 accounting firms in the financial statement audit space, wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see more of these.",
