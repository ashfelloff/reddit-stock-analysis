Ideally I was aiming for 2 months duration at least but I had to withdraw some money from my trading account in late June and the money left over wasn't enough for a 2 month ATM call. So I'd either have to go farther OTM or get a shorter duration ATM call. I opted for the latter and got fucked, which looking back at SPY's performance so far this year, is pretty funny seeing as how the same play would have been just fine most of the year so far with only some very short periods where it would have netted a loss. \n\nOh well.",

Immediatelly SPY pulled back from 549, went sideways for a week and hit it again on the 28th and pulled back again and hit it again on Jul 3, by which point by theta decay alone these calls were just not profitable even with the price at 552 at expiration. They were a little below break even.\n\nAnd that's just one example. There have been more periods like this and of course let's not forget the entire month of April until mid March. So basically any ATM calls with a duration longer than 2 months would have been profitable this year regardless of when they were bought but less than that you're getting into less consistent territory.",
