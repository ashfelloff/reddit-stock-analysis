  "selftext": "1. Declining sales for mobile chips - Apple recently announced the decline for iPhones was 10% this quarter. The only reason their stock pumped up was due to their share buy back announced. ARM will not have this luxury and decreasing demand will hurt them\n2. Previous guidance was made under the assumption of 3 rate cuts this year. We are down to maybe 1? This had hurt SMCI as well as AMD two chip manufacturers who build chips using ARM's archecture... suffice to say guidance will be poor hurting their stock price against Wall Streets insane expectations for chip manufacturers\n3. I have NVDA calls (expiring May 24th) , one of ARM's biggest customers, thus by proxy my calls are gonna tank after close. Honestly debating on buying ARM puts (expiring this Friday) to hedge but IV crush is gonna be a bitch with this one\n\nEdit: I bought calls expiring this Friday so it‚Äôs gonna crash. GG friends\n\nEdit 2: I told yall their revenue guidance would miss smh ü§¶ ",
