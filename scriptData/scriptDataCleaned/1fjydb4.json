China has hindered their economy by not allowing the free market to dictate, and the CCP will never allow any of their tech giants to be more powerful than them. Nobody in finance trusts Chinese financial accounting, not even Chinese citizens. It’s why they invest overseas mainly in the US.\n\nAlibaba is never going to go back to being a trillion dollar company let alone 2 trillion+ like you claim. If sentiment flips in China, maybe it can go back to 300 billion and trade around its fair value of $120 but it’s not going anywhere near where it was when people thought China had changed.",
