If that works out sooner than expected, they won't use the ATM much, or at all. I'm not emotional lol. I'm stating facts. Did you read the initial filing? It's a mixed shelf that provides a lot of flexibility for funding sources. Is the share price dropping because of the ATM shelf filing? That's likely part of the reason right now, I do agree. Is it an overreaction based on the company's current situation and signaling? I believe so.
