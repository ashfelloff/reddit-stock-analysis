What if it never gets there?) And at the end of the days it's minimal gains compared to what the stock will be worth in the next few years. If the price ever drops below my buy price (7.01), which I highly doubt, I will average down. \n\nAs it stands I would still be buying at 11 if it didn't already make up 5% of my portfolio, which is my hard limit for a single stock.",
