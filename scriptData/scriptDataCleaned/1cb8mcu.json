  "score": 86,
  "selftext": "Stock was up 20% pre market, then opened up at around $5.70 only to face huge selling pressure and massive volume that drove the price right down to where it started. Now up almost 12% on huge volume of 23m shares when normal range is around 4m.\n\nCompany has a big conference call to discuss the new drug approval on Friday. Almost 49m shares short. Will they start to cover today and the rest of week? I have no idea but active traders here might enjoy this action. I certainly don't as a long :(  \n\n\n[https://immunitybio.com/immunitybio-announces-fda-approval-of-anktiva-first-in-class-il-15-receptor-agonist-for-bcg-unresponsive-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/](https://immunitybio.com/immunitybio-announces-fda-approval-of-anktiva-first-in-class-il-15-receptor-agonist-for-bcg-unresponsive-non-muscle-invasive-bladder-cancer/)",

And it is a unique agent, other forms of IL-15 have had mixed success, with the modification to this superagonist it mimics endogenous IL-15 signaling in trans with enhanced binding affinity. Compared to other common gamma chain cytokines, IL-2 being the most ubiquitous, you don't have Treg proliferation.\n\nHere they were approved for BCG resistant/refractory NMIBC. The options in this space are:\n1. Cystectomy \n2. Intravesicular chemos like Valrubicin (approved for BCG-refractory CIS)\n3. Pembrolizumab (for BCG-unresponsive, high-risk NMIBC with Tis (with or without papillary) tumors or with BCG-\r\nunresponsive, high-risk NMIBC with high-grade papillary Ta/T1 only tumors without Tis who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy)\r\n4. And Nadofaragene firadenovec-vncg (for BCG-unresponsive, high-risk, NMIBC with CIS (with or without papillary) or with \r\nBCG-unresponsive, high-risk, NMIBC with high-grade papillary Ta/T1 only tumors without CIS\n\nIn terms of comparisons, very generally:\n\nPembro's 12 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 43.5% (95% CI, 34.9%-51.9%) and the median DFS was 7.7 months (95% CI, 5.5-13.6). With a CR rate at 3 months of 41% in Keynote-057.\n\nNado had a CR of 51% (95% CI, 41%-61%).\n\nCompared to N-803's estimated 12-month DFS rate of 55.4% (95% CI, 42.0%-66.8%). The median DFS was 19.3 months (95% CI, 7.4-not reached). And an initial CR rate of 71%.\n\nIt's not a systemic therapy like Pembro and has better comparative data than Nado. I would anticipate it becoming the main player for BCG-resistant/refractory NMIBC. Which has an incidence of 50-60k/yr in the US alone, approximately 30% of those will be BCG-resistant/refractory after 12 months. They're submitting approvals for 6 other countries upfront (UK, Canada, Italy, etc) and are evaluating the agent as a first line tx for NMIBC as well as studies as salvage for Lung and CRC. They're also using the agent in some of their other NK-based portfolio. I think they've got some genuine upside potential with this agent, let alone the rest of their pipeline.",
