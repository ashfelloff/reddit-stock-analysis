  "selftext": "As it stands, bird flu (H5N1 avian influenza) is making its way across the world. Yet another coronavirus ([animal origin to humans](https://theconversation.com/a-person-in-texas-caught-bird-flu-after-mixing-with-dairy-cattle-should-we-be-worried-227223)) that we know very little about and certainly not enough to stop it.\n\nCurrent situation:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bird flu in chickens](https://preview.redd.it/y6try66yhhtc1.jpg?width=2059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fadc612737765bc87b4d9e474816a898720a4d59)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Bird flu in cattle](https://preview.redd.it/pxlmchs0ihtc1.jpg?width=1398&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7cef35b3f35bf6183e5d13ec7a093746ab1c4ad8)\n\nThe first map is meaningless. Everyone is going to hoard chicken, chicken nuggets and eggs but they're wasting their time.\n\nWhen it comes to chicken, that industry can take a major hit, keep walking and laugh it off. The chicken and egg industry is impervious to issues. They have that shit on lock down.\n\nWhen it comes to meat that you consume, it's down to \"egg to your plate\" in 28 days. If the birds weren't \"harvested\" at this point, their legs would snap under their own weight. They're fatter than ever but their bone structure hasn't changed to adapt to it.\n\nWhen it comes to eggs, billions of chickens are laying them daily, at peak, every 16 hours. Eggs last forever, the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes, they grow faster than ever.\n\nYou can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.\n\n# How do I know this?\n\n3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.\n\nThe one that matters here is live chickens.\n\nThe highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.\n\nEver wonder what $8,200,000 worth of chickens look like?\n\nFeast your eyes on this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3titj0f0khtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7baeb7d3894554dd278b29603db3347e1f2f9\n\n8,200 chickens worth $1,000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn, 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them, I was escorted down the highway, blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16,500,000 worth of chickens, 4,500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.\n\n(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist, supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)\n\nThese are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ijxydf37vhtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320935df12c355485139c5e06ea560209f11be13\n\nI've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10,000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather, it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there, they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).\n\n# There won't be a shortage of chicken, meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet's discuss beef for a second.\n\nBeef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also, of all the mafia ridden shit going, beef is definitely it.\n\nThere are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.\n\n\\- feminine hygiene products\n\n\\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)\n\n\\- frozen meat\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf they did, you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint, or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.\n\nOn the other hand, it's abundant. \n\nBeing Canadian, we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;\n\n\\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022, Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))\n\n\\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada’s beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)\n\nThere is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef, 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.\n\nFinal point:\n\nWho is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  \nBrazil  \n**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023, followed by India, which exports water buffalo, the United States and Australia. Mar 5, 2024\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# This is also not the play.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so what is the play?\n\n# MILK\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.\n\nYou can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. \n\nThe substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.\n\n\\- school milk programs\n\n\\- cheese production\n\n\\- butter\n\n\\- ice cream\n\n\\- yogurt\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.\n\nThis is where you're wrong.\n\n\"In the barn\" means \"in the workers\".\n\nThe industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. \n\nLet's visualize that journey:\n\n\\- It starts at the feed mill.\n\n\\- Then it's a truck driver.\n\n\\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.\n\n\\- Another driver who collects the milk.\n\n\\- A dock worker.\n\n\\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.\n\n\\- Another truck driver.\n\n\\- The person stocking the shelves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhether you realize it or not, that's 50+ people.\n\nThinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.\n\nIf a cow gets sick, they produce way less milk.\n\nThe following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while, she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse, the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.\n\n[The last time this happened, they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[62,500kgs \\(137,788lbs\\)](https://preview.redd.it/qr7t9eqivhtc1.jpg?width=1088&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbcc4eb6b6fc031a3e9d69e8bd36c7d0ae373136)\n\nTADR;\n\nNot the play:\n\n\\- chicken\n\n\\- beef\n\nThe play:\n\n\\- milk\n\nWhat is it?\n\n&#x200B;",

          "body": "Federal guidelines require producers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to have withdrawal periods when using antibiotics (typically 0-21 days prior to harvest depending on the molecule) and vaccines (typically 14-21 days just for any tissue damage) in food animals. If any of those tests come back positive, it’s either contamination or a vastly smaller number of cases of cull animals who were treated shortly prior to their culling and communication wasn’t strong up the chain. I have also worked for the largest manufacturer of diagnostic testing for food, which also includes amongst its portfolio, a long list of biosecurity products that OP is surely familiar with as a driver of GP and GPP laying breeders.",
