I watched overnight as Trump won, and Tesla shot up and increased by $30. Lots of poll analyzation led me here and I sure am lucky. My account closed today at around $8,400, a 440% increase since the start of the week.",

      "body": "What the Tesla stock holding incels don't realize is that the Muskrat has to sell his Tesla stock or place into a BT if he accepts a cabinet position in the Trump admin.. This is from ChatGpt:\"Does a US government cabinet member have to sell stock they own in a company they lead or own?\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nChatGPT\n\nYes, a U.S. government cabinet member must divest (sell or otherwise dispose of) stock in a company they lead or own if their position creates a conflict of interest.\n\nThe Ethics in Government Act and other ethics laws require that government officials, including cabinet members, avoid situations where their personal financial interests could influence their official actions. If a cabinet member owns or has a leadership role in a company, their position in the government could create a conflict of interest when it comes to decisions that may affect that company or industry.\n\nHereâ€™s how it works:\n\nConflicts of Interest: If a cabinet member holds stock in a company they lead or own, it could create a potential conflict of interest, especially if their government decisions would impact that company's business. For example, if the cabinet member is overseeing an agency that regulates or works with that company, they would be required to take steps to eliminate the conflict.\n\nDivestment Requirement: To resolve the conflict, the cabinet member is typically required to divest (sell off) their holdings or leadership position in the company. This is meant to ensure that their financial interests do not influence their governmental duties.\n\nRecusal and Blind Trusts: If divestment isn't immediately possible, the official may be required to recuse themselves from decisions that would affect the company. Alternatively, they might place their financial assets into a blind trust, where a trustee manages the assets independently, without the official's involvement.\n\nIn short, yes, if a cabinet member owns or leads a company, they must take actionsâ€”such as selling their stock or stepping down from leadershipâ€”to avoid conflicts of interest and comply with federal ethics rules.\"",
