So yes, he did technically buy ASTS on the price of $2.10.\n\nBut with options you technically control 100 shares per contract, so he bought 8 contracts(number on top right of the 24k) which = 800 shares. The contract cost 1.40($1.40x100 shares = $140 each), in total he bought them for $1,120 about 6 months ago.\n\nIn comparison buying 800 shares straight up would have cost $1,680(800x2.10) in theory he got 800 shares for $560 less. This is what makes options attractive\n\nIt amplifies your gain but it also GREATLY amplifies your losses\n\nThe stock went up to ~$32 which means, $30 gain per share.\n\nSo $30 x \"800 shares\"(8 contracts) he had = $24,000\n\nAlso the 1/16/2026 is expiration date, so contracts are basically stocks that expire. Options lose value the closer to it to expiration. But since he picked a date so far out, time doesn't affect it as much. \n\nRemember when options expire the value becomes 0. So it is 100% riskier than just buying it straight up. So when the contacts reaches 1/16/2026, it's worthless.\n\n\nIt has some advantages, but VERY BIG DISADVANTAGES. \n\nIf you have anymore questions I'll answer it to the best of my ability.\n\nHere is the actually chart of this option: \nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ASTS260116C00003500/",
