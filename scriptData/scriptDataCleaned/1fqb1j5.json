I invested in Tesla in 2019 at the peak of the bearishness when the mainstream finance media kept wrongly insisting that they were months away from bankruptcy. I did the research and knew that the bears were flat out delusional with a lot of their increasingly absurd thesis's about the company. I sold all my Tesla shares for anywhere from an 800% to 2,500% gain.\n\nI haven't checked in months how well I'm doing compared to the market, but if I exclude Tesla I've generally been within a few points of it. The stocks I buy into tend to consistently under perform the market in the year I bought them, but often outperform the market in later years based on my analysis (I track the price of VTI at the time I make any buys, and compare my performance against that).\n\nEdit: I just checked. My record against VTI each year is as follows: \n\n* 2019 - Beat by 12.06%\n\n* 2020 - Beat by 85.78%\n\n* 2021 - Beat by 62.06%\n\n* 2022 - Beat by 16.45%\n\n* 2023 - Beat by 23.60%\n\n* 2024 - Beat by 4.16% (so far)\n\nWithout Tesla my record is:\n\n* 2019 - Behind by -0.99%\n\n* 2020 - Behind by -9.33%\n\n* 2021 - Behind by -7.05%\n\n* 2022 - Beat by 3.38%\n\n* 2023 - Beat by 6.15%\n\n* 2024 - Beat by 4.16% (so far)",

I came to the conclusion from my research that 1) Tesla's EV's are clearly superior to all the competition (especially back in 2019). 2) The competition was no only awful at designing EVs for the most part, but most automakers were heavily dragging their feet on EV's, which was only going to help Tesla farther since it takes 3 years on average for them to bring a new vehicle to market. 3) S-curve adoption of new technology met that EV sales are going to explode overtime (and they have worldwide since 2019, despite the slowdown the last year or two), which met that Tesla could easily continue to grow their sales plenty even when the other automakers finally start getting their act together. 4) I believed that several other automakers were almost certainly going to go bankrupt (or need a big government bailout) from failing to transition to EV's, which was only going to help Tesla farther as today's biggest players in the auto market imploded.\n\nI took profits in Tesla, and eventually sold out of it due to valuation concerns, and cyclicality in the auto business. I just didn't see a rational bull case to pump the stock up much more for a while. IMO in the short term Tesla bet on the wrong horse putting more focus on FSD than a cheaper Model 2 to continue to expand their market share and destroy their competitors profitable ICE vehicle market in cheaper vehicle segments.\n\n> What is your hit rate with your pics like there would be some that drown or stagnate for multi-year periods. Do you have stop losses for such cases?\n\nI don't use stop losses for anything. I just have alerts setup for me to re-evaluate things if a stock hits a certain price target.\n\nAnd as my non-Tesla record shows I've definitely changed my strategy some overtime. I was originally focused mostly on dividend paying stocks in my earlier years, and invested in a lot of companies back then that I would never touch today (MMM, JNJ, JPM, PEP) because I just don't get their industry enough to feel comfortable investing in them. I'm much more selective in the kinds of stocks I invest in today.\n\nI've had some definite flops, and in some cases I held onto winners too long and lost a bunch of gains (DIS used to be a winner, but I sold it at a loss. I had over 300% gains on ALB at once point, but ended up selling it barely a 100% gain after that cyclical market entered a downturn). My worst investment is probably either DIS or MMM in terms of number of dollars I lost.",

      "body": "10 plus years now. Lost money for the first six or seven years I was trading, blew up to accounts. \n\nI trade a lot of statistics but there's one I've been looking at that practically anyone could do that seems incredibly useful. So if you look at the run in the '90s or even the recent run this decade if someone had small positions in companies or an ideas that had a future or they thought had a future. Even if you get a few wrong. One or two of those can make you an absolute mint. So it's kind of an experiment with the majority of your money being in the s&p 500 but you have a 10 or 20% allocation you mess around with looking for these breakthrough ideas but rather than selling them when you get a 10% profit or 20 or whatever, you let the idea play out which is where the big money has been. The hard part is figuring out what the next company to do that is going to be or where you can get those multiples or how long they are going to go \n\nThe majority of my outperformance has came from being short theta and anticipating where the market is going to go before it does. I know that last part might sound cliche but buying TLT when it's in the '80s, you see that 50% correction from the top, you start shorting puts down there that are one or two years out. You start buying the shares. Cyclical companies like UPS, massive correction from COVID, back down to its original trend line, big dividend, you buy some shares, you short some puts. The small cat play, load up there, also loaded up on BTC beginning in 2016, didn't sell the top in 2017, didn't have that much but I did unload in 2021 and paid off my house and then some. I think that one is setting up to go again but even if I'm wrong the risk is asymmetrical which is the type of trade you should be looking for. It's like if you're wrong you lose 20 30 40 50% but if you're right you make X's. That account I started in 2017 with $5,000 is now worth a little over 200k but the part that's seriously impressive and I would say this to anyone if they accomplished similar is that no one trade really did it. That growth is from tens of thousands of trades with a high percent profitability. My win rate is pretty crazy it's 65 to 70% and the gains are also larger than the losses. Biggest loss this year was Intel, short $30 puts which definitely got put to me but I took in so much premium for selling them, I'm already almost back to break even so we'll see how that goes\n\nIf anyone is going to even attempt to be an active trader, you need all the education you can get. If your resourceful you should be able to figure out how to get the courses from profitable people like Adam khoo, anton from the institute of trading, the old IBD courses, the chart guys, krown, there are downloads of all of these out there and no I'm not going to tell you where, that's part of the fun, if you want it bad enough, you'll find it. In fact I'm not sure I could tell you where, the people who have these are constantly changing the sites and the download locations",

Taking it further, a 4th grader could buy the 5 biggest companies by market cap and beat the S&P by 40% over 25 years (numbers I saw were from 1998-2023).

When the markets are down, say Covid or even during the inflation heating up 2022-23 ish and the subsequent selloff in stocks, I sell the non equity component(which is now sitting at profits because its price moves opposite to stocks) to buy stocks, ETFs or whatever you prefer for your exposure to equity.\n2. Your 'volatility drag' is reduced, this concept needs a bit of a deeper understanding but basically if a stock is at 100 goes down 20% to 80  and then goes up by 25% to reach back 100, if I'm able to avoid the 20% downturn and only gain exposure to the 25% up move I would make 25% while other people have broken even. The derivation is more nuanced and conceptual than this so try reading it up on google, what I've told you is an oversimplification.\n\nNow because of my portfolio positioning is like this, I can take on higher risk, generally and in CAPM world also, more volatile pockets of the asset markets(like smallcaps, junk bonds etc.) have higher returns, but in downturns they fall harder than the Blue chips(Apple, Nvidia etc.) like the ones in DJIA index so we say these assets are more 'risky' than mainstream Blue chips, given my exposure to downturns is reduced due to my non stock component but the upside is mine I can generate a higher profit than being invested in the S&P 500 alone",

There's a long list of how investing in just one or a few companies goes sideways (Enron, Eastern Airlines, Nortel as e.g.).  I worked with one fella who started buying LOW as a Lowe's employee (he had a four-digit employee number, to offer an idea of how long he worked for the blue gable) -- that turned out great.   But we are just one series of Marvin mistakes (look at his work with JC Penney) for LOW to start a 20 yr decline.  Sears wasn't supposed to go under 25 years ago.",
