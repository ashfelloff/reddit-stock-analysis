Unless looking for attention, make that decision on your own. \n\nBut in case that‚Äôs not possible, I‚Äôll do your thinking for you. \n\n1. Is your entire life savings in this investment? If so, yeah probably not a great idea to keep holding without taking some off the table. Except for that family farm guy, that was hilarious and should be made into a hallmark movie.  \n\n2. Do you like the stock justifiably or are you just full on FOMO and/or greedy? If the latter; sell.\n\n3. Life comes down to a few important choices. Decide if this is one. Personally I wouldn‚Äôt let an online community make that decision for me. Maybe I‚Äôm uNiQuE.\n\n4. And a bit of a repeat. Grow up. Be an adult and make your own choices. If you arent sophisticated enough to do so, accept you‚Äôre at the casino (totally fine) or stop investing in moon shots and just throw your money in an index fund until you are sophisticated enough. \n\n5. I don‚Äôt care what you do. And I find all these posts very enjoyable and entertaining. üíé üôåüèº to the üåô and all. \n\nBackground: I am a CFA charterholder, a CFP professional, a CPWA professional, and hold the CTFA designation. Ethically I must share that this doesn‚Äôt mean I am smarter or can produce better returns vs those without. Also, my Roth IRA is 50% NVDA, 25% TSLA, 17% AAPL, 3% MSFT and GOOG. My 401k which is 4 times the size is invested purely in index funds. \n\nYou all did make me money on the meme stocks‚Ä¶which I was just told by Reddit that I cannot reference in my post. So thank you Regards. Keep on keeping on. \n\nEdit: While I‚Äôm clearly qualified to give financial advice, this is just something to reflect on and not meant as advice. Read this, ignore this, take this as a challenge. I‚Äôm indifferent lol\n\nEdit 2: My taxable dollars are invested in illiquid assets like PE/RE. Likely not relevant but I figured why not share everything but my SSN. ",

I believe I mentioned something to that extent earlier. \n\nI wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm loaded, but that‚Äôs relative and a matter of perspective. I have a number in my head. When I hit that number I‚Äôll feel loaded. \n\nI do focus on investment management but estate planning for those with net worths in excess of the lifetime exemption amount is what I really enjoy. I‚Äôm preparing to get castrated for this comment but my client minimum is $40mm. It is this because that‚Äôs the number where I am able to offer the value which I believe justifies my pay. \n\nIf a serious question about career path‚Ä¶and tough to tell if it is, I started as a junior associate right out of school, excelled, took every opportunity I had to continue my education and broaden my expertise. While I do have a wife, I do not have children, and I enjoy working hard and long hours. It turns out this was rewarded and exponentially accelerated my track. My advice is the same as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve heard before: Know your worth, don‚Äôt be afraid to work harder than the person next to you or your boss‚Äîyou can‚Äôt control when the position you want becomes available, but you can control when you‚Äôre ready for it‚Äîask for help and for mentors.
