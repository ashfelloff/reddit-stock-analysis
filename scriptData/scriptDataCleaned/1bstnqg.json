  "selftext": "Just something that I have been pondering recently.\n\nHere, me out. What if we are not in a bubble, but the beginning of an actual infinite money glitch.\n\n If its logical to assume the AI we have access to today is a fraction of what they have access to. What are the chances, some big bank or hedgy has put something into their \"black boxes\" that essentially manipulates foreign markets and transports the wealth Stateside, reinvesting it here. \n\nThere is no way, a company has created this, and not first found an application in the financial sector ... I mean, right? I feel like the fact that we even have access now, means the starting pistol must have gone off ages ago ... or?\n\nIt should be noted, I have been using AI extensively lately, and how seamlessly it has integrated into my life, and in turn changed my creative process and professional strategy has broken me. There is no way some of the things I have used it for, have not been more complicated than markets. Not to say it is required of me to do my job, but for a machine to act as my number 2, and at times with damn life-like feeling intuition, leads me to *feel* there is no way it isn't on ...\n\nIt should also be noted, I am a certified moron.\n\n0DTE Calls on SPY for the next year? If the overall trend was positive, would this not print? I have only recently after 6 years of heavy investing and a lot of hard lessons learned, begun to feel confident enough, to play with my spare change.\n\n&#x200B;",

From Wikipedia article AI Winter:\n\n> Many researchers in AI in the mid 2000s deliberately called their work by other names, such as informatics, machine learning, analytics, knowledge-based systems, business rules management, cognitive systems, intelligent systems, intelligent agents or computational intelligence, to indicate that their work emphasizes particular tools or is directed at a particular sub-problem. Although this may be partly because they consider their field to be fundamentally different from AI, it is also true that the new names help to procure funding by avoiding the stigma of false promises attached to the name \"artificial intelligence\".",

Yes, LLMs like ChatGPT are ML, but so are ‚Äúboring‚Äù things like fitting nonlinear models to extract seasonality effects from weather records.\n\nThe ‚Äúboring‚Äù stuff is already used extensively in analysis and trading. The sexy LLM stuff is impressive because you can interact with it in natural language, but in trading you have hard numbers, so really the boring statistical stuff is more applicable.\n\nUnlike chat bots, which didn‚Äôt demonstrate much value or see much investment until recently, applications of ML in financial sectors are obvious and well-funded. So it isn‚Äôt likely that there‚Äôs a gap that can be filled by tech transfer from recent advances in chat bots or image generators.\n\nThere is plenty of ongoing research and open questions about financial modeling that are investigated by universities and analytics companies and quantitative funds.

What makes \"intelligence\" is not even slightly understood. And the problem is we are no closer to understanding it than when Alan Turing was thinking about it. No amount of data, resources, memory, or processing power is going to make it happen. The dilemma is a philosophical one. We can build automobiles because we understand what is required for something to be an automobile, and the processes that govern them. We don't even know where to start with AGI.",
