Then another in recent years. Government's in the US have tried to address bad monetary and fiscal policy by forcing wages higher. Due to central bank's QE program, the federal government can borrow seemingly without limit, which states have benefited directly from spending programs and asset bubbles. \n\nThe result is clear that the Government's attempts to force wage growth by policy to address the wealth gap they created have only resulted in loosing inflation. There is no way out of this problem by accelerating the same policies.",
