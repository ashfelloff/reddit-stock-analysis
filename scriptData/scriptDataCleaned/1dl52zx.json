  "selftext": "I look around and see two options.

Would you say the AI hype beginning to die down would be the main reason for a correction? I would say maybe a war but no one seems to really care about those. Trying to think of a good reason to not be overly optimistic. ",

              "body": ">with resource shortages\n\nI think this is more of a long-term problem. In most cases, the magic of pricing may bail us out.\n\nAffordable oil is expected to run out in around 50 years, but that assumes that consumption stays at current levels. We may see peak oil consumption within 5-10 years.\n\nWater is probably the biggest concern, but water shortages tend to be impacting poorer economies much more than the rich world. Part of the reason wealthy countries are in their current position is because they had access to adequate supplies of fresh water. Long term, desalination will become much cheaper due to better technology and cheaper energy (renewables, fusion, etc.).\n\nThere is still a lot of low-hanging fruit when it comes to water conservation. If we charged farmers a significant fraction of the cost of water paid by homeowners in cities, it would instantly end wasteful practices like growing almonds in California or any crops at all in Arizona. You would see an explosion in vertical farming, drip irrigation, shade-grown crops, drought tolerant GMOs, etc. Prices can work wonders if they are not artificially suppressed (or inflated) due to lobbying and corruption by special interests.\n\nHelium will probably become extremely expensive in future years, but if we stop wasting it, we may have enough to tide us over until we figure out how to produce more (fusion?), but it will likely never be as cheap and plentiful as it is currently.\n\nMost other scarce resources can be swapped with alternative materials or conserved as higher prices and better efficiency cause them to be used only where absolutely necessary.\n\nKeep in mind that today's refrigerators use around 35% of the electricity required by models produced in 2000. Aluminum cans today contain 1/6 the amount of metal used to produce the same size cans in the 1970s.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Surprising-Learned-Resources\\_and/dp/1982103574](https://www.amazon.com/More-Less-Surprising-Learned-Resources_and/dp/1982103574)",

Sure, let me pull out my crystal ball and magic wand. \n\n1. **AI Hype Deflation**: Yes, because apparently, once people stop believing that AI can solve all the world's problems, the market will just crumble. Who needs sound fundamentals when you have overhyped tech trends?\n\n2. **Global War**: Ah, yes, a global conflict. Historically proven to shake markets, but hey, who cares about wars these days? They're just background noise in our 24-hour news cycle.\n\n3. **Major Corporate Scandals**: Because who wouldn't want to wake up to find out that the world's largest companies have been cooking their books all along? Nothing like a good ol' Enron 2.0 to spice things up.\n\n4. **Economic Collapse**: Maybe a nice, juicy economic collapse from one of the major global players. But, you know, with all the QE and lowered interest rates, it's hard to imagine how that would even be possible.\n\n5. **Pandemic 2.0**: Remember the good times of 2020? A sequel could be just what we need to reset expectations. But, of course, we've all become immune to global health crises by now.\n\n6. **Alien Invasion**: Hey, you never know. If aliens decided to invade, that might just do the trick. But then again, they might bring advanced technology that boosts market productivity.\n\nSo, yes, finding a reason to not be overly optimistic is quite the challenge. Maybe the secret to market crashes is just hiding in plain sight, waiting for the right moment to pounce. Or maybe, just maybe, it's a concoction of unpredictable human behavior and unforeseen global events. But let's not worry about those; after all, the market only ever goes up, right?",
