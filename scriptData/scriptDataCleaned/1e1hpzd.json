End up having to put the loans in forbearance, defaulted on the credit cards. I think the total balance on the cards was something like $5k, or more like $7k in today's money?\n\nDefaulting on those cards was one of the best decisions I ever made. The accounts got sold of course, but the debt collectors were as desperate as anyone back then. It was three different cards sold to three different agencies, settled them all for something like $0.15 on the dollar.\n\nNo way you're getting that kind of deal today, I just got lucky.
