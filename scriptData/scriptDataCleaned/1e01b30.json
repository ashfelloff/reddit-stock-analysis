  "selftext": "All, \nAnyone watching closely on SBUX? It’s trading almost 52 week low and I am thinking about unloading a substantial capital on this stock. I know its market share is diminishing and its growth is not as solid as before but I think it’s a decent play. The other day, I read an article that Chinese ETF is trading high and over 50% growth. If this is a sign, the money is flowing into China. I think the current value is fairly cheap imo. Any thoughts? I know the consumer discretionary/restaurant sector is doing poorly but maybe it’s time to get into now?",
