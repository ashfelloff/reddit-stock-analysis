  "selftext": "All, \nAnyone watching closely on SBUX? It‚Äôs trading almost 52 week low and I am thinking about unloading a substantial capital on this stock. I know its market share is diminishing and its growth is not as solid as before but I think it‚Äôs a decent play. The other day, I read an article that Chinese ETF is trading high and over 50% growth. If this is a sign, the money is flowing into China. I think the current value is fairly cheap imo. Any thoughts? I know the consumer discretionary/restaurant sector is doing poorly but maybe it‚Äôs time to get into now?",

In China specifically, they are not doing very well and the competition is fierce, Luckin Coffee seems to be doing much better in China. I don't need to analyse any reports or statements to know it's going downhill if they continue with the same model. They have a good brand, so it's still possible for them to flip the table. MCD on the other hand is not bad, it doesn't have any real competition and I believe it should gain some momentum as soon as the economic conditions get better worldwide.",
