I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\n**News:** [Traders Are Bracing for Volatility on Fed-CPI Double Blow](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-10/traders-are-bracing-for-volatility-on-fed-cpi-double-blow)\n\n**NVDA-** Looking at both the $125 and the $120 level today. Stock split is complete so good to keep cognizant of previous levels.\n\n**GME-** Still worth watching today, **obviously a lot of bearish news recently (the share offering) so trying to be agile in this.**\n\n**CRWD-** Has been on a tear since earnings, up even more due to inclusion on the S&P 500. Watching the $375 level.\n\n**LUV-** Activist Elliott takes close to $2B stake in LUV.\n\n**AMD-** Morgan Stanley slashes rating, saying that the bar for AI companies “remains high” and investor expectations are too high.\n\n\n\n \n\n ",

In my opinion looks like a solid product for the moment we are (political right) and it will cover the needs of it, provide security via AI gun detection and people detection (I'm thinking of people that have been in jail or known terrorist etc.). I don't know much about fair price or else but since I like the idea of the product and what it means I bought 150 shares at 2.45$. Maybe I'm hoping for a big raise in the next year or couple of years.",
