  "selftext": "Last year after some lurking on WSB I figured \"Who needs college when you can 10x your tuition in the market?\" \n\nI pitched the idea of becoming a trader to my dad, and surprisingly, he agreed, BUT ONLY on one condition: If I’m not profitable by January 1st, 2025, I'm heading straight to boot camp and becoming a medic.\n \nNaturally, I went full regard:\n \nFirst, I dumped everything into $TSLA options. Easy money, right? Elon’s gonna send us to Mars.\n\nThen, I diversified into : meme stocks, biotech, AI. \n\nThrew a bit into some obscure altcoins. Figured Bitcoin was for cowards.\n \nFast forward to today. Portfolio down 60%.\nI sold it all and put it in NVDA.\n \nDad’s starting to get nervous. He checks in every week asking, \"How's the portfolio?\" Meanwhile, I’m sweating bullets as January gets closer.\n \nI’m not giving up yet. There’s still time. \nI’ve got 3 months to turn this thing around. \n\nAll I need is one good play that’ll pop and get me out of the military.",

So you want him to tie up his money with a minuscule premium return until Jan 2025?  As opposed to my idea of buying DITM call leaps that’ll give him a leverage of owning more shares with a fraction of the cost, and will move up when NVDA moves up, as well as having time on his side to avg down or sell for profit anytime?

You see that more with vast mobilization of ground troops during a kinetic conflict. \n\nArmy is unique in which you sign a contract to enlist for the job that you want. Now, do you get the job you want in every other Branch? Majority of the time yeah. But the army is specific in which your job (your MOS or military occupational specialty) is part of your contract. That being said, if you suck and are a shitbag and you fail at one or many things you can lose that job. Majority of the time they will just recycle you into another class date but I have seen people reclassed into another (shittier) job after like the second or third time failing. \n\nMedic is a very dynamic job- in both the Navy and the Army you can be assigned to infantry, artillery, etc units and actually be a fucking medic, or at least one that you would be proud to call yourself. You also can go be a low-T beta or woman and go to like a hospital or such. They were integrating women as medics in infantry units when I was getting out and it was a cluster fuck. I have a lot of strong opinions about that lol.\n\nBut yeah, it's the second largest job in the army. Very broad in your positions and possible responsibilities. I would recommend it but no matter which branch you're going to go into it's going to suck dog shit (except Air force- those bastards got paid more to stay in our army barracks for what they called 'hardship pay' lol)\n\nIf you were going to do it, I would not recommend Army because it is trash. Don't listen to the dumbasses calling the Air Force, the Chair Force. \" Oh no! They are soft and actually give a shit about their people!\" F all that. Lots of cool jobs in the Air Force and if you want to be a sooper cool High-Speed low-drag oper8tor there are plenty of options in a branch that actually gives a shit about you. \n\nI used to do career counseling so any questions you have or if you want some ammo when you go talk to a recruiter hit me up. All I have to show for my time is bad memories, a bad back and knees, and my name on some government watch list since they see GWOT veterans as some kind of existential threat now.",

Pays exceptionally well and you get to do lots of cool stuff if you want, or just work in the hospital if you don't. There is a strong core of nurses in the Air Force and Navy, and while there are Army nurses, it's not as common. \n\nArmy utilizes a lot of physicians assistants (they basically created the career field). \n\nVery fascinating subject matter. Also a lot of money gets thrown at you for either paying off loans from schooling. I knew plenty of doctors who became basically debt free after not that much time in active duty, and they never did anything crazier than working at a hospital.",
