I don't know how much bigger credit bubble is as a result, but you'd figure any artificial inflation to assets, once snuffed out, is going to to cause a bit of panic. \n\nIf I can borrow $10 for 2% APY and I know I can convert into $9.85 at 5.0% APY. It works out well for a year, so I borrow $100 doing the same. Then I go all out and borrow $1M expecting I'll be able to make $14k risk free. Then I get greedy and I start investing the profits into speculative assets and stocks and do well so I start getting even more greedy and pulling money from the non-risky bonds and dumping into speculative assets/stocks. All of a sudden my loan APY gets adjusted upwards and markets drop.",
