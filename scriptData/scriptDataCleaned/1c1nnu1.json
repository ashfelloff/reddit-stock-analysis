              "body": "It really depends on the person but what I'm saying can be scaled. Of course when you don't have a lot of money to spare you can't just get any contract; you have to stick to those you can afford. But using money that you can afford to lose is crucial to maximising the duration of an option. \n\nIf you have 2k in all to invest, you don't put that 2k into options hoping that it'll definitely make money or that you'll pull out in time to not lose too much. Because then if the option isn't immediately making money you get scared, you close the position, lose a healthy chunk of money, and usually you end up seeing that it would probably have made money if you had let it ride it out. If you instead buy an option with 200 bucks you won't care that much if you lose it, you can let it ride out its duration and maybe it'll end up going green, if not you're -200$ but you still have 1800 to keep trying. Of course that 2k in itself should be money meant for investing that you can also afford to lose not your life savings.\n\nObviously all this is relative. If our imaginary trader in this scenario is regarded and makes bad picks there's no strategy that will save him. But I've personally had it happen to me too many times, that I open a position and it's in the red and I get cold feet and pull out, only to later discover that the stock would ultimately move in my favor as I assumed and if I had held on I would have made money. So I downsized the amounts I put on each position and made my loss tolerance wider. You can't expect to only make money, there is inevitable risk in all this. If you can't handle seeing a position in the red don't open it.",

                              "body": "My dude, this is why everyone says, over and over, to learn how options work before getting into options. When an option expires, that's it, it's worthless and you lose the premium you paid for it, because even though it was in the money, you didn't close the position (ie sell it to someone else) and you didn't exercise it either, so nothing happens. \n\nOptions don't have to be exercised. The whole point when buying calls and puts is that you only pay the premium and then sell it off before expiration to mr money bags who can actually exercise. The value of options rises when they become in the money because they afford the opportunity to make a buy or sell with tangible intrinsic benefit. \n\nBut for every bought option, someone is selling it, also known as writing options. When you're selling options, you're only keeping the premium, but stand to lose a ton of money. When you sell an option, you actually bet that it won't be in the money. You're expecting the opposite result of what the person buying it wants. But you don't have control over whether the option will be exercised or not. If you're selling calls and someone exercises, you have the obligation to sell them those shares at the strike price. If you don't have them already, you buy them right then and there and then sell them which obviously incurs a loss. When selling puts, if they're exercised you're obligated to buy the shares off of them, meaning that you have to have a lot of money in your account to do so.\n\nTL:DR learn how options work. When buying options you risk the premium paid but the potential upside is huge. When selling options you can only gain the premium but the potential downside is huge.",
