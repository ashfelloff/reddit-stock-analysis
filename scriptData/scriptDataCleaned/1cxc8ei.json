As for many, I disagree with you, I'm not obligated to give more because I didn't say a number or etc. Lol\n\nWhen congress votes on the budget or continuing spending resolutions, they do not vote to \"approve\" mandatory spending. Mandatory spending was approved by whatever specific piece of legislation that created it. In order to change mandatory spending you must pass legislation that alters the prior enacting piece of legislation. Thus it is not under budgetary control. Congress could literally do nothing and mandatory spending will still occur.\n\nWhen politicians speak of tackling mandatory spending they do not do it through the budget. You must only listen to or read the headlines. For instance, the \"Republican\" platform for dealing with the deficit is not just adjusting mandatory spending, hardly. The most basic plan that many Republicans want is to remove the spending increases that occurred since 2020. The reasoning is if the pandemic is over, why hasn't spending gone back down.\n\nYou obviously think you're right and have a desperate desire to get the last word with a stranger on the internet so I'll just step away from this and you can reply with whatever and maybe someone will read it. have a great day 👍",
