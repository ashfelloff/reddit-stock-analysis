  "selftext": "I opened up calls in NVDA back in early March and as NVDA kept going down, I went full regard and liquidated most of my assets in safe investments such as VOO, MSFT, etc and my regular NVDA shares to double down on my calls and I kept losing money but held steady, expecting good earnings in May and hoping for a stock split announcement. I always told myself I would sell if NVDA hit 1100-1150 and this morning, even though I was tempted to hold through the split, I finally sold everything when NVDA was around 1115 to stick with my price target. I‚Äôve now pened up a smaller position with June 2025 calls (bye short term capital gains) and bought 200 shares to participate in further rallies and benefit from selling covered calls. Sure my gains will be smaller now but at least I won‚Äôt be as stressed looking at the stock app every day now. All the rest of the money is now diversified and I can rest easy. ",
