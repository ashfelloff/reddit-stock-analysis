So lots of categories can see a higher price in Jan/Feb that then holds steady for the rest of the year.\n\nThis hit both auto and health insurance components.  \n\nAlso for PCE there is a unique component of “portfolio management fees” which is what people pay investment managers.  It basically tracks the market so when stocks go up it also goes up. (Because of how they are paid).",
