I agree that markets would boom even if it's a fake boom due to The Fed suddenly deciding that inflation is okay. \n\nPeople and markets need to get off of their addiction to cheap money and low rates. The Fed is doing a good job sticking to their guns. If banks fail due to higher rates, then they shouldn't be in the banking business. It's the same thing with any business - if you can only survive in a low interest rate environment where you continue to stay over-leveraged and continue to roll over debt, then maybe your business isn't actually sound and we should let it fail. The government needs to start letting capitalism run its course and let businesses fail again.",
