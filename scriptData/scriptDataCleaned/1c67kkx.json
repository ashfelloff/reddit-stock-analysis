      "body": "I thought one of the reasons given by the judge was that the board was not really independent of Musk, and so had a conflict of interest in approving the payout.\n\nIf they do the same thing now with the same board, is it not likely to be voided again in the same way? Is the plan to move to Texas and then hope judges there would not void it again?",

          "body": "The key part of the ruling is that while there was a shareholder vote, the guidance on the vote didn’t disclose the ties to Musk of the board that “negotiated” the payment. If they hold a new vote and openly say “we’re friends of Musk and basically just give him what he wants, please approve it anyway”, the shareholder vote should cover the board.\n\nOriginally I’d say that given that Tesla shares are largely owned by people who believe in Musk to some degree there’s a good chance of the vote passing regardless, but the recent demand for 25% of stock after selling a good chunk should be very alarming. This isn’t just about a one-time bonus; committing to Musk apparently means bankrolling whatever expensive distractions he finds too.",

The fair market value of those options at the time were $2.6 billion, and the people voting on them really wanted Tesla to have the high market cap that would unlock those options.\n\nToday, now that the preconditions were all met, the fair market value of those options are over $50 billion.
