Dragon Nest, Gunbound, FlyFF, Maple Story, etc)\n\nCompetitive games on other hand have the opposite problem, most players pretend to be older because getting exposed to be a kid will immediately attract pretty much every insult  under the sun. It's better now than 10 years ago due to newer word filter systems and stricter monitoring due to threats of fines from regulators, but players have gotten creative with the insults.",
