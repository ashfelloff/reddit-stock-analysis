  "selftext": "* June CPI rose 3.0% over the last 12 months lower than the expected 3.1%\n* The Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) declined 0.1 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis, after being unchanged in May, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Over the last 12 months, the all items index increased 3.0 percent before seasonal adjustment.\n\n* The index for gasoline fell 3.8 percent in June, after declining 3.6 percent in May, more than offsetting an increase in shelter. The energy index fell 2.0 percent over the month, as it did the preceding month. The index for food increased 0.2 percent in June. The food away from home index rose 0.4 percent over the month, while the food at home index increased 0.1 percent. \n\n* The index for all items less food and energy rose 0.1 percent in June, after rising 0.2 percent the preceding month. Indexes which increased in June include shelter, motor vehicle insurance, household furnishings and operations, medical care, and personal care. The indexes for airline fares, used cars and trucks, and communication were among those that decreased over the month.\n\n* The all items index rose 3.0 percent for the 12 months ending June, a smaller increase than the 3.3-percent increase for the 12 months ending May. The all items less food and energy index rose 3.3 percent over the last 12 months and was the smallest 12-month increase in that index since April 2021. The energy index increased 1.0 percent for the 12 months ending June. The food index increased 2.2 percent over the last year. \n\nThe economy would benefit drastically if the interest hike reached a peak, and started to turn around.\n\nLoans are much less likely to go on to default as inflation comes down.\n\nA study by credit agency TransUnion has shown that inflation pushes borrowers with low FICO scores to default. Default is always a concern for investors of lending institutions.\n\nFed chair Jerome Powell is more likely to cut the rate this year sooner than later as inflation comes down.\n\nThe CPI report, interest rate hikes, house prices and rents, wage growth, job openings, unemployment rate, international conflicts, and trade wars all play a significant role in guiding the market's microenvironment.\n\n\"In June, the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers fell 0.1 percent, seasonally adjusted, and rose 3.0 percent over the last 12 months, not seasonally adjusted. The index for all items less food and energy increased 0.1 percent in June (SA); up 3.3 percent over the year (NSA).\"\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)\n\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)",
