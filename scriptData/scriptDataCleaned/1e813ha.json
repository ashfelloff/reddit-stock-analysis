Even if every mid cap company spent a generous amount on AI cards with unknown returns at their scale, they are still less than 25% of the big boys who have deep pockets and debt dicks to swing around.\n\nThe midcaps will end up buying AI from them not risk making it themselves.\n\nThe second any of the big boys get their own chips online NVDA is basically dead, especially when they are still halted on exports to continue growing.\n\nAMD has yet to do anything meaningful with AI, they have stuff coming out at EOY, but even then it looks very barebones when you have NVDA new launch.",
