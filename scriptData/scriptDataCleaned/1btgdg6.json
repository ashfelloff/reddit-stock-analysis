That said new entry will take a few years to enter the market rubriks in and starting to own. \n\nSo ide say buy early sell early - three years is the flight time until it will regulate in price until then it'll be a nice crazy fad - gain speed might even look like \"Snowflake\" when it goes live. \n\n\nAlso yes I work in the market space - no I don't work for Rubrik - yes I will be taking a large position when it pops out.",

Anyone look into this? Guessing it’s services revenue and perhaps they moved to a channel services model to improve margins? Just a guess \n- anyone know if the ARR includes hardware - is this an appliance or just software? \n\nSome great high level numbers, but growth won’t be sustainable imo if a bunch of the growth came from maintenance base unless they dump a ton of cost into gtm, presumably. Also, clearly they are lighting money on fire so curious how they will sustain growth more profitably considering their sales and marketing line is massive relative to revenue already.  Anyone here use the product? I thought it was more of a backup play which is a race to the bottom on price (see: cash burn), but maybe they had successful pivot to cyber security and it’s not just fluff?\n\nCurious of thoughts from folks who looked deep into this or use the product ",

It’s so boring, they spent a fortune on marketing to upsell their product as a cybersecurity tool - because it creates read-only backups that could be recovered (if everything goes perfectly) in the event of ransomware; problem is, things rarely go perfectly, and their biggest competitors have the exact same features. They do sell an outrageously expensive “enterprise suite” of features that are supposed to detect ransomware and insider threats, but like everything in this space, it works under ideal conditions, but I wouldn’t trust it as a control layer. Overall, it’s a decent backup solution, but there are almost identical competitors that are more compelling.
