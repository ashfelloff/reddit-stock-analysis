Then use it as a trade In towards the 17 pro max sept 2025.\n\nAny major carrier is buying these phones in bulk from Apple at a discounted price and then selling them to you at near loss, the bill credit system keeps you paying for service over the course of the financing of the phone, which is where the carriers actually make their money, along with early upgrade and other add ins such as insurance.\n\nIf you want the bill credit system to work in your favor then you want the new iPhone on trade in the month it comes out which is normally September that way you can upgrade every 3 generations unless you opt for early upgrade which is every year.",
