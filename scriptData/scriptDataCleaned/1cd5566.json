      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

They only opened 2 of the 28 terminals they bought, and they aren’t going to increase profits until mid late 2025. They took on yrcs unprofitable contracts to prop up revenue. If SAIA and Odfl missed, Xpo is guaranteed to miss with the cash burn, depreciation, and amortization payments, it’s a 10% drop after earnings maybe more. While Odfl and SAIA had 15-22% drops Xpo has already taken hits from the 52w high because they were falsely propped up from the yrc acquisitions. I may not know the auto industry, or tech industry, but I know trucking. All my major wins have been from trucking plays, I lose when I jump into shit I don’t understand bc I like to gamble. 105 17 may 24 puts guaranteed to print, high likelihood of 100 17 may 24 puts printing. Take it with a grain of salt, but I only missed on 3 out of my 10 plays this week. Hope you make money",

Do your own due diligence but after projecting to have 12 of the 28 terminals open by now, (today's date) and only opening 3...I think the terminals is much more expensive to open and operate than anticipated. And I think it's going to effect the bottom line big time. They said it would be as simple as \"moving from a small building to a bigger building with no extra hiring\". But I think they underestimated yrcs financial crisis and found our the terminals needed more work than anticipated.",
