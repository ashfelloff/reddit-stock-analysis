The finalists featured Luka and Tatum, both Jordan brand athletes with ugly ass shoes because Jordan doesn’t really seem to want any shoe to eclipse his in term of popularity. \n\nAll of the other Nike Athletes kinda got embarrassed in the playoffs, Booker, Giannis, Durant, and LeBron first round embarrassments. Adidas’ Anthony Edwards also shined in these playoffs and that man has a nice ass shoe, people calling him the next Jordan and whatnot. \n\nWould expect a bounce back in the next quarter or two after sales start flowing in from a result of the Olympic Games in Paris though, good amount of high profile Nike athletes on the roster and I would expect team USA to feature those players like they usually do.",
