  "selftext": "The title is self-explanatory.\n\nWe're all witnessing the impact of AI, and there's no doubt it can be super beneficial to many. However, at the same time, it is clear that some jobs can be easily replaced (or, more accurately, destroyed, from humans' point of view).\n\nI do not engage in short selling, so the goal of this post isn't to find companies (or sectors) to short-sell. Rather, the goal is to spark a discussion on this topic.\n\nThe first companies that come to mind that will be harmed by AI are call centres. A lot of repetitive work that can be replaced, with a fraction of the cost. I do there will be a huge impact in the next 5 years.\n\nWhich companies (or sectors) do you believe AI will replace/destroy. Also, what would the timeframe be?",

The plan is to train it using all the tickets that have been submitted to the help desk, along with our existing knowledge bases, to replace and enhance our current help desk. For example, if an employee calls in saying they can’t install an update for “X app” due to privileged access, the voice GPT would engage like a human operator, asking the necessary troubleshooting questions and then submitting the ticket to our ITSM. We’re also exploring integration with Active Directory, so the system can automatically check if approval is needed for the app. If approval is required, it’ll handle that process; if not, it’ll grant access directly through AD, fully automating tasks that would have previously required human intervention.",

Don't make me laugh.\n\nThe fundamental problem is accuracy. \"Artificial Intelligence\" is a bad name for these algorithms because they are not actually intelligent. They are extremely sophisticated pattern matching algorithms. They don't actually understand any question posed to them, they are just good at predicting what you want them to say based on their training data. The \"hallucinations\" are not a big per se, they are the algorithms working as intended. This fundamental flaw in the technology is extraordinarily difficult to close. There are many experts in the field, ones not on the payroll of AI companies (one of whom I am related to), who blatantly say that current technology will not be able to close that gap. It will take a completely, 100% new approach to produce guaranteed accurate output. That can't just be thought up overnight. Current AI is the result of nearly 2 decades of research into machine learning, we can't reinvent the wheel instantly just because corporate valuations depend on it.\n\nWithout accuracy, AI cannot replace industries. Take customer service for example, I see quite a few commenters bring that one up. Unless companies are willing to be legally liable for whatever promises their AI service reps make to customers, regardless of what it may be, there will always be a need for human customer service reps. AI could be used to replace current automated systems, which we all know are trash today, but remember today's systems at best will allow super basic automated actions and nothing else. Think of health insurance as an example. Imagine an AI approving an expensive medication or procedure that is outside of the insurance company guidelines. Now a patient and/or doctor thinks it's been approved, if the insurance company refuses to pay that's quite the legal quagmire. Even if we assume insurance companies are all dicks that don't care about us (safe assumption) the sheer anger from not being able to trust their customer service AI will prevent them from moving forward with it.\n\nAnyway that's my rant. AI is a powerful tool, but it is also super over-hyped in its capabilities. We are far far away from our robot overlords taking over my friends. Sorry.",

These are American companies that manage or directly own call centers located in places like the Philippines or India. \n\nIf you have been hiding under a rock, let me get you up to speed really quickly. There is a new version of ChatGPT that speaks in fluent English and learns anything if you feed it enough information. \n\nThere are learning modules that a call center can adopt in the background where the actual interactions of call center agents will end up training the AI. With enough hours of complete background or even invisible, behind-the-scenes learning by the software, it can easily replace call center workers. \n\nIn fact, according to a recent estimate, one call to a call center in the United States currently costs 35 cents per minute. In India, it's 10 cents per minute. But with AI, even that 10 cents will be too expensive. \n\nWhy? Currently AI voce call fulfillment is around 15 cents per minute. But given the fact that large language models continue to crash in price and AI software continues to crash in price, it's only a matter of time until that 15-cent-per-minute rate goes down to less than a penny per minute. \n\nIf you need proof of this, look at how much AI-based call processing was 5 years ago. It was just through the roof. From there, it crashed to 15 cents given that rate of depreciation, assuming that it's constant, we will be close to 0.001 cent per minute in a short period of time. That's how rapidly AI pricing is depreciating. \n\nExpect radical changes in call centers, but also radical changes in anything that requires low-level, human judgment. This can be reading reports, processing and tagging documents, so every industry, all the way from legal services to medical records, will be either destroyed or significantly disrupted by AI.\n\nNow of course this begs the question, how about last-mile service fulfilment? Even if a doctor has to rely on all sorts of charts that were basically processed by AI and streamlined by artificial intelligence, the last mile of that service involves a human doctor talking to a patient. That's now going to go away anytime soon. \n\nBut even then, it's still not a sure bet that humans will keep that type of job. The same goes with a lawyer advising his or her client.",
