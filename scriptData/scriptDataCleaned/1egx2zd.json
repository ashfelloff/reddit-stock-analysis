It’s not just negative public perception, but also increased scrutiny from government officials who can leverage that public hate for easy political capital by going after them. To me it’s all related, and it’s obvious that Meta would prefer to avoid it altogether.\n\nAs for your second point, that’s just how the game is played in the US. Silicon Valley watched Microsoft get crippled in the early 2000s due to not playing nice with regulators, and learned to be much more politically savvy as a result.\n\nEdit: I also want to point out that the response to Meta de-prioritizing political content was largely negative from the left, despite being criticized for doing the opposite in previous elections. The truth is both sides leverage social media greatly to campaign, while calling them out publicly for political favor. Everyone was onboard with banning TikTok earlier this year, but now Kamala’s campaign is basically being carried out on the same platform. Just goes to show people only get upset with politics on social media when it goes against their team.",

But they certainly also want to appeal somewhat to left wingers, who they know don't like covid misinformation or other types of misinfo.\n\nThere's absolutely nothing wrong with facebook posting little corrections to false information w/sources. I think allowing people to post lies but posting little links to the truth below it is a fair in between. Most of the people that don't want to trust facebook anyway simply won't click on those links so it doesn't even change anyone's opinions but it still somewhat satisfies left wingers.\n\nIn basically the same way that Twitter (Now X) has community notes to correct both left wing and right wing misinfo. \n\nNobody on FB wants to just ban conservatives. Not sure why you think that is the case. I've heard this argument even for other social media sites like youtube, which I always laugh at because there's ton of very prominent conservative figures on there that have millions of subscribers that have not been banned.

              "body": "It sounds like you’re suggesting Apple only pretends to prioritize privacy. Let me give you some concrete examples that demonstrate Apple’s actual care about privacy:\n\n1. App Tracking Transparency: This feature significantly fucked up Facebook’s cross-device monetization model for several years, as it requires apps to obtain user permission before tracking their data across other apps and websites.\n\n2. On-Device AI/ML Processing: Features like Face ID, Photos analysis, and Siri operate directly on the device, ensuring that private data remains on the user’s device and is not shared with Apple.\n\n3. End-to-End Encryption and Private Keys: This is why I don’t believe Apple can unlock devices for governments, even if requested. Apple’s encryption policies ensure that only the users have access to their data.\n\nThese are just three examples that come to mind immediately. Additionally, Apple’s business model focuses on selling premium devices, unlike companies like Meta, Google, Amazon, and Netflix, which heavily rely on advertising as a core part of their business.\n\nIt’s worth noting that while Apple does sell iAds for Apple developers, it’s a relatively small business. From my understanding in the industry, iAds can’t compete with other major players and is more of a checkbox to keep developers satisfied.",

                  "body": "I guess this all depends on the word \"pretends\". If your perception is that I believe Apple is focusing on privacy for profit and not moral reasons, then yes I believe they are pretending.\n\nJust for transparency, I work in privacy at Meta and my closest colleague is a former Apple privacy lead. I really have no tie to Meta emotionally, I am pretty close to leaving frankly speaking, but the narratives around privacy are infuriating enough for me to clarify.\n\nJust like any field, there are the issues that appeal to the masses due to simplicity and issues that actually matter to the experts. Most of the privacy work Apple does is very light, easily marketable, and is very appealing to the masses.   \n  \n- App tracking transparency is 100% not a real privacy play, this was evident before I ever joined Meta. ATT coincided with Apple's ads business, AI work, and increased competition from Chinese competitors. ATT is a way for Apple to maintain a monopoly on iPhone user data. User data is still being heavily tracked, just by Apple instead of other apps.\n\n- On-device processing is another idea that sounds really nice in theory, and does offer some protection, but is not viewed as real comprehensive privacy work. Face ID, photos analysis, and siri operate on device because they can. There is no need for those to run off-device, so by running them on-device apple can tout \"privacy\". Every single thing that you do on your iphone that are not those three things are processed off-device and captured and fed into ML models for the use of selling more iphones and iAds. This also isn't groundbreaking and is standard industry practice, most Quest data is kept on-device for example. Keeping 1% of data on-device and then sending 99% off-device to profit off of while touting privacy is a bit misleading.\n\n- Encryption in transit is standard industry practice so I will assume that you are referring to device locking + E2E iMessages. Most apps that are strictly messenger apps are E2E encrypted, because there's no reason not to. Messenger isn't E2E encrypted because it is connected to a social media platform that grants access to a wide range of users (Facebook). Some of those users are children or potential targets of scams. If you E2E encrypt messenger then you can't have youth protection features or anti-scam features while offering access to billions of users via Facebook. The same applies to Instagram but not to Whatsapp, which is E2E encrypted for that reason. I can't think of a single device that isn't E2E encrypted though. This isn't unique to Apple. Apple just advertises it. \n\nSo what is real privacy work? Purpose limitation, limiting the use of data based on heavy audits. A comprehensive privacy program audited internally by hand, by scans (that are audited by 3rd parties or the government), and that the program itself is also audited by a third party and the government (This is what Meta does following the FTC consent order). Boards of third party entities responsible for vetting overall privacy programs. Privacy red teams. Collaboration with universities for privacy audits. Apple doesn't talk about these things because they don't do the majority of them. They also aren't \"sexy\" like ATT is or on-device processing.\n\nSo my point is that most of Apple's privacy talk isn't unique or important or significant. But it is appealing to users and as such improves their sales and strategic positioning. What really matters vs what the public cares about differs drastically in this space.",

With Meta you are connecting with friends and family to form an online community with people you care about (which drives engagement).

This allows a relatively safe and effective environment for advertisers to spend money, and at a relatively low cost. You can advertise to users in developing countries for literally a penny per user. The amount of targeting features on Meta are incredible. You can also share proprietary data with them to enhance your targeting. They’re not on the same level as Google but they’re still very good. \n\nReddit and Twitter are cesspools for advertisers. Anonymous accounts, hard to target based on user interests, too much trolling and brand risk.
