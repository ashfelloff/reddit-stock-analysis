All you do is sell shares, put them into a HY savings account or bonds and let them accumulate interest.\n\nWhy do morons think someone selling at a high and taking the cash and putting someplace is \"losing money\".",

The only people who look at that headline and think \"haha!!! yea screw them!!!\" are people who have absolutely zero understanding of finance whatsoever. The valuation of companies fluctuates. They did not \"lose 66 billion dollars\", the valuation of their companies dropped 66 billion dollars. Losing 66 billion dollars is going to the casino and losing it all on red.\n\nDo you think you'll see articles stating how they made back their 66 billion and then some in 2-3 months time when these stocks are at new ATH's? No, because ragebait headlines about billionaires losing money makes stupid people feel better about themselves and drives their resentment-filled interaction online just like this one is doing. \n\nI'd like to say you belong here, but you're too stupid for even this place for posting this.
