These companies trade at insane PEs (currently 570) because the expectation is they will continue growing profits at an exponential rate (forward PE is 75). \n\nTheir contracts stipulate they have to refund no more than 1 year of payments for any failures. Imagine them trying to put that in future contracts. Any business will laugh them out of the office. They will demand compensation equal to their losses that are not covered by insurance.\n\nWhich brings me to the 2nd factor, there's no way their insurance premiums aren't going to skyrocket, which will once again not reflect in the current stock price but will eventually factor into forward profit guidance.\n\nAnd finally, lawsuits. Even if they have insurance, there are often caps to how much insurers will pay out. And the overhang of lawsuits often creates a cloud of uncertainty over a stock that forces selling. Just look at JNJ. They've literally been stuck for years because no one had a clue what they will have to pay out for TALC lawsuits.\n\nAnyway, this is my half-baked theory.",

This is a major breach of trust for clients and shows extreme lack of care on their part, giving vital insight into how poor the internal processes at Crowdstrike are. This is a not just a “fuck up”, it’s a legitimate huge failure across so many levels of Crowdstrike’s organisation. I don’t have a crystal ball or anything but I’d be genuinely concerned if most of their clients renewed their contracts, and I wouldn’t be surprised if many drop Crowdstrike all together prior to renewal.\n\nFor context, instead of pushing the actual channel file to all client machines, they pushed a file with all zero bytes. That means they do not appropriately test or inspect extremely low level drivers that have full control and visibility over the entire local system and network traffic. Now imagine instead of shipping a buggy file that caused downtime, they shipped a vulnerability? \n\nI really doubt critical services like hospitals, airlines, banks or emergency operators will be willing to play the field again with a partner that has shown how little attention they pay towards their product. Even at heavily discounted renewal quotes the damages for plenty of firms might outweigh any savings. I think the impact of this might be latent, but won’t be positive, and I don’t see them bouncing back in terms of reputation anytime soon.\n\nThis is FAR from the only enterprise solution at this scale, just take a look at Palo Alto and SentinelOne.",
