          "body": "The rebalance is from prices on the 14th and both have retraced to prices from a day or 2 before that, AAPL lows of the 12th and NVDA lows of the 13th. NVDA just did it's retracing in the morning but APPL waited until late power hour. Would make sense if I'm a big fund though, trap liquidity up high on APPL as a sell and build liquidity low on the buy of NVDA.\n\nNVDA likes to drop below the 200MA on a near weekly basis anyway to build liquidity. I was only watching SPY and NVDA but both tested and resisted the 500MA. \n\nIt's what I misjudged this week trying to time the bottom, sold my puts too early and bought calls too early toward the end of Thursday when NVDA levelled off just below the 200MA, I didn't see a 500MA retest coming on Friday.\n\nGood news is, there is a fucking mountain of liquidity at the mid 210s and low 130s for both now. 500MA resistance is a good bullish signal. If they close the cup at 210 and 130 Monday or Tuesday, we're taking flight again.",

It's not a normal amount of volume/liquidity around 130 so I think we go back to 130 pretty quickly next week, mayne even PM. I'll be looking to sell my 132Cs for the 28th when we do to play it safe and bank some gains.\n\nMedium term, 130 is a good price point to remember. If we run up the next few weeks and have another pull back in mid July say,  130 will be a good lower resistance. If we reject 130 this week and we see a proper pull back for a while, I wouldn't be taking any long positions above 130 until it's retaken.",
