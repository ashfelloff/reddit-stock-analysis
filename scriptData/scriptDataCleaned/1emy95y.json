      "body": "I have been following Nvidia closely since the July 2021 stock split (because an annoying friend of mine who was so proud of the gains on his one share that I guess is now 40 shares)--sentiment always goes down when the stock falls the usual 30 to 50% from ATH, as recently as last Fall 2023, but it never seems to lose momentum for long. We are in a different ballgame now that its up with the Mag7 big boys, but honestly this is such a unique market I suppose it could fall to the $75 range (that still being a 30 Forward PE and 45 present PE, mind you) for a bit, but until the demand dries up for whatever reason I just dont see that happening. Nvidias customers are trillion dollar companies that even in a recession and they see another 20% pullback are still trillion dollar companies that need Nvidias products and services. Unless there start to be massive earnings misses , it could fall to the extremely cheap $50 range but it could just as easily return and pass $140 like nothing. I am mulling going balls deep before earnings",
