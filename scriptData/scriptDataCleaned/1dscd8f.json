      "body": "According to Boeing, Starliner is safe for return travel. The issue is with the thrusters attached to the service module which is separate from the capsule. This part separates and burns up on re-entry, so they cannot test it on the ground to see what is malfunctioning. But they can carry out ground tests and see if any solutions that worked on the ground work in space, hence the extra time in orbit.\n\nThere are worse things than spending time in space at the ISS.\n\nSafe or not, it's really embarrassing. It seems like everything Boeing works on these days is riddled with failure. People no longer want to fly on 737 MAX-9 planes out of fear. Boeing can't get the MAX 7 or 10 in customers hands, most likely (this is speculation) because they open themselves up for lawsuits until the problems with the 9 are resolved. The 787 is still having QA issues. The 777x should have been in customers hands by now and it's not carrying passengers until at least 2026. Some of that is engine issues with a supplier. Boeing military is rife with project delays, cost overruns and losing money on fixed price contracts.",
