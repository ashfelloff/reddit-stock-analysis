To me it appears that any business that isn't a financial institution run by these MBA crews has lots of problems. Technical companies like Boeing should be run by technical people who understand the business from the ground up. The MBA crew can stick to being CFOs and marketing. Having technical people not just as CEO but also middle management will also make it easier for them to deal with labor and avoid these types of problems as they can understand the challenges they are facing better and not just seeing them as a cost. I just look at what they've done to once great companies such as Boeing and GE and I say wtf.",

I know these may not be the best examples, but Sundar Pichai, Satya Nadella, Jensen Huang are literally engineers who made it to the c-suite. But you should always want an unlikely/unwilling leadership from a bunch of nerds rather than a bunch of jagoffs who literally go to school to only become management from the start of undergrad itself.\n\n> they are taught the best and most efficient way to increase shareholder value by running the company into the ground.\n\nJust how McKinsey likes it \"oh the problem is that you're not getting a 30% return and only a 29% return, our solution is to lay off half your workforce :) \"",

BUT were also the only company in history to have not only one type of their planes to get grounded by the FAA ever, but also their entire fleet of planes get grounded ever... and repeatedly for that matter. that is up till the recent Boeing groundings...\n\nso thats the core issue. its the management that blatantly ignores the workers concerns and complaints and they sweep safety concern under the carpet (in the name of stock profits) basically daily and thats not an exaggeration.\n\nwhich yeh thats fucked up to do the cut corners and count pennies / capitalism bullshit to god damn airplanes that fly 30,000+ feet in the air.. but you damn well better believe if theyre gonna do it they damn well better be sharing the wealth then.. not fucking taking away from the workers decent Health insurance and stock options and retirement/pensions.. not to mention totally stiffing them super hard on wages and on time off like they did with the 2014 contract... \n\nwhen in 2014 they rigged the voting for the contract through a you guessed it a McDonnell Douglas secret corpo agent in the Union. when most of the workers couldnt vote becasue they didnt receive their 'voting eligibility cards' in time to vote. which was some new bullshit way and rule that the McDonnell Douglas secret agent came up with and most everybody didnt even receive their voting card in time to vote on the contract. so they couldnt even vote. but not only that even if you were one of the lucky few that actually received the voting card in time you were also physically and purposely unable to get to the voting booths unless they waited in a 4-6+ hour line to vote (becasue of the secret agents ploys to create massive back ups including but not limited to only having 5 voting booths that were only open for a 6 hour window to vote in. which it was never like that before it was several days to vote and they had tons of voting booths). But even if you did try to vote you got written up and got 1 of 3 permanent allowed strikes before getting fired for \"missing\" work to go to vote. they were even checking the cameras to see who was there to vote and wrote them up if they called in sick to try to vote..  so yeh.. and i forget the exact number that voted but it was less than 5k people that were basically allowed to vote despite literally causing an about 8 hour traffic jam on the freeway because the line just to get to the line to vote was that backed up because they just so happened to forget to get someone to direct traffic that day to get to the union hall to vote... and you guessed it a large majority of the votes that just some how managed to get through all the hoops from the 2014 contract voting were from those coincidentally McDonnell Douglas folk... imagine that)\n\nSource: alot of my family and friends work at the Everett and Seattle assembly plants and the union. and at a multitude of levels from the wire shop to mechanics to quality control and middle to upper management and i think a current board member of the union and etc. and bro pretty much all of them are \"whistle blowers\" like legit when news of another whistle blower having a mysterious death their co workers thinks its them. and im telling you its not the Boeing assemble plant workers fault they tell their boss above them the product is all fucked up all the time and have even contacted the local media about it but you never hear about it for some 'mysterious' reason still.\n\n but to get to the beef.. its a number of things that are at fault for the bad build quality issues. but its mostly the outsourcing of parts that they do now in the like last decade. so not only are they having to stitch and piece together the planes with pieces that just dont fit right or are just flat out made wrong cause they arent made in house anymore or made in one piece anymore. but also the parts themselves dont have to pass the same safety FAA standards as the Boeing assembly plants have to abide by. but even then it woudlnt matter since as of the last decade or so Boeing has their own FAA agents that are payed directly and only by Boeing as the ONLY people that regulate their planes safety now...\n\n its a whole god damn fucked up end game capitalism eco sytem. and when you have the type of money and power that Boeing has in America you apparently in todays world can get away with anything. including knowingly endangering countless peoples lives in your faulty flying tin cans that are flying at 30,000+ feet in the air and going 500+mph. and it all in the name of stock profits only, cause they wouldnt even lose money in the long run as a company to fix their shit and build plans that dont crash, cause they the only mother fuckers making planes. but doing so would effect the stock in the short term, heaven forbid...\n\nand theres alot more to it all of course and i could go on and on but i doubt anyone will bother reading this with my bad grammar and tendency to ramble especially if i do go on so...\n\nbut i do highly recommend checking out this John Oliver exposé on Boeing that he did a few months back. he goes into further details about how shit of a company Boeing has become.\n \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8oCilY4szc",

If Boeing actually had FAA in their pockets then there wouldn’t be a need for the dog & pony show they have going on with the new FAA compliancy group they’ve formed since the door plug blow out. A group whose entirely kept compartmentalized from the rest of the company and only purpose is to waste the FAAs time. \n\nThe FAA agents on detail at Boeing are paid for by tax payers. And no they’re not bought out. Dumb yes. But it actually isn’t comically easy to buy out govies. Don’t pretend like Boeing is in control of any situation with the government, they’re in incredible deep shit. The compliancy group I mentioned is backlogged years out and haven’t even made it to the incidents after the door plug. But it doesn’t matter because the group is designed to spin the FAA’s wheels and kick the can. \n\nAnyways I can only see two scenarios. Boeing isn’t intending on righting its wrongs.
