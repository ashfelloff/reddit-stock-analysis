  "score": 520,
  "selftext": "Intel shares jumped 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected revenue and issued quarterly guidance that topped expectations.\n\nHere’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted\n* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected\n\nIntel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nAs part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.\n\nIntel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.\n\nCNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.\n\nThe Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nRevenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.\n\nIntel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nAs of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/intel-intc-q3-earnings-report-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/intel-intc-q3-earnings-report-2024.html)",

Intel has just guided that the majority of work on the fabs is finished and they can now pull back on the R&D spend somewhat and will be hitting and EPS of 0.12 next quarter and it's not even trading at 2x sales currently. INTC had been getting valued like they were at risk of going out of business but nothings further from the truth. Intel is a sleeping giant, they're making 50bn$ a year in revs and profit has been reinvested heavily into the business.

I was right and that was a result of the emergency board meeting. They did this because they have to and have no choice. The company is tanking and needs more capital to put into these foundries. Yes by spinning off this will help limit the burden on Intel and open the doors to more public investors to help pay for the investments. Whether this will significantly help them to the point of turning around their situation remains unknown. However if the factories become reality Intel will lose out on future profits since they will be partially owned by outside investors. \n\nI still don’t like it but I guess it’s a way to keep them going for a bit.",

While Intel's infrastructure expansion has faced delays, the D1X fab has been expanded and is ready to support the 18A processing node set for production in 2025. The fabs are on track for their respective nodes, and those needed for next year are prepared to shift away from TSMC to meet the needs of their customer shortlist. However, the larger infrastructure projects, such as the new plants in Ohio, Germany, and Poland, are experiencing delays due to market conditions. There’s no need to rush into high-volume fab capacity when demand is still being established.\n\nYour attempt to misconstrue my previous comment is apparent. While you suggest I’m confusing processing nodes with fab operations, it seems you’re misinformed about Intel's strategy, particularly regarding the notion of the subsidiary being spun off, as you blindly agreed. It might be helpful to engage more critically with the material instead of relying on surface-level articles for understanding.\n\nTo clarify: the D1X fab is ready for 18A in 2025, while larger infrastructure projects are delayed. The necessary fabs will be built eventually to meet future demand when market conditions allow. It’s crucial to differentiate these aspects when discussing Intel's roadmap.",
