Nope, vpns\n\nprosecute people if they use vpns? okay sure we're getting somewhere, we still have to ramp up surveillance massively and absolutely shit on every single persons privacy to bring these laws into effect but hey, anything to get kids to stop looking at memes. \n\ndon't you think we should at least figure out if this is even harmful yet? like millenials and zoomers are mostly fine, it could be that gen alpha comes out of this more or less fine as well. furthermore, what if this is an issue with shitty parents, what if no matter what we do, these kids will fail because their failure is a result of an extremely shit generation of parents and we're doing nothing to fix the actual issue.",
