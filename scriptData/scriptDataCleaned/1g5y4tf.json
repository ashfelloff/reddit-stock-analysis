Right now Elon is trying to convince the FTC to relax regulations due to starlink being unable to meet these specs. Specs that ASTS have met and exceeded.  It's unlikely that the FTC will relax the regulations because they are under huge pressure with threats of lawsuits from major mobile carriers not just in the US but Europe too if they allow this, due to the damages it would have on terrestrial mobile networks. Secondly, ASTS has much more expansive network coverage, meaning more potential customers and, more importantly, the coveted military contracts. This tech could be instrumental for rapid encrypted communication and weapons guidance. Thirdly, ASTS is actively seeking patents for its tech which may be strong enough to cement their strength in the industry, or at least be used to fleece starlink for a fat wad of cash.",

I went through about 2 months of pretty bad depression, it was hard to get out of bed. All I gotta say is just keep moving you're still up and that's what matters.",

None of yall know this dude let alone know how he got that money, just cause he don't pay rent and eats some food made at dinner thats love right there, it don't mean his parents pay for his gas or phone bill insurance ect. \n\nWhen I lived with my parents I payed for everything even rent at times but I never once said \"Mom, Dad, can yall pay for this? I'm broke\" \n\nYall thinking his parents feeding a child they love is wrong lol yall need therapy. And I'm talking to the ones who said it💯",
