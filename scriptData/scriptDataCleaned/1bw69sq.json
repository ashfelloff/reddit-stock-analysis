  "selftext": "[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)\n\nThursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.\n\nThe day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.\n\nLater in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that ‚Äúif inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn‚Äôt have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.\n\nThis news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.\n\nThe S&P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.\n\nIt was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.\n\nWe still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled. Volatility has spiked, and there should be a major shift in sentiment as a result of this action.\n\nI‚Äôll have more in the morning prior to the jobs news, but that report now has the capacity to accelerate a correction that has been anticipated for several months.\n\nHave a good evening. I‚Äôll see you Friday.\n\nEdit: Kashkari started speaking at 2pm, when the markets were already crashing. Also, the US10Y did not shoot up but dropped instead.\n\n\n\n",

Went back at work, get busy, by mid day it shot down to 18100 ish, I was thinking jesus Christ, that was quicker than expected lol. I was holding my short but since this was the biggest move I ever been since I started trading last month, I closed at 18144 (that was 25% profi5lt so I'm quite happy), just to make sure I don't lost the profit for possible reversal. Went back to work, at the end of the day I look back and the fuckin thing went 17900 ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271) I would have doubled my profit if I watch the price movement.\n\nI straight away bought the dip because I know it will shoot back up, and ended up with another set of profit when it hit 18150.\n\nThis was my best play ever so far. Very happy.",

The real truth is that this was planned way in advance, they‚Äôve been looking for the right opportunity and it‚Äôs usually done on some ‚Äúnews‚Äù day event. Before the big drop, several market makers began withdrawing volume silently while the price was being propped up by fake orders on the book, then slowly they began dropping it to not alarm everyone all at once. You need the right tools to see what‚Äôs going on and believe me it‚Äôs not the news.",
