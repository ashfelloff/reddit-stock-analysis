They got royally screwed and rightly so- no one uses traditional GPS anymore. So the question is - if DXCM were to become disrupted, how fast can they pivot to other business? Garmin was lucky to have somewhat diversified business. \n\nI picked EW because of how difficult it is to get reg. approval etc. \n\nJust one more data point- over time you will find that CGM etc to become more and more commoditized. Already, you no longer need prescription for these. So as more and more companies get into this business, it will become more of a demand side business and not supplier side business, thereby, eroding pricing power.",
