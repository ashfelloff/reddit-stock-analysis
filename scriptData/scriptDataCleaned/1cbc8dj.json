  "selftext": "EDIT (4:52 PM) - I just wanna say bears on this thread were clearly (once again) REGARDED \n\n\n\nWhat happened to the degens in this sub wtf?\n\nI'm a long-term investor (5+ year horizon) I've read most recent research reports and considering how autistic Elon is I think there will be a nice lil rally after earnings tonight. The stock is trading near 2023 lows... Even if it goes lower to $100 I'll just buy more. People keep trying to say whether the stock is fairly priced but there is no exact comparable to this company (bUt wDyMm iT's mO0rE tHaNn tHe Wh0Le cAr mArKeT fO0rD hAsS bEtTeR cRuIisE cO0nTro0O0o0l itS tHe sAmE tHiiNg...) Finance is all theories - AKA NOT FACTS (never was never will be a right or wrong answer) People that say its overvalued are either boomers or those who believe in last decade financial theories that MAY or MAY NOT hold with todays stock market reactions. Or maybe they are right...Have y'all forgotten the previous rally? do you think Tesla is in a better place TODAY vs. then? feel free to bash me but TO THE MOON (either today or eventually one day 100%)",

With bank interest at an all time high, people are reluctant to finance a new car. People that in the past would have bought a second or third car, now are happy with only one, and people that were aiming to replace their old car, now are driving their old cars for longer.\n\nThis, naturally, has an impact on how many cars are sold by manufactures. And with the inflation staying sticky for even longer than anticipated, well, the future for TSLA doesn't look that rosy anymore.\n\nHowever, one should understand that all this is cyclical. There will be a time when rates will be lowered and demand for cars will increase again. \n\nMy point is, it's not then, it's now, the time to buy TSLA!",
