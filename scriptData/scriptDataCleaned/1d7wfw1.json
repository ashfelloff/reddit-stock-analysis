  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\nNews: [Moderna, Merck say vaccine improved survival in patients with deadly skin cancer](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/moderna-merck-cancer-vaccine-with-keytruda-improved-survival-in-trial.html)\n\n**GME**- Interested in the $25 level, currently have a small short position on calls.  No change in DFV’s position (other than him being up $90M lol). He is 120K of the 146K open interest in the June 20^(th) strikes, so any significant volume at that price is likely him.\n\n**NVDA-**  Watching that $1150 level again. Note the details released on Rubin AI chip (which was yesterday’s news). Also, partnering with Foxconn to build advanced computing center in Kaohsiung.\n\n**INTC-** Announces “Lunar Lake”, the flagship processor for Intel’s next generation of AI PCs.\n\n**EWW-** Mexico ETFs, investors fear that Morena’s party’s majority will likely lead to more constitutional reforms.\n\n**AX-** Allegations of taking on far more risk through lax underwriting, (but not fraud). Overall, don’t think this will be a huge catalyst but just good to be cognizant of.\n\nEarnings today : CRWD.",
