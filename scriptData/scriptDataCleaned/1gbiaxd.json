I agree that they're at the top of the industry as it is now, but I think we've very much yet to see anything properly game-changing as far as our actual capabilities in space are concerned. In practical terms, what they've delivered so far via falcon 9/heavy amounts to a slight decrease in launch costs rather than some sort of dramatic lurch forward in our ability to utilize or travel through space. \n\nThat may well happen with Starship, but it's yet to be realized and there are a number of extremely difficult hurdles to overcome ‚Äî arguably far moreso than first stage reuse ‚Äî before they're able to deliver on even a fraction of its promised capabilities.",

Equally, revenue has been down quarter to quarter this year, and only marginally better than last year this time.¬†\n\n\n¬†The Ugly: A fairly significant portion of the profit margin they are achieving (about 30%) is from carbon offset sales. This is not a long term business plan, and likely unsustainable, with future shortfalls here needing to be buttressed by significant growth elsewhere.¬†\n\n\n¬†The very ugly:¬† A significant portion of their increased profits is on *margins* spurred by cost cutting margins, particularly in overhead.
