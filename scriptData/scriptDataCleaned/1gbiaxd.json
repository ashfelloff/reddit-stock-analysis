I agree that they're at the top of the industry as it is now, but I think we've very much yet to see anything properly game-changing as far as our actual capabilities in space are concerned. In practical terms, what they've delivered so far via falcon 9/heavy amounts to a slight decrease in launch costs rather than some sort of dramatic lurch forward in our ability to utilize or travel through space. \n\nThat may well happen with Starship, but it's yet to be realized and there are a number of extremely difficult hurdles to overcome — arguably far moreso than first stage reuse — before they're able to deliver on even a fraction of its promised capabilities.",

It gave us a domestic option again and brought costs down a little bit. \n\nI'm sorry, but that's just not a revolution.

I can't knock it.  It's a small part of the business, and likely to grow to a degree, but it had great results there. \n\n\n The Bad:  Tesla vehicle sales are essentially flat YOY.  It seems they have reached full saturation in this market for what can be expected for the future. Equally, revenue has been down quarter to quarter this year, and only marginally better than last year this time. \n\n\n The Ugly: A fairly significant portion of the profit margin they are achieving (about 30%) is from carbon offset sales. This is not a long term business plan, and likely unsustainable, with future shortfalls here needing to be buttressed by significant growth elsewhere. \n\n\n The very ugly:  A significant portion of their increased profits is on *margins* spurred by cost cutting margins, particularly in overhead. This is not a helpful thing in terms of future growth potential, and only serves to grow short term profit margins.",

This is moderately concerning for the future potential, as these *largely* don't have significant potential for fueling future growth, and you can only cut or offer offsets so much.  Meanwhile, their revenue growth overall has more or less stagnated, which is a concern moving forward.  You can only cut costs so much, and subsidies only go so far.\n\n\nIs it failing?
