Especially with Intel. lately, Intel seems to go down first thing in the morning, then if it’s going to trend upwards it starts around 9, hits its peak around 10/11, then drops a little bit. \n\nLately, Intel has been doing this little “false bottom” or “false top” thing where it will bounce off a particular price up and down for a little bit before making a swing and I just buy puts or calls closest to that “bottom” or “top” \n\nObviously everything changes week to week and there is no sure thing. \n\nThen with RKLB if it dips below $6 I’ll buy calls for $6, and if it’s above $7 I buy puts at $7. \n\nLUMN same thing but above/below $6. We will see how tomorrow/Thursday pan out to see if those ones were right or not.\n\nJust to be clear: I’m gambling. This is fun for me to try and predict what will happen.
