Bought Tesla puts, bullshit guidance and “already priced in”… yeah whatever. Shorted the market before FOMC meeting in March, due to following actual logistics on PMI and Inflation, Market doesn’t give a single fuck, they see Powell on the screen and rally anyway… So today I’m gonna chose to not take the logical route. Amazon Puts it is. Fuck me and Fuck you… good luck. ",
