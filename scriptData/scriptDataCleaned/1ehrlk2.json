The downturn is surely gonna hurt my portfolio in the short term, but I got cash to spare to buy in.\n\nTim Apple is only 63 years old, so can still run the company for at least 7 more years.  The same Lisa SU at AMD, she is only 55 years old, so could stay there another decade. It is nice to have some comfort that they are going to be replaced by any bean counters that prevent the company from doing any innovations.",
