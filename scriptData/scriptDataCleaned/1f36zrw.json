  "score": 73,
  "selftext": "I’ve been a long time holder of Nvidia but sold at $136 because I had a feeling it had reached peak until next earnings.\n\nI missed buying back in due to health issues, and now that I’m “back”, it’s risky to buy today - unless I set a limit after hours, correct?\n\n\nCan I set a limit sell order for after hours a few dollars under the price before earnings (like 4:45 pm). Wouldn’t that protect me from losses in case NVIDIA misses targets?\n\nEDIT:\nI bought shares for $117 after hours by listening to the call and waiting for a nice entry. \n",
