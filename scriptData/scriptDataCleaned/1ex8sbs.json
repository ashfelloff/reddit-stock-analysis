ARKK went from $2B in assets under management at the beginning of 2020 to [$18B at the end of the year](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/12/a-short-history-of-chasing-the-best-performing-funds/). Anybody who‚Äôd been in from the beginning saw 170% gains (temporarily), but that‚Äôs a 9-fold increase in AUM, so clearly new money was piling in‚Ä¶ just in time for the fund to come back down to earth.\n\nThat article I linked above highlights other cases of performance chasing and how investors have suffered.

Most of her 'trades' are head scratchers and weird timing if you ask anybody in the field.\n\n>Cathie Wood, the CEO of ARK Investment Management, has made several notable investment decisions that starkly contrasted with the broader hedge fund consensus, often leading to significant losses.\n\n>One of the most prominent examples was her decision to exit Nvidia in late 2022, just before the company's massive recovery driven by the AI boom. Nvidia's stock surged over 400% afterward, making this a costly move for ARK. Additionally, ARK's aggressive investments in high-growth, speculative technology stocks like Tesla, Roku, and Unity Software, have faced steep declines, further exacerbating the fund's underperformance. In contrast, many other hedge funds had taken a more conservative approach during this period, focusing on value or defensive stocks‚Äã ([InvestmentNews](https://www.investmentnews.com/etfs/news/cathie-woods-ark-funds-are-leaking-billions-of-dollars-252578))‚Äã ([Finbold](https://finbold.com/shocking-3-year-losses-on-a-1k-investment-in-cathie-woods-ark-etf/)).\n\n>Moreover, ARK's timing has often been criticized, such as the purchase of UiPath shares just before a significant earnings drop, leading to a nearly 40% decline in the stock‚Äã ([Finbold](https://finbold.com/shocking-3-year-losses-on-a-1k-investment-in-cathie-woods-ark-etf/)). This pattern of taking contrarian positions, often based on Wood's strong belief in disruptive innovation, has led to ARK's considerable underperformance compared to more traditional strategies, contributing to significant investor outflows‚Äã ([HedgeFollow](https://hedgefollow.com/funds/ARK+Investment+Management)).\n\n>‚ÄúWood remains the firm‚Äôs key person. \\[Her\\] reliance on her instincts to construct the portfolio is a liability,‚Äù Robby Greengold, an analyst at the fund ratings giant, wrote in April.",
