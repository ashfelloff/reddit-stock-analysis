  "selftext": "With NVDA in past and me being too poor for NVDA, WWDC 2024 is coming up, there will be lot's of talk of AI. Apple Execs are going to milk the keyword till the last atom. \n\n1. [Article](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/) shows that with every device getting major OS update, they will be pushing AI with almost anything. Just like Samsung did with Galaxy AI. Basically a selling point of S24 series.\n2. With [OpenAI integration with iOS](https://www.pcmag.com/news/apple-and-openai-are-prepping-a-big-announcement-for-wwdc), possibly with Siri, next launch of iPhone in September will be lit.\n3. After every WWDC in June since last 5 year, AAPL gained around 3-5%\n4. Basic[ iPad M4 chip is beating chip of Copilot + PC](https://nanoreview.net/en/cpu-compare/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-vs-apple-m4) in all major score. So, with launch or announce of Pro chip for Pro user, all major influencers are gonna jerk off themselves with it.\n5. One of AAPL Exec met with TSMC to secure 2nm processors. But that's for next year, not likely to be announced this year.\n\nIt's not much like other regards but my entire portfolio is just AAPL Calls. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gmkmk7m262d1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=1c1d48b8af6224a7e949d64d5c179758a2753861\n\nAll savings from working at Timmies in Great White North. If 190 Call pays off by 10 June, I'm dropping everything in NVDA calls after split.  Now show us that NVDA gains. Press F for dude who dumped 401K on NVDA puts.",

Additionally, they are *locked in*. With multiple sources of data per user, paired with the comfort of familiarity with Siri that even old folks have (even compared to Alexa and Google), they're primed to explooooooode on the AI front. I'm an Android fanboy, but I can't avoid the fact that your standard \"basic bitch\" is going to trust their iGarbage over the various LLMs that have proliferated in recent years. Apple's going to make it \"cool\" to use AI, while at the same time making it easy for old people to use it too.\n\n  \nI'm bullish af for WWDC.\n\n  \nBut I'm probably screwed and gonna lose my ass with these calls.",
