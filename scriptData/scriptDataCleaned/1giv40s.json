  "score": 404,
  "selftext": "\"The amendment allows Super Micro (SMCI), which has been grappling with financial reporting and governance issues, to extend the deadline to file its audited financial statements for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, from Oct. 28, 2024 to Dec. 31, 2024.\"\n\nSource: seeking alpha, blocked by reddit\n\nWill be interesting to see how this one plays out. Aren't they about to report earnings on Tuesday?\n\nStock is so far down it'll probably pop on earnings. I am staying away but will be interesting to watch that is for sure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/eb9l7o72oqyd1.png?width=800&format=png&auto=webp&s=e670e3f8a8a189ddbfe3812308a46c464c3d601f\n\n",
