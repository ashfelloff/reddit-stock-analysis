They are up about 620 million on shares. \n\nThey want nvidia to go up but have concerns of its value potentially going down, not at the time of expiry but in the nearer future. So they spend 100 million (of 620 million in profit) on $80 puts. \n\nIf the stock continues up by $5, it would be enough to cover a 100% loss on these puts because their holdings are so large. However if this incredibly volatile stock takes a big hit, like historically happens with elections. Then while their holdings will take a large hit, these puts can offset those losses on the holdings which can then be used to buy more at a lower price and increase holdings. \n\nInsurance.",

We really don’t know which way the market is going to go so we buy the opposite just in case. A hedge is a wall of bushes to limit loss. For example, someone could come in your backyard and take your dog (call). That would be soooo sad! So you “put” hedges around your calls. \n\nSome people don’t hedge so their dog (call) gets out and gets hit by a car. And when it’s A LOT of money (Fido, the Afghan Hound, was $10,000!), you are so angry you want to hit someone (market makers, bulls or bears) with a car!

ATM delta on the $120 puts expiring in January 25 is about .4 - meaning for every dollar NVDA goes down the premium on the ask is going to increase \\~.4. AS it moves further down, the gamma on those contracts increases and thus there's new delta values as the stock tanks. If NVDA falls $10 on Monday this dude will have a substantial unrealized profit. So stock goes down = put premium prices increasing according to the delta less the daily theta. You don't necessarily have to have the right price prediction if you can call the right direction, (and have the self discipline to fucking sell the position when its green). If this post reads like gibberish go watch some youtube videos on the greeks and you'll get some lightbulbs goin off in that brain of yours.",

So you buy puts at a fraction of the stock price, like $3 each. If stock drops, your loss is limited because the put options will cover some of it. If stock goes up like you thought it would, then you lose the put premium you paid but you are hoping the gain would be much higher than that. Like if stock goes to $110, you will make $10 profit per stock so it is fine to lose that $3 premium.\n\nThe person/fund that bought that put positions probably has a much bigger stock position and expecting the price to go higher.",

A **put** gives them the right to sell at a certain price, so if the stock goes down, they profit from the put, acting as insurance for a bullish position and covering both outcomes.\n\nThey could also just be **bearish** and buying puts outright. People are assuming it's part of a larger strategy, but who knows for sure? There's a dozen other strategies that could be being used here.\n\nOptions strategies can be complicated, but options themselves are fairly simple.
