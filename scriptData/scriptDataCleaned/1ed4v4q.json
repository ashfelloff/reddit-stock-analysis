These are the pipeline of young people. But when they join, most of their time is spent doing actual engineering processes and projects under direct supervision. Our co-ops and interns definitely see some of that, but most of their time is spent on grunt work. Document review, database entry, basic test/validation, excel work, etc. Basically admin stuff that needs to be done, but is non-billable and should be assigned to your lowest hourly workers, instead of wasting a $250/hr consultant’s time on it. \n\nThose aren’t tasks that need a person to do them for the sake of having a larger workforce. It’s in the same camp as the phone companies switching from having thousands of call line operators standing by to connect you, to an automated system that needs a handful of people monitoring it. Or every mom n pop business historically needing to have a dedicated full time accountant, to now having software and the books can be managed by someone in just a few hours each month. \n\nWe’re still in the rollout and adjustment phase, but this is going to make us significantly more efficient and able to spend more time actually consulting clients and servicing their needs rather than spending those hours on admin tasks. We aren’t the only engineering firm with this view, and it seems clear the major banks are moving in this direction as well. I think a large swathe of engineering, medical diagnosis, banking, accounting, law, marketing, etc will move to AI assistance as the tech and tools become available. Very few people actually want to be sitting at a computer screen doing the same thing every day. We just haven’t historically had the computer power to replace them.",

AI will continue to grow in capabilities. Why do you think your job is safe to outsourcing?\n\nI’ve been a “junior” engineer at one point. I was paid well (over $80k 5+ years ago with 0 experience), did actual engineering (led parts of process design for capital projects), and worked for a F100 company that was run by engineers. A good AI could do 50% of what I was doing, as most of what I was doing was building skills to grow into someone who could contribute individually\n\nWith the AI talk, they’ve been exploring using AI to take the responsibilities that jr engineers do. Taking notes during meetings can be done by AI, translating the notes to requirements can be done by AI, taking a first pass at engineering eventually will be done by AI, coordinating people can be done by AI, etc. \n\nThey’d already outsourced a lot of their engineering.
