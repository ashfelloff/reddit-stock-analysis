INTC reached its low point in Q3 last year at $24 and steadily climbed back to $54 in January. Allegedly also under the impression that it's foundry business is healthy. In their Q1 reporting they changed the way they report  their business units and it was revealed that the foundry lost $2.5B on $4.4B of revenue. So anything but healthy. The stock now is at $30\n\nThe lawsuit is about their back reporting of 2023 foundry business though. $19B of revenue with $7B in deficit. The lawsuit claims that Intel knew how bad their foundry business is and that investors were deceived and the loss in 2024 could have been prevented if intel would have been truthful. \n\nAnybody holding INTC stock from January 24 to April 25, 2024 may have an interest in the suit. \n\nEDIT: I never held INTC.",

      "body": "This is a sour grapes lawsuit.  Intel changed where they expensed capex for new foundries from intel as a whole company to foundry segment.  Basically they broke out capex to each individual segment.  As a shareholder it will be easier to recognize the turn, which they have been saying is still a ways a way.  My memory is fuzzy, but I believe it was to be 150 billion in capex over 10 years, new facilities in Ohio, Arizona, Ireland, Isreal and New Mexico(I think).  Plan is supposed to be done by 2030.  I think Arizona is furthest along and one fab maybe open.  Pat Gelsinger has been pretty open about how long this would take.  Lawsuit feels like an attorney fee generator to me",

Only looking at this Q it looks like they had to take drastic meassures to make them look alright. \n\n- [March 2024](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/semiconductors/intel-pushes-launch-date-of-ohio-fab-from-2025-to-2027-or-2028-state-politicians-remain-enthusiastic-about-progress): Ohio fab - Intel pushes launch date from 2025 to 2027 or 2028\n\n- [April 2024](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20240418PD202/intel-arizona-fab-2024-ic-manufacturing.html): Fab 52 Arizona - delay in production start to 2025. (Even though they got [$15B from an investor in 2022 for a 49% stake](https://www.networkworld.com/article/971395/intel-partners-for-30b-fab-investment-in-arizona.html) in the fab) \n\n- [May 2024](https://www.golem.de/news/intel-in-magdeburg-zu-viel-guter-boden-verschiebt-baustart-auf-2025-2405-185546.html): Fab 29 Germany - could have gone ahead if intel paid for the additional earth removal. Legally it was on them to pay for that risk. We are talking about a few million $ max. If they actually really needed that fab they could have forked that up. Now because they don't want to pay that the whole fab construction is delayed for at least 12 months. The big deal though is that then maybe the $10b in grants may not be paid out because those are connected to timelines. Intel is delaying a fab for a year and risking $10B for a few million $!?!?!\n\n- [June 2024](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/10/intel_israeli_fab/): Fab in Israel - Intel interrupts work on $25B Israel fab, citing need for 'responsible capital management'. The interruption is actually pretty smart. Everybody will associate that with whats going on down their not with intels internal problems.\n\n\n\n- [June 2024](https://iconnect007.com/article/141100/intel-apollo-agree-to-joint-venture-related-to-intels-fab-34-in-ireland/141097/ein): Fab in Ireland that started producing chips since September 2023. intel sold an 49% stake to an outside investment company.",
