  "selftext": "I am a Tesla bear, and made some decent change on puts last week. My gut says puts will be destroyed today, here is why:  \n\n\n1. Missing earnings is priced in, if anything, stock was oversold. Some big hedge funds are actually buying in, and analyst price targets are higher than current prices\n2. Tesla isn't just a car company. I am not pretending that it's a tech company per se, but it has other divisions, like battery that are profitable. Also, the FSD price cut will be instrumental going forward. I don't know of many car company that have convinced its buyers to pay $100 a month-$1200  a year per car on subscription.\n3. Even though its being dragged, it still can pivot, and we know Musk-the guy who has convinced millions of people on his 'genius', isn't going to just admit defeat, and watch the stock go to shit, when he was just recently trying to get a 56 Billion payout\n\nI know y'all won't listen, but cash out.
