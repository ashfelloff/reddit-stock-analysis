But even after the next recoinage and increased availability of silver, gold standard remained. \n\nThis is because as Adam Smith had observed in 1776 itself, there wasn't enough coinage to fuel global trade regardless of the metal. Bank money like Amsterdam (just entries of credit and debit at a commercial bank rather than actual money changing hands) was driving European trade, and paper currency was already facilitating domestic trade and government debt (especiallyin American colonies). Obsession with metal coinage was a relic of mercantilism (though the rest of the world only caught up to this idea centuries later).\n\nSo, the complete abandonment of gold standard had less to do with availability of metal and more to do with increased understanding of banking and trade globally, in my opinion. In any timeline where Bretton Woods or a similar event happened, gold/ silver standard was going to be abandoned as long as the currency adopted for global trade (dollar) remained dominant.",
