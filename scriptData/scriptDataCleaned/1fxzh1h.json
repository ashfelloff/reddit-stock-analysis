  "selftext": "Oct 6 (Reuters) - Activist investor Starboard Value has taken a stake of about $1 billion in Pfizer (PFE), opens new tab and wants the U.S. drug giant to make changes to turn its performance around, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday.\n\nStarboard has also approached Ian Read, a former Pfizer CEO, and Frank D'Amelio, who served as CFO until 2021, and both have expressed interest in helping the activist investor, the sources said.\n\nRead served as CEO until Albert Bourla took the position in 2019. Bourla was instrumental in working with BioNTech to develop a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nPfizer declined to comment and Starboard did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/activist-investor-starboard-value-takes-1-billion-stake-pfizer-wsj-reports-2024-10-07/",
