Intelsat announced on Monday that one of its satellites, built by Boeing, broke up in geostationary orbit. Multiple organizations are tracking the debris to avoid collisions and a potential cascading catastrophe. It’s unclear why the satellite exploded into at least 20 pieces.”",

Sats are more flimsy than cars, so that's an unacceptable risk. \n\nThat specific orbit station is lost, and the debris won't be able to station keep the way the rest of the GEO sats do for 3rd body effects (causes deviation in their orbits over time), so that debris could drift into another satellite's orbital path if the break-apart was bad enough.",

So it's orbit ascending node element will start to drift, which is bad. \n\nThen, Assuming the pieces broke apart in some sort of shock/explosive manner, and thus they all drifted away from their center of mass equidistantly around a sphere, some of those pieces could be on course to have elliptical orbits bringing them in closer contact with other GEO sats due to those third body effects deviating their orbits.\n\nAlso, yeah the speeds aren't as high, but sats are fragile. Car Impact at 30mph is enough to fender bender, and that's only 13 m/s relative velocity.\n\nLastly, the risk is still too high to try to use that specific orbit location again, because the pieces won't deviate too far.

LEO is where Kessler Syndrome is the real threat (or satellites on highly elliptical orbits).\n\nThe fact it's \"unclear why\" means it almost certainly wasn't an onboard malfunction, as there would have been anomalous sensor data coming in just before it went offline.
