Oh and I STILL don't get the big mac meal even at $6.50 (there are better deals on the app, big mac is mid, and the meal portion is mid). It's not particularly healthy either which leaves it as an occasional convenience meal rather than a daily thing. Slow cooker chili con carne w/ rice from rice cooker and you're set. Even if we're talking fast food Chipotle is a better overall value if you're paying around $10.",
