  "selftext": "*Long read. Account down -63% by actions taken during a melt down in the span of 11 minutes at market open this morning. Lessons at the end so you can avoid doing what I did.*\n\n\n\nI held 100 $NVDA Jul 19 24 135 CALLS at $3.60 avg at close yesterday. NVDA was pumping into close, and I had done great trading it (+$9k day). Since they were weekly options, I decided I wanted to lock in profits (peel strategy) and leave a portion to ride, so I sold 80 of the calls and kept 20 at avg price of $3.60.\n\n \n\nNext day, today, CPI print came in below expectations, pre-market was PUMPING. NVDA closed yesterday at $134.91. It was into its follow through from a base breakout with momentum and volume that started Tuesday. Admittedly though, it was on its 3rd day of the breakout. Who cares about the 3rd day breakout (I should), here we were, pre market $NVDA 137.32 high. FUCK YES.\n\n \n\nYet, something didn't sit right. I fucking sold 80 of my  Jul 19 24 135 CALLS for $3.90 avg yesterday at 3:58 and 3:59 right before market close. All because I wanted to follow my rules and not carry 100%  of my portfolio on weekly options. And this morning after CPI print, we saw Shrek's wiener in pre-market. I was more annoyed, if that’s the right feeling, than happy in pre-market. I had left money on the table. Regardless that my 20 calls were up. It didn't matter.\n\n \n\nMarket opens, $NVDA at $135.75. Not bad, pulled back from its highs pre market. Calls I sold yesterday were at $ $4.30-35, when NVDA reached its high of the day at $136.15. Probably within the first 10-15 sec of market open. In my eyes, the continuation of the breakout, and momentum from pre-market high. Suddenly, the stock, and calls, began to drop. Jul 19 24 135 CALLS were at $4:15. Here was my chance to get back my calls that I closed yesterday on this pull back, I thought, buying 10 shares at 9:30:48 for $4.14 avg.\n\n \n\nAt 9:32 the stock pulled back even further, as did my position of now 30 calls. And for some reason, even now as I'm writing this, I can't for the love of god understand why I put an order in to buy another 10 calls. But that’s what I did. At 9:32:47 for $3.95 avg.\n\n \n\nI'm a fucking dumbass. I'll call myself out. Why the fuck would I buy on that drop. I'm looking at the 1 min chart right now for today and I bought on momentum and high volume decline. What the fuck. And to top it off, the next 3 1 min candles are a pull back to the down side (i.e., stock go up) with LOW FUCKING VOLUME. And my dumbass for some reason thought it was a good time to buy. That fucking \"don't catch a falling knife\" saying got me.\n\n \n\nAt 9:33:15, I bought another 15 calls for $3.75 avg. (notice I'm doubling, tripling down on a losing position - breaking another rule). However, by the close of the 9:33 1 Min candle, I FLET LIKE A FUCKING GENIUS. I was right I thought, this is a just a pull back, and we are back onto the breakout momentum now. So at 9:34:13 I bought another 35 calls at $3.90 avg.\n\n \n\nAnd then the 9:35 candle happened. Now I'm in a deep loss for the day, taking out most of the $9K gain from yesterday. Still mad about the whole \"leaving money on the table\" revenge trading spiral I was in, my dumbass bought another 10 calls at 9:36:13 for 3.70 avg, and another 10 at 9:36:42 for $3.75 avg.\n\n \n\nI caught the bottom on the 1 min at 9:36.  Again, thinking we were about to reverse to the upside and continue the breakout and pre-market momentum. I was blind to the fact that we were trending down on the day, and with strong volume. Yes even on the 1 min. I wanted to get my losses from today's position back, and what I had \"left on the table\" from closing out the calls yesterday. I felt like a genius from 9:36 - 9:38.\n\n \n\nThen the 9:39 1 min candle happened. It was downhill from there. I assume I must of said fuck it because at 9:41:38 I bought my last 10 calls at $3.35 avg.\n\n \n\nI watched NVDA drop for the next 2 hours, breaking another rule and not cutting losses. It had to go back up I thought. I went and did some pressure washing around the yard for the rest of the day. Anything to keep my mind off the charts.\n\n \n\nMy current position is 130 Jul 19 24 135 CALL at avg. price of $3.84. It is my entire portfolio. Position at -63%. I will determine what I will do with the position tomorrow once I see pre-market. \n\n \n\nAll those buys happened in 11 minutes, with majority in first 6 mins. I honestly have no idea what came over me to make those decisions, blatantly breaking trading rules I've set up for myself. But I did.\n\n \n\nWriting this has helped me realize some of the mistakes I made in managing the position during this morning's melt down. Below in case anyone wants to learn from others mistakes so you don't have to be a dumbass yourself.\n\n \n\n* Don't trade first 15 - 30 min (mainly day trading). Especially if you already have a position. Let it play out until next setup appears, and set a trailing stop incase position goes against you\n\n* Don't add to a losing position\n\n* Be mindful of volume on pull backs (reversal with strong volume, or pull back with weak volume that will continue trend)\n\n* Don't put your entire portfolio on weekly options (who would of thought...)\n\n* Maintain position size for account\n\n* Maintain stop and cut losses quickly\n\n* Follow \"peeling\" strategy (sell off portions of position into strength - can use trailing stop)\n\n  \nBest regards.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/be5t1jm8j0cd1.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3c1ba38dd5ea16c2a20a3620ded9ad51e23180c\n\n  \n",

His eyes got really big like, nobody has ever done that before look. So yeah, I paid a theta premium, but I got to keep my pizza shares sooner and give some, I make WSB type money over here, power move in the Costco food court kid. \n\nAlso, just to prove I’m regarded: I took a 50% loss today on NVDA today because I typed a 7 and not a 4.",

Sorry man, I imagine you’re feeling even worse than I am today. I lost 23% of my account between NVDA and TSLA, just refusing to believe they’d give up 4-6 days of gains without as much as a meaningful bounce. Even chased TSLA after market thinking “no way it doesn’t jump from its dip into 139, 138….. 137, 136…” For the hundredth time today, I guessed wrong. \n\nBut reading your share helped me process, or at least feel not alone, and wanted to thank you for articulating. I’m a full-time day trader, but only 1.5 years in, and I think/hope I’m currently making the slow turn to more consistent profitability (vs 1.5 years of losses). Last week was a record green week, and I made my 1-day record on Tuesday this week. I was elated, thinking MAYBE I’m finally getting good at this. Then today came along and I chose to screw the pooch from opening past closing bell. Humbling for sure, and I’ll have to start the rebuild tomorrow, again. Anyway, wanted you to know that YOU’RE not alone, in making mistakes, and breaking rules, and in trusting there would be a reversal like we’ve seen 1000 times before. Pretty confident the whole system is set up to trick us and today it got me for sure. \n\nYour awareness of everything you should have done differently is clear, and meaningful, and critical to your ultimate success. *Everyone* breaks their damn rules sometimes, and sometimes it actually works, but usually it’s a recipe for an even worse red day. Anyway, thanks for the share, and here’s to surviving another day! 🍻",
