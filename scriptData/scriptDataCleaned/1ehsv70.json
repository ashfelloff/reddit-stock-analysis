You didn't account for one single scenario where Intel would face headwinds...you even went so far as to envision the possibility of TSMC losing production capabilities and companies like AMD and NVDA needing to move production over to Intel...which could happen but it's a VERY long stretch\n\nSo have you learnt your lesson?  You did several things wrong with your decision to go full port into one stock...the most egregious was your inability to be objective...I think it's because you've had a blessed life where basically every thing has gone right for you (view your intro paragraph)...to the point where you're not used to considering the possibility of things going wrong\n\nNext time, not just when picking stocks but with any major decision in life...sit your ass down for a good hour and think of all the bad things that can happen with the decision you're making...basically make a pros/cons list before going full regard and making a decision",
