I’ll enter a trade and if something doesn’t feel right/I don’t like the strike or date I bought or I feel the markets turning south I’ll cut it. The previous Meta gain post I just about dumped those and re entered at a lower strike. I despise owning calls when they go out of the money. No matter the price you want your calls to always be itm or atleast have something of value come expiration. I always recommend buying itm or deep itm. Not only for safety sake but the deltas are higher from the get go. Being a good trader you have to play good defense, entering a trade is easy. Knowing when to exit is the tough part.",

              "body": "Wouldn't say it's better, it's about on par with them... everything you mentioned is pfof brokers. They are all about the same. He could go with a boutique broker, and probably get slightly better fills and be able to route his orders the way he wants, iceberg in and out etc. He could go with ibkr pro and do those things but also get 4% on his uninvested cash. Many reasons for him to go with a more professional oriented broker. I find it wild that there is a bunch of people who post their huge trades on here dealing with big money, and they are using RH or like webull. I don't deal near as much money as the OP and I trade with lightspeed lol.. also have ibkr pro cash account. But then again, who cares, pfof doesn't mean much for options, especially not CBOE options as everything is routed the same place... Ntm it's not like your money isn't safe at RH, accounts insured etc... they have a good interest program. Their tools still suck though, then again if you need better charting, you can always just use TV or TOS charting, which I think the OP uses something else to chart. I guess I feel like if you have professional level money, one would want a more professional level platform/broker. Lighspeed for instance, they are awesome...great customer service, and you really do feel like a client and not just a number, they get on the phone quick if you need anything. Platform fee is expensive but your commissions go towards it. And for whatever reason, I don't know how they do it, but fills are super fast with them.",
