But 25 or 30 would be very similar: that make stocks expensive. So either we have a new paradigm that is PER of 25-30 is great, or we expect a big increase of revenue by like 50-100% so that the PER goes back to 15-20 or we may have a crash... or even just many years without much return in the future.\n\nThat we are at 5200 or 5800 is still overall the same ballpark for such conclusions. More reasonable valuation if the prospect of fast growth is not there and we don't have a paradigm change is more like 3500-4500 than 5000-6000.\n\nBut reality is nobody know and that the market can keep irrational for a long time.
