With that much money it can also take days/weeks to enter and exit positions. When you can just pick a few stocks you’re confident in with small money, it’s actually easier imo.

The 5 sats will take them to EBIDTA break even. Verizon and AT&T have started the trend of providing revenue prepayments which allows AST non dilutionary funding. They still have another 45 or so MNO’s whom they have MOU’s with, to be converted to formal commercial agreements. The most likely dilution in the future will be purely from convertible loans which are more favourable than public offerings (and if the shares are trading at 12, preferred shares will convert at around 15/16). The company have already stated there will be no more offerings in 2024 (and hopefully ever). \n\nIt is a front loaded capital extensive business but when up and running margins are going to be silly high. Costs are near zero, other than restoration of the satellite fleet every 7-10 years which will cost approx 200 milly per year - a drop in the ocean of the potential 10 billy plus yearly Rev AST will take in. Margins are anticipated to be approx 95%. \n\nYou clearly have no idea about the potential of this company or who the MNO’s are backing. AST are backed by MNO’s with a user base of 2.8 billion, Starlink are backed by MNO’s with a user base of 200 million. Why is that? Because the MNO’s know that AST have superior tech and are years ahead. \n\nRegardless, even if there was a further 30% dilution (which I don’t believe there will be) the revenue and cash flow potential is so massive it won’t matter. Deutsche Bank certainly agree with me. They have a 2027 PT of 650. Transhumanica have a 500 PT.

However, when approached with an alternate viewpoint the vehemence with which you defend AST isn't healthy. You view this play as a sure thing, which NOTHING in life ever is. I don't have a dog in this fight and I hope you personally gain but as an outsider reading all your comments and posts...... JFC.......tone it down a little. It looks as if you are molding your own personal identity around this stock. Take a breather and at least entertain other possibilities. You said you're up 200%. Smart thing to do would be to take profits, like you're initial capital and let the rest ride.  Because if for some reason this doesn't work out like you think it will I'm a little worried about you.

                      "body": "Starlink is not the dominant player. Starlink were solely focused on broadband until 2 years ago when they announced they would be making a stab at D2D. AST have been here working on their tech for almost a decade and have 3000 patents. \n\nAST are backed by MNO’s with a user base of 2.8 billion, Starlink are backed by MNO’s with a user base of 200 million. Why is that? Because the MNO’s know that AST have superior tech and are years ahead. \n\nThe facts re star-link’s tech: Their text and supposed ‘voice’ (which they provided no proof of achieving) not only is shit and out of sequence, but only functions at a low orbit which is not acceptable to the FCC and causes interference. They have not achieved data/download capabilities. The evidence is that they are years behind and haven’t shown that they will be able to achieve tech as competent and effective as AST’s - full 5G voice, video, text and download speeds up to 125mps with no interference at an appropriate orbit height, and able to penetrate buildings. Who knows if Musk will ever achieve and be able to provide as effective a service. The evidence so far doesn’t point to it.   \n\nAs I said Starlink’s main area of focus has always been broadband. They entered the D2D race years late out of desperation. AST are set to disrupt their broadband business so they had no choice. They will absolutely lose customers who will opt for AST’s cheap service that penetrates buildings rather than use Starlinks shite expensive receiver that can’t penetrate buildings.   \n\nAll DoD contracts go through Fairwinds technology. Fairwinds technology have tweeted about AST’s tech.  First Net have 8 billion allocated to improve connectivity. First Net work with AT&T (who work with AST). First Net have also tweeted about AST. Contracts with the military and first responders are inevitable imo. \n\nIt’s clear who everyone with interest in this technology are backing - AST. You are wrong about your assumption. AST are likely years ahead and are set to dominate the market. They already have over 2/3s of the US market locked up with commercial agreements with Verizon and AT&T. There is speculation that T-Mobile will jump ship to AST as Starlink have no service to provide them and AST’s tech is compatible with T-Mobile’s spectrum. \n\nAlso - Google, Vodafone, AT&T and Verizon are all strategic investors in AST. \n\nBtw Deutsche Bank have slapped a 2027 650 PT on ASTS. Transhumanica a PT of 500. Check my page for an ASTS write up where I showed how these PT’s and revenue projections can actually easily be reached.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?si=DKfIV51XACqh-glU&v=b25Prku8T54&feature=youtu.be \n\nHere’s a short video of ASTS discussed just yesterday on Schwabb network by a professional money manager. A money manager who has been invested in the telecommunications industry for 20 years and so had good knowledge before choosing to heavily back ASTS. 5:30 to 7:00 on the vid is when ASTS is discussed.",
