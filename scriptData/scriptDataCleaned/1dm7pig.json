The returns might've been the case for the last year, but for example over the last 10 years TQQQ has had only 2x the annualized return of QQQ (even though it's 3x ETF).\n\n> If the market drops or corrects you just wait it out and you’re fine.\n\nYeah, even if you do wait it out (seeing 60% losses), you're missing out on possible gains in the meantime.\n\nE.g. SPXL (SPY x3) has just recently reached a new ATH after *3 years* (the previous one was during COVID). So if you held it for all this time, you'd be waiting years to just break even (even it's just unrealized losses). What if a better opportunity emerges (e.g. Nvidia)? — you don't have the capital to spare anymore.\n\nIt's way better to wait for the crash and buy the leveraged ETF near the bottom, then ride it all the way up.",

Keep in mind you're losing in a choppy market even when SPY doesn't change at all in the end (due to decay). Maybe read others' opinions on the topic as well, since it's not as simple as it may appear \n\nOff topic question: if you had access to any leverage you fancied, which one would you choose (e.g. 10x, 20x, 100x)? Also, would you prefer leveraged futures instead (with true leverage; e.g. if SPY's average return is 10% and you have 5x leverage, then your return will be exactly 50%), if it weren't for the fees?",

If u have 3K don’t go and buy 100 contracts blowing up ur account in one stock. Buy 1 contract or a few and diversify the portfolio. All the rich people on this didn’t YOLO into one stock, they diversified their portfolio, probably made 1/30th of what they could’ve made. But remember it’s a slow and steady marathon not a race. Small profits are better than a -100% portfolio",
