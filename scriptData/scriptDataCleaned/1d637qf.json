  "score": 74,
  "selftext": "Couple reasons why I think Gitlab >> Github, and their earnings report is gonna go well:\n\n* gitlab-ci is ahead of it's time, makes devops so much easier to test and deploy pipelines, which are the lifeblood of most tech companies, basically when either gitlab or github is down most developers touch grass\n* When it comes to AI you gotta host your models and ML infrastructure somewhere, I think as more companies (chatGPTs) build code for AI, this code needs to get deployed, these deployments require CI/CD cycles which see point above\n* last quarter they became cash flow positive, expecting this to continue upwards along with better guidance\n* Just this month Google tripled their ownership from 7% to 22% so I imagine their compute costs are competitive to Github, meaning Gitlab will be able to scale up free tier operations to continue to capture new business. Where Gitlab might be at a disadvantage is storage, since I'm pretty sure Azure has the cheapest storage options around right now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5989lla7k24d1.png?width=1554&format=png&auto=webp&s=4017e45ed52f5a39c1ff50ba3876396fb1833513",

Microsoft has a lot of reasons to take a loss on GitHub if it helps train their AI endeavors, allows them insight into startup ideas, and for control of the ecosystem to update to their other products. It's a trap that a lot of people fall into because \"other people are doing it\". In reality gitlab is a much better platform for technical people that understand devops.

      "body": "I work as a consultant in one of the big tech companies, and what I see (I often implement a lot of these systems net-new for customers):\n\n- GitHub is better for forking as a first class citizen. It’s great for big wide orgs that don’t need a lot of organization of their projects, or project management tooling. Their calling card is *accessibility* over feature richness: great APIs, centralized SSO, big flat open organization page UX, public and free storage options. GitHub on its own is extremely anemic when it comes to kanban/scrum “project” tooling- which is where Atlassian has the primary advantage with Jira. It’s common to see Jira bolted onto other VCS solutions to fill the gap. GitHub also has a paid-only onprem solution. The FOSS analogous option is Gitea, which is tiny in comparison to everything else. GitHub wins with CI/CD simplicity with its @modular system which lets people curate libraries of CI functions and share/reuse them. Highly pluggable, more accessibility. They have free package repos built in. Their releases API is best in class. \n\n- Gitlab is free as fuck. As in, nearly its entire featureset works OOTB without slip-and-sliding people into buying anything at all. CI just works. Single board Kanban is there. Private orgs just work. Runners work. Releases are all there. It has a more than sufficient toolset for kanban/scrum tooling, issue management, builds, k8s integration, whole 9. Running it on-premise though is archaic. It’s still designed like a fat monolith with 12 different services composing the stack. It still does not have a good k8s implementation for running on k8s clusters, and people opt to just run the single monolithic pod or VM (native packages) version instead. I think over half of the fortune 100 use it for on prem because it’s TRULY free, whereas GitHub’s onprem option is paid only, same with bitbucket. It’s THE ONLY real on-prem free option with full features batteries included. The SaaS platform (Gitlab.com) is not anywhere near as popular as GitHub because it’s really a tool more designed for private use, and as such it’s not as UX-focused to be a big “public portal” for projects. I don’t event think that’s gitlab’s goal.\n\n- Bitbucket sucks on its own. It’s minimal in featureset because Atlassian sells their *suite* of tools in bundles, and it’s intended to be sold alongside Bamboo, Jira, and Confluence to be feature-complete. \n\nEvery one of these primary options has their own market strategy and niche it’s trying to hit. I’d argue Gitlab is king of on prem, GitHub is king of SaaS, and bitbucket is king of economy of scale (institutional adopters).\n\nWhere Gitlab is “failing” is pushing their primary business model of CALs+Support:\n\n1. SO MUCH of the product featureset is free, most consumers can avoid paying for it at all. \n\n2. WHEN YOU DO need support, their support sucks major donkey dick because they’re frankly understaffed/underskilled to solve some of those more complex issues (when they seldom occur). They don’t have as large of a support engineering foundation as say, Red Hat, and many of the engineers that built Gitlab came from there, and never took the time to capture/outline their strategy for running a services based revenue generating part of the business- a case of too much engineering not enough business sense.\n\n3. Their upsell to paid enterprise edition (EE vs CE) is nonexistent. I have never seen them try to push us or anyone else to turn on EE-only features, and they’re just *not that compelling* to do so. Their marketing and sales strategy is just milk-toast. You can install EE, and run it in free mode which is the same as just having CE.\n\nFrom what I’ve seen, most consumers just use one or two features of Gitlab that they really need, which is just proper on-premise isolation of proprietary code and content. There is so little incentive to base an entire company’s operations on JUST Gitlab that the sales exposure and opportunity there is slim unless GTLB decided to grow a pair and more aggressively upsell people to EE. \n\nThis is my experience and opinion, and I’m a $350k/yr TCO engineer in the space.\n\nWe ourselves use multiple Gitlab EE (free mode) instances on-prem, just for internal stuff that houses sensitive data and our skeletons in the closet, but majority of our real world product development occurs on both GitHub.com and Gitlab.com SaaS because we’re a FOSS leader.",
