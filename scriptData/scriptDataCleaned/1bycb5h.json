  "score": 165,
  "selftext": "Recently i have been looking at Barick gold corp, since gold prices are going up along side with oil and gas.\nSo $GOLD is the largest gold mining company in the world, with a $31.35B market  cap and $11.397B in revenue last year that's 3.49% increase from 2022 , and their revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 was $2.862B, a 13.26% increase year-over-year, And this is their best quarter since 2021.\nEarnings is scheduled for may 1st, with strong EPS history the next earnings call would be very promising. \nThe stock price is at $17.86 which has increased 15% in the last month but still -1.27% YTD. i think the targed price here is $20.\nCalls are very cheap 0.25 for 20c 05/17 and leaps looking very delicious as well 0.56 for 20c 01/17/ 25.\n\nThoughts?   \n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n",

It´s just very fast. Given that the bigger mining companies have been holding vast cash reserves the last year, waiting for opportunities to buy up assets, I´d think, those developments are what you should look at, rather than only the gold price.",

Normally, disregarding spikes in price due to geopolitical events, there are costs associated with exploration and mining activities, when the gold price falls too much miners will discontinue operation, hence driving down supply, and when gold prices go up to where its economically viable again they will resume supply, which is why over time gold roughly keeps pace with inflation. I’d add his food for thought, over the past years dispute rate hikes, the market has been “paying” a 5% premium to keep the gold(not invested in treasuries hence giving up the 5% yield). Further, in mainland China where the currency will weaken for sometime, consumers are buying gold Ada hedge. As jewelry pieces the price is at a further 10-15% depending on where you get them for craftsmanship + profit + expenses. Last year, the savings statistics say mainland China is responsible for 28% of the world’s total savings whilst Europe + US combined stand at 33%. Not predictions but are cases where it may be bullish for gold when rates ultimately do fall.",

If you haven’t heard Zimbabwe just announced a gold backed currency. Almost all commodities have been on a significant run this year and for this reason I believe inflation will only go higher promoting the federal reserve to revise the interest rate guidance to no rate hikes like our boy Imhotep said the other day. I actually wouldn’t be surprised to see a rate hike to combat new inflation. Call me crazy I could be wrong but either way it feels like the market has already priced in interest rate declines.",
