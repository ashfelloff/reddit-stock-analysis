  "selftext": "**$300 EOD**\n\n**My Position: $CRWD $270 Put 08/02/2024 Expiry. (edit, typed** **~~07/19/25~~** **before)**  \n**tl;dr:** $CRWD is fucked by reputational damage alone, not to mention their insane P/E to begin with\n\n**CRITIQUES**\n\n**Irreparable Tarnish on Core Product** CrowdStrike‚Äôs core product is trust and reliability. Today's outage, caused by their own human error, has irreparably tarnished this trust globally. This incident has shown their failure in delivering their fundamental promise, which is simply trust and reliability. The company should and will eventually be sold for scraps as customers move away in droves.\n\n**Forward Guidance Concerns** Even if the next quarterly earnings are good, forward guidance cannot be positive. Customers will inevitably look to move to other providers. If not simply for better security, for the purposes of demonstrating the strength of their security to their end clients (who know nothing about the true ins and outs of cybersecurity). CRWD has become a household name now for being a failure. For a similar example, Boeing (a company with a formerly incredible reputation) is now known as a failure in the eyes of the public. Imagine CRWD, which was unknown to the average citizen until today, now being known as a colossal failure.\n\n**Failed Public Response and CEO‚Äôs Lack of Remorse** The public response from CrowdStrike has been an absolute disaster. Instead of taking full responsibility, their statements have been riddled with excuses and deflections. The CEO has failed to show any genuine remorse for the mistake, demonstrating a lack of accountability and understanding of the gravity of the situation. This kind of leadership is unacceptable and only adds insult to injury for their customers who are already suffering from the fallout.\n\n**Competitive Landscape** Competitors like Palo Alto Networks ($PANW) offer similar services without the tarnished reputation and fear of failure. They will undoubtedly learn from CrowdStrike's mistake, ensuring they do not repeat it. This gives them a significant edge in the market.\n\n**Political Risk** With the next US government (likely Trump 2024) already hesitant around tech in general, CrowdStrike is in a precarious position. A single tweet from Trump could tank this stock, exacerbating the already significant damage.\n\n**Customer Backlash** In the coming weeks, customers will be demanding compensation for billions lost in revenue due to CrowdStrike‚Äôs outage. Fixing the damage will cost time and money for individual customers, and CrowdStrike may be liable or required to contribute to these costs.\n\n**Potential Fallout with Major Partners** Microsoft (MSFT) may move away from involving CrowdStrike in future defense of their systems. MSFT has its own security offerings and the issue originated from their OS. To protect their own reputation and stock price, MSFT would be smart to limit any connection to CrowdStrike.\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\n**Black Swan Perspective** Nassim Taleb‚Äôs concept of a \"Black Swan\" event highlights the profound impact of rare and unpredictable events. For a cybersecurity company like CrowdStrike, the recent outage represents such an event. The fragility of their trust and reliability has been exposed, showing that even a small error can lead to catastrophic consequences. The cybersecurity industry is built on the foundation of preventing and mitigating risks. A company like CrowdStrike, which fails to uphold these principles, demonstrates an inherent fragility. The outage is not just a technical failure but a breach of trust that cannot be easily repaired.\n\n**Similar Company: SolarWinds** A notable example of a similar company that suffered a major breach is SolarWinds. In December 2020, SolarWinds experienced a significant security breach when their Orion software was compromised, leading to one of the most sophisticated and wide-reaching cyberattacks in history. The breach affected numerous government agencies and private companies, severely damaging SolarWinds' reputation. On December 11, 2020, SolarWinds was trading at $24.83, but by September 23, 2023, it had plummeted to $7.68. The majority of the damage was done reputationally immediately. Despite efforts to recover, SolarWinds has faced substantial backlash, legal challenges, and a loss of trust among its customers. This incident serves as a cautionary tale for CrowdStrike, showing how a single event can have long-term detrimental effects on a cybersecurity firm.\n\nCrowdStrike‚Äôs recent outage has revealed deep flaws in their reliability and trustworthiness. With competitors like Palo Alto Networks standing ready to capitalize on this failure, and potential political and customer backlash looming, CrowdStrike‚Äôs future looks bleak. Their customers, partners, and investors should consider this incident a major red flag, and avoid investing in a company with such compromised integrity and performance.",

Certainly nothing as public as Crowdstrike is experiencing, but IT professionals can debate which is worse: a faulty patch that impacts retail OS operations for less than 24h, or gaps in the actual protective software with vulnerabilities that cause actual exploitation by bad actors and malware to infect systems (which PAN has had no shortage of)? If I was forced to choose, I'll take the outage.\n\n>**Similar Company: SolarWinds**¬†A notable example of a similar company that suffered a major breach is SolarWinds.¬†\n\nYou have no clue what you are talking about. SolarWinds (1/3 the size of Crowdstrike, but who's counting) experienced a breach.

I think Crowdstrike ends up offering a discount for companies who renew and an apology. I think insurance covers most of the losses that the company will face from the outage itself. Having worked in IT, switching software systems particularly something as important as security is a massive, slow, and costly undertaking. It will take at least a year for a company of any major size to change vendors. People underestimate that.
