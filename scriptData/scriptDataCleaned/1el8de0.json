          "body": "Most of ya'll regarded and don't understand how the leveraged ETFs work. In periods of high volatility (as I imagine the rest of the year will be), over the long term (OP said they will hold for 6 months) leveraged decay and daily rebalancing can really bite you.\n\nSay over the next 6 months, QQQ does:\n\nMonth 1: +5%\n\nMonth 2: -4%\n\nMonth 3: +3%\n\nMonth 4: -2%\n\nMonth 5: +6%\n\nMonth 6: -3%\n\n\nIf you invested $100 in QQQ, after 6 months you have a *gain* of $4.61. But if you invested $100 into TQQQ instead, you would have a *loss* of $35.93. OP should have DCAed to reduce their risk profile, but they didn't which is why this is a YOLO.",
