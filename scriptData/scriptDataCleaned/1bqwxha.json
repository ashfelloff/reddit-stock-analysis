  "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell repeated that the US central bank isn’t in any rush to cut interest rates as policymakers await more evidence that inflation is contained.\n\n“The fact that the US economy is growing at such a solid pace, the fact that the labor market is still very, very strong, gives us the chance to just be a little more confident about inflation coming down before we take the important step of cutting rates,” Powell said Friday at an event at the San Francisco Fed.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-29/powell-says-latest-inflation-data-in-line-with-expectations",

This isn’t a hypothetical, you can read about historical examples. \n\nFor example, when the us (and everyone else) was still on the gold standard around the turn of the 19th century, there was a severe shortage of gold globally. It caused a massive liquidity crunch, which greatly harmed the economic lives of the poor, especially small family farmers. When the value of money starts increasing, people hoard it, rather than spending or investing it. Poor people suffer the most when money doesn’t move around. In the us, this meant farmers couldn’t get loans to keep their farms going, or if they could the rates were usurious and they risked losing everything with one bad harvest. People who already have a lot of money do fine, but then again when don’t they really lol. \n\nA whole populist movement was born out of this circumstance, and a nut job called William Jennings Bryant came pretty close to being president on a single issue platform: switching from a gold to a silver standard.\n\nThe problem was only solved by a providential strike of major gold mines in South Africa, which injected a massive amount of liquidity into global markets and ended the cries for the silver standard.",
