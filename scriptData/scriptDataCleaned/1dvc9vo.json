We are WAY outside of the normal bounds of median prices for a developed market like the US. 21 is stupid expensive, implying a return of under 5%, before inflation and taxes.

It can't be the MSCI index, because that's in the 30's right now. Maybe they're looking at frontier markets aka \"really, really emerging markets\". Something like Ukraine, Bulgaria, Kenya..",
