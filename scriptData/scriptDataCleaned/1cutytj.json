      "body": "Really hard to gauge NVDA. Consensus seems to be that they are dominant and order book backlog so should readily beat both earnings and revenue. They also have a huge backlog of orders so hard to imagine any hint of lowering guidance. In fact, probably raise guidance.\n\nBut here is the kicker, this is what most people think and expect. This has a tendency or raising expectations significantly even beyond “whisper” numbers.\n\nI have been burned many times by companies beating estimates, solid guidance but flat or decline share price.\n\nExpectations are:\n- EPS = $5.18 (Q4 was $4.92 and LY q1 was $0.82) this is massive earnings growth. I think 5% earnings growth QoQ is too conservative. They grew 32% last QoQ. I am gonna estimate 20% increase from $4.92 to $5.90.\n\n- revenue = $24.27B. (Q4 was $22.1B and LY Q1 was $7.2B) They increased revenue 22% QoQ. Estimate is to increase 10%. Revenue is harder to scale with backlog and actual limiting of shipping demand. But they are also shifting to higher cost chips and margin. I think 15% rev growth is reasonable so $25.4B rev.\n\nOf course these beats would also go into the full year guidance and even if they just incorporated the Q1 beat, would raise 12-month guidance. But likely raise future quarters as well as it would seem artificially low given Q1 beat.\n\nThis is all my speculation and my point is even if this happens, because so many people including institutions expect this sort of beat, the stock may not jump as expected.\n\nAlso, that 1000 ceiling is very real. But this earnings could well be the catalyst to break through and then hopefully the 1000 ceiling becomes support.\n\nDisclosure: no position in NVDA but have shares of TSMC (riding conservative coattails of NVDA, AMD and maybe even AAPL)",

Too low is just as bad as too high.  Too high signifies a potential peak which is also a sell indicator. Last quarter they came in right where they needed to.  I think they can do it again.  The straddle tho to me seems the least risky.  The market is going to move on 5/22 and gap in to 5/23.  So I’ll buy a 1DTE on 5/22 ATM and see what happens.\n\nIf it goes up I won’t be surprised. If it goes down I won’t be either.  Going down is the more interesting scenario as I don’t know if SPY and Qs do a retrace or if there’s just a rotation in SPY.",
