      "body": "The problem with valuation metrics is that they are largely backwards looking. Even the ones that look at forward earnings/FCF are based on analyst expectations. Well, analysts have largely been wrong on Palantir (with the exception of Mariana Perez over at B of A and Dan Ives at Wedbush). I'd recommend building your own valuation model based on your assumptions.\n\nAt ~28x sales it obviously is expensive but lets dig a little deeper. There has been an acceleration in revenue growth since 2023Q2 which coincided with a new go-to-market sales strategy called AIP Bootcamps. Just in the last 2 quarters they've gone from 21% revenue growth to 27% YoY. Those buying the stock at today's multiples are expecting this revenue growth to continue accelerating.\n\nBut let's dig even deeper. **Why** is revenue growth accelerating? I mentioned AIP bootcamps where Palantir is able to demonstrate how they can deliver value in as little as a few hours. I highly recommend watching all of their AIP Conferences (freely available on Youtube). There you can learn about how they've built a digital twin for BP that is a fingerprint of their business from oil reservoir to gas pump. Or how they've helped Tampa General cut by 83% the amount of time required to place patients and post anesthesia care unit (PACU) holds declined 28%. Palantir now covers 20% of US hospital beds. Both of these institutions have recently signed 5+ year contract extensions. Take a look at the Skywise platform they developed with Airbus which cut the time to produce an A350 by 33%. Palantir was also recently selected as the first software prime ever on a $500 million military contract with Project Maven. Now we have the S&P 500 inclusion which further validates to prospective clients that they are here to stay.\n\nPalantir has the potential to become the operating system for the modern enterprise. What price would you have paid for Microsoft in 1993 knowing what you know now? Palantir has grown into a 20% position for me and I sleep soundly because I know what I own. This is just the beginning.",

He has stated that models and valuations don’t work for growth tech companies, he bets on CEOs and their abilities to cultivate a vision and management skills. He loves ppl like Musk/ Jobs. He likes Karp. Like you referenced, a year ago no one was valuing the potential expansion into health care facilities. Years before that they were only valuing their growth potential by government/ defense spending. There’s no way to determine how they may expand their TAM and product offerings and value those things before they are happening, so he bets on CEOs and leadership. \n\nAs of now, their fair valuation is around $25-30 per share imo, but every year they expand capabilities and the valuations increase after news drops, but market price typically moves quicker",

At the end of the day businesses will need to rent out all this computing power and subscribe to the software that makes best use of it. As the best software companies have margins in the range of 80% on average you can imagine expected return of all that capex invest is gigantic.
