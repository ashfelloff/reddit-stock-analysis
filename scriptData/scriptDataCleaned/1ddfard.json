NASDAQ‚Äôs been hitting ATH‚Äôs all week and I think it‚Äôs due for a bucket of cold water - and CPI will probably be the ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù. If it dips hard on CPI I will probably close and get calls before JPOW. Also 75 SOXL puts 48$ strike for this Friday (can‚Äôt attach multiple screenshots for some reason).",
