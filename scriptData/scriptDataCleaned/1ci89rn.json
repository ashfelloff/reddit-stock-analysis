For starters it isn't as simple as a choice for most people.\n\nIf you routinely fly from airport A to airport B for work, and need to do that, it's very possible only one airline does that route. Others might get there with 2+ connections. But only might might give the flight you need and that your company will pay for.\n\nThat limits the ability for a principled stand for a lot of people. There are also some airlines where you'll never be in a position to boycott them because of geographic limitations. You may just not live near an airport where Virgin or Southwest flies, for example.\n\nAnd even if you did put a dent in an airline. They'll lobby the feds for a bailout. Worst case is they get gobbled up by another airline. There are many barriers to entry. It isnt easy to just compete with airlines by creating a new competitor. \n\n\"Just don't fly\" or \"just use another airline\" is fine for casual travelers who have flexibility. Business travelers lack that same flexibility and they represent a more reliable market segment for airlines.\n\nThink of it like boycotting Sam's Club. The weight of your boycott is diminished by the fact that you're an individual consumer and the next 10 people whonwalk in after you own businesses and do most of their business shopping there.",
