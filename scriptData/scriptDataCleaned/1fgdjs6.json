The bottom company OpenAI Global, LLC is the one Microsoft has a stake in.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Top org non-profit OpenAI also wholly owns and controls OpenAI GP, LLC which CONTROLS but does not OWN the holding company mentioned in the previous paragraphs. The holding company is also where employees and early investors have their money.\n\nOn top of that, as with any 501(c)(3), the governance of the top org is entirely in the hands of the board of directors.\n\nFor all we know they could be keeping the top org exactly how it is and just restructuring everything else underneath.\n\nLink for details and pictures for all smooth-brains:\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/2023/11/18/how-openai-board-is-structured\n\nhttps://openai.com/our-structure/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sendto_newslettertest_business&stream=top#_ga=2.216803474.540377892.1726331669-1091357816.1726331669",
