There are something like 5 billion shares of TSM and with 10-15 million shares traded daily the stock bounces around way too much.\n\nThere is a fear of a slowdown in cell phone & computer sales.  This is where most of their chips go (AMD, Apple, Qualcomm and even Tesla's Dojo chip but this is not a big order). I think the 2nd half of 2024 and then 2025 will see an uptick in PC sales as all the pandemic PCs are due for a refresh. The stock market doesn't usually price in things like that so far in advance. \n\nI think TSM will reach 200 but probably not this year, maybe 2nd half of 2025 when it become apparent that AI is not a fad.\n\nINTC is a longer term investment as in 5-8 years. It will take that long for their fabs to work out all the problem.  In 5 years the demand for chips will be 10x what it is today. Robots, automation, AI, smart cars, etc. Only TSM, INTC and Samsung can make those chips and possibly Global Foundries (formerly AMD's fab) All the fabs can win, it isn't a zero sum game.\n\nI think that INTC could reach 300 by 2030.  It is much easier to buy now in the 30s than it will be at 100 even though I still think it will triple from there. If a tech bubble forms then 500-700 is not out of the question.  If they continue to suck then the stock will go pretty much nowhere.\n\nOn a more short term (6-12 months) INTC has their own AI chip which aren't as good as the latest tech from nVidia but there may still be a market for it.  Also some new CPU tech such as Backside power will make Intel CPUs more competitive. On a benchmark Apple's M2 smokes Intel's CPUs (especially with regards to power consumption) but in real world uses the vast majority of people just browse the internet, youtube, facebook, etc. and the CPU doesn't make much of a difference thus x86 cpus will still sell by the millions.\n\nThere is a danger in that the stupid US chip policy vs. China backfires. Because the US is limiting advanced chip sales to China, they will eventually develop their own chip fabs on par with Taiwan Semi.  I think they are 5-10 years behind.  But the FEAR can suppress the value of the stock price of other competing fabs.",
