                  "body": "In all honesty..  I did look into getting puts but the prices were so high any gains were very unlikely, selling them would be a better idea in general, which comes with a different set of issues.\n\nIf I did execute my plan three puts where like 3x16 ish.  Meaning it had to drop -16 just to double up.  And theta decay pending ... That's a long way down .  If bought at peak yesterday, it would have been a positive move looking at how much it fell.  Nothing really changed between yesterday and today fundamentally for DJT.\n\nSo very quickly, risk 4800 to make a realistic 1500 ( since we never buy and sell exactly on pivot moments). \n\nThat's a lot of risk, and those were short term  options . Far out are not affordable.\n\nWhat a I ended up doing is buy three 15 strike calls on IONQ on my birthday (5th).  2.55 average price, profit taker at 5.60 .  It hit, I cashed and got out.  Those were januari 25 calls.  In 24hrs as they went out before I could even look at the market first hour.\n\nSo I risked 765$ , got 880 profit.  That stock is flying way too hard, I could have sold at 7.70 if I had a chance to move my stops.  I'm long term bullish on this one , hence the January call.   I thought it was going to go up but not as fast.\n\nNoone ever got poor by taking a profit though.  \n\nBut the point is, the risk was soo much lower than any DJT move.  And time was on my side here.",

But when you start creating a strategy around options , you quickly realise it's not as easy and very expensive when you have a longer horizon.  \n\nMy best friend the day trader once said:\n\n- Never catch a falling knife\n- never gamble against the market\n- take a hike along in whatever direction it's going, don't bet against the market.\n- taking profit, well done.  Even if it was a double up with potential triple up.  Don't feel bad about not getting the latter, be proud on not using emotions in decisions.\n- make a plan, stick to the plan.\n- just ride the waves.\n\nHe never went broke since going pro.  Well...
