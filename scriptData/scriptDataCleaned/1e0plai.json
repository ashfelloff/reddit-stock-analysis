  "score": 64,
  "selftext": "Hello, fellow regards. A T10 MBA regarding reporting here. Rather than doing homework, traveling the Amalfi coast on a yacht, ripping bongs, and eating thongs, I’d rather spend a moment sharing my thoughts on HOOD. Not your boyfriend’s wife’s husband’s HOOD. I’m talking about Robinhood, the innovator for the investor. Not Cuckles Schwab or Fuckidtly.  I hope you’re ready for a highly regarded DD supporting my 160k tuition bill. To get in front of the dildo in the room, in 2021, Robinhood screwed me and many others over on a lot of money, but look, just because your hoe makes a mistake, you don’t get rid of your hoe. You train and teach your hoe so that next time, your hoe buys you the proper sauce for your tendies. Also, idk if any of you fellow regards spent some time on certain stock subreddits, but holy cow… Since I’m limited to pictures now, bear with this wall of text – I know you can't read, so I’ll do a TLDR at the end. \n\nThe stock has rocketed this year, but Vlad has plenty of room to take this verdant Hood to Pluto. You will experience a soft leather embrace with a whisper of ancient forests reflecting a sanctuary against your losses. Unlike other experiences with Vlad’s, we know. Below is an outline of the platform appreciation from 1Q23 to 1Q24.\n\n***Funded customers have gone from 23 million to 24 million over the past year.***\n\n***Gold subscribers have gone from 1.2 million to 1.7 million.***\n\n***AUC – Assets under Custody have gone from $78billion to $130 billion.***\n\n***Net deposits have gone from $4.4 to $ 11.2 billion.***\n\nAs of Q1, Robinhood has grown its user base with additional headwinds to keep people happy and to attract consumers. IDK about you, but I’m about AUC. AUC is the lifeblood of the Hood. It drives everything else and signals positive investment performance, acquisition of new customers, and expanding geographic and product footprint. To keep you in mind – this is data as of March 31, 2024. Over the past 4-5 months, the market has gone crazy, and who benefits – Hood. Expect these numbers to increase significantly within their 2Q24 report.\n\n***Outline of LTM (last twelve months) financial statistics from 1Q23 to 1Q24 – I’m drooling and wet. Some may call me mango man.***\n\n***Total net revenue grew by \\~40% or $177million -$441 to $618***\n\n***Operating expenses grew by \\~12% or 46 million– your mom likes this ratio - $352 to $398***\n\n***Net income went from a negative $511 to a positive $157 million – holy balls, batman – this growth ratio looks similar to RK's return on a certain stock***\n\nFinancial Health – this company has finally turned a profit and will continue to do so. 2Q24 I was glued to my phone, physically calling and putting stocks left and right. We all know the 2Q24 results will be similar, and we can thank our boy RK / RC for hyping all you clown up. Robinhood's cash runway is over three years if it maintains its current positive free cash flow level and many of its costs are fixed. It currently has $9.3 billion in cash and $6.6 billion in stockholder equity. We know these guys are M&A heavy with the current purchase of Bitstamp catering towards Crypto Chads and Shirley Temples. The next play for Robinhood for M&A could be health, auto, and home insurance for the boyfriend's wife's husband's insurance. (we know the terrible insurance companies are faltering, and private equity is scooping these bad boys up). By by by insurance agents / \"financial representatives,\" hello Robinhood\n\nNow let's talk about the Credit Card. I'm canceling my Amex Reserve, that's if I don't die in a Boeing airplane first. This gold trophy from Hood will fuel my casino playing, and to top it off, it has no annual fees outside of Robinhood gold and 3% back on all purchases. Now I can reinvest the cash I spend on my boyfriend's and wife's Gucci sleds and buy more Otm calls. Buying alcohol - boom, Otm calls on Grinder, and the 5% back on travel is just icing on the cake. No longer are we locked into buying off-brand apple air pods for a 50% premium or getting a free trip to Gary Indian with perks from American Express, Chase, and other shit cardboard.\n\n Currently, 1 million people are interested in a gold card, and we all know we love to gamble, eat, and consume way beyond our abilities. \"According to a Bankrate survey in November 2023, 49% of credit card holders in the US carry a balance from month to month, which means they could be charged interest on their purchases. This is up from 39% in 2021 and **47%** in July 2023. The average credit card debt for those with a balance is **$4,773**\". We know the number is increasing due to printers, mango man, and handicap Joe. Besides additional members joining the platform, Robinhood will use your balances to generate extra monthly income.\n\n1,000,000 users \\* **47%** \\* **$4,773** \\* (20 – 30%)/12 APR \\* a 20% discount for people that can't pay = we are looking at an additional $29.9 million to $44.9 million per month.\n\nThat doesn't even include the Fees merchants pay to accept the card. The way my boyfriend's wife and husband eat, we know that these fees are no joke.\n\nIf that didn't help, they also announced a $1 billion share repurchase program, with the process taking place over two to three years, beginning in the third quarter of 2024. And we all know what happens with share buybacks.\n\nWhile many of you gents and ladies yolo your wife's boyfriend's paycheck into Otm spy or Nvidia calls or buying doge on margin. Who is the real winner here? Robinhood. With all this in mind, the subsequent earnings will be massive in the first week of August. I'm betting my left nut, tuition, and a party in the Alps that Robinhood will crush earnings due to all you knuckle grinders buying CHEWY, SiriusXM, Telsa, GRINDR, and Nvidia. Robinhood will announce a new tiered subscription to leverage their newly acquired AI Fintech, Pluto, to let us simple folk play with Legos (algorithms) and trading AI tools in the coming months. The current Gold Subscriber is offered a robust product offering and is sticky, with churn of \\~0.8%. Most of us here wouldn't bat an eye if Robinhood bumped this up to $10 a month, doubling Robinhood's current gold member income of $90 million to $180 million.\n\nIn the past, Robinhood stock has been associated with crypto movement and volatility. However, if we were to come to stock prices today vs the past. Feb 2024\n\n**Bitcoin – \\~58k**\n\n**Robinhood - \\~$16 a share**\n\n**July 2024**\n\n**Bitcoin – \\~58k**\n\n**Robinhood - \\~$22 a share**\n\nRobinhood is slowly decoupling its downward movement from crypto.\n\nAll – positions below the share price of $32 by the end of the year. I’d expect a nice climb to the mid-high 20s after earnings and break $30 by October. Positions below. **THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE! I’m just cranking hawg. I’m buying every dip until earnings**.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2jnytxcb9wbd1.png?width=954&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc58da4073f9fa8a2eff9911d5f6bb3a1bf86268\n\nI’m just trying to apply what I learned in class and provide some helpful DD. Also, what no one is telling us, poors, is that private equity is chomping at the bit to get retailer money so they can charge us sexy management fees/carry and continue to serve us degens. I bet in a year, there’ll be new private equity offerings to us simple folk through brokerage firms like Robinhood.\n\n**TLDR: Robinhood is undervalued; they are printing money and doing shit with it, unlike a certain stock, with multiple new product offerings, and has massive market penetration with young generations. If you want to play earnings - calls 8/9, calls with a break-even of $23-$24 will make you rich. If you don’t want to play earnings, consider mid-August or anything at the end of 3Q24-4Q24. You’ll thank me later. Once again this is not financial advice – I don’t know shit but I’m a strong believer - ban me if this doesn't hit $25 a share by August 9, 2024.** ",
