  "score": 247,
  "selftext": "Eli Lilly on Thursday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that blew past expectations and hiked its full-year revenue outlook by $3 billion as sales of its blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss injection Zepbound spike.\n\nShares of Eli Lilly jumped more than 9% in premarket trading Thursday.\n\nThe drugmaker now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $16.10 to $16.60, up from a previous guidance of $13.50 to $14 per share.\n\nThe company also expects revenue for the year to come in between $45.4 billion and $46.6 billion, an increase of $3 billion at both ends of the range.\n\nThe results come almost one week after the Food and Drug Administration said all doses of Zepbound and Mounjaro are available in the U.S. after extended shortages. Demand has far outstripped supply for those incretin drugs, which mimic hormones produced in the gut to suppress a person’s appetite and regulate their blood sugar.\n\nHere’s what Eli Lilly reported for the second quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: \n\nEarnings per share: $3.92 adjusted vs. $2.60 expected\n\nRevenue: $11.30 billion vs. $9.92 billion expected\n\nThe pharmaceutical giant booked net income of $2.97 billion, or $3.28 a share, for the second quarter. That compares with a profit of $1.76 billion, or $1.95 a share, a year earlier. \n\nExcluding one-time items associated with the value of intangible assets and other adjustments, Eli Lilly posted earnings of $3.92 per share for the second quarter of 2024.\n\nThe company posted second-quarter revenue of $11.30 billion, up 36% from the same period a year ago. \n\nShares of Eli Lilly are up more than 30% this year after jumping almost 60% in 2023 due to the soaring demand for the company’s weight loss and diabetes drugs – and increased investor interest in their potential as treatments for other health conditions. That popularity comes despite their hefty monthly price tags, inconsistent insurance coverage and intermittent supply shortages. \n\nWith a market cap of more than $730 billion, Eli Lilly is the largest pharmaceutical company based in the U.S.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/08/eli-lilly-lly-earnings-q2-2024.html",

                  "body": "I don't believe Mounjaro is easier on the system. Both Ozempic and Mounjaro act in the same manner (with Mounjaro having another component for how it works). If Ozempic is harder on the system, Mounjaro would be as well since they both work in similar fashion. Looking at both clinical trials they had similar side effects. It'll also take a few years to see how the side effects pan out for non-diabetic patients.\n\nAnd, Mounjaro is not the preferred drug for T2DM. It has a higher weight loss reduction than Ozempic so it may be prescribed more often but Ozempic and other drugs in that class are also being classified as first-line again due to the weight loss.\n\nIn actual practice if your A1c or blood glucose levels aren't incredibly high, a lot of doctors start on Metformin because it's super cheap and likely won't need extra steps to be paid for by insurance. Then, they'll put you on a number of different drugs based on your overall health.",

The doc told her she needed to lose 60+ lbs to help level things out, but she was only losing a lb a month on an extremely restrictive caloric deficit + daily exercise. She got a script for Zepbound and started losing 10+lbs a month without any change to her diet or exercise routine. She should hit her goal weight in a couple months, and plans on stopping Zepbound then. Basically \\~$4.5k to cut multiple years off of her weight loss plan, seems pretty worth it IMO.",

If your cells don't respond well to insulin, you're going to store more fat than normal and hold onto that fat even in a caloric deficit. Tirzepatide has shown to improve insulin sensitivity and increase insulin secretion, which is going to help you burn off fat and store less of it.   \n\n\nCalories in and calories out matters the most, but there are people who are going to have a much more difficult time losing weight due to hormonal imbalances causing metabolic issues, insulin resistance, and other things. It's the reason why some people who get thyroid cancer gain massive amounts of weight, their hormones go out of whack and their metabolism comes to a screeching halt.  \n\n\nMy SIL is also a registered dietitian, so she knows how to track her calories and eat properly for weight loss. I find it difficult to believe she was self-sabotaging or something and lying about it.",

Thyroid issues = hormonal issues. Hormonal issues are not exclusive to thyroid problems (e.g. my SIL's hormonal imbalances postpartum).\n\n\n>when I’m deep into a “bulk” and have a higher body fat percentage, my blood glucose is usually in not the most optimal of levels either.
