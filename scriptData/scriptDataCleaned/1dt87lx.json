                          "body": "It's going up on low volume trading. If you are managing a hedge fund, then you want the stock to go up so that you can sell high. So, during premarket or on trading days with low volume, you can buy with small amounts of money to push the market higher, creating momentum that brings in a lot of retail buyers. \n\nYou then sell later but you do that very gradually so that the selling doesn't cause the market to tank. The market will then correct later, you try to not trigger that inevitable downward motion by your selling. \n\nThe reason why the market will go down later is then due to retail being fully on board and the hedge funds who have just sold not wanting to buy before the price has corrected a lot, say, 50%. In such a situation there are no more buyers at the current price, there are only sellers. But if the trading volume stays low the price still won't tank.  It's only later when trading volume starts to increase that the price will come down hard.",
