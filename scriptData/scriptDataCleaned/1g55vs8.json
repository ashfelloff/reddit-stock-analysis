  "selftext": "The crux of this thesis is well explained in this[ WSB post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/) from earlier in the year. The thesis was correct - Uber missed earnings badly due to investment losses, and the stock tanked afterwards.\n\nHowever, Q3 of 2024 earnings will be the *opposite*. Their investments killed it, which should result in blow-out EPS.\n\n**Uber has three major holdings:**\n\n* Aurora Innovations (AUR)\n* Didi (DIDIY)\n* Grab (GRAB)\n\n**Investment gains during Q3**\n\nAUR $2.81 to $5.95, a 111.74% gain\n\nDIDIY $4.02 to $4.74, a 17.91% gain\n\nGRAB $3.53 to $3.80 a 7.65% gain\n\n**Number of Shares**\n\nAUR 326 million shares\n\nDIDIY 575 million shares\n\nGRAB 535 million share\n\n**Total gains for Q3**\n\nAUR - $1,023,640,000\n\nDIDIY - $414,000,000\n\nGRAB - $144,450,000.\n\nTotal gain: $1,582,090,000\n\n**Modeling Q3 2024 EPS**\n\n[EPS estimates are .37 for the quarter](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UBER&p=d&ty=ea). With approximately \\~2billion shares outstanding, the net income *just from their investments alone will be EPS of  $.79.* Any additional EPS from operations is gravy. I’m guessing earnings will come in around $1 per share - exceeding EPS estimates by 300%.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5g83x61ro5vd1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=66b121677bdd95ab60cd95673a1382ec57aecc6e\n\nThe same thing happened back in Q4 2023. UBERS investments did well that quarter and the company blew out estimates. Looking back at Q4 2023 earnings as an indicator for this quarter, the stock moved from $67 to $81 within a week of earnings, a 20.9% gain.\n\nI'm seeing some conflicting data around the actual date that earnings will be released - finviz says 11/06 and yahoo finance says 10/31. I'm currently rolling with the 10/31 date.\n\n**My Positions:**\n\n700 shares of UBRL purchased last week\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/lk4diweso5vd1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f938b13f776d9c2ac52a80b9d28d1fd168a8617\n\n12 of the 11/15 $90 calls acquired today\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i4g3aunuo5vd1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=102e038327a02e258b148042208a63328c818209\n\n**Risks**\n\n1)      If the market shits the bed, this play might shit the bed too.\n\n2)      If Uber’s core business shits the bed or guidance is bad, this might not work.\n\nGood day.\n\n**Earnings day edit 10/31**: Welp, UBER crushed earnings even more than expected. However, the market has decided to shit the bed and the stock gods have frowned upon UBER. Booked a -20% loss in UBRL but holding onto the options for a hail mary miracle.",

That idea is absurd and will never show growth anytime in the next five years.\n\nEvery time their investments are a drag on the headline number they are quick to point out that it was just because of one time paper losses while when they boost the number they don’t mention the paper gains. \n\nThe main thing the street is going to care about in this report is gross bookings, ie are more people ordering food and cars? I can guarantee that even with these paper gains if they show a disappointing number this stock is going to crater. I would not be shocked to see a miss there tbh even though those are very hard to predict quarter to quarter.\n\nWas actually in an Uber this evening and the driver said they are all revolting against how much Uber has been fucking them of late, gaming how much they get paid so the drivers are now rejecting rides unless they are over a particular amount per mile because that forces Uber to raise prices.\n\nThe only thing keeping this stock in tact at this point is ultra low gas prices.

But there is no guarantee that this EPS will be sustained in the future. In other words, a 111.74% gain in AUR shares is just a one-off event. As I see it, if UBER sold all of his shares in other companies, he would get *$.79* per share. Considering that the stock has gone up by 10% in 1 month (*$7,33* per share) those investments are more than taken into account. If they were not taken into account, we are looking here at a mere 1% increase. Perhaps it will skyrocket, but it would not be because of investments, or at least it shouldn't.",
