      "body": "$AI is estimated to report on the last week of May sometime\n\nSince their last ER the stock dropped almost 50%. Currently, it has found a floor near the $20.60 mark and is picking up momentum\nalong with the overall market\n\nStill even with the ~10% bounce off the lows this thing has room to run. It is 30% shorted and is starting to create momentum to the upside\n\nThe stock while not great has the best ticker in the industry and sits on over $700M in cash\n\nI don't love the stock long term because wallstreet has very high hopes for it but short term they will not need to raise any equity as their cash burn is very low, The company also has 0 long term debt.\n\nRight now the price to sales is at ~7 which is the lowest it has been in the past 3 years\n\nThey are presenting at two upcoming investor conferences in May. I do not believe you would hold two investor conferences that close to ER if you weren't going to produce results\n\nThey hold their ER close to last out of the market and every stock ahead of them will be mentioning\nAI nonstop as we have seen with Adobe and Tesla\n\nHistorical IV will push these option contracts higher as ER is announced and the conferences start to happen.\n\n I believe $AI hits a minimum PT of $25 before ER.\n\n**Positions 3,500 shares. Options 6/21 $25C x 100**",
