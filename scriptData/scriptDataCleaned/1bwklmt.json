One of the reasons they had so many returning buyers was because the cars held value pretty well making it easier for those who get a new car every 2-3 years to make that decision without hesitation. \n\nThe unstable pricing makes it impossible. Pandemic aside, you always expect to lose value as soon as you leave the lot, but the predictability of reuse market makes it easier to justify the general cost to own a car. I can go buy a Tacoma today, and I know roughly how much it'll sell for in 3 years. Hard to determine that with the Model 3, Y, etc. One day prices can go up $2-5k, another day it drops $5k.
