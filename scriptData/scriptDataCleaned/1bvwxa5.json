If you make his gains divided by the percentage increase it gives you his starting money roughly\n\nSo 23 575$ return, divided by 1977.78 = 11.81. That means OP had 11.81$ x 125. Which gives 1477$.\n\nHis 125 contracts are worth 187$ EACH. Hence the $1.87 (options contracts are x100). This means he bought his contracts for like 11$ each (0.11) or so.\n\nIt appears as though he held them at first even past like 10k gains..but OP being greedy wanted more. You can see on the Day graph that it spiked up and down bases on SPY Price and the theta decay (time)",
