I’ve burned more cash trying the latter than sticking to smaller returns. I’ve only made it big time once and got cooked on the rest because of holding onto something that never happened. Yeah, I know it sucks to go see those contracts now worth a gazillion dollars, but hey, it could’ve gone the opposite way and at least you got something out of it. Anyway, fuck why did I sold those NVDA calls on Tuesday?! Back to you",

Like sometimes you just KNOW a company is stupid like with zinga or Groupon. And you can smell the mass psychosis. But that happens once every couple years. \n\nOther than that options are for hedging. Not investing. Nobody can predict short term fluctuations. \n\nSo basically the opposite 😂",

I assume we're only talking about short term OTM or ATM or very barely ITM options here.  I buy these with the assumption that they may go to 0 and I will let them go to 0 if my target is not hit.  This obviously limits the amount I buy but I really have not found a good way to manage these kinds of options.  It's just \"place your bet, spin the wheel\" and see what happens.  \n\nIf I have multiple contracts I will manage them differently.  If I can sell some to recover my cost I will let the rest run past my target.  I like having a few contracts for that reason but it obviously increases the risk given my strategy of moon or bust.",

Start learning how spreads work, because a lot of them only realize their value after 3:50pm on their exp date - like when the short expires OTM. If you short something, buy it back for a gain, but only 1/5th of the potential gain, when the risk is actually decreasing, is like paying for a plan ticket to tokyo and flying home after eating some 711 sushi.
