Just because the company the market cap is 3T doesn't mean people spent 3T cash buying it. The total money supply in the whole world only sits around 21T.\n\nThe daily volume of Nvdia was 500m just for reference during the carry trade unwind the august 6th when Nvidia dipped pretty hard. If 200-500M trading volume (both buying and selling) can move prices up +-4%, 60B only buying can certainly impact prices.",

Bull markets last 7x longer than bear markets. Buying the dip aint possible or else we'd all be filthy rich. We all miss the dips waiting for it to dip more then not buying until it almost gets out of the dip anyway. \n\n/u/TY5ieZZCfRQJjAs so just ignore this man.
