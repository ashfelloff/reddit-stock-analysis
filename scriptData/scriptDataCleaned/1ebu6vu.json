                  "body": ">Gross debt is up due to inflation,\n\nIm confused what youre arguing against when you proved my point. GDP increases does not normalize against inflation. So in OPs post he says   \n  \n\"Gross domestic product increased at a 2.8% annualized rate after rising 1.4% in the previous period, the government‚Äôs initial estimate showed. The economy‚Äôs main growth engine ‚Äî personal spending ‚Äî rose 2.3%, also more than forecast.\"\n\nTo which i replied a simple fact. Consumer spending is driven by increased in debt which is pretty commonly known at this point  \n[https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc](https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc)\n\nYou say gross debt is up due to inflation. Yes exactly, things cost more, so people have to borrow to afford the same things that they didnt have to borrow as much previously\n\nThe part youre saying no sign of worry is  \", but the most recent available numbers adjusted for inflation + delinquencies show no sign of worry.\"\n\nWhat youre missing is this. Increase in US unemployment  \n[https://ycharts.com/indicators/us\\_unemployment\\_rate](https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_unemployment_rate)\n\nSo whats the story. Increased consumer debt wouldnt be an issue as long as that debt can be serviced. So youre looking at delinquencies right now, but thats a lagging indicator. One significant leading indicator to increased future delinquencies is higher unemployment and higher under employment (IE people losing FT roles and going to PT roles)\n\nSo thats why i say, current GDP increases looks good right now but inflated prices + consumer debt spending is whats driving the increase in the economy.\n\nThe problem is leading indicators like increased unemployment + increased carry over debt balances + increased under employment all point to one thing. A future significant pull back in spending which will be a pull back in the economy aka recession. \n\nSo like i said originally. The current economy is built on debt not cash. And it will bite us at some point. Because people will max their debt out at the trend theyre going. And income is no where near catching up, vehicles are underwater, so where does that money come from?\n\n[https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/12/three-measures-of-us-credit-card-debt/](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/12/three-measures-of-us-credit-card-debt/)",

Risk/Reward, right?\n\nBecause most banks make a profit on people who pay interest. That demographic is probably sub-prime folks who‚Äôll get a card, not pay their credit card balance on time and banks will charge interest. Most folks who have great credit will pay their bills on time and banks won‚Äôt make money. \n\nThe only problem in this plan is if the economy tanks, those customers are not going to pay their debts. Hence, it is a balance for banks to just bleed them enough that they pay their interest and debt while not killing their golden goose.",
