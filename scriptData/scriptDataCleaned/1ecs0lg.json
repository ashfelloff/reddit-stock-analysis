Prisons being for profit is messed up though. There's a good reason the vulnerable and lower socio-economic/economic groups of people go to jail, and not billionaires\n\nEdit: he will start shorting that prison stock if it's public.\n\nEdit edit: it's quite ironic that the company is called \"G.G Inc.\" \n\nGood game mfer,  ya lost!",

One trader would do a trade with the broker (broker using a personal trading account which is also not supposed to ever happen). Broker would buy from one of the traders, then sell to a different one for a profit. They'd then funnel these profits into a real estate company that they were all partners in. The whole thing was dumber than this was and they thought they'd get away with it.\n\n\nWhen I first started in the industry Dodd Frank hadn't been put in place yet. I worked at a very small shop. When Dodd Frank was put in place, my boss had to sell out his interest in the company. Come to find out that 15-20 years before that, he was a trader at a big oil company. Every time his company was about to hedge their production, he would go out and sell futures. Then his company would go and hedge their production, driving the price down...and he would buy back while the price was lower from all the selling pressure. \n\n\nIn both of those cases the people involved were fined MORE than they made in the crime. In my old boss's case he was banned from ever being registered with the NFA again, which basically means he can never trade or broker again. In both cases I was shocked at how blatant it was and couldn't believe they thought for a moment that they wouldn't get caught.",

They hold that position, then when it goes to around the peak, they short it back down. Or if they say it's overvalued, they buy it then pump it back up to profit that way. They're profiting on both sides and it's not just deceit.\n\nI mean the fact that a certain famous investor got sued and investigated for market manipulation for posting a meme... the shit citron does should be illegal.

                          "body": "Sorry for being unclear man! You're right though. they say it's overvalued publicly, downward pressure from that decreases the stock price, so they short it,, then they buy up shares cheaper than they are really worth. \n\nSo say it's at $50, they release a report saying \"overvalued\"and the price goes down to $35. They buy the stock at the low price while also shorting it at peak. $35 is the low, so they stop (sometimes naked) shorting it and exit that position. Then the target company has great news released and the price goes up to $60 over a period of time and they have made $25/share+ the amount they made on shorting, and the hedge funds also paid a % of *their profits* to citron for the manipulation of the public.\n\nEssentially they can easily at least double their profits by smear campaigns and buying/selling along with the hedge funds and such. Thing is if they are naked shorting it, they didn't even need to have the shares or buying power to begin with. They're making money out of thin air\n\nHope this makes sense!",
