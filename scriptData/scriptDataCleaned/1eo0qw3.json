Obviously there's a degree of truth to it as you can see in what remains of the manufacturing industry in North America, but your hyperbole is clearly overblown.\n\nWhat's so special about physical presence that you can't apply the same logic as to purely knowledge based work? If anything, manual labour and related service industries have a decades long head start on being automated out of existence and yet they're hardly dead.\n\nWhat AI is or will be theoretically capable of is one thing.

Two years ago ChatGPT seemed like magic, and now most coders I know use some kind of virtual assistant (Claude, copilot, replit) to massively increase their productivity. Hiring in the tech sector is lagging, and the jobs market overall is incredibly weak. Again, it's not a value judgement, it's just what's happening and a small excerpt  of what's to come. \n\nWhat I think is that working society is in no way prepared for AI. The main issue isn't that AI will replace your job, it's that a single person with AI can replace 20 of you. Most likely we'll need some form of UBI, but even that is problematic in that most of the UBI incentives align a little too well with communist dictatorship.\n\nReddit is also incredibly behind on this, for whatever reason. I assume it's just broad backlash against AI as a concept, but regardless of the downvotes: it's here, it's not going away, and you're probably not ready.",
