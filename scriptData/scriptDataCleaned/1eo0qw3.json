Two years ago ChatGPT seemed like magic, and now most coders I know use some kind of virtual assistant (Claude, copilot, replit) to massively increase their productivity. Hiring in the tech sector is lagging, and the jobs market overall is incredibly weak. Again, it's not a value judgement, it's just what's happening and a small excerpt  of what's to come. \n\nWhat I think is that working society is in no way prepared for AI. The main issue isn't that AI will replace your job, it's that a single person with AI can replace 20 of you. Most likely we'll need some form of UBI, but even that is problematic in that most of the UBI incentives align a little too well with communist dictatorship.\n\nReddit is also incredibly behind on this, for whatever reason. I assume it's just broad backlash against AI as a concept, but regardless of the downvotes: it's here, it's not going away, and you're probably not ready.",
