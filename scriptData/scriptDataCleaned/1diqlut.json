I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade, I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored. I will block you if you’re a troll.\n\n**News:** [Boeing Lost Track of Up to 400 Bad 737 Parts, Whistleblower Says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-18/boeing-may-have-installed-bad-737-parts-whistleblower-alleges)\n\n**AAPL-** Nearing that 220 level again. Also supposedly going to conclude their EU Anti trust inestigation to avoid a huge fine.  \n\n**ITCI-** Up because of positive topline drug results for mood disorder therapy.\n\n**AVGO-** Reported blowout earnings on the 12^(th), still been moving upwards. Watching the 1900 and 1850 level.\n\n**RKLB-** Signed Electron (small rocket) launch agreement, largest ever, with Japan.  Watching $5 level.\n\n**GME-** Annual meeting happened yesterday, company reiterated past statements on cost-cutting plan, but didn’t speak about future growth efforts.\n\n \n\nNo watchlist will be posted on Friday, I'm taking the day off to play the Elden Ring DLC!!",
