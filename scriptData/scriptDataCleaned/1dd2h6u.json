  "score": 31,
  "selftext": "I‚Äôm researching these two companies right now, and from what I‚Äôm seeing so far (definitely could be missing a lot), they‚Äôre pretty neck and neck. They seem to give off FedEx vs. UPS vibes in that both are decent companies with no indisputable advantage over the other.\n\nNow, granted, AZO has a significantly higher price per share at $2780.95 (at the time of this post) with a market cap of $47.5 billion, but its P/E is 19.23. ORLY is currently priced at $975.13 per share with a market cap of $57.4 billion, but its P/E is higher at 24.75. Both have negative equity for their RoE%, and both seem to be saddled with significantly more debt than cash.\n\nAnyone have any insight on these two competitors?",

      "body": "For me Advance Auto, AutoZone, and O'Reilly are the same and sell mostly low quality parts. I go to whatever is closest. They are fine for \"staples\" like oil, filters, spark plugs, basically anything that's a good name brand. Also great for tool rentals. \n\nFor important stuff I stick to OEM, or good quality aftermarket. Outside of oil, anything I can get at the box stores I usually prefer to get on Rock Auto. Rock Auto usually has a better selection of better brands. \n\nNapa has a good house brand for a lot of stuff, and for certain things that I need right now I'll drive farther to Napa.\n\nI personally wouldn't touch any of these stocks. I see this as a dying market. I love working on my old cars, but I also own new EVs and accept the fact that I'll never work on them.",
