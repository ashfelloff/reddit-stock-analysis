I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.\n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_?” or “Is \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Traders Need Fed’s Rate-Cut Signal to Keep Stocks Rallying](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-18/traders-need-fed-go-sign-in-jackson-hole-to-keep-stocks-rallying)\n\n- Also looking to trim/sell off my current NVDA long because I anticipate this week to be far more volatile than the last and we've literally had a week and a half of straight recovery for the market. \n\n* [**AMD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMD&p=d) - $4.9B cash-stock deal to acquire server builder ZT systems to expand portfolio of AI chips.\n* [**ASTS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ASTS&p=d) - We saw this make a huge move from 30 ->37 Friday, worth watching at the open again.
