I would look for huge gains.  10x or more.  Smaller bets like $2-$5k.  What killed me were these little innocuous trades when price movements were flat.  Earnings were ok, but then you have movements that are hard to understand, like nflx blowing out earnings and dropping 8%.  Maybe trade 2-4 times a year.

If I was in \"really good\" profits last week, I would have cashed out at least half of the profits. Only continue trading with the other half. Trying to do this is a good habit. Ideally you are trading and doing well most of the time if you are timing the start of the trades well (at least in crypto/bitcoin, no idea about stock market) and saving half of the profits each time as you hit plateaus. Then continuing trade again with the other half. Again timing it well, not entering into a trade during a pump. Always after a dip (I.E. right now in bitcoin when it has been down around 60-65k for a month and should soon be going upwards again). Ideally you always want to be gaining and saving/keeping half of those profits, and continuing new trades. Set tight stop losses so you dont lose much if the trade suddenly turns around and starts to go down. I dont suggest riding through dips, it never generally works out. Only upwards, and stop losses for if it's not working in your favor. Then waiting for another opportunity where it will be going upwards again.\n\nI once too used to fully trade my total amount, 5x leverage or whatever. Hoping it'll just go on forever. Always ended up losing all of the initial amounts eventually (just smaller trades, like $500 or 1000). Then learned that going full degen without any safety plan never works. The market volatility will make sure you eventually lose it, every time. By design.",

      "body": "Something similar happened to me in 2018 and again in 2021. A gambling addiction is a manifestation of a much deeper problem, which is a lack of self worth. If you buy a particular stock or option, you believe in the return on that option more than you believe in investing in yourself. No amount of money will ever validate your lack of self worth, which is why you keep trading. The solution I found is to pivot to endeavors that are \"very difficult\" and increase self-worth. Examples might be learning a language, climbing a tall peak, picking up an adventure sport, living in a new country, or starting a business. Even failing at something very difficult increases self-worth, because you're working the muscles of taking on life's challenges. Pushing a few buttons on a computer is not intrinsically challenging. You need a real hard challenge. This $250K loss is God / the Universe pushing you towards a real difficult endeavor that will transform you for the better.",
