What stocks are you most eager to pick up on the cheap?\n\n* CMG has really come off its highs and nearing it's 200 day ma. \n* NVDA and TSM are just about at their 50 ema, so a bounce is expected as we head toward earnings (TSM tomorrow)\n\n\n[edit] MMFI is signaling we're entering correction territory, so I think more downside is in the cards over the next few sessions.",

If they are inexperienced or illiquid and they fear loss they will pull out of the market on speculation, further contributing to bearish trends. When this correction occurs, more liquid investors may take advantage of the trend. They may increase purchasing of ‚Äúdiscounted‚Äù stocks they are long on, or if bearish outlooks are dominant may buy puts, further exacerbating the problem until the correction has been fully realized.

Often times P/E ratios spike due to capex, or an investment held on the balance sheet loses value, or some other one off event. \n\nOn the flip side, P/E ratios can drop dramatically due to one off positive events like an investment held on the balance sheet gains tons of value.\n\nI‚Äôm not sure on the specifics of Uber, but their forward P/E is 32x. It‚Äôs important to have some concept of ‚Äúnormalized P/E ratios‚Äù, and to do some digging on companies that have recently turned profitable.
