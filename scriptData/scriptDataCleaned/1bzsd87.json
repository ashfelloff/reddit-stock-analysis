NVidia hyped AI, showed some new hardware, companies bought what they needed and stuff started to become irrelevant, so the demand also dropped. Bigger companies don't spend huge amounts of money on new hardware/software every year, heck as my cousin worked at Motorola in 2016 they still used winXP at some of their offices, simply because switching to new hardware wasn't cost effect for them. Another thing is, 1k per share for a tech company ? That's way too overpriced imo. \n\nWhen I was trading forex news were important but still TA had it's place ( because people follow it so it creates fake demand on b/s) but stocks simply move like crazy and at least for me seems like there's no real analysis over here except for resistance, support and the 30% bound back on short time graphs ( which happens more than 50% of the time but still not always), whatever is in fashion people create such a dumb demands from nowhere losing millions, hope to create millions.
