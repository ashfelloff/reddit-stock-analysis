  "score": 173,
  "selftext": "As you know, Boeing has messed up again, and the ongoing work strike could last another 1-2 months, similar to the automotive strikes. This will likely drain Boeing’s cash flow by at least another $3 billion. Given they’re already operating with negative cash flow, any further bleed will push back their timeline to achieve positive cash flow.\n\nKeep in mind that the upcoming quarterly report is shaping up to be another nightmare for shareholders. The additional red tape in their production process, aimed at improving quality, is only going to slow things down further, leading to more delivery delays and cost increases.\n\nWe can expect their losses to widen, cash flow to worsen, and it’s very likely the stock price will drop below $100 after the next quarterly results. So, put it is.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/a8dzzqthwjod1.png?width=345&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8a2eb2edf7accbf94d2811d23515c5f8e3ab5bb\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4tbl9c5jwjod1.png?width=1534&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aabc478b61a8f17322fe0d40c7394d6b61607a1\n\n",

      "body": "It seems like there’s a lot of confusion about how government bailouts work, especially when it comes to Boeing.\n\nFirst off, Boeing is a public company, and they aren’t struggling with their business model or on the brink of bankruptcy. They won’t shut down if the government doesn’t step in. The real issue here is their operational problems and bad management, and the government can’t just send in the CIA, Secret Service, or Agent 47 to fix that. (Ok, they did twice)\n\nBoeing’s stuck in this vicious cycle:\n\nProduction problems → losing money → cutting costs → quality control issues → product failures → adding more red tape to fix production → increased costs → bigger losses → more cost-cutting → strikes → even higher costs → losses keep growing.\n\nYes, Boeing’s too big to fail, and the government won’t let them go under. They’ll keep giving Boeing military contracts to keep the company afloat. But unless Boeing can turn things around and make their business profitable, their stock price is going to stay stuck.\n\nNow, even if the government does step in with a bailout, I can assure you, you’re not going to like how that plays out or what happens afterward. Just look at the banks that failed in 2008 or even the more recent collapses, or take a look at GE. Government bailouts rarely end well.\n\nSome people might argue that since most of the shares are held by institutions and funds, they’re not going to sell off a huge chunk of them. That’s probably true, but keep in mind that if the company isn’t making money, they’re not going to add to their positions either. They’ll only buy more when the stock is cheap enough. Plus, they’ve probably hedged their bets with puts that you won’t see.\n\nSo, until Boeing’s stock price drops low enough or the company gets back to profitability, it’s mostly going to be retail investors and Agent 47 trading the stock.",
