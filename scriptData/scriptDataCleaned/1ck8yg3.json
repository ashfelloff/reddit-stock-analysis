And do you think shareholders are about to be screwed? I have high hopes and believe All he’s saying is they’ll invest whatever it takes to get to AGI, which they’re probably very close to reaching.",

The algorithms are basically the same as the ones detailed in the latest-and-greatest textbooks on the subject that I used in grad school. The only thing that's changed is how much processing power we have today vs 10 years ago, 20 years, 30 years ago...\n\nOpenAI can afford to pay absurd comp packages to get the smartest people working on a single, specific problem. They can also afford the obscene cost of processing power for all of this, and they have access to the cutting edge GPUs from Nvidia where a single unit is more powerful than most supercomputers were 15 years ago.\n\nI have no idea how feasible it actually is, or how far they will get or how quickly, I just know that nobody has thrown this many smart people and processing power at a single problem before.",
