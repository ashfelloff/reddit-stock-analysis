  "selftext": "Nvidia and Jensen Huang have been talking about AI for almost two decades, granted it was mostly vaporware but there were many futurists and academicians who have recognized its promise as early as the 1980s/90s, if not before. NVDA the stock itself languished for many years without any major movement, it was in the low $100s as late as October 2022, it was $50 in 2020. \n\nHow many of the big name investors and fund managers with massive research budgets and resources miss out on its potential and are now chasing it all costs? How many of those funds had it as a major holding for the last 5 or 10 years? ",

I never heard businesses talk about it. I guess because they didn't think it could make them money so they didn't care. Outside of a company like Deepmind maybe. \n\nDeepmind created an ai that would play what some people consider to be the hardest games. They did starcraft, go, and a few others. And it became exceptionally good very quickly. And then it beat the best humans in the world. When this was released exactly isn't clear, but it was early to mid 2010s when I started hearing about it. \n\nThen nvidia released the rtx cards, which used ai to do real time ray tracing. Something previously thought impossible because of the calculations required. This came out in 2020.\n\nAnd still there was no mainstream appeal.\n\nOpen AI releases chat gpt. This is in 2022. End of 2022 but still. It's now a global phenomenon. If you weren't making investments into ai at this point, I'm not sure what else to say.\n\nI say all this with the belief at the time that I didn't have any special knowledge. Deepmind was cool, but impractical because of how long it took them to design it for these specific tasks. Nvidias rtx cards were a massive push, and really made ai practical and applicable to real world use cases in tech. Chat gpt brought all that to consumers.

It became clear to the docs 1-2 years ago LLY and NVO were massively undervalued based on our own experience prescribing the meds, their efficacy and the lengths patients would go to get and pay for them. When we spoke to finance buddies about this they kind of shrugged at what we thought the companies could make before profits. I remember being laughed when I said both would be trillion dollar companies. (I posted this here on wsb last year as well)\n\nIn the end they invested but everyone who bought LLY sub 350 was a doctor or in medicine. \n\nI’m guessing the same holds for NVDA. People working on chips and AI likely had an idea but the finance bros were a bit late on this because honestly most of them don’t really know.\n\nFor what it’s worth I think Amgen may be worth a flier based on their once a month drug, but the next gen drugs from NVO (cagrisema) and LLY (retratrutride) will dominate.",

However, at the time, it was overpriced due to high demand for GPUs. I was waiting for tech stocks and Bitcoin to drop due to interest rate hikes to get a better price. I honestly thought I had a few years before people would catch on, but then OpenAI released ChatGPT, and everyone jumped on any stock related to AI. The funny part is, my investment wouldn't have been about their GPUs. NVIDIA has some amazing AI technology for training robots in simulations.\n\nIf you haven't noticed, there are a lot of companies trying to create robots, and I don't believe anyone has superior technology for training purposes. To train anything that will operate in the physical world, you need a detailed simulation of the underlying physics. NVIDIA not only has the hardware but also the software to achieve this.\n\nI'm not claiming to be the smartest investor in the world, but I think others had similar reasoning. They're not pouring money in now because of the GPUs per se, but because of the technology necessary to train the robots that will be hitting the market in 5-8 years.
