  "selftext": "There are 3 Chipotle locations near me and lately every time I go (to any of them) I leave feeling angry and disappointed.\n\nMore than 50% of their customers are millennial and Gen Z and they are 20% more likely than average to have incomes of >$125,000 (according to NY Post article). Is that this crew? Margins are also 16% which is crazy high for the restaurant biz.\n\n\nTheir stock performance has obviously been consistently great while the quality of the burrito has consistently gotten worse. I don’t think I’ve ever seen such a disconnect between stock performance and the quality of the product.\n\n\nThe reason I ask is because I think I’m gonna short it. Except for their diehards, I just don’t see how their customers can continue to choose to eat there.\n\nEdit: Stock splits on June 6. Would short or buy puts after. Edit 2: Vote is June 6, stock split June 26 (thanks Derelict5432).",

It's like $11-12 at most with taxes, unless you're just piling it with extra options that cost money, i.e. both queso and guacamole. \n\nEven then, cheaper than a restaurant burrito + tip. Better for you than McDonald's with a portion of everything in the food pyramid for you. I eat MCDs and pay $12, I'm hungry in a few hours. I buy that burrito from Chipotle - I'm eating it over the course of a day and probably good until the next day while getting a great mix of veggies, carbs and protein.",

Economy is slowing so people who used to eat in higher end restaurants who won’t stoop as low as Mac Donald’s think it is a good compromise. Chipotle being in the middle is benefitting from both sides of the spending spectrum. They didn’t do anything special. IMO they will keep pushing the quality down until they lose both of these customers.",

The company intends to seek shareholder approval for this amendment at its upcoming annual meeting on June 6, 2024.\n\n>If the Certificate of Incorporation amendment is approved, shareholders of record as of June 18, 2024 will receive 49 additional shares for each share held, which will be distributed after market close on June 25, 2024. Chipotle's shares are expected to begin trading on a post-split basis at the market open on Wednesday, June 26, 2024.\n\nAlso, I forgot the most regarded aspect of shorting Chipotle. [They now have a guacamole-making robot called Autocado](https://newsroom.chipotle.com/2023-07-12-CHIPOTLE-PARTNERS-WITH-VEBU-TO-TEST-AUTOCADO-PROTOTYPE,-A-ROBOTIC-SOLUTION-TO-GUACAMOLE-PREP). How fucking regarded to you have to be to bet against a fucking guacamole-making robot?",

Had this confirmed to me by a logistics manager, who also said that the reduction in portions is to reduce food waste (said that \"customers can't even finish their burritos/bowls because portions were too big\") and the maintaining or increase in price despite portion reduction is due to the high quality of the food (which has decreased over the years due to using cheaper food sources despite raising prices). It's my favorite food place and I spend an embarrassing amount of money there, but yeah the portion reduction and giving normal portions when paying for double is a real scam that they are encouraged to pull by the company lol",
