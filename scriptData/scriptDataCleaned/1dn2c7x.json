But over time it has evolved into an airline that does not care for the patronage of its customers. They “revamped” their AA Advantage Points system by giving “Loyalty” points. Mind you, the “awards” for loyalty are like seat coupons, and system wide upgrades, etc. Imagine you cannot use the seat coupons cause you already have status by the time you get those awards, so essentially they are worthless. Idk if AA thinks we are dumb or don’t notice. Then systemwide upgrades and their use depends widely on availability but AA sells the upgrades and do not open availability until maybe right before the flight. They rather make $59 bucks than give a customer loyal to them spending over $20k a month in travel the upgrade option. \n\nFrom the moment their protocol in flight started to include “our flight attendants are primarily here for your safety and not comfort…” I knew it was going to go downhill. No other airlines makes you feel like they’re doing you a favor to be serviced by them in-flight. It’s a top down flaw that has taken grip and eroded this once climbing airline. So AA, take a page from others such as Singapore Airlines, Emirates, or any other top airline traveler option and buck up. Or lean back and double down into becoming the next cheap airline like Spirit to nickel and dime everyone from customers to employees. File Chapter 11 again and bleed business customers. My 2 cents.",

Nowadays their service is so terrible I would rather drive an extra hour to get to a United hub.

It feels like they need to make some drastic decisions to turn this around, but I'm not sure their CEO has the brains or the guts to do it.",

They then closed their kiosk and just left for the night. So I had to scramble to find a hotel, ground transportation, etc. and didn’t get settled until after midnight. \n\nThe next day, I had to wake up early to make sure I made my connecting flight. But I’d already paid for a hotel room at my destination for a room I hadn’t used, had to pay for a hotel and ground transportation in Dallas, and no one at AA wanted to address it. \n\nThen, earlier this year, I was forced to use AA again and connect through DFW. As we landed at Dallas, our pilot came down hard and must have jostled something in the plane’s cabin air system because a fan caught fire and smoke started filling the cabin. After our fire department escort to the gate (which, surprisingly, we weren’t the only plane receiving one as another AA plane taxiing in front of us ALSO had one!), they brought in a maintenance team to address the smoke issue. Amazingly, they were preparing to immediately put the plane right back into service for a flight to Idaho Falls. \n\nSo if I can avoid using AA, I’m avoiding using AA.",

EVERY single flight was delayed. First flight was first flight of the day. Delayed due to first aircraft not passing preflight inspection. Second flight delayed due to previous flight at gate departing late. Gate agent told us as soon as the flight in gate pulled out, the new flight would pull in and we would start boarding within 10 minutes. I knew it wasn't going to happen. 30 minutes passes by and finally they announce 10 more minutes. Then at the one hour mark they start boarding.  This also was not some random city. This was at DFW which is basically their home base and they should have maximum resources. \n\nSomething similar happened on the return trip.

All three places are plagued with bad weather and constant ATC delays.\n\nTheir international flying is lacking. They’re basically a domestic career with some Europe, Asia and lots of Central America/South America.\n\nTheir customer service is almost to the level of Spirit with the amount of disgruntled and burned out employees they have. The different work groups hate each other. Hell, the pilots hate each other. Legacy AA vs TWA vs US Air vs America West all hold grudges after their mergers.\n\nInflight experience is basically nothing now. Same stale pretzels and horrible basic economy seats with no IFE installed anymore. \n\nAA just fired a top exec for screwing up and bleeding cash.\n\nThis company is in shambles right now.\n\n\nThe only thing good is apparently they’re paying off lots of their bad debt.",
