  "selftext": "started my RH account on Jan 3rd wanting to invest to make good money as a side hustle. At that time only had 2k deposited on my RH account and managed to gain 300 within a month investing in companies than selling the shares within a few days, basically swing trading. It's funny how you can see when actually enabled options though. At my peak was up 1,700 with only 2k invested in RH, and this was after a few days of discovering options. decided to withdraw $500, but the following trading day humbled me quickly with a 1k loss to making me nearly breakeven. This is when I discovered ODTES which is where my downfall started. After all of this that happened, the past 2 weeks has been interesting. FINALLY learned that 0DTES are horrible and you REALLY need to be experienced just to make consistent profits, which is whyI started buying calls at least a week out from now. Last Friday I purchased a spy call with most of my port and though had bought the dip. As we all know, that was not the case. On Monday could of sold my contract for a -20% loss but held, now am at a -90% loss with money that I now owe. This is the last week that will EVER be trading options, I was much more profitable by just buying shares in a company and I was doing it rather consistently too. I'm only 18 but it stings to lose this money especially since thought I had a head start in life but not anymore. start investing again once have a good amount of savings, but as far as options gol never want to touch it again!\nTLDR: lost most of my savings on DTES and should of stocked to just buying and selling shares. switched to buying calls a week out but the market crashed. Never touching options again, only sticking to shares in the future.",

Not even this advice.\n\nSeriously though, unless you're psychic you can't tell the difference between people who got lucky and people who are good at it (and that's if you even believe there are people who can consistently pick winners *or* losers, which I don't). The law of large numbers says there's gonna be a *lot* of lucky people out there, no matter how you define \"luck\". They bought ten different options and they all printed? Good for them, there's no way to know if it's luck or not.\n\nMostly I just hang out here to see what people are saying and for entertainment. My own investments are significantly less \"regarded\" to use the terminology. All those times you see somebody say \"If you'd just put your money in <X> and done nothing you'd have made $$$$\"? I'm one of the guys who did that. Currently +$557k, and that's after the divorce cut everything in half.\n\nTL;DR: Investing isn't fast unless you're lucky. Stop looking at luck as something you can achieve and make the obvious plays that always print money instead. It's boring and slow, but will make you rich if you just fucking do it.",

          "body": "My first big loss was from trading LCID calls which expired a 5 days out. I was up +20% until Elon Musk made a tweet which sent TSLA competitors to shit for a few days. I was down 1.7k within 24 hours so I sold then bought puts next market day which gained me $700 in just 3 hours. I quickly sold it there without looking back, at the time I was shocked to recover some of my losses so quickly. During the weekend I discovered 0DTE SPY contracts which I watched at least 2 hours of videos on. The thing is, saying your going to do something is easy, but when in your in the moment and you see SPY moving up and down a dollar at a time it gives you a sudden impulse to trade to avoid FMO. This what I'd later discover to be the nail in the coffin on my trading experience. I originally planned to have my TP at 50% on a 0DTE contract and SL at 25%. When Monday came I bought 3 SPY 0DTE calls and was up 20% but later throughout the day it just moved sideways. At the time I had a wistful concept on what Theta was, and as you may have thought, not only did SPY go down later that day but I held all the way to 1pm from open which made me lose -30% on the contract which was about $500. I don't remember when, but at some point I gained $200 on 0DTE SPY which motivated me to continue. \n\n\nAnyways, after this loss I saw that reddit was yapping about crypto and saw that Shiba has rose 30% the past month. I got in on Shib at .000018 with 1k then held to $200 profit on that Friday. I then opened Shiba charts to try to look for a pattern. I eventually found out that Shib peaked at 4am every day which I tested multiple times and was successful. During that weekend I was able to make $440 by just trading crypto, but I stopped after the following trading day opened. I thought of the crypto gains as a little reward I got out of the pump and dump.\n\nAfter that, the next 2 weeks were just 0DTE options, I had ups and downs but I had a tight TP but a loose stop loss which led to my downfall. It's funny looking back on it because if I were to have bought those same contracts a week out I would have had some nice gains. The last 2 weeks of me trading was me realizing my regarded mistakes, that's where you see those two small bumps at. I was doing somewhat fine until SPY crashed causing my calls to become near worthless.\n\n\n\nQ: Would you ever go back to options? \nA: No, I've stated numerous times that I was more consistently profitable from just buying and selling shares. I'd go further in depth about this more but I'm at work\n\nQ: How does your loss affect your life?\nA: Despite me losing over 3k it hasn't affected me financially much because I can make that back in less than 3 months, but it has GREATLY affected my mental health which I am still continuously working towards improving",
