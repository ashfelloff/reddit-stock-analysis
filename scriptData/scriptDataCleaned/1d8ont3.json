  "selftext": "Eli Lilly CFO Anat Ashkenazi will become Alphabet’s new chief financial officer effective July 31, Google’s parent company announced Tuesday, almost a year after Alphabet first announced current CFO Ruth Porat would move to a new role as president and chief investment officer.\n\nAshkenazi has had a 23-year career at Eli Lilly, which in a separate release confirmed her departure.\n\n“We’re very pleased to have found such a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a release.\n\nAshkenazi joined Eli Lilly in 2001 and had been CFO since 2021. She will continue to serve on the pharmaceutical company’s executive committee until her departure.\n\nShe previously served as a CFO for several of the company’s global business areas, helping to manage the revenue windfall from Eli Lilly’s weight loss and diabetes drugs.\n\nPorat had nearly three-decade career as as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, culminating as its CFO, before joining Google in 2015.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/alphabet-taps-eli-lillys-anat-ashkenazi-as-new-cfo.html",
