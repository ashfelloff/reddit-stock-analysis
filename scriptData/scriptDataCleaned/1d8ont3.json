She will continue to serve on the pharmaceutical company‚Äôs executive committee until her departure.\n\nShe previously served as a CFO for several of the company‚Äôs global business areas, helping to manage the revenue windfall from Eli Lilly‚Äôs weight loss and diabetes drugs.\n\nPorat had nearly three-decade career as as an investment banker at Morgan Stanley, culminating as its CFO, before joining Google in 2015.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/05/alphabet-taps-eli-lillys-anat-ashkenazi-as-new-cfo.html",
