  "score": 83,
  "selftext": "I wanted to bring some qualitative discussion as to why I think Elasticsearch is only at the start of its downfall.\n\nYou'll need to know some history behind how Elasticsearch started and why it became so popular in the DevOps world. \n\nTLDR: They used to be opensource but Amazon basically stole their code and offered their service on AWS with the same name. Elasticsearch got pissed, changed their licensing from open source in 2021 and sued Amazon. Fast forward to today, theyve now settled with Amazon. However, since 2021, AWS has created their own competitor called Opensearch which is basically just a forked version of Elasticsearch with Amazons own contribution to it.... and they've been gaining a ton of market share.\n\nThe main reasons why\n\n1. Engineering managers and open source devs that spent time on developing Elasticsearch open source got screwed by Elastic in 2021 and trust eroded\n\n2. Opensearch is a part of the AWS ecosystem and why would a company go out of their way to add another vendor like Elastic if everythings already managed under AWS for them?\n\nThis graph shows a snapshot of the adoption of both:  \nhttps://db-engines.com/en/ranking\\_trend/system/Elasticsearch%3BOpenSearch%3BSplunk?\n\nAs you can see Opensearch is gaining more and more traction where as Elastic seems to be stagnating.\n\nHowever, anecdotally, I think this is worse than it looks for Elasticsearch. I know for a fact internally teams still refer to Opensearch as Elasticsearch because it is just a fork of it.\n\n  \nI think this story will be similar to how Microsoft Teams due to its distribution channels completely swept up market share from Zoom. Similarly, I think this will happen with Opensearch and Elasticsearch.",

Sure individual and small projects will use Opensearch, because it is easier to get started, but what larger companies will do is what is important. Because it is a fork of a now closed source application, it is going to diverge more and more and not be a one to one replacement as more time goes on. Just because there is competition doesn't mean anything. I am no expert in evaluating database stock, but I know mongodb is publicly traded and they have a lot of document store database competition and they are still doing fine on the market.",

          "body": "I should have mentioned that after the backlash, Elasticsearch has gone back to being open source again. So both are open source options but Elasticsearch has to convince people that their solution is not only better than Opensearch, but that its worth adding a vendor like Elastic to manage their service. With the eroded trust, I would bet against experienced engineering managers in the DevOps space trusting Elastic again. The amount of added work Elastic put on engineering teams to analyze pricing with the changing of licenses really confused the market and a lot of teams opted to switch to Opensearch even though their search as of now is not superior. But Amazon looks committed to improving Opensearch and if I were a betting man, I'd bet on Amazon's ability to improve and close the gap.",
