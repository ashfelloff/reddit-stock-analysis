The only real exception to this is if you’re bullish on China and you think their tax on foreign investments will divert money into HS or A50 in which case Jan calls on Kweb or Yinn. \n\nMy thesis is that money will flow into Tesla and crypto in the event of a Trump win. I was already playing BTC and I think most of the juice is done for anyone playing derivs which means I’d take a look at Tesla. December 240s will print hard if Donnie wins but you have an earnings minefield to cross first so I personally have a small position of 10 calls that will be doubled or tripled if Tesla earnings disappoint the market. If they don’t and we get a blast off I’m going to take profit and look for the next thing. You’re like 1 good trade away from being even or better",

You haven't deserved that right yet.\n\nAs painful as it is, start with a bare minimum amount that your broker requires you to have to make the smallest trades. Then focus just on growing this small account by 1-2% a day or whatever your time + your strategy can accomplish successfully. Then fucking grind.\n\nYour money is gone forever, delete the memory of it from your brain. Start making $20 a day, then $50 a day, then $100 a day (and make that transition over months) and then slowly get up to the minimum amount you need to pay all your bills. And make sure that is consistent over months. Then and only then should you think about \"making\" money.\n\nRealistically, if you follow this advice, at some point you will lose it all again, and feel even worse than you did this time because you made it all from trading so it'll hit harder because it took you months or a year to build up to that amount.\n\nThen you restart and do the same thing again, this time it'll go faster, and you won't fuck up as much. Maybe this will be the last time, maybe you lose it all one more time, but eventually something in your brain will click about whatever is fucking you up so much and you fix it.",

Life isn't about money. Money sure does help life tho. Take some time off trading and just focus on resetting your bank. You will get back that money plus some in due time. Life is worth more than 20k. I'm really sorry for your loss tho regard. May this be a lesson in your life that you bounce back quickly from.",
