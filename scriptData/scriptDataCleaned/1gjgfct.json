  "selftext": "\nNvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.\n\nNvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.\n\nThat gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nContinued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.\n\n\"We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,\" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.\n\nIntel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was off 0.6% and Broadcom rose 1.7%.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

MSFT and META will onboard their new chips (which are already fabbed btw, since 2023) and soon custom silicon will be the way. with TSMC still making all of them. *ALSO* i think GCP is gonna scoop up a lot of these customers who are getting denied by Azure for the simple reason that they have compute and azure is constrainted\n\neither that or gen AI itself crashes.  but thats even harder to time",

              "body": "The reason is that the effectiveness of a gpu/chip for AI is largely dependent on the software and algorithms that other people build. Sure google has their own tpu (which is only available via gcp btw), and amd is trying to create a gpu while supporting rocm, and other big tech companies are creating their own chips, but the largest misunderstanding you're making here is that hardware is the most important thing you need to do ai workloads. In reality, you need the software ecosystem, since the field moves so quickly. In the past 1-2 years, we have gone from the introduction of FlashAttention, to FlashAttention v3, which is optimized specifically for hopper architecture gpus. And by the way, this is just for the transformer layer, it doesn't even account for the hundreds of other layer variations people come up with (which are always optimized for nvidia gpus in the first place because that's what everyone uses). And why would use non-nvidia as a researcher, you would just be making things more difficult for yourself. This is just a single example, and you can see how just having this optimized attention layer will speed up things by a multiple 2 over v2!! And, in the past few years, the software ecosystem for nvidia has only become greater with the release of open source models. Because with open source models, you can guarantee that one company (like google), cannot own the best model, and you can spur open source development, which is best for nvidia because most people operate within their software ecosystem. Guess who is releasing those open source models? Meta (SAM and LLaMa and more). And I have a theory that's probably why meta was such a large customer early on, because they may have been given some sort of incentive to do open source releases for ai models since it ultimately benefits nvidia. By the way, this is why no one uses tensorflow/jax anymore, since google tpus works the best on tf/jax, but nvidia does not want to support them. As such, nvidia supports pytorch more, and thus the entire community mainly uses pytorch. So yeah, ai is not just the hardware, it is the software ecosystem. And ai is not just chatgpt, it is search relevancy, recommender systems, computer vision (object detection, segmentation, ai generation), etc. So many uses cases, so you need the software ecosystem in order to be efficient in AI development.",

Currently, I agree that claude is probably the best LLM for most use cases, but the field is dynamic and it's hard to know what will be the best a year from now. And yes, the software is there, but there is a reason why most people don't use it. Even if the software is there, it doesn't mean that it is easy to use, or if it is the most efficient as well. Anthropic and Google use it because Google has a stake in anthropic, and will obviously push to use their own product.

                              "body": "Yes, lets break this down.\n\nSo first off, regarding the concentration in ai spend. I do agree about this, and this was a point of concern for me a while back as well. So google and microsoft and amazon buy large amounts for sure, but it's also because they have cloud businesses. So in their cloud busiinesses, companies that run on the cloud (which is pretty much most large corporations), need to use nvidia gpus for their ai workloads. So, although it seems that the biggest techs are buying the majority, the demand is still pretty mixed because they buy it for their cloud customers.  Meta is probably the largest individual buyer (they use it for themselves because they don't have a cloud business), but meta is going crazy in AI with all of the different work they're doing (not even LLMs, but outside like recommendations, etc.). So props to them.\n\nSo the point of contention here is whether the biggest tech companies will cease to buy nvidia. And that's the point I am also trying to make with the software ecosystem. Because nvidia's software ecosystem is the dominant ecosystem, it is not only more training efficient to use nvidia gpus (faster inference for models, as well as more efficient/faster training), but it is easier to use as a whole, since more people use it, there is better documentation, as well as coverage for different AI use cases. And it is important that not only the mega labs are on nvidia gpus, because a lot of the cutting-edge stuff happens in university research labs as well, such that the most optimized algorithms are built for nvidia first and foremost. So the question is that how much is this software ecosystem worth, is it work the premium that you have to pay for nvidia. I would say that explains why nvidia is able to sell their gpus at such a markup compard to other tpus.\n\nThe concept of the software ecosystem is very difficult to understand if you don't work in the space. But it's real and very powerful. Why do you think nvidia's revenue has skyrocketed in the past 1-2 years. TPUs and AMD gpus and meta's inference accelerators have existed DURING the time that these big tech companies ramped up spending. And the fact of the matter is that the largest datacenters right now are built with nvidia gpus. This will only further the software dominance of nvidia. Imagine all the software that goes into parallelizing training/inference workloads.",

Not to mention, meta's lab is very prestigious, and literally every company has internal teams working on ai development (more tailored for industry). Of course, all the big tech companies are working on their own accelerators, but these are not mutually exclusive. There is a reason why nvidia has stayed dominant in the past 2 years despite tpus existing, etc. I guess we may have to agree to disagree here, otherwise we are going to go back and forth all day on reddit. I'm just really passionate about investing so I love talking about companies.\n\nDo not underestimate the cloud customers.

The reason I ask is my understanding is NVDA’s power is that it isn’t heavy in providing AI services/research themselves, but instead they’re the go to hardware provider for those who want to start up/maintain their own AI services. That makes them insulated from the “how do we monetize this/offset the massive research costs associated with AI” because they’re just providing the fundamental tool for others, and then it’s up to others to answer the hard questions/spend the big money, in the same way that the paper company doesn’t need to figure out how to market a book, their money is made the second the paper is sold. Google meanwhile seems to be in a defensive position where they’re looking to leverage AI to protect their already dominant position in search.\n\nSo if Google is hoping to position itself as a manufacturer for other companies, then that opens up a brand new revenue stream for Google and puts them in position to potentially eat market share from Nvidia, etc if successful. If Google is just manufacturing enough to supplement their own AI needs (in other words, if they’re prioritizing AI services over hardware development/hardware manufacturing infrastructure), then it’s less of an exciting venture because they’re at the same level of other software companies where they’re pouring lots of money into AI in the hopes of a long-term payday. Not to say that the latter couldn’t be good too, it’s just a question of what strategy I’d be more interested in, and as a layman, my preference isn’t worth much.",

Legacy software is horribly insecure, and most admins will shank you if you try to run it on an internet connected machine.

      "body": "Nvidia's recent performance is indeed impressive, especially the huge returns on its investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure. With the rapid development of AI technology, companies like Nvidia that focus on graphics processing units (GPUs) and data center processors seem to be leading this wave of technological revolution. In particular, their Blackwell processors may become a key driver of the market in the next few years. However, it is worth noting that although Nvidia's stock price is currently high, it still faces challenges from competitors such as giants such as Apple and Intel. Although Apple has an advantage in hardware design, Nvidia's leading position in AI and graphics processing undoubtedly gives it a place in future technology investments.",
