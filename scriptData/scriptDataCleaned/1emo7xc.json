I haven't met one person that literally can't use it to be better at something.  At the very minimum, its insanely great at a functional google 2.0 which is what i mainly use it for.\n\nAI is the next version of technology, look at how powerful the internet is 24 years since it actually had pretty legs.  Also as another after thought, the .com bubble had way too many companies in the mix, everyone could make a website and form a company.  Not everyone out here building cutting edge AI chips and nvda is so far in the lead, its going to take AMD years to catch up and their in 2nd place.\n\nto wrap up.  The largest companies that are traded on the stock market can't buy these fucking things fast enough and they're so interested in it, since its a public company its a growth opportunity, they're literally building tiny nuclear reactors so they have enough energy to run the whole AI systems/data storage.  Among general discussions in the real world with people in many different fields, AI is already being used",
