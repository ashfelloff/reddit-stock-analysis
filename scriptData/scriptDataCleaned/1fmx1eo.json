  "selftext": "On Thursday I felt good about the $INTC chart so I grabbed some lotto 22c. (I am also long shares and LEAPS).\n\nIt was going horribly, I averaged down at 0.06 and then i just threw more shit at the wall hoping it would stick when they went to 0.01.\n\nLooked like dead money. I was about to close the app for the week and I saw THAT news come through. I let out a shriek.\n\nSaw my contracts at 0.41 in an instant and i closed them immediately. What a monumental dub. When you see a gain like that on 0DTE you don't ask questions just take the win. These contracts ended up going to 0.00. Glad I didn't think twice.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gasngdxtydqd1.png?width=2758&format=png&auto=webp&s=da797d96609d409f99dec85d1e70154af47fe351\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ivozfdxtydqd1.png?width=2908&format=png&auto=webp&s=8335cb062ff1e3e9c2128e885a90057af40975a1\n\n",
