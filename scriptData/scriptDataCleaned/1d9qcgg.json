BB's just chillin’ today, biding its time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3qfgknon305d1.png?width=473&format=png&auto=webp&s=25b5844b4ebba68dc3b8e275bd923e31fd9b4cdf\n\nIf it doesn't go anywhere, I can just sell this one off without much repercussions\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nUpdate: I feel like I should make an update about what my intentions and thought process were going into this trade.\n\nLook, BB stock was/is at a stagnant price around $2.7 per the charts for the past few months. $2.8 entry is pretty whatever. I scanned some other meme stocks but they went up already. So, I narrowed down to play BB. How did I play BB? I entered in with a plan to liquidate within 2 weeks and chose a far-out date if it did not go anywhere.\n\nNow, BB fluctuates enough such that it is most likely within my entry range and I could sell then. There are also no real potential catalysts that would go tits-up and dump this stock at this point. The only thing I do lose is decay, but really 10-15% is not a lot when compared to a potential jump to $3-4 range.\n\nI also was feeling a bit risky since I netted around $4k trading the main meme stocks this morning trading those options. So, my real cost is $4k\n\nAnd you know what? After hours its $3. Even if it doesn't actually open at that, I'm still fairly protected in my initial entry point.",
