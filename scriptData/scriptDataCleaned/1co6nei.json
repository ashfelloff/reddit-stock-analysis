      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nr/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.\n\nTo keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.\n\nWe try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. \n\nThis is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:\n\n* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. \"What app should I use?\", \"What should I invest in?\". \n\n* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, \"inverse cramer\" joke again. \n\n* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. \n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

This will be one of the most important companies of all time, they are building and operating these micro plants, smr only sells the designs, what data center or user wants to operate their own nuclear power plant lol. This design is incredibly safe and uses physics itself as a safety mechanism. This is going to be a trillion dollar company, its about to take off. Watch their investor video, if youre not convinced by the end i dont know what to tell you. This is absolute brilliance. This company at 18 is what btc was at 5$.",

They aren't regulated in the same way as IPO's so they can say whatever they want. Go look at some SPAC presentations and promises from 2 years ago. All of them overpromised, overhyped, and then underdelivered.",
