A major trajectory depends on specific results as trials play out further. Many drugs have early positive results, but shit happens.\n\nThis isn't the future of cancer treatment, as in this drug will cure y'all. Many companies are involved in immunotherapies and targeted therapies already, so this future is actually here. No need to sensationalize.\n\nFDA approval is always good news. But until insurance comapnies and Medicare study the results, it won't be used in large quantities over night. It takes years under normal circumstances for a drug to be approved for new patients..\n\nThere are various types of bladder cancer, so it's important to understand the specifics here. I hope ANKTIVA does work out and the company succeeds. There are already other  treatments available.",
