Get the city to fund low-income housing in it for a tax rebate, do no maintenance, set yourself as CEO of a parent corp that charges licensing fees for the management software used by that property.  Make those fees equal the full rent rates for the building, hire low income minorities and women to \"manage\" the property.  Never pay the loan, pass back the keys to a shit apartment building, to the bank in your bankruptcy of the holding company (REIT LLC is the building) when the loan implodes.   A bank that doesn't want the run-down building infested with crackheads will let you skate on that loan for ages, but you get tax-free income in your licensing fees.   Make sure you have a good attorney to fight the city when they claim you profited off your slumlord status making homes for the crackheads they wanted off the street anyway when they gave you low-income tax incentives.   \n\n\nNot advice, just imagining how bad and easy could be.",

Sell the land out from under them to your holding company and charge them rent equal to their income+some. Max out loans on the restaurant side and pay that as 'rent' too.
