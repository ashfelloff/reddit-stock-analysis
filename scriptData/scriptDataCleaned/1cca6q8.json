You're invested in Meta because you're bearish on all their AI spend, you think all the servers and AI stuff they're doing will generate good returns. Then they lean into it slightly more, a little more AI spend, and suddenly you hate it?\n\nDon't know what investors are thinking here. It's like I'm very bullish on Amazon doubling their fullfilment network and spending a bunch of capex on it, but Amazon spends slightly more on it, oh no, suddenly I hate it?",
