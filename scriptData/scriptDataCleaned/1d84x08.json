  "selftext": "PayPal might be a great investment given its current valuation of just 16x P/E and the launch of a new business.\n\nPayPal is building an advertising business that will leverage the troves of data it collects on consumer purchases and spending habits. The company already offers an “Advanced Offers” ad product that uses AI to serve PayPal users with targeted discounts from merchants whenever they make a purchase. Advertising generally offers higher gross and operating margins compared to transaction-based revenue. As PayPal scales its ad platform, the additional revenue from ads could significantly boost overall margins. While initial investments in technology and personnel will be necessary, advertising businesses typically benefit from economies of scale, which could enhance operating margins over time.\n\nIn terms of cash flow, the new advertising business can generate a steady revenue stream, enhancing PayPal's overall cash flow. Although there will be initial capital expenditures to build the advertising infrastructure (like a data management system), these investments should be relatively small compared to PayPal's primary business and can be quickly recouped through ad revenue. Diversifying into advertising also reduces dependency on transaction-based revenue, which can be more volatile, thus potentially stabilizing and increasing free cash flow in the long run. Not an investment advice.\n\nWhat do you think?",
