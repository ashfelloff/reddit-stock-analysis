It wasn’t until Wall Street figured out they also needed to lure engineers, scientists, etc. and get their own trading platforms up to speed before they could compete.\n\nHe also has dumped a huge amount of money back into research grants and scholarships, which is far more admirable than hoarding paintings or samurai armor like some other rich people.",
