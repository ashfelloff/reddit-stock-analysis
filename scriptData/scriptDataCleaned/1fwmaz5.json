  "score": 449,
  "selftext": "The airline was in discussions with bondholders over the terms of a potential bankruptcy filing. Its long-term debt and finance leases amounted to about $3.06 billion, excluding current maturities, as of Dec. 31. The airline has until Oct. 21 to refinance $1.1 billion in loyalty bonds due next year. \n\nSpirit has been facing an uncertain future after the collapse of its $3.8 billion merger deal with JetBlue Airways. But I guess US Gov wanted to preserve competition back when they block the merger deal..",
