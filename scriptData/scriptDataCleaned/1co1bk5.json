Go to ER and the stock is up bigly but not massive green dilly and lo and behold 9:30AM and the market tanks it.\n\nSorry for all of you who held past about 9:40 this morning.\n\nWow.",

That means 8% is actually trade able and seeking price discovery. But folks who can use leverage and volume and derivatives and set the bid ask prices (MM) can push the price around however they want and don’t care about delta. They’re focused on scalping theta and iv and such. 8% float worked over by a parasite system results in false price discovery. The only level price can find in this system is one that burns as many orders as possible. ",
