However it’s not what was being discussed. \n\nFor needed things, which are regularly scheduled shipments instead of drop, there will be limited reductions in demand, so other discretionary instead will drop as the consumers will buy higher priced. \n\nFor not needed, aka what most drop shipping is, this will harm the company directly as folks won’t be buying with the added cost at demand. This is a risk they took, it being priced in or not is your risk to take. \n\nThat better?",
