If they think there will be 4 this year for example, and that's priced in, but something outside the market changes that view, it will effect TLT. TLT just reacts to bond prices but bonds react to a bunch of inputs. The general thing to keep in mind is that for every 1% of rate cuts or increases, TLT will change by 16% up or down. If Jpow cut rates by a full point in Sept instead of .25, TLT would go up 16%. Most likely it's already pricing in some cut so it's already gone up part of that 16%. \n\nThis is why TLT was (and still is) a no brainer position if you think the fed is going to keep cutting rates. It'll go up if there is a recession and is a good hedge against stocks that will go down.",
