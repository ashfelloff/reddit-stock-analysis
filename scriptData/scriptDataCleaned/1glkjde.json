      "body": "OXY closed at 51.39 on Wednesday (yesterday)\n\nThis call expires on 8 Nov (Friday/Tomorrow)\n\nTo break even for a $55 strike call, you would need to reach call price + premium paid (55 + 0.02)\n\n$55.02 is $3.63 more than $51.39, so you would need a 7.06% increase in OXYâ€™s price by tomorrow to even break even.\n\nOXY has 0.708 beta, so it is less volatile than the market itself.\n\nOXYâ€™s IV is currently elevated at 31.9%. So using a 360d/yr calculation, 2 day volatility would be 31.9%/sqrt(180) = 2.37768% = 1Ïƒ\n\nYou need a 7.06% move, so a 2.969Ïƒ move, which for simplicity sake, weâ€™ll take as 3Ïƒ, a highly unlikely occurrence with a CDF of 99.7%. The probability of it rising 7.06% would roughly be ~0.3/2 = 0.15% \n\nSince earnings are next week Wednesday, Major catalysts between today and expiration are unemployment claims later at 9:30pm gmt+8 and FOMC tmr (these are unlikely to move OXY by huge amounts barring a huge change in narrative).\n\nSo, unless you have insider info that would drastically alter the crude/petroleum market by tomorrow, youâ€™re all but guaranteed to lose your money.",

      "body": "Oil stock should fall with the iran war needing money. Gas prices dropping like a rock from lesser demand and to much oil. Warrens just doing a small favor to share holders.\n\nTrump will let new companies drill drill drill.\nFrack frack frack. Only money in oil is possibly in companies that buy new land thats never been drilled before. Hes going to fluid the market with oil while we still needed it and ruin profits of other countries so they wont make war. See everyone all pissed off. He better do it and tank the price of oil more. Craps going to get real hairy soon. Then when its over just buy it all up for reserves and get a democrat in to reverse the damage. Probably will be screwy till 2037. Need every republican you can get atm to allow it so we dont get war. The damage will be insane though. This is why fallout thinks they would attack alaska. Because the usa will show them the true wealth of our nation.",
