Its just pure corporate greed.\n\nThis is exactly why there needs to be MAJOR government intervention in medication pricing.\n\n\nThe way medical corporations operate is not like a typical business where they look to make up their R&D and overhead costs plus a nice profit, they instead operate like the East India company, where they seek to exploit those they have power over for every penny they can.\n\nPeople with diseases/issues are not customers to them.

Now there’s enough demand that they are running out of stock (the wegovy bullshit too). I did however see some Mounjaro pushed through a few times. I think when doctors start actually thinking about weight loss as something that will be cured ultimately it will be the drug with the highest % weight loss that will be prescribed the most. Novo just owns the marketing right now with zepbound/mounjaro on only online advertising platforms",
