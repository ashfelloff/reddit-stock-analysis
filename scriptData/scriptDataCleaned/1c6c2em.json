  "selftext": "Pretty much the title. ASML had a pretty bad ER yesterday and the stock has fallen 7.5% as of now. As a result, other semi conductor stocks like NVDA, AMD have fell a bit. \n\nSince ASML's customers are chipmakers like TSM, Samsung etc, there weak guidance could potentially signal signs of slowing down production for these companies? So could it be that TSM also gives a low guidance on their ER which could plummet their stock as well?",
