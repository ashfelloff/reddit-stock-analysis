Sub 3% sounds great. but if you already pay a significant amount of your income to mortgage loans then life isn't any better. Home insurance, well insurance in general have been going up like crazy as well, and those rates aren't locked in. Even with good mortgage rates, an average household monthly payment and burden has been increasing. So the real winners are the ones who could pay off the house fully without mortgage, since that's one less thing to worry about(excludes people who can afford it but still took out mortgage on purpose to build credit)",

Your rate will be marginally better, but now days, it simply means you have a “par rate” (a rate you don’t have to pay for) vs. anyone under 700 who is paying to get a rate at all (this gets complex but happy to explain it in depth if you want!) \n\nHere’s my life pro tip: if you are buying a house, go under contract and send that mother fucker to 3 or more different lenders immediately. You have several days to where multiple hard inquiries don’t count against you. They LEGALLY have to send you a loan estimate within three days if they have property knowledge. Get loan estimates from all three and send them to each other lender and make them fight it out. This will give you a far bigger advantage than any credit score LLPAs (rate advantages).\n\nMost lenders sell their loans in the secondary market (happy to explain this too if you want). This means they are willing to take a loss to sell that thing off. I’ve had circumstances where lenders have given away $6k on a $300000 home just to buy a rate down to beat me. Then I’ll do the same, then they’ll wave fees, then I’ll wave fees, then you win. Any good lender should close you within 25-30 days, so use those first three to let them fight it out lol!",

As long as people are paying asking there is no reason to incentivize the market to lower rates. I don’t even care or worry about loan defaulting because you would have to see a massive change in that to cause prices to lower - the few that default will be scooped up quite quickly and unless you bought a house in the last 12 months or paid a crazy price it’s very likely your home value is greater than what you paid for it.\n\nPpl will also say - “7% was nothing when I bought my first home” - yeah well that’s stupid AF. What did it cost to do anything then? A lot fucking less.\n\nCall me stupid but as long as rent is high so will mortgage rates. They are married together. Imagine if rates were cut to like 4% and housing declined even 5% of value, you would see loan originations skyrocket and renting would see their rises capped or possibly retreat. They are in competition with each other but rely on each other to milk people dry or give something moderately priced.",

Interest rates during covid and immediately afterward were stupid low. 3% and lower levels of stupid. Yet during covid and through 2021 we saw a huge increase in rents across the country. So if it was as simple as \"Interest rates high = rents high\" then how do you explain the rise in rents when interest rates were low? \n\nIt's a lot more complicated, but rents are more closely tied to surrounding property values than they are interest rates. \n\nWhat's harder to explain is how housing prices have remained high and YoY price increases in real estate continue despite us being in a high rate environment for almost 2 years. Normal markets would see a correction in real estate prices to account for the lowered borrowing power buyers have in high interest environments. This points more to a supply side issue than a demand side issue. Corporate purchases of real estate in cash only deals is probably a factor too...",

If you paid $500,000 for your house at 7% and rates for some reason drop to 3%, the only way you will be able to refinance that house is if it is worth $500,000 - whatever your down payment was - minimal equity from monthly mortgage payments.
