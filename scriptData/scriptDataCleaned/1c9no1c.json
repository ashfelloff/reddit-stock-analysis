Sold them for ~$57,515 half at $28 to at least lock in profits and the rest at $32! My Roth account P840 put option purchased earlier on 3/25  10 contracts @ $8.3 cost $8306. Sold those for $46,800. Was kicking myself not closing out earlier but given the patten felt strongly we‚Äôd have a drop enough to at least break even. I didn‚Äôt buy more on Thursday really wanted to on the P800 because at that time I was tapped out! Also had same expiry P750 and P700. Fidelity will close out sometime in last hour of trading for any ITM options if you can‚Äôt cover them. I should have called them to request not doing this but the wait time can be long and too late.\nAs you can see combined gained 100k in one day! ü§ô\nNot letting me post more than 1 screenshot üëé\n",

Lets say that company x is now 700 per share but you think that it will fall so buy a put you can either buy a itm one where the strike price is higher than the stock price or an otm one where the strike is lower.¬† Lets say you buy a itm put at 760 strike this is very far itm and will be very expensive and the price of the contract depends on¬† factors such as volitility and supply and¬† demand. If say the stock price rises above 760 then by expiration the contract expires worthless if it plummets you make money. But i am assuming that the stock will nosedive in the near future so lets say you buy a 590 put this will be very cheap and how cheap it is depends on volitility supply abd demand. For u not lose all ur money it should fall below 590 b4 expiration, but the nice part is the contract increases in value as it approches 590 so if u dont thibk it will hit that then u can sell",

Generally speaking, retail traders are just trading the contracts, while exercising is more often done by institutions because they actually have the capital to take full advantage of these instruments\n\nIn this case, he is not exercising the contracts, he's just selling them off to someone else\n\nAlso, these are puts not calls, so if they were exercised he would be selling shares, not buying shares",

It was the cool nvidia not too long ago. In the end puts are perfectly fine if markets are hugely overvalued with a weird economy that is hard to predict and stubborn inflation and a screwed up global economy. Especially if a company has outlandish price rises with promises of a transformed economy ( and robo taxis cough tesla cough ) . \n\nNow for the wider market in general you are right and markets tend to go up over time because companies make profit and do research and development. So most of the time you should stay in the market but man the last couple years are pushing a huge wave of potential fuck up ahead of themselves. A big amount of the great performance of the stockmarket in the last decade were companies leveraging with cheap money. And well that that is gone and doesn't seem to come back. And with inflation high and the deficit already at idiotic level the government can't save us this time, if anything it's a miracle that it still is going so well. I guess uncle Sam is still pumping up the economy with a 6% deficit.",
