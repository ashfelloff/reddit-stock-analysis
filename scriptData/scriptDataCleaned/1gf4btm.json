  "selftext": "Reddit shares jumped 16% in extended trading on Tuesday after the social media company reported third-quarter results that topped analyst estimates and issued an optimistic forecast for the current period.\n\nHere’s how the company did compared to LSEG estimates:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 16 cents vs. a loss of 7 cents\n* **Revenue:** $348.4 million vs. $312.8 million expected\n\nReddit said fourth-quarter revenue will be between $385 million to $400 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $357.9 million. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter will be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, higher than the $85.2 million average estimate.\n\nRevenue in the third quarter jumped 68% from a year earlier, and the company turned profitable, reporting net income of $29.9 million, compared to a net loss of $7.4 million during the same quarter a year ago.\n\nThe company said that its daily active users grew 47% year-over-year in the third quarter to 97.2 million, better than analyst estimates of 96.5 million.\n\nAverage revenue per user was $3.58 for the third quarter, which beat analyst estimates of $3.24.\n\n“It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability,” Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said in a statement. “Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.”\n\nThis is Reddit’s third earnings report since going public in March. The stock has more than doubled in value since its IPO, closing on Tuesday at $81.74, giving the company a market cap of $13.6 billion.\n\nSince last year, Reddit has benefited from Google search updates that helped push its content higher in results, bringing in a flood of new users to the 19-year-old social media service. However, the newer users, which Reddit refers to as logged-out users, generate less online advertising revenue for the company than logged-in users, who typically spend more time on the platform, Reddit has detailed in financial filings.\n\nThe company said that global logged-out users grew 70% from a year earlier to 53.1 million, while global logged-in users increased 27% to 44.1 million.\n\nHuffman told CNBC in August that the company has been making it easier for new users to create accounts and is developing more recommendation features to turn newbies into long-term users. He also said that Reddit’s direct traffic is “really resilient” to any Google search changes.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29//reddit-rddt-q3-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29//reddit-rddt-q3-2024.html)",

While I agree their current business model may not be sustainable in the long term, businesses can change and adapt and GameStop is in the perfect position to do just that. Try to look past the \"meme stock\" label and see the incredible turnaround the business has seen the last few years. \n\nI agree with you, I thought GameStop was blockbuster 2.0 at first until I gave it a closer look. \n\nGameStop, like any business could one day ultimately fail. However with their current financial position they have an incredibly long runway. \n\nI kindly suggest you try reevaluating the business, and you may be surprised in what you find.",

The upvote downvote is core to its concept but is heavily suffering under its decades long memes being repeated to gain upvotes, drowning out other comments. Mods have almost unlimited power in their subs, to the point that mods ban people who use other subs. And bc they are all unpaid mods, the quality and reliability is inconsistent. They also have tendency to powertrip and its a very time consuming job, unpaid and internet parasocial relationships to get mod positions, so it isnt surprising that a very strange group of people are mods on that website. The plans are also weird as they rely on advertisers for revenue but want user to pay too. They are discussing monetising access to subs which contradicts ad revenue when people consume less since they lose access to some subs. \n\nIn the next 5 years they will do fine, longterm there is no perspective.

Reserve the sub and then get companies to pay.\n\nSecond is to change system from upvotes/amusement for contribution to crypto or cash directly - think YouTube business model. Allow more content creators to get here, you can then start replacing all kinds of content sites with subreddits, patreon, etc. - even NSFW stuff if they wanted to compete there.\n\nHonestly, the list goes on and on and on.

Let's say that number is actually 1B.\n\n1. For purely consumer social with advertising potential, Reddit's EV/MAU is currently \\~$17 (Assuming 17B EV and 1B MAUs). Twitter in 2022 traded at \\~$78/MAU. The median of a broader comp set is between 40x and 45x.\n2. Once you expand consumer social to AI licensing deals, the recurring revenue generated from that should require a multiple similar to B2B SaaS companies, which from a transaction multiple would yield 4.5-7x in addition to consumer social EV.\n\nBased on this, I'd say the bear case over the next two years is a $40B EV, the base case would be roughly $75B-$80B and the bull case to be north of $100B. And let me be clear this is not financial advice, so please consult a financial expert as the above explanation has holes.\n\nOverall, it begs the question: what would a company pay for RDDT today? And, what would RDDT shareholders agree to?",

I chose reddit as a \"highly likely to invest in\" stock pick after finding out this site had a stock listing which i honestly had no idea before. it was at 77 bucks and on the day I finally want to trade, out of nowhere (out of nowhere from a newbie's standpoint looking from outside in), reddit's stock shoots up to 114+ bucks.\n\nIs this a common occurrence where a stock shoots up this much? And if not, is it too late to invest in reddit now? i would assume that it's too late from what i'm seeing as the graph seems to have stagnanted now. (note still a noob, give me 100 years)",
