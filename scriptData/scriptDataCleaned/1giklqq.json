I really want an M4 processor for my servers at home, but running Linux on Apple hardware is still a slight PITA. \n\nGive me an ARM board with twice the bandwidth between system ram and the CPU as the M4. The Apple processors are great for running LLMs like Llama. \n\nThis could be the end of the x86 monopoly. Less power. More performance. Better LLM performance. It would kick ass in almost every way. Especially if it ends up being some sort of socketed solution.\n\nUnfortunately this looks to be another SoC solution. Which effectively means use and throw away. No swapping components to cater to certain use scenarios. No upgrades. Notta. \n\nOh well, a guy can dream can‚Äôt he?",
