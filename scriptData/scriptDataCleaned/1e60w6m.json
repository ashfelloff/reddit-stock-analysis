  "selftext": "People have been saying time and again that the technological market, specifically A.I., is nowhere near its peak. With the changing times and eras, stocks in the A.I. sector will continue to grow and reach new highs. However, with the sudden news yesterday announced by both candidates for the 2024 US President, it seems like a big hit to global chip stocks, including ASML, Nvidia, and TSMC.\n\nYesterday, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration is considering a sweeping rule to clamp down on companies exporting their critical chipmaking equipment to China. Trump added further negative sentiment to semiconductor stocks by saying Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defense, while also claiming Taiwan took \"about 100%\" of America's semiconductor business.\n\nIs this the final phase of the A.I. bubble?\n\n[This is a chart I drew myself with the help of an external website. Hopefully this helps with explaining that after the pandemic dip in 2020, this is the second largest dip the semiconductor stock has experienced](https://preview.redd.it/nqylryjsx6dd1.png?width=1950&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc9f3c689e96a10646e4e7625df62e006121689e)",
