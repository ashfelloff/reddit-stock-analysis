      "body": "Basically, the bull case means you need to talk about why it's price isn't as inflated as the rest of the Magnificent 7.\n\nPeople often say MSFT is like a tech ETF and that they have many revenue streams etc. There is a bit of truth, but I think it's mostly exaggeration – most seem to ignore how concentrated MSFT revenue streams are: Azure is 40%, Office is 25%, and Windows is 10%. If anything MSFT has significant risk since their top product directly competes with Amazon and Alphabet – which both have significant market share.\n\nApple seems to be even worse where the iPhone makes up >50% of their revenue.\n\nIf you run a DCF analysis, AAPL needs to grow FCF by 12% per year for the next 10 years. In the last 10 years, they've doubled their FCF, which is closer to 8% per year.\n\nWith MSFT, a FCF analysis indicates that MSFT needs to grow by ~15% per year to justify their valuation. In the last 10 years, they have averaged ~12% per year.\n\nAs for GOOGL, a FCF analysis indicates that only need to grow by ~9% per year to justify their valuation. In the last 10 years, they've grown FCF by ~18% per year.\n\nThe odd thing is that people always go on about how much MSFT has been able to grow, how GOOGL hasn't grown etc. However, no matter what metric you use (FCF, revenue or whatever), GOOGL has essentially the best track record of growing revenue and FCF than other big tech companies.",

The need to make revenue somehow at the end of the day. \n\nGoogle search is just so embedded in our lives and their AI summaries are actually quite helpful.

Google also has the most used search engine, this means that for AI applications they have the largest data sets available for free. Their cloud offering is top tier and have developed technologies that are very important for the internet and have their fingers in pretty much everything. DNS, cloud, storage. They also in a way control the internet. If a site doesnt pull up google search it will be easily forgotten. Pretty much the entire SEO industry revolves around GSE",
