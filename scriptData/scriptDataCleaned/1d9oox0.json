  "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is seriously considering increasing its production fees for artificial intelligence leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) , according to a report by Morgan Stanley.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang apparently agrees with the notion.\n\n\n\n\"TSMC's wafer price is indeed too low,\" said Huang at a Computex investor luncheon in Taipei on Wednesday.\"I think TSMC's \\[service\\] price is too low,\" and that \"TSMC’s contribution to the world and the tech industry is under-presented by its financial results,\" he added.\"NVIDIA is TSMC’s key customer and accounts for 10% of TSMC’s 2024 revenue, we estimate,\" said Morgan Stanley analyst Charlie Chan and others in a note. \"We believe that if NVIDIA accepted price hikes, other key AI semi customers may follow.\"\n\n\"We think NVIDIA's management recognizes TSMC’s reliability, as it helps remove one of the largest risk factors – foundry production,\" Chan added.NVIDIA did not confirm the timing or amount of a wafer price increase.TSMC hiked its prices by 10% in 2022 and another 5% in 2023. Morgan Stanley believes TSMC could raise prices by another 5% for 2025, due to AI semi demand.\n\nOther major TSMC customers include Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Qualcomm (QCOM) and MediaTek (OTCPK:2454-TK).\"We believe TSMC will be a winner in AI semis in the long term,\" Chan noted. \"No matter where the growth is coming from – GPU or ASIC, cloud or edge AI chips – most, if not all, will likely be manufactured by TSMC's leading-edge foundry services.\"Morgan Stanley rates TSMC Overweight, as most analysts are very bullish on the stock. Its price is up 55% year to date.",
