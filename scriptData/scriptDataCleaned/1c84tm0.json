Eat apples , orange juice , water melon , ceaser salads with chicken and avocado , bacon and eggs sourdough toast with butter. Get up run push ups pull ups run run. Clean the house. Throw out old stuff. Become a minimalist and then reassess your portfolio. Break your mindset physically with running I promise you’ll get through it. Also drop any weed and alcohol addiction for 4-5 weeks. And drink black espresso over ice from Starbucks tell you learn to love it. Followed by more running. Love your life go get a hair cut tell your self you’re beautiful and stop jerking your dick. Plenty of hot chicks to look at well pushing weight at the gym. \nAlso get some whey protein some pre work out and creatine and start making some shakes with milk and bananas and frozen fruit kale and whatever else you want. Get some over the counter test boosters and take them sparingly or some ashwagandha pills to kick start your low t from too much jerking off. Give me 3 months of this and come back and tell me how you feel. You will be a beast. And won’t even care about financial losses. You will start again and set goals and completely have a new mindset.",

They make so much money and have such a strong competitive edge that I personally don’t think there is any value of them that would be considered too high by itself. \n\nWith that being said, I like to make money and also like to eliminate risk when I’m up. I took profits when it was close to $900 and the market was only partially fucking with this stock and decided to wait to re-enter. BTW the stock ran to like $935 after I sold but….it was the right move to take in hindsight.\n\nThis price action is fugazi. Even the articles have nothing to do or explain why it dropped 10% today. And lest we forget every seller needs a buyer so someone owns all of these shares sold today. I got in CB around $790 and guilty of trying to catch the falling knife. Every movement up was met by heavy resistance and downward pressure further down each rung.\n\nAgain, there is no fair reason why NVDA dropped 10% today and SMCI dropped 20% and ARM is down 30% the last few days and they have nothing to do with each other from a company perspective. This is the market taking advantage of some runway and using it to make more money for them in the long run. So fuck em.\n\nI added around 120 shares today and feel very comfortable on the risk associated to it. Today was also opex and the options chain really fucked up any positive momentum back IMO. Tech is also facing a big selloff for some reason. AI isn’t dead, and NVDA will still be on a massive trajectory regardless of AI products and services.\n\nIt’s all bullshit and sentiment and I’ll be happy to sell at $900 right before a share split 🙏🏻🤞🏻🤪",
