Statistically, it makes sense to wait for the market to cool off. At least, for me. That's why they say \"inverse WSB\".\n\nI have 1 share of RKLB, tho :) It's sad that it shows +20% gains. But I don't get the appeal honestly. Another rocket company, so what? Recently I bought ASTS recently at $26-ish. Gonna DCA every month or so. I just like the idea so much.",

They're currently limited to launching small sats, but have a clear plan and timeline to have a larger capacity launch vehicle.\n\nMore successful launches means lower launch insurance costs. Lower launch insurance costs means better margins.\n\nThe biggest risk is that they will develop supply and the market won't provide enough demand.\n\nWSB will play with this stock on small runs but the real return for this company comes from a long term hold.",
