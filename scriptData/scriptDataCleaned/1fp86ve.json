They're currently limited to launching small sats, but have a clear plan and timeline to have a larger capacity launch vehicle.\n\nMore successful launches means lower launch insurance costs. Lower launch insurance costs means better margins.\n\nThe biggest risk is that they will develop supply and the market won't provide enough demand.\n\nWSB will play with this stock on small runs but the real return for this company comes from a long term hold.",
