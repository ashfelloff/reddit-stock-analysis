          "body": "Yes and no. Lower oil prices mean lower production cost, lower cost for transportation (that will actually make a hell of a differenece) and more money in the pockets of middle and lower class families. On the other hand, expecting low demand from the frailing chinese and overall slow world economy is moderately bad news. We should not forget however, that a significant part of the slowing oil demand stems from green technology and other endeavors to reduce fossile fuel dependency. Generally speaking low oil prices with low production are a bad sign and low oil prices with more production are a sign of ample supply for a hungry market. Currently we have the first. And together with other indicators (we all saw todays markets), this makes me tick up the likelyhood of .5 Fed rate cut. We don´t have a recession, but cutting rates, when one is here is to late. And I don´t buy the nonsense about \"it will spook the market.\" That comes out of the same bearish corner, which always drums up fear.",
