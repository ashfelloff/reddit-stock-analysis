More than likely that sensor will go off before there is a true pressure drop, or that sensor will go off if it has some sort of technical issue etc. More than likely you’re not losing pressure out of no where without warning, the pilots are just getting a reading that the pressure sensors aren’t good to go, or it isn’t at the proper pressure(most common) or when you initially take off it’ll read if the aircraft isn’t pressurizing at all",
