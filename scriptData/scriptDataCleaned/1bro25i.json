The result is overall pretty affordable pharmaceuticals. \n\nIt’s all such basic common sense stuff that any person would apply to themselves if they had the time and ability to figure this out. Drug A is effective and generic and cheap, Drug B RTX costs 10x as much and is just as effective as Drug A, so why the fuck would I buy that?",

This is due to corporate lobbying and the idea that it will stifle innovation and cut funds for R&D, which is of course true in part, but used as a crutch to protect their ability to price gouge. \n\nAll in all though in think anyone who invests in pharma companies knows that even with the USA market they’re not as profitable as Internet commentators will have you believe. Profits mostly come from a few winners. The blockbuster drugs usually last about 10 years (20 year patent minus ~10 years of trials). It’s true that drug development and trials are extremely expensive. \n\nFor example you can see how we’re in desperate need of new antibiotics but there’s a lull of new developments because it’s not that profitable of an endeavor.

This has nothing to do with safety or effectiveness, it is a gimmick to maximize revenue.
