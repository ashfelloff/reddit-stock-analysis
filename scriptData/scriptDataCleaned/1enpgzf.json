There's countless examples of stocks being beaten down to nothing and then suddenly turning around and climbing to new ATH. This is how bottom feeding, big money capitalizes on retail. By psyching the everyday investor into selling at the bottom, then scooping in and buying the stock which sends it on a run. Look at GE, another big name blue chip type stock. There's hundreds of stocks that go through this cycle. It's what Wallstreet does.",

My personal example being PLTR going from $22 because BoJ sneezed to whatever the hell it's going to open at today. Unless you wheel INTC or played it on the downside last week you're still not capturing any of the volatility the market by buying it now.",
