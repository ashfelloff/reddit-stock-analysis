  "selftext": "I've been in the stock market for a few years now, made some modest profits and some embarassing losses like a proper regard.\n\nI don't do options or day trading anymore because I've learned the hard(and only) way that im too stupid and not lucky enough to handle that. So when I got lucky I was stupid enough to ruin it.\n\nNow I just do long-term stocks, heavily invested in the tech market with some medical, crypto, oil, and private equity stocks on the side, and I've weathered multiple storms the last few years and always recovered.\n\nIts clear now that the last weeks we've been going through a hard bear run and I've been eating ass like I'm used to but, and this is my unreasearched fully biased opinion, i have a feeling that this one is different. It feels like the tides are turning and I wanna know if anyone shares the same sentiment, on that we might be enetering bear season. Please discuss as I like money and would like to keep mine.\n\nI've been enduring a lot of losses the last 2 weeks and I feel like I'm breaking down, but I know at least my grandma still loves me.\n\nEdit: Since this is picking up traction, i almost went through all of the comments and the consensus i would say is: 65% suck it up and hold you lil bitch. 30% is yep we're all doomed the end is not near its already happening. And the other 5% is like maybe yes maybe no who knows. \n\nSince I posted this like 30 minutes before the US economic data went live and everything went to shit, I am proudly soldiering through the losses riding the high of I told you so with a tear in my eye. The uninformed decision I am making is to look away and hold only with the fact that literally EVERYTHING is going down today, which is usually a sign that its a correction and not one market is being affected, just the whole world.",

It’s a double edged sword. It means the rate hikes worked. Inflation is down a lot and will probably come down more. We aren’t in a recession yet which is awesome, as normally big rate hikes cause a recession. (“But the market is down 3% back to May levels!1!1!!!” Yeah this isn’t a recession. UE is still really freaking low. GDP grew at 2.8% last quarter. You want a rate-fueled recession check out the late 1970s early 1980s.)\n\nBUT the landing may not be Sully on the Hudson. It may be more Denzel in Flight. I’m still impressed with Powell that we’ve gone this long without macro indicators turning against us. It was bound to happen sooner or later. But there’s still time to land this bird without casualties. Today an engine sputtered. Luckily we’re on an Airbus so we have 3 more.\n\nPowell was holding out in rate cuts until the very last minute. Really waiting for the game clock to wind down before launching a corner 3 to take the last shot of the game. And it’s a high percentage shot for a good spot shooter. So we dunno if it’s going in or not, but it might. We just know he took it down to the last second and now we wait and see how resilient the economy is. Maybe he waited too long. Maybe you want time to rebound and or foul if you miss. High risk either way. \n\nLet’s just not forget the fundamentals: that rate cuts are a GOOD thing in and of themselves. Rates are not supposed to be this high. They are high to bring down inflation. They come down when inflation comes down. High rates tend to cause recessions. We haven’t had one yet. So rate reduction doesn’t mean there will be a recession. It’s what you do when inflation comes down and you want to get in and get out before a recession begins.",

Experts are *still* saying, \"Trust me bro, this time it's different.\" \n\n...\n\nThe bears don't have to be right for you and your portfolio to get fucked. Warren Buffet didn't go into a cash position because he *knew* the market was going to go down. It's the uncertainty. We *are* in uncharted territory. Why would I shoulder the risk of predicting the direction of an unprecedented market?\n\n  \nPut another way, if you had 10,000 dollars and you wanted to invest it in a small business in your community, would you give your money to a business that wasn't sure it was going to be open in six months? \n\n  \nIf you're truly a fundamental, traditional value-investor, the answer to your problem isn't *sell it all right now*.

In 2008 I ran a lead gen business for realtors (generating 2000 leads/day) right before the housing crash.  Obviously both of those preceded 50%+ stock market crashes.  Everything today, including the people telling you to sack up, reminds me of the time right before the huge corrections.  Nowadays I have a nice eight figure net worth.  ONLY 7% is in US consumer stocks.  Another 8% is commodities (mostly gold).  About 1% is crypto and about 2% in intl stocks.  The rest is in a combination of cash, short term bonds and hard money loans backed by low LTV real estate.  I’m storing my nuts for winter with the idea to invest heavily in stocks AFTER the major correction.\n\nFor reference, the last time stocks seriously crashed (2008 to 2009) I put about 90% of my net worth into index funds.  I didn’t nail the bottom perfectly, but I was close enough to make a great return when the new bull market started.\n\nI expect to get trolled plenty for my bearish sentiment, but to the trolls:  How old are you?
