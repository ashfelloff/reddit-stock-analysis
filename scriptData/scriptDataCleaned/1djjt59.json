If Amazon steals a big enough portion of their business, Walgreen could end up being a penny stock facing insolvency. \n\nAt the moment any positive earning development could skyrocket the stock of Walgreen. So short term puts are super dangerous. However the long term outlook is super bad. What is your opinion? Walgreens Earning call is close. \n\nShort: Buy puts on Walgreen for 2027 ",
