So in a way, a buyer is paying higher than at the money option because of the IV.\n\nIf one is super sure of the price direction [which in case of Nvidia is obviously bullish], it may serve well to go Pelosi and buy deep in the money, or at least at the money call option to capture the gain from delta in a favourable price movement of the stock.\n\nAn option trader, may subsidise the cost of purchase by selling a option on the wings. \n\nHigher delta for deep in the money or at the money long call option will more than offset any delta increase for the short call option at the wings.\n\n[Deep in the money call option serves basically as a very strong proxy of owning an actual stock with delta approaching 0.9, for a fraction of cost of owning actual stock].\n\nHere are few additional tips:\n\nBuyers of options in the long run generate negative alpha compared to sellers of options.\n\nLonger dated options tend to outperform shorter dursation options [for buyers].\n\nIn the money options tend to outperform out of the money options [for buyers].\n\nCalls tend to outperform Puts [for buyers].",

It just seems like NVDA is being priced as though the spending will continue to accelerate at these insane levels. It just seems unsustainable, or at least cyclical. In other words, is META really going to up spending from 40 billion to 60 billion? 80 billion? At what point will companies be forced to pause spending and then fall back to a regular upgrade cycle. \n\nMy shitty analogy - It's almost like iPhones. From \\~2008 to \\~2020, their sales would continue to climb at insane levels. But eventually, everyone that wants an iPhone has one (\\~1.5 billion users). And now they have to 'settle' for the regular consumer upgrade cycle. They can't keep adding 50 million new users every quarter.",

      "body": "Say company X says, \"We need to run AI in house/on-prem due to security concerns with leaking our data to ChatGPT/CoPilot.\"   They have 5-100k employees and want to run LLM locally because the cost to run it on the cloud is going to be too high.  (yeah Copilot enterprise costs as much as your whole MSFT stack - E3 lic is $30/mo, plus $30/mo to add copilot to that user).  \n\n\nIf you are going to do that, every off-the-shelf LLM is built on CUDA.   Every turn-key hardware solution to build up that system is NVDA (with Mellanox switching, smartest MA they did).\n\n\nCan you build a INTC or AMD AI based compute node with Broadcom switches and a software stack to convert those LLM's and train them up on your data in-house with your own devs?   Yes, you can, do you think those devs are cheap (they don't have a problem finding a job)?   Do you think that conversion of the LLM is cheap?   How long do you think it will take to spin that up versus your competitors buying NVDA product?\n\n\nOnly really huge corps are going to be able to go an AMD or INTC or (one of my favorites) Waffer Scale solution.  Huge corps will have the existing network infrastructure, and dev teams who could use that.   AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, META, AAPL... basically all of them can, but will they?  So far AMZN and MSFT are NVDA.   GOOG is still chasing their own gear, META is mixed.   AAPL will think different, but who knows what that means for the heavy lift. \n\n\nAnd I don't mean edge AI that just feeds the product to the consumer  on their phone chip, that AI is pre-trained and limited scope.   All the producers will need some added logic to \"play\" the limited AI at the edge.   That's not what is making it happen, just making it smoother.\n\n\nNo, NVDA has it.   5yrs from now, it's theirs to lose the future.   Is it priced in already, fuck if I know, PE's off the charts...but It's not the dumbest play I've seen.",
