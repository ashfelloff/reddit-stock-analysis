      "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nr/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.\n\nPolitics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.\n\nStill, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Iran didn't significantly hit a single military target. Iranian rockets were mostly intercepted and those that weren't didn't hit anything important. A ballistic missile will always do some damage, the debris from the interception is still massive - but a single drone from Hizbollah has done substantially more damage than the entire ballistic arsenal Iran shot at Israel.\n\n>Israeli strike on Iran was a bit meh.

Israel sent 100 planes into Iranian airspace, bombing dozens of targets in Teheran, which is in the middle of the country - and every single one of these planes returned.\n\nThe fact is that Iran was able to intercept drones and rockets that was always meant to be intercepted.",

I'll let other people decide who is right/wrong.\n\n**Ukraine** \\- Russia is going to \"win\" unless Putin dies in the next 6-12 months. Winning in this case means getting part of Ukraine via land swaps at an astronomical cost of lives, money and future. Russia is playing the old WW2 Japan tactic of hoping to sue for peace to lock in gains. If Trump is elected, this peace and land swap deal will happen quicker. Under Harris it will just be delayed a year or two until people tire of funding Ukraine's losing battle (simply due to running out of soldiers). Either way, *without the EU taking a direct role*, there is unlikely a winning solution for Ukraine other than to give up land. Mind you this sucks as Russia is a shit hole and is simply competing with NK for second worst government, but the reality is that the lack of US international leadership going back a decade, effectively greenlit Russia's expansion. There won't be a WWIII over this -- simply Ukraine gives up more territory just like they had to in 2014. At least it nearly bankrupt Russia this go around.\n\nThe only up-shot is that Kaliningrad will likely attempt independence.\n\n**China** \\- Taiwan is a red herring. There is no real economic advantage for China and the US to go into a direct conflict. China would rather use Taiwan (but continue assert their ownership) as ruse to focus on neo-colonialism in Africa and other parts of SE Asia. Too much money to be lost in a conflict. No one wants to lose their cheap Harbor Freight tools and Gen-Z can't get cut off from their Temu. It is just saber rattling and localized South China sea posturing. Neither candidate has any real differentiation here.\n\n**Israel/Hamas/Hezbollah** \\- Trump wins, Iran sanctions get reimplemented and Hezbollah starts losing their ability to fund terror in Lebanon and Palestine. He would still be unable to do anything meaningful with Palestine who will likely get the short end of the stick (he doesn't care about Palestine anyhow). Harris wins and Hamas continues to get Iranian funding. Israel gets into a broader war in the region and strains international relations (who are more focused on Palestine rights than Iran/Hamas funding). Her party has no solution as they are at odds with themselves.\n\nBut short of it is that neither candidate winning will lead to WW3.

In the end, the next guy(s) will be busy solidifying their position in the Kremlin and less about managing a difficult war.\n\nRussia by all accounts has lost more than 500k people. Granted it is hard to know for sure given how much they rely on private forces. To be brutally honest, half the world doesn't seem to care how many people died there. Even Oxfam stumbles over themselves to dismiss deaths in Ukraine.\n\nOne of the key points of the Obama administration (trying not to make this political, but just stating) was to remove the US from its \"International Overlord\" position (to put it negatively) or \"International Peace Keeper\" to put it positively. His strategy was to push this responsibility to the broader global leadership (e.g. UN and EU). Unfortunately this opened up a window for Putin to test the waters with Crimea. And despite it being a clear invasion and even shooting down a civilian airliner, Russia escaped with just minor sanctions. Obama even admitted it was a mistake as the vacuum didn't get filled. And don't get me wrong, yes the US causes problems with its meddling, but in this case Putin knew he could get away with expansion with little consequence. Granted he was surprised that the international community pushed back the second time which resulted in the grindy war he has now.\n\nI pick on Russia although I try not to pick on the Russian people.

Russia's currency is super weak right now and they are forced to make friends with China. This asymmetric relationship means that China can provide currency swaps that are collateral backed in increasing quantities. Even if Russian wins, China can cause a liquidity crunch in Russia at anytime in exchange for control and power, for generations to come. Putin has not only ruined the current productive output of current Russian generation, he will be selling Russia's children and grandchildren to China just to come out neutral on his war. Each day that it continues sweeps larger and larger ownership into China's hands.",

This opens the door for them to gain combat experience/ readiness and collect data for them to possibly open a front with SK in coming years. This also builds a stronger  military relationship between Russia and North Korea allowing them to support each other in war time. Which Ukraine cannot win through war of an attrition which has become evident after 3 years as the front lines are collapsing now. If Russia makes large swaths of territorial gains, this paves the way for other NATO countries to get involved directly to use Ukraine as a buffer as an attempt to prevent a possible spill over. Hence we see the front running of mercenary groups from all over the world fighting the front lines since the invasion began.  \n\nRussia is using Iran and its proxies to attack U.S interest in the Middle East creating another  proxy war because of the U.S involvement in Ukraine  and will support Iran as it is in their best interest to keep their influence strong..Russia will not let Iran fall. Attacking Irans energy and nuclear infrastructure will draw mobilization from Iran and will likely cause them to attack energy supplies in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia , pinching the straight of Hormuz) further destabilizing the region and driving up global oil prices.  Iran and its proxies are resilient and without U.S boots to assist , Israel will not achieve any reasonable victory.",
