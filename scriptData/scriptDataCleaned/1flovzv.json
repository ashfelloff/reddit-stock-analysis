  "score": 115,
  "selftext": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has just granted [approval](https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/ise/2024/34-101128.pdf) for the listing and trading of options on BlackRock's [spot Bitcoin ETF](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/guides/spot-bitcoin-etf), the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT).\n\nThe approved options on the iShares Bitcoin Trust will be physically settled, meaning that when the option is exercised, Bitcoin will be delivered to fulfill the contract. These American-style options can be exercised at any time before the expiration date, providing flexibility for traders. According to the SEC, the listing will follow the same rules as options on other exchange-traded funds (ETFs), including position limits and margin requirements.",

              "body": "It's not easy to get that info on my broker (gains from a specific ticker), but I did it mixing its reporting tools and some manual filtering. \n\nAssuming I made no mistake: During different trades since January (I didn't buy all at once, I started small and then increased by selling puts and allowing assignation, and sometimes just buying) I invested a total of 17k and got 4.6k out of the premiums, not considering the appreciation of the stock, and considering sells of puts and calls as well as the buys to close early. Considering appreciation of BTCC.B I have an extra 1k\n\nWhat I do is closer to wheeling and has evolved during the year as I have learned. My strategy today is something along these lines: I enter the position by selling puts with real chance of getting assigned, or just buy the stock if I feel it's already a good deal. I use the stock to sell CCs at strike prices I'd be happy to sell. I sell some \"naked\" puts (they're covered by me having VFV or VGRO ready to sell if needed), the strike depends on my interest in the risk to get more shares \n\nI hope that explanation helps\n\nBasically the 1k is what I got from holding, and the 4.6 is the extra I got by selling options",
