Garbage company. $WMT does everything $CVS does for cheaper (seems to be a theme, doesn't it?)\n\nThis turd has been flirting with the $52 level since they bombed earnings in May.\n\nLast time CVS was at $52 level was 2013, 2019, and 2020. If this goes below $52, it will be a straight shot to $44 by Friday.\n\nThis is a pig and will be below $45 by Friday.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p5lleyxyn4zd1.png?width=2978&format=png&auto=webp&s=78687bdb05e25ce194e1333db0f3bd2829adef8a\n\n",

              "body": "Many/most insurance plans don't allow \"maintenance medication\" to be filled any other way without a major penalty(basically they pay $50, you pay $500 type penalty).\n\nThey run out of medications, cancel scripts on a whim, &take FOREVER to fill scripts(my doc sends electronically, it takes 24-72h to get through processing, then another 48-72h to fill, then they mail it, the whole thing takes around 7-14days).\n\nBecause of the levels of bureaucracy in a company that size, everyone you speak to will tell you something different, some agents are great, some are awful. I went 28mos in a row with a mistake/issue EVERY MONTH. Those 28mos I received 23mos of medications to their delays and ineptitude....and that was WITH daily calls, involvement of higher/highest levels of customer service. Were talking about 20+hrs on the phone each month.\n\nOne time they were out of my medications, instead of saying anything, they just canceled the script. When we called, they stated the doctor canceled it. That went round & round before we got to the bottom of it. My doc wrote FIVE scripts for the same prescription.\n\nAnother time they were out of the generic, with no backorder date. So we requested an exception for brand name(which would also cost us 50%, but i need my medication, right?) or a local fill(which costs us 80 or 90%), well, the company approved it(took a week for caremark to send the request-which was only done when we called the company & asked when they would approve it...they stated they hadn't gotten it, then THEY called CM to get it & approve the request), then caremark delayed, delayed, delayed, &sent the generic 5-1/2w later....I was without necessary medications for 4-1/2wks, I was using a walker, falling several times a day, &couldn't even brush my hair(among other things).\n\nWhen I am paying 100%(deductible period), theyre usually a bit better, once the deductible is reached th3y get worse, once I reach my out of pocket max, forget it, the games will reach fever pitch.\n\nAdditionally, they require prior authorization for many medications. These are only good for a set amount of time(1-12mos), the time they last can vary-I guess maybe my MS might go away, so this must be re-evaluated regularly-lol. This time a PA might last 6mos, but the next time only 1mos. However they do not provide you with these details, you find out when they don't send your script, you call, are routed through multiple layers of customer service to discover the problem....now another 3-4-7d to process that. Plus my docs office charges $25 everytime one needs to be submitted(this is more an annoyance than anything, but it definitely adds to the \"layers\")\n\nThen there's the \"you can't have it\" list. An example are lidocaine patches. I can only have those if I have shingles. Doesn't matter that they improve my quality of life, nope, only for shingles. It's the same with Zofran. I take it because I have issues swallowing, but its a nausea medication...so unless I'm pregnant, or have a flu, I cannot have it. That one I have chosen to pay out of pocket at Costco so I can continue to eat & drink(vs gtube).\n\nThen there's the \"that's not therapeutic\"...I am on cymbalta(antidepressant)to help with pain, but if I take it daily, then I cannot sleep. So I take it every other day. If my doc writes the script for 15/mo, they will not fill it because its not \"therapeutic,\" so my doc has to write for 30, tell me to just write it every other day.\n\nWe have complained to the company that provides our insurance, they call Caremark who tries to blame me, I provide the company with proof that it is not me, Caremark assigned us a care coordinator who was more worthless than just about any agent we had spoken with....she would not return calls for WEEKS, she was the one that played games with the out of stock medication until they received the generic back in stock. It's a joke.\n\nMy doctors hate dealing with them, we hate them even more, but I have no choice. It's so bad that my husband had talked about changing jobs just to get away from them.\n\nI have begun rationing & skipping doses of medications...its better to go one day/wk without medications...better to take 2doses per day instead of 3...than to be out for weeks at a time. This has absolutely affected both my health & quality of life(I am on many medications to treat the symptoms of MS, so things to control spasticity, shaking/tremors, pain, migraines, nerve function, bladder function, fatigue, heart, etc)\n\nThe worst part of all of this, i have PPMS(primary progressive, the worst type), at 15y, only 15% can still walk. At 20y, 5%. I am at 17y & am still mobile, but I truly feel that it is starting to slip away & I 100% believe CM is playing a MAJOR part in all of that. IF that were to happen, I will file a lawsuit.\n\nI am not alone in any of this. Every person I know that has a chronic condition has a similar experience. Many folks talk about a class action suit. In the end, I really just want them to do better!! I just want my medications so I can take care of myself & my family!!\n\nIt's CONSTANT!! There's much MUCH more, that's just a small taste.\n\nAs an aside, we pay nearly 2k/mo for family insurance coverage. It's rather sickening",
