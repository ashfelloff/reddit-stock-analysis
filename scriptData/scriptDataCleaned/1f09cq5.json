The first one would be that investors have it priced in so when it happens they all take their profits and sell which would cause the market to drop. The second reason would be that The fed is late on making the rate cuts so they push us into the beginning of a recession that now they have to make up for.  That's what I'm worried about here. They probably should have cut 25 basis points last meeting.",
