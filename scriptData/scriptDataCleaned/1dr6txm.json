  "score": 60,
  "selftext": "Alright, this post is a little on the more serious side. I'm pretty new to trading, and have been screwed more than once by pre market and opening gap ups/downs. What's the right way to approach the pre market movement, and the first 30 minutes of frenzy when the market opens? It often seems that when I expect the trend to follow, it reverses when things stabilise at 10am. But sometimes, the trend just follows, like NKE yesterday.",

Only get in if you can stomach the risk.  By this point a lot of the high speed traders are basically done with their day having blown through their margin or hitting their profit targets.\n\n10:30-12:00 - Confirmation or Retrace - 10am data comes in, if an overbought/oversold condition comes in, thereâ€™s usually a switch in direction as long as volume remains low. Key here is watching volume.\n\n12:00-2:00 - Steady support - Bond auctions finish up at 1ish.  Usually lower volume and supports the general market sentiment for the day.\n\n2:00-3:00 - Retrace - Usually a short reversal to trim RSI or a pause for consolidation. Volume tends to be low.\n\n3:00-3:30 - False finish - Volatlity, high speed, day traders all start to step back in looking for deals.\n\n3:30-4:15 - Chaos to the finish line - Brokerage auto close options, and bets during earnings season kick in for the finish.  I say 4:15 as there are late close options like SPY and QQQ that provide material support and volatility until that time.\n\nOn data days, the direction is pretty much set if the data comes in as expected.  The issue is when data comes in too hot or too cool. Then all hell breaks loose.",

              "body": "PCE data was already priced in and climaxed with the released. I felt confident enough that the market was going to drop last Friday or have a weak move after the news. MU has been parabolic. Look at the weekly and monthly charts, it needed to cold down. Also current earnings is not the only thing that matter, it is the guidances too. NVDA was also overextended. I caught the recent bottom when I saw it kept dropping post-market. That made it oversold and I profited 10% in a single day from that (you also had the NVDA annual meeting after that). It takes a lot of thinking to understand and many times what we think we understand turn out to be wrong because we are missing pieces from the puzzle or misinterpreting things which can happen often. One thing I have really learned is to be patient and wait. One reason why I kept losing money is because I was rushing to be part of a trade thinking I will miss out. I would suggest to go to higher timeframes where things are more clear and less noises.",
