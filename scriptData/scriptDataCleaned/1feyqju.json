The FDA has already approved Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes treatment, but its use for weight loss is off-label. I think we need more data on long-term efficacy before we can conclude that it's similar to Ozempic.",

But the null hypothesis when two molecules have identical or nearly identical mechanisms of action is that they are likely to have similar clinical characteristics. It's the basis for modern rational drug design.",
