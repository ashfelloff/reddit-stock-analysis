His total amount owed at the end of the timeframe is 48% greater than his amount borrowed. I've never seen loan paperwork with \"total interest\" even listed, because it's not clear what it would even mean given how compounding works. However \"total amount owed\" is pretty indisputable.\n\n>Negative ghost rider. 10K total interest 16.85%. Not yearly. There is a financing charge as well (as with most personal loans). Total amount owed by the end of 60 months is 14,862 (it’s stated on the loan when you sign for it).",

ATH post halving was reached 365 - 548 days post halving. The other part is the ETFs that r being issued. Halving will reduce the amount of new BTC being created from 6.25 to 3.125 every 10 minutes. Since there is less new supply to go around price goes up, & lots of ppl holding BTC know they r not selling until 100K/ 200K/ 500K price, so price will simply go up, at least that's what's expected. Haven't updated my chart below, but will once halving takes place.
