  "title": "Why i think the market is going to crash after the election no matter who wins.",
  "score": 4328,
  "selftext": "I have this theory that because the election is so fucked up, everyone is just holding out to see what shakes out, thinking that someone else will ( depending on who wins) make good investments that they can then base their own math on, IE they expect someone to make the first move.\n\nHowever, i think no one actually has anything good to invest it, and it will reveal itself immediately the winner is called. Thus i think there will be a whole market crash a couple hours after election night.\n\nCan someone who is good with logic check this thinking through before i yolo my savings?\n\nEDIT:\nQuite a few people have come with different opinions on this and it was suggested i just go with vibes instead. I have now bought a vibrator and put it in my ass, but it hasn't helped me make a decision yet. How long do i have to wait?",

Buffet sure seems to think there aren't a lot of good deals around because he keeps selling stock and increasing cash piles.   There's a few ways to look at that, the one that makes the most sense is that he doesn't believe there's a lot of good value in the market right now.  He keeps selling and waiting for an opportunity that looks good, but isn't finding it right now.   Another possibility is that he believes the market will crash and give him a discount.  While similar to the first, these aren't quite the same and timing the market isn't his style.  Another possibility is that he sees the unsustainable spending path the US is on and anticipates that we'll have to raise capital gains in the near future, and he anticipates that could be a significant possibility following the election.   This is much easier to predict than predicting the market and is more likely.   \n\nPersonally I think it's a mix of the first and third possibility I've outlined.",

Don't emulate their tangible actions, emulate their intangible mode of thinking; I expect they'd be the first to recommend the same.\n\nWhen I look at a potential investment, the advice I take from Buffett (and his mentor Graham) is to look at their debt, balance sheet, and their position/relationship with competition within their industry.

American military might is the sole reason we have a booming economy and the world is as rich as it is.  For most of human history, there were constant major power battles and free trade wasn't possible.  Now that's relatively rare and if you do anything to interfere with economic activity the US sails a few warships near your waters to remind you there are rules you need to follow.",

Because he said himself he wants to usurp the federal reserve board of governors and the chairman himself when it comes to the federal funds rate. He thinks that the PUSA knows better than life-long economists and Nobel laureates. Anyone with half a brain knows this will unleash holy hell on the economy.
