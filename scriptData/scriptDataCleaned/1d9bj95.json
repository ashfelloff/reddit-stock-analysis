  "selftext": "The DOJ and FTC will split responsibility for investigating the largest tech companies involved in developing artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are nearing an agreement to divvy up investigations of potential anticompetitive conduct by some of the world’s largest technology companies in the artificial intelligence industry, according to three people with knowledge of the negotiations.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, the DOJ is poised to investigate Nvidia and its leading position in supplying the high-end semiconductors underpinning AI computing, while the FTC is set to probe whether Microsoft, and its partner OpenAI, have unfair advantages with the rapidly evolving technology, particularly around the technology used for large language models.\n\nThe three companies have been leaders in AI, with the technology powering Nvidia today to a $3 trillion market value, second only to Microsoft.\n\nThe deal has been negotiated for nearly a year. And while leaders of both agencies have expressed urgency in ensuring that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence technology is not dominated by existing tech giants, until an agreement is finalized, there was very little investigative work they could do.\n\nThe agreement is not yet final, but could be completed as soon as this week.\n\nSpokespeople for the DOJ, FTC, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n",

          "body": "My guess is that Nvidia isn't allowing competitors the use of CUDA, which is a platform block, and could be considered an exploit. It's also true that being a monopoly doesn't make you subject to anti trust, but being a monopoly that price gouges as much as Nvidia does.\n\nThe Microsoft and OpenAi arguments are weaker IMO. It would probably mainly stem from the use of the Copilot in Windows devices, which is similar to how older Windows devices were shipped with explorer and often blocked other web browsers. Microsoft can get around that by simply allowing people to choose a different Ai than GPT/Copilot to run, as most would pick GPT in that case over something like Gemini.",
