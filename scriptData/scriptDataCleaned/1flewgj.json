When Saturn V was 1.5 years into its flight testing, it was also on its 5th flight (Apollo 10), except that one was a complete rehearsal of the actual moon landing! Their self-described cash cow, Starlink, has already captured all the market it could in the only country where paying $120/mo for internet is acceptable, and ASTS will start eating its lunch worldwide in a few months.\n\nMeanwhile, RocketLab's CEO is an actual engineer and prioritizes operational efficiency. Their customers are happy, and they keep getting more of them. The space systems division has excellent margins and grows rapidly. RKLB has been proven to deliver, and I'm willing to bet Neutron will be operational before Starship has any chance to land on the Moon. So yeah, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀",

Unlikely.\n\nWanna invest in the next APPL or MSFT before they blew up, but for Space?

I recommend those to do their DD before buying in and choose the companies with the highest chance to succeed, and not buy based on hype or because the stock was cheaper through market cap and you think that means you'll earn more on a 100x or something.\n\nAnyway, don't really frequent here, but wanted to chip in with my thoughts. 100% of a portfolio is wild, but if he holds it for the long haul, will probably never work a day in his life.",
