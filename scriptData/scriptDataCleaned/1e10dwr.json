I went big on NVDA in 2020 because AI and i knew how good their cards are. didn't sell when up 144%, but sold in the 2022 crash to derisk and was too greedy to get back in at $140 (before split), didn't start getting back in until $400. \n\nI did some quick math and realize that mistake cost me earlier retirement. It has taken me a long time to get over it. Now, leaving money on the table from selling for profit doesn't bother me anymore. \n\nwoulda, coulda, shoulda will kill you.",
