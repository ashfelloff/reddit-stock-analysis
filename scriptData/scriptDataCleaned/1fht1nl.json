  "selftext": "Firstly, about JP Morgan.\n\nThis is a bank we all know, some hate them some love them. However, I am just here for the money.\n\nFrom the 2008 crisis to the effect of COVID and the current bearish thesis of Jamie Dimon. I believe he knows something. \n\nBut in that case why did he not shorten JP Morgan investment strategy? Jp Morgan bank has high leverage, long term investments, and with the capital requirement from the government it is logical to see the price fall.\n\nRate cut is generally not beneficial for banks. Banks make money from the difference of cost and profit trading from its users and lower rate means lower fee.\n\nMy idea is Jamie believes the market is going down either way and all he can do is diversified investments, lay off but the decline in the short-term is inevitable.\n\nPart 2 about Victoria Secret\n\nThis one is easier to understand.\n\n1/ change in management bullish\n2/ rate cut bullish \n3/ CPI stable bullish\n4/ Partnership with other brands bullish\n5/ restructuring business equal bullish.\n\nPositions 500 Victoria secret calls 20/09/2024.\n                  150 JP Morgan puts 20/09/2024.\n\n\n\n",
