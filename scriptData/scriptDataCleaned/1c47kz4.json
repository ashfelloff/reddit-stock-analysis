They just announced yesterday that they are recalling in 5 more countries so I’m expecting it to continue the trend.\n\nTINFA - do what you want, just thought I’d give you guys a heads up into Monday. I’m a degenerate and I don’t know much but making kids sick and getting your shit recalled doesn’t sound like calls.\n\nSouth Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity\nReuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00\nApril 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.\n\nThe affected batches were sold in South Africa, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria, the statement added.\n\nThe recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday, which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.\n\nKenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup, which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.\n\nKenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nHigh levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nEDIT: Up in premarket with the rest of the market (sure why not) and SEC insider report. Going to hold on till the 19th, still don’t see this going anywhere but I guess we’ll find out.",
