The financial crisis happened because:\n\n1. a large loss in asset valuation\n\n2. high leverage and derivative positions multiplied this loss into something way bigger\n\n3. every major bank in the country was holding these assets on its balance sheet\n\n4. banking system instability starts mass panic / run\n\nNVIDIA stops at number 1.  Maybe it gets to 2 and some hedge funds go under, which doesn't matter to the wider economy.  But no major bank has a balance sheet riding on this because equity is always assumed risky.  The reason that the financial crisis in 2008 could get to step 3 was that assets that were considered extremely safe turned out not to be.",

Indexes are leveraged and collateralized and held as retirement assets simply because they are measurements of wider stability so a large drop would impact more than just the 1 asset evaluation.\n\nBut if that sounds doom and gloom, think about what could actually cause a crash like that and why its so unlikely to happen.  Nvidia isn't going to zero.  Anecdotally speaking, even if they had fatal design flaws that could kill customers and began systematically assassinating whistle blowers while the CEO was being scolded like a toddler by Congress the company wouldn't crash enough to bring down the market like that.  Not that this kind of ridiculous scenario would ever happen - but if it did I have a feeling even that silly situation wouldn't bring a company down overnight to such a degree that the whole market wouldn't have time protect itself.\n\nI agree with you, if they do something moronic and get caught there are plenty of Hwangs out there doing regarded things with their hedge funds who will go broke.  The financial sector itself won't.",

Meaning statistics-only based, \"Deep Learning\" based,  \"neural\" based *pseudo*-AI.\n\nLLMs basically generate phrase mash-ups based on co-occurrence statistics and pattern-matching of prior texts or data.  The results are mediocre, but impress many people now who think the computer is reasoning.  It does no logical reasoning or inference, can reach no conclusions, and has no \"ontology\" or models of the real world.  It's text-processing.   If a few big downstream business customers find out that the output is unreliable (unexplained) mediocre junk, they will lose faith.  (The problem is not with AI, but only with this kind of statistical *pseudo*-AI.)  ***If*** they lose faith in LLMs, ***then*** I think NVDA stock will plummet almost back to its \"games & mining & NFTs\" valuation.\n\nAs far as I know, NVDA's GPU chips *currently* contribute little to knowledge and logical-reasoning based AI.\n\nThis is not to say that a generator of mediocrity has no value.  For many business and government purposes, mediocre crap is \"good enough\".   But I doubt if that would sustain NVDA's spectacular stock price.",

              "body": "We are very early in the development of AI. Nvidia has experienced great returns because they've found a use for GPU's in AI. But we are at the same stage with AI that we were with the internet prior to the internet crash in 99/2000. This bubble is unsustainable and the timeline is longer than people are expecting.\n\nWill there be a trillion dollar market for chips to serve the AI market. Undoubtedly there will be. Will it be Nvidia chips they use for it? I'm going to bet there will be better chips available for it when the time comes. Maybe they'll be from Nvidia, maybe they won't.\n\nJust because Nvidia has shown growth via this unbelievably great new tech, doesn't ensure they won't be left behind as the tech matures. Intel already has chips that offer lower prices and better performance per watt. Once their new fabs are up and running at speed and they can deliver those and whatever else they have in development, the marketplace won't be so Nvidia biased.\n\nI'm looking at Nvidia now the same way I saw Netscape back in the day. They're driving the early market development. Let me know how Nvidia fares when the chip wars really start to gain traction and they have more competition in the space. Their current price has far more future profits built in than they could ever hope to generate. One thing that won't hold back developers in the AI space is legacy code and attachment to old tech. They can pivot and adapt to new hardware far faster than in the past. With chip fabs opened up to whomever wants to pay to build them. There's going to be a lot of competitors with a lot of new ideas.\n\nFor every [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) and Apple that survived the dot com crash there was a:\n\n[Webvan.com](http://Webvan.com) - We're doing grocery deliveries now, why did this fail?\n\n[Kosmo.com](http://Kosmo.com) - An early form of Uber deliveries. We can see that this is viable now, why not then?\n\n[Geocities.com](http://Geocities.com) - Yeah, I guess we just weren't ready for social media back then.\n\nAnd that's just scratching the surface of all the too big to fail, failures.\n\nShoot, just look at how Cisco fell from grace after once being the most valuable company in the world overtaking Microsoft at a time when that would have been considered impossible. Seeing Nvidia doing it now makes me more cautious than bullish for the shorter term.",
