  "score": 1004,
  "selftext": "A technical issue at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday caused the A-class shares of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway to appear to be down nearly 100%.\n\nTrading was halted in those shares, as well as in Barrick Gold and Nuscale Power, which had also seen dramatic falls.\n\nThe NYSE said in a 10:11 a.m. ET update that it was investigating a technical issue related to the limit up and limit down bands, which are mechanisms to halt stocks for excessive volatility.\n\nThere were less than 4,000 recorded trades on the day for Berkshire’s A-class shares when trading was halted. Trading continued in the B-class shares, which were down less than 1% in morning trading.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/nyse-technical-issue-impacting-some-stock-prices-incorrectly-showing-berkshire-hathaway-down-99percent.html",

Among the charges included was the use of spoofing algorithms; just prior to the flash crash, he placed orders for thousands of E-mini S&P 500 stock index futures contracts which he planned on canceling later. These orders amounting to about \"$200 million worth of bets that the market would fall\" were \"replaced or modified 19,000 times\" before they were canceled. Spoofing, layering, and front running are now banned\n\nThe Flash Crash of 2010 was a trillion dollar flash crash.\n\n> The May 6, 2010, flash crash, also known as the crash of 2:45 or simply the flash crash, was a United States trillion-dollar flash crash (a type of stock market crash) which started at 2:32 p.m. EDT and lasted for approximately 36 minutes\n\n\nEDIT: now fixed, issue with pricing bands\n\n> The NYSE said that the problems stemmed from the price-bands published by the Consolidated Tape Association, the organization used by major exchanges to jointly provide real-time stock quotes. The NYSE said at roughly 11:45 a.m. ET that the issues had been resolved and trading was back to normal.\n\n> The CTA said that there was an issue with limit up and limit down price bands, a mechanism meant to combat market volatility, between 9:30 a.m. and 10:27 a.m. ET. The issue may have been caused by a new software release, and the organization will revert back to the prior software program in its primary data center for Tuesday’s trading session, the CTA said.\n\n> There were 49 stocks affected by the issue, according to the CTA. Other notable stocks involved include Chipotle Mexican Grill and Bank of Montreal",
