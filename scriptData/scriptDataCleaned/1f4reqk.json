I have 2 things to say to this knowing you will see this comment too:\n\n1. karma is for poor internet weebs who jerk off in expensive sex toys instead of expensive women\n2. lol. l. o. L. how much fucking money did you lose today that youd waste your time doing this? bears who were smart enough to take their L at a -50% loss are still talking shit. the silent downvoting is more a reflection of how humiliated you must feel right now losing money in such a stupid and boring way. I agree. you should feel that way. especially if you were one of those cocksucking assholes trying to pressure everyone into selling and buying puts earlier. if we had listened to you, we'd all feel like you do right now. asshole.\n\nedit: >!forgot to say ber r fuck lol get rekt you whores !<",
