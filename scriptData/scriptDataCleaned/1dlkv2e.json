  "title": "Why F (Ford) Stock is in my Portfolio and Where I See Potential Growth",
  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "I've been holding F stock over the last few years and despite a lot of negative sentiment I see about this stock, I feel that it's value is under recognized as a key player in the automotive space.\n\n**Why Do I Like F?**\n\n1. The biggest reason I am interested in Ford is FORD PRO. For those who do not know, Ford Pro is their commercial sales and software business.  Think of it as a fleet management software company working inside of Ford, coupled with auto sales, financing, vehicle servicing, and telematics. It helps commercial Ford customers like construction or delivery companies manage the upkeep and tracking of their entire commercial vehicle fleet, ensuring that the vehicles are serviced, being fuel/energy efficient, and optimized.\n2. [The USPS recently announced their purchase of over 9,000 E-transit vans](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/24/first-quarter-2024-financial-results.html), and [Ecolab expanded their electric fleet with Ford as well.](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/01/30/ecolab-accelerates-north-american-fleet-electrification-with-for.html)\n3. **Ford PRO alone saw revenues of $18 Billion in Q1 of 2024, which is up 36% YOY with a nearly 17% EBIT margin at $3B**.\n4. Despite the huge growth in **Ford PRO revenue, F's total market cap is only $47.27B. Part of my investment thesis for F stock is that Ford PRO could eventually be a $30-$40B business on its own.**\n5. **Ford's EV segment lost money in Q1 ($1.3 billion)due to costs and slowing demand, so I believe they will scale back a bit while still being a player.** In the US, they are second only to TSLA when it comes to EV sales and it's important that they continue to be number two.\n6. **Their Ford Blue segment, or non-commercial ICE and Hybrid segment had slightly lower revenues due to production slow downs but still had $21B in revenue with a EBIT of $900M.**\n7. Ford has the diversification of ICE, Hybrid, and EV models which continues to be a differentiator. In May 2024, Ford saw an increase of 64.7% YOY in EV sales, and a 64.5% YOY increase in hybrid sales. \n8. [**Full Year 2024, Ford is tracking to do $10-12B EBIT guidance range.**](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/04/24/first-quarter-2024-financial-results.html)\n9. As interest rates decrease, which most economists predict they will in the latter half of 2024, auto sales should see a bit less pressure.\n\nWhen compared to TSLA with a market cap of $573.46B and a P/E ratio of 46, I find that F is an incredibly good value at a market cap of just $47.27B and a P/E ratio of 12.\n\nIt's notable that Ford's Q1 net income was actually higher than Tesla's at $1.13B for TSLA and $1.3B for Ford.\n\nThis makes me feel even more confident that Ford is underestimated.\n\n**LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST:**\n\nF pays an annual dividend of $0.60 per share, which at the current price of $11.84, this presents an attractive yield of 5.07%.\n\nGiven all the growth, diversity in the business, and huge potential of the Ford PRO segment - this stock is undervalued and I think it's a good buy going into their earnings which will be announced next month on July 24, 2024.\n\nThese opinions are my own and this is not financial advice.  Please do your own due diligence and would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you for reading!\n\n",
