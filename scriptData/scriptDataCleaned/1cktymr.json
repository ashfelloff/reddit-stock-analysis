It also doesn't reflect real execution in the market which is extremely important with scalping/day trading. That's why I always tell people who insist on trading that they start with a small account and make relatively small trades. If they can become consistently profitable over months to years then they can slowly ramp up their trade size.",

Instead of trying to go for getting a huge 10-20k gain on your screen, treating it like a day-trading job that you can atleast make 150-200$ a day for little effort that’s what demo trading should be for. \n\nI’m 15, used it through my grandparents and all I’ve used is just a MACD chart with RSI setup and just paid attention to both charts and buy in and sell when I reach a profit target. If I want to make 100$ a day within 10-15 minutes of work so I can enjoy the rest of the day as a teenager out of school then I take a profit and ignore the potential of getting a 300-400$ gain because I can just make that in the next couple of days \n\nI probably spent 2 months paper trading and started out with an account that I put aside 25k that I made from online reselling and that account within 2 years has grown to a little over 70,000$",
