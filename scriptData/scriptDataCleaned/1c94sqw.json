Probably close to $100B at least. \n\n\nI think Walmart and Oracle were part of the brokered deal years ago, but I doubt they will be involved. And I don’t think the FTC will want one of the large tech companies (Meta, Google, Microsoft) taking them over for antitrust reasons. \n\n\nI just don’t see a scenario where ByteDance abandons the US as a market for TikTok so a sale seems far more likely than a ban to me.
