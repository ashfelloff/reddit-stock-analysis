They basically just handed a big fat check to Rocket, Monarch, etc. They also paid a stupid amount of money for Mailchimp and I'd expect them to write that investment down if they haven't already (although it probably makes way more money than Credit Karma).\n\nDisclosure - I own INTU, though I'm *very* disappointed in it.",
