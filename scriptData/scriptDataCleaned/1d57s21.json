If I gave you 130k and said “this can only be spent on x” and you spent it on something else and then cooked the books to hide the spending on your reports that’s the crime.   \n\nNow this would be a big deal if you were an average joe with a 100k per year salary.   But if you were a billionaire - why the hell would you do that?   It’s incredibly dumb.  But still a crime. \n\nNo different than using campaign funds for a vacation instead of your campaign.  Lots of rich people do this too.   And they get charged for it.  \n\nYeah the dudes a billionaire but should that matter?   Martha Stewart was investigated for insider trading over like a 50k gain - she went to jail over the cover up.   Plenty of rich people shoplift.   Doesn’t mean we shouldn’t charge them for shoplifting because they are rich.   \n\nStealing is a big deal for normal people,  it just doesn’t feel like a big deal for a rich person because it’s so dumb and if the punishment is a fine that doesn’t take income into account the punishment is also dumb. \n\nSo should it be charged.  Yes.  It should,  for fairness of the system.   But at the same time it exposes how unfair the system is when going after the rich and powerful.",
