MU stock price normally peaks before EPS does and around 11-15 TTM P/E.  TTM PE is still negative right now so I doubt it’s a top but who knows.  \n\nPeople trying to get into the cycle earlier and out before the hammer drops may have caused a shift.  I haven’t even looked into revenue and margins to determine how much revenue they would need to achieve EPS that validates the stock price so what da fuk do I know anyways🤷‍♂️",
