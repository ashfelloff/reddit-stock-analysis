I do this relatively consistently with small amounts, and it’s so hard not to full port and pay off everything I have in a day. But I stay humble knowing that’s when shit would go south, and I simply don’t have the balls 😂",

I'm always so cautious with options and I think that's one reason I ain't making big gains honestly. It's so hard to predict the market, I would say though the market does follow the trend fairly well, timing your 0dtes is key, in an uptrend, just gotta get that sniper timing on the pullback but then I think like what if that pullback turns into a fuckin dump and it becomes a downtrend. 🤣\n\nI think a smart strategy is use like 100 dollars, if you guess right, take the 100 dollars back and use the gains as play money and if you double it just keep sending it all and doubling that shit, who knows you either win hard or lose hard but at least you won't feel bad.",
