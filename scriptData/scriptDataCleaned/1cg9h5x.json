The risks here are ‚Äúout of the money‚Äù (OTM) calls that can expire worthless and the premium that you pay that gets lost as ‚Äúdecay‚Äù. For these lotto plays, they are typically quick in and out unless you are deep ‚Äúin the money‚Äù (ITM) and you can let it ride out. Nonetheless you want to capture the gains + premiums at the peak which is typically before expiration. The longer you hold, the value naturally drops due to the premiums unless it continues to rise. Most brokers handle the underlying technicalities so you don‚Äôt end ‚Äúholding the bag‚Äù of exercised shares.",
