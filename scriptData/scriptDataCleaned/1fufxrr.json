He thinks that normal people think like they do. Fortunately most people don’t. Unfortunately the people that do are in the position they are in because  of their dearth of altruism and basic human decency. Also unfortunately they have a disproportionately large voice because of their resources and influence. Fortunately Elon is a dumbshit and is going to run “his” companies into the ground because he’s a delulu narcissist.",
