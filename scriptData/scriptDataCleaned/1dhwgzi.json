Countries are also aiming to protect their national culture and security in an AI-dominated world. […]”\n\n- “Nvidia’s sovereign AI initiatives are expected to bring in nearly $10 billion this year, up from zero last year. This is a significant boost to the company’s $26 billion in quarterly revenue, with almost half coming from major cloud-computing firms renting access to its chips.”\n\nAnd then there’s this regard with a quote I thought was funny,\n\n_”New York University Stern School of Business Professor Aswath Damodaran, known as Wall Street’s “Dean of Valuation,” believes Nvidia’s intrinsic value doesn’t justify its current price tag. However, he acknowledged the company’s achievements, stating, “If you are designing the perfect momentum company from scratch, Nvidia would be it.”_\n\nTLDR: Jensen said “I ain’t hear no bell” so therefore I’ll be buying more calls because ~~HPE keynote~~, ~~Dow inclusion~~, ~~XLK tech fund repositioning~~, ~~healthcare~~, ~~Ethernet~~, ~~robotics~~, sovereign AI — I don’t fuckin know, my attention span is limited, stonks go up",
