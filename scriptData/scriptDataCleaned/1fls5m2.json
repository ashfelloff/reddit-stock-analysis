Credit card companies only make money off that sick 28% interest rate the majority of people don’t pay off\n\n\nEdit*** apparently my experience and the people I know with the card definitely differed from the reality as I knew people that had gotten rejected with good credit but I guess there are a ton of reasons for their struggles. Copy and paste from an article last year on reuters .  Short version is too many unpaid balances, forced to accept too many applicants , diminished or no fees, all bills posting on the same day(first of the month), very little experience dealing with non wealthy individuals. Apologies for not having done enough research. \n\n“New credit card businesses typically lose money in their early years, in part because regulations require banks to set aside about 7% of projected sales to cover expected losses, said Warren Kornfeld, senior vice president at Moody’s Investors Service.\nGoldman was responsible for setting aside the provisions for credit losses instead of sharing them with Apple, according to the two sources familiar with the business.\nThe Apple card also posed an underwriting challenge. Goldman’s clients are typically wealthy individuals, and it had little experience making loans to less-affluent customers, according to analysts. As the two companies sought to boost revenue, they granted cards to customers with lower credit scores, according to one of the sources familiar with the situation.\nAs Goldman set aside more money for bad loans, the paper losses for its consumer business mounted, according to earnings filings.\nThe companies also tried to tempt new customers with the promise of “no annual fees, foreign transaction fees, or late fees,” Apple said on its website.\nThey also introduced high-yield savings accounts for card holders in April, enabling Goldman to gather $10 billion of deposits by August, Apple said at the time.”",

They weren't using it like a normal credit card, but rather just a backup to get cashback on Apple products, which is a loss they incurred. Which is amplified with huge infrastructure costs to host this huge system that's hardly being used. \n\nBut the big issue, which I found surprising was, there was a massive default rate on them. So you had 1 group who just never used it at all, and another group who just maxed it out and ditched the card and never used it again. Apple basically brought credit cards to all their users to people who wouldn't normally even want a credit card. Their default rates were really really high, on incredibly thin margins, and the only \"responsible\" customers were actually creating a ton of losses by taking advantage of the rewards. \n\nThey basically got the worst of all worlds.",

Perhaps a more risk-based credit card company would bite for the chance to associate with Apple, like TBOM (Bank of Missouri) or Synchrony as they are deep in the shit already with all those store cards they handed out to credit scores not even often in the 6's that go to 34.99% after the intro rate period expires, as it does on over 70% of clients with those cards (same applies to most Comenity store cards).

I swear Citi makes it harder to find these questions with every update.\n\nLeads me to believe that a majority of CC companies use UX obfuscation to profit off misleading their customers.
