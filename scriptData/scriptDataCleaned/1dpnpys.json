Waymo is it's own corporate entity.   \n\nThat happened years ago.   \n\n> Why would alphabet give up ownership of a possible cash cow? \n\nFor a ton of different reasons.   A big one is Waymo employees are given shares of Waymo already.   As it is a separate corporate entity.\n\nThis is a good and efficient way to compensate and motivate employees.\n\nHaving it public would make the shares have a higher value.  Plus makes it easier to exchange the shares instead of a annual valuation done.  It is a more real price.   Well kind of.  Read on about the float.\n\nAnother reason is Google already dominates so many things and then also dominating transportation could/would cause focus from the government that you do not want.\n\nI do not want to offend but I am not sure you understand how it works?  I have personally been involved in this exact situaiton but on a smaller scale.\n\nI ran a company that a primary investor, like Waymo, was a public company.\n\nAnother company owned 52% of that company that was also public.\n\nAlphabet would keep a relatively small float which would give the company an inflated multiple.\n\nYou continue to recognize the profit with the ownership you retain.  You do NOT sell 100% of the shares.\n\nThis is also provides a means to fund the build out which will be massive with Waymo.\n\nThere is simply no reason to NOT do an IPO and why they will do one at some point.  Nothing else would make any sense.",
