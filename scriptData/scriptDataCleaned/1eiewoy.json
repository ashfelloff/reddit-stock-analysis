They will have to innovate and rebuild themselves, but I don't think they will ever go bankrupt. Despite the huge fuck up with their recent chips, they will rebound. Majority of PCs still run on Intel architecture. Last time the stock has been $21 was in 2013. This is probably a good time to buy. Remind me in 11 years on this platform or something new.",

Lunar Lake pulled in, but it was presumed that AMD was going to launch Zen 5 3 months from now, but they also pulled in so it's a wash.  There's a lot more analyst downgrades coming.  Might get delisted from the Dow.\n\nI'm going to pivot to a long position eventually, on the assumption the stock pops on either Foundry getting spun off or Products getting acquired by someone else.  But this is going to probably take a year or two.\n\nEdit: if it matters, Intel is basically trading at book value right now.  I bought AMD back when they were there too and that worked out...sort of.",
