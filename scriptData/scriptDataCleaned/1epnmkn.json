  "score": 2476,
  "selftext": "No pun intended but this will not take long. Please accept this simple DD on why you should be longing NVDA leading up to earnings. \n\n\n1) There seems to be no end in sight with Jensen‚Äôs ability to juice earnings releases. Is it the leather jacket? No. Well we don‚Äôt know for sure, but the last six ERs have resulted in an average reaction of roughly +8.5%. Isn‚Äôt that what Buffet earns on an annual basis?\n\n\n2) Look at the chart. I‚Äôm not usually one for technical analysis, but it‚Äôs quite clear reviewing the chart on my Apple iPhone‚Äôs stocks app that we‚Äôve reached the bottom of this selloff. Image attached for your reference. \n\n\n3) The delay in Blackwell chip rollout is not a big deal if it‚Äôs even real. Jensen has been clear that demand for Hopper still exceeds supply. Someone did the math previously, but any impact of a 3 month delay is mitigated by the fact that they‚Äôll simply sell more H200. Just Google ‚ÄúBlackwell delay‚Äù and you‚Äôll see lots of articles on sites you‚Äôve never heard of confirming the same.\n\n\n4. Nancy Pelosi is still buying. She‚Äôs probably already seen the AGI locked in Sam‚Äôs basement. Don‚Äôt forget, this entire AI wave was kicked off by ChatGPT. That‚Äôs just the very tip of the AI iceberg that‚Äôs about to change the course of humanity‚Äôs future. Any upcoming product releases from the big players in this space are only going to reignite excitement for this technology and thusly shares of NVDA.\n\n\nMy position: Very sensible 9/20 $100 and 12/20 $110 strike calls, shares. Not financial advice. Thank you for reading.",
