Now, no one is borrowing, and this has caused major slumps in these chipmakers. The only one not seeing a sales slump is NVDA for fairly obvious reasons. Some have cut prices, which boosts revenue, but guts earnings(AMD). Others have stayed strong on pricing and seen revenue slump(Qualcomm, Texas Instruments). Others have somehow managed to cut prices and still get slapped down by the market(Intel mainly).

It's been a bloodbath for the past 18-24 months, solo owner-operators leave the industry by the thousands every week, companies between 10 and 500 trucks go out of biz every month and big boys like Convoy with thousands of trailers or US Xpress eith 6k trucks got bought out for pennies.\n\n\nI believe the main reason is the high inflation and high interest rates. There's just less freight to move, people are buying less stuff. You'll say Walmart, Kroger or Target posted record profits, but they do that by selling less stuff for higher markup. In trucking we don't care if we haul $20k worth of corn or $100k worth of electronics - it's still 40k pounds to us. \n\n\nNow, some might say we had a boom and high prices during the covid \"bottleneck\", but that was 3 years ago. The prices to move freight have gone significantly down from then and have stayed like that for too long. Unfortunatelly tires, maintenace and parts prices have remained at covid level and we are getting crushed. \n\n\nThe only reason I'm still profitable is because I specialize in hazmat freight, but the dark side of it is that I'm a target for the DOT every single day - mud of the reflective tape on one of the side of a 53ft trailer? Violation, fine, higher safety scores and increased insurance when I renew. A chip on the windshield? Violation. DOT officer not sure if my hazmat isn't labeled correctly? Better slap a violation just in case and it costs me to fight it. The driver's expencive specialized gps sticking half an inch above the dashboard? Obstruction of view and violation....",
