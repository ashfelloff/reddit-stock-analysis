  "score": 639,
  "selftext": "Look at the chart just to my eye there‚Äôs not a trade I‚Äôll put on now if I‚Äôm not already in  because I‚Äôm more of a momentum kind of trader  I let the trend be my friend and I believe Tesla can trade in this wedge and if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll wait to see with direct it will break. Tesla has been In a down trend for some time now so maybe the buyers will participate because of their belief of the stock price being at a price they consider cheap? My guess is as good as yours the big money that moves the market does what ever they want. We all will soon know Tesla miss on earnings and had a 10 percent jump after hours, what is next for Tesla ? Will u trade it ? If so which way? Or will you just leave it alone ? ",

Liquid stock, been beat down for months, tons of news crashing over it like waves for months, short sellers/put buyers had all the time in the world to get their cut of this drop. Expectations were very low, so for more downside they had to really miss. Short sellers saw that the results weren't that bad, and decided they'd gotten their fill and covered.\n\nAnd there were a whole lot of shorts/puts on the ledger, the I'm alance was pretty easy to spot. Retail ER speculators trying to short the hole will make for some seriously nice exit liquidity. There's no reason tsla can't make new yearly lows but the opportunity to squeeze shorts was just too easy, IMHO.\n\nDisclaimer: I have ZERO position on TSLA and make no opinions about their long term success/troubles",

Expectation was low into the print.\n* There are some analysts arguing that these numbers are being inflated by FSD revenue recognition. And that with 3-5% price cuts and 20% lower deliveries, gross margins shouldn‚Äôt have been 17.4%, when Q4 revenue was 17.6%. WE will learn more of this when 10-Q comes out.\n* Nonetheless:\n* Revenue came in 21.3B a 8.7% miss vs consensus\n* EPS came 0.45, a big miss vs expectations of 0.58\n* FCF came in at negative 2.5B a big miss vs consensus of 1.19B.\n* Gross margins came 17.4%, beating consensus of 16.9%\n* Auto Gross Margin came 16.4% beating 15.8% consensus\n* EBITDA margin came 15.9% beating expectation of 15.8%\n* Within Revenue, Services beat, but thats a tiny segment\n* Automotive revenue, which is the bulk missed by 11%\n* Energy missed by 13%\n* Comments from the press conference:\n* Accelerating launch of new models ahead of previously communicated start of production in H2 2025\n* This includes more affordable models\n* Still sees notably lower volume growth rate for 2024\n* Committed to company wide cost reduction\n* Production at Shanghai Giga factory is down QOQ\n* Musk says Tesla may be able to sell Optmius by the end of next year\n* Tesla aims to deliver Semis to customers in 2025\n* Says Tesla will have higher sales this year than last year\n* Buybacks are possible, but we need positive cash flow\n* RObotaxi will be called cyber cab",
