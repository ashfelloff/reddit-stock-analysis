Depending on when we dump, I may be able to get out when spot price is as high as $105. $115 was tested this week already. I don't expect it to hold next time.\n\nI'll cut losses if we rise above $132 at any point.

A 1 for 2 bet doesn‚Äôt justify the insane amount of risk you‚Äôre taking, especially considering this is NVDA we‚Äôre talking about. No matter how you look at it, the 3.1T market cap, historical vol, or implied vol, a 1 for 2 bet doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.\n\nBut I like the strike and the DTE. Hopefully a catalyst comes, macro shock, regulation, supply chain, anything. If it does come, it wouldn‚Äôt result in just a mere 5% drop. Overall, this is a solid play.
