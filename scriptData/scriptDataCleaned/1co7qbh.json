  "selftext": "I’m all for bashing Boeing when there is something worth bashing, but newsflash to the recent puberty graduates, planes have been having mechanical issues since the dawn of modern time. Air travel 30-50 years ago had significantly more fatal crashes, with far less flights. Much of this has to do with maintenance issues and human error at the airline/airport level.\n\nIn cases such as their Max 737, that’s clearly on Boeing. But all these constant news snippets for old planes having issues is just an insult to the remaining intelligence in this sub. \n\nSo please keep your Spirit Airlines quality DD in the overhead compartment.",
