So I have 8 throws left to get 2 cups.\n\nAt this point you might think ahhh fuck, my chances to win this are pretty low now.\n\nSo you sell the bet to someone else for $130, and take a $30 loss.\n\nBut the game isn't over yet. I still have to make those throws.\n\nThen lets say that I completely fucking suck and I miss the last 8 throws.\n\nThat guy that you sold your bet to just won the bet and will pocket $100 - but you didn't want to take the risk anymore so you booked a loss to get out of it for a smaller loss.\n\nThis is basically how options work. An out of the money option still has value because of the possibility that the stock moves in the correct direction.",
