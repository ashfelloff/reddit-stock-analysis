  "selftext": "This strike wasn't a big deal. Israel was demonstrating force capability in regions with critical targets, they avoided nuclear/civilian targets which would have been extremely escalatory. Middle east conflict could still escalate but if anything, this strike made it *less* likely that it would happen tomorrow. If the casualty count is low/zero, its further proof Israel was demonstrating capability, not truly attacking. My guess is that this is why futures aren't tanking further.\n\nLooks like [3 drones were shot down over Isfahan](https://aje.io/akzdf6?update=2846016), an important nuclear research/weapons development city. Israel might have been showing Iran that they could hit them if they want to. This after Iran showed the opposite, that even \\~600 munitions can't meaningfully get to Israel. So this whole thing might have been Israel shooting at nothing 2 miles from a strategically significant target to prove to Iran they could get to a bunch of important military targets if they needed to. That could put to rest the current pressure for retaliation in Israel without forcing Iran to do the same. Especially if the casualty count is zero; there's no need for Iran to respond.\n\nStill, medium and long term this isn't great for middle east geopolitical stability but if it was WW3 time, the news would be different. My 2 cents\n\nAll from this [live feed](https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-18-24/index.html)\n\n# Nuclear facilities are safe in Isfahan province, Iranian state-aligned media says\n\n# US had advance warning of Israel's retaliation against Iran but \"didn't endorse\" it, US official says\n\n>",

Iran should expect Russian help with Israel - and why not. Russia would love to divert Western Military Resources away from Ukraine. China has relatively strong economic and geopolitical ties to Iran and will simply do the exact same thing with Iran that it is doing with Russia: continue selling dual use technologies with plausible deniability. So, then the U.S more forcefully sanctions and exerts pressure on China to stop selling dual use technologies to Russia and Iran and China tells the U.S to Fuck Off. So, the U.S begins to militarize its allies (Philippines, South Korea, Japan). China responds the same way. \n\nWW3 is closer than ever at this point. It's all fucked.",

It's that they steal intellectual property as a general rule and have a relatively closed economy where foreign companies are at a huge disadvantage. So they actively pursue policies which result in trade imbalances with their trading partners. They also fund non-profitable companies using state capitalism, which then dump exports at less than cost, like with solar panels.\n\nFor the US, it's more economically sensible to import from Mexico since Chinese goods have to cross the Pacific Ocean, making the cost of their imports sensitive to increases in shipping. And container costs have fluctuated wildly the last 4 or 5 years (during and following covid, especially).\n\nMany Chinese manufacturing facilities are state of the art though. They make iPhones and all kinds of other highend electronics there. Quality of goods is not the main problem. It would be hard to argue that quality in China is any lower than other countries with cheap labor like Indonesia, Vietnam, etc. \n\nYou also rightly point out that compared to some other competitors their labor is becoming more expensive and so less attractive.",

Firstly, Russia is not going to get involved here simply because it can't, it's far too busy in Ukraine. This is the reason Iran has not moved the Syrian army into Israel because Russia doesn't have the resources to support the Assad regime right now so if Assad moved troops to Israel then Syria would crumble and go from a cold civil war as it's currently in (a stalemate) to a bloodbath again. So we can already see Russia is not able to get involved. As for China, you think that USA putting sanctions on China for trading to Iran will cause China to say fuck off and everyone will gather their armies? They're not school children, China and USA are focused on Taiwan, that's the important bit and that is not spilling into war anytime soon for a huge host of reasons that would be another massive essay to go into.\n\nIf Iran were to retaliate the likely move would be to move Hezbollah south into Israel, this would cause massive devastation to Israel, however the USA has a strong military presence just off the coast of Lebanon where Hezbollah is ATM and they're there to prevent that exact move. If Iran did this then Hezbollah would be wiped out and Iran would lose it's trump card essentially meaning it'd have only nuclear weapons as a deterrent to attack. Meanwhile Hezbollah could take out all of Israel's clean water supply and power within a day as Israel is actually very fragile so it would be devastating to Israel but leave Iran exposed. This move would also tie up Iranian resources allowing Azerbaijan to invade southern. Armenia which puts Iran in a very weak position. \n\nThis I feel is the far more likely escalation move but I don't see it happening just yet. If it does, it's not WW3, not even close. Not unless Iran starts getting an itchy trigger finger with those nukes.\n\nSo calm down, have a cup of tea and buy the dip.",

The snail mail drones and cruise missiles were nothing more than a distraction.   \nNow lets just Hope Iran will just brush this off as Israels desperate attempt to save face.
