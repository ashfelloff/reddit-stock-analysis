We often got information that was not readily available to the public that had I had a Robin Hood account back at the time would’ve enabled me to make actionable decisions that would’ve benefited me ahead of the general public.  Politicians in the United States often have access to non-public information due to their positions, including insights from confidential briefings, committee meetings, and interactions with industry leaders and regulators. This information can provide them with an edge in making financial decisions, as they might be aware of upcoming legislation, regulatory changes, or economic policies that could impact stock prices before the general public. However, trading on such information, known as insider trading, is illegal, and there are laws and regulations intended to prevent and penalize such actions among public officials. That’s said there should definitely be greater transparency for officials that are in a position to have knowledge that’s beyond the public purview.",
