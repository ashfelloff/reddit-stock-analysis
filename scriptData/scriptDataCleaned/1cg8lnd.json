          "body": "This. OP is better off just trying for a Tesla or more money. $30K can't even buy you a Tesla and we're not even factoring taxes.\n\nMaybe OP will 20x again and then he can afford an actual car. Keep that $1.5K in sgov or something. Then roll the dice with house money. Worst case is you're back to square 1 and you don't have to pay taxes on that gain (watch out for washsales tho).\n\n--------------------------\n\np.s. Buying a benz is such a scrub move. \n\nThe brand is less for the rich/wealthy but poors who want to pretend to be rich. Just like Coach, Supreme, Hermes, Ferrari, or anything from LVMH (Great investment btw. Been owning it for years and it's paid off off like a boss. Basic bitches, bitchy bitches, bossy bitches, slutty bitches, classy bitches, etcetc. Don't matter they all love LV bags.)\n\nReason why is because those who are actually rich/wealthy value their time the most and that's not Mercedes. You don't own the Merc. Merc owns you: cringe salesmen, constant brake downs and error messages, price gouging dealers mechanics, higher insurance, \"recommended\" BS from premium fuel to authentic parts, lifestyle creep, the quality is a lie since most new models won't last 100K+ (for that you want a Lexus/Acura, Honda/Toyota, Subaru or Porsche if you must go German), you can't park it just wherever for fear of damage, you can't max rev it because it's your precious merc, and every mofo trying to rip off your lil'merc logo. \n\nEven the actual wealthy/rich people who drive benz don't \"own\" merc cars: ***they lease them***. That cuts the Merc BS you have to deal with in half: cringe merc dealer will just give you the advertised lease price, breakdown issues are the dealer's problem, overpriced maintenance/parts isn't your problem either, plus the multiple warnings for shit going wrong are all covered, and you'll return it after your lease ends so you can redline that shit as much as you like. One good thing about Mercedes is their service reps and service are decent so most rich mofos like just dropping off the car whenever it has problems/maintenance, picking up some free coffee/breakfast, getting a new service vehicle for the weekend or a concierge to wherever they are going, and then get their car back fixed and washed (cause they value the time/convenience).",

The entire service history of my car is 2 brake jobs, 2 new batteries, 1 recall airbag replacement, and annual oil changes. It has literally never needed a single mechanical repair. And it is the lowest maintenance vehicle I've ever owned.\n\n\nETA: can y'all downvoting this at least leave a comment letting me know where on the doll Mercedes hurt you?",
