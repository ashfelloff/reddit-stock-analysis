Japanese aging population spend less and less for everyday goods, so there is immence deflationally pressure to counter the printing. Japanese central bank holds 1/3 of total debt that they can delete if shit hits the fan, so the actual debt is lower than it seems.\n\nUS can print more money than normal countries since USD is THE grobal currency and they can win WW3 against every other countries conbined unless it becomes nuclear war. US culture has inflationally pressure by default since US citizens pay less taxes, spend more, and bollow more compared to most of the first world countries.\n\nNobody knows when or if hyperinflation or something remotly close to that can happen in the US or Japan.

It’s not a conspiracy theory it’s widely talked about. \n\nThe problem is inflation has its own problems it introduces and it needs to be carefully balanced. For example high inflation reduces capital investments because these projects can’t rapidly adjust to new prices. Eg: a 10M bridge is actually a 12M bridge but you already allocated 10M for it. Long term this is a huge deal because infrastructure and capital investments are the lifeblood of any modern economy. \n\nSimilarly social security would need to increase, contributing to the national debt yet again.\n\nIt can cause problems in housing supply, no one wants to buy a house if their existing one is “burning” off its debt. Why move? You’re basically printing money by staying put. \n\nhttps://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2021/10/21/can-inflation-offset-government-debt\n\nhttps://www.pgpf.org/blog/2023/08/how-does-inflation-affect-the-federal-budget",

While inflating away debt seems like a tempting strategy, it’s like trying to fix a leaky roof by flooding the house. Sure, it ‘solves’ one problem, but creates several others: from cratering long-term investments to jacking up the costs of social programs like Social Security. It’s kind of like trying to lose weight by setting your scale to kilograms—you feel lighter, but you’re not really addressing the core issue.\n\nPlus, in the housing market, why move when inflation turns your mortgage into the best hedge fund you didn’t know you signed up for? Your debt is shrinking, but so are your incentives to do anything. Inflation might ‘burn’ the debt, but it’s also burning the foundation of economic stability.\n\nIn short, you can inflate debt away, but you can’t inflate away the consequences. It’s like playing Monopoly with a broken bank—eventually, everyone loses.",

Most of them worry about it because it would be very bad if the US slowed spending / increasing the debt. Way more than if they cut their debt. Iirc they call this modern monetary theory. Another google search is what it meant for when the US got off the gold backed dollar. Add onto that the slight conspiracy of the petrodollar and why its the real reason we invaded the middle east all those times. \n\nThis is wsb, where we are directly gambling on the market and look at how upvoted this post is. We have a monetary incentive to learn this shit yet we as a sub dont. Now imagine all the aunt karens who go to church every Sunday and knit in their free time. Theyre never going to even think about fact checking t he scary debt myth and even if they do, they understand it or will find some fake facebook post about it.  And since the debt is always going to increase, its always going to be a free promise / talking point. Many people have felt the burdens of debt so its very easy to mistake a governments debt to itself or foreign entities (that also owe the US money btw) is even remotely the same thing. Debt is fucking good. Its how companies like amazon have rose to the top because it just borrowed a shit ton and put off profit making. Why make 10 dollars today when you can reinvest 10 dollars and make 11 tomorrow? That is what the US is doing, except it keeps snowballing. They arent satisfied with 11, or 12, or 13 dollars. They just keep reinvesting in itself. This has been proven to be the fastest way to grow. And if we dont do this, we are going to lose progress to countries that have 2 brain cells and are doing this. \n\nAlso OP used hard dollar amounts. We can cut spending and still have a record dollar amount added. Cut spending in half? Well we still have the pay the SAME interest on the previois debt plus the interest on the new debt. It doesnt matter if the new debt is halfed. Because debt we are clearing from the 1990s is not the same dollar for dollar (inflation). \n\nOr look at the spy. If the spy rises from 5600 to 6100 tomorrow, its the highest dollar amount rise ever!  By double the previous record actually! But its not even top 10 percentage wise. Shit without further research, we could have owed 36tril last year with interest of 1.1t but owed 1.2t on 35t right now. Debt decreased!!! (it didnt btw).",
