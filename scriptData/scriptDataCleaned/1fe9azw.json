That includes all houses currently owned. Last year, the same group of people (1000 properties or more) bought nearly 20% of the houses purchased. This represents a MAJOR increase in investor property purchasing in recent years. That number is only 1% because this has really only been happening since the 80s, and it has seen a huge uptick with the low interest rate environment. It is going up. Rapidly. And that is the issue.\n\nThe studies you're referring to are mostly (if not all) sponsored by these entities or related groups, and they only focus on the overall housing market which is mostly irrelevant when it comes to supply and demand. Supply and demand are based on current market states, and right now people owning 1000 homes or more makes up 1/5 of the total demand. People owning 3 homes or more make up for another ~2/5 of that demand. Only around 1/3 of the total demand is represented by first time homebuyers. The point here, is that there is more institutional demand and more homeowners buying a second property, and that is creating a feedback loopdriving prices higher and making the share of first time homebuyers lower.",

It seems very logical that well-capitalized buyers would be less sensitive to change. Most non-first-time homebuyers are also sellers. Demand has fallen drastically because rates and prices are high. First mortgage rates for primary homeowners are rather competitive by borrowing standards, even when compared to those with more substantial balance sheets. Mortgages are not hard to get. 1/3 of total demand coming from first time homebuyers is almost hard to believe. There are a lot of homeowners, like 90 million and I remember reading the average homes owned over a lifetime for Americans is 3. How could 1/3 of the demand come from first timers every year?

That meant inflation stuck around into the spring of 2024 so they couldn’t do a 0.25 rate cut back then. \nSo they’re going to start with 0.25 in September. Depending on how the economy reacts they might do another cut in December. Later on they could justify a 0.5 cut and it might not necessarily be for panic- like if either the war in Ukraine or the Middle East ends, or if there’s an oil glut. But that is going to be in 2025 or 2026. \n\nRight now it’s going to be 0.25 and the market has already priced it in.",

I know for a fact that tech job market is super slow and the same goes for manufacturing and other sectors are to follow. Fed will try to go slow with .25 but soon they will realize they’ve been too late in cutting rates. Then we will see .50 or .75 cuts when they try to catch up but by then it’ll be too late.
