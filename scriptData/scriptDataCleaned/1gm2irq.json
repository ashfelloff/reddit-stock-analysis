An example of this was just before the Robotaxi event, which was followed by a large drop.\n\n\n\nMy current fair value estimate for tesla is $170 and at $297.5 it has reached 75% over.\n\n\n\nSo I decided YOLO and bought 50 Nov29 $250 puts and 50 Dec 20 $250 puts.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0tsft2wbyjzd1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97dcab45540b5e50a66c60619ae64a1b2798130",

It never tade at the price that make sense if you look at PE, only time it is trade in fair range is 2023/12/27 to 2024/01/09, there's like 6 days. \n\nThat's if you give it 30-50 pe, if you don't, you think like 20-25 or 10, then Tsla NEVER trade at fair valuation. \n\nSo DON'T trade it thinking fundamentals, just don't do it. Trade it with the technical. \n\nA tip for Tesla trader, if the price don't close or open below 238, that mean we are currently in the up trend, buy the dip. If it drop below 238 the trade range will be 238-266 for resistance and 180-201 as support.",
