          "body": "Ok, so getting women is difficult, and there is never any guarantee that you will ever get one, but there are a bunch of things that will greatly improve your chances.\n\n1) Get in shape. Chicks dig guys that are physically healthy.\n\n2) Get an education. Chicks dig guys with masters degrees.\n\n3) Get a hobby, but try to pick a good one. Video games, gym and collecting doge coins aren't good enough hobbies to stand on their own, so you need something more classy. Chess, specific sports (hockey, wall climbing, etc.), photography, playing an instrument, cooking are better examples.\n\n4) After you've done all the previous steps, which could take multiple years to begin with, you can try finding woman. They are usually never in your apartment unless you have arranged for it previously, in which case you already have a woman and can stop here. Dating apps are really depressing, but they sometimes get you a date, and importantly they give you a lot of practice in talking to woman. In person classes, the gym, bars and flower filled meadows give you good opportunities for finding women IRL.\n\n5) Once you have located a womans, for example at a bar, try approach her in a way that feels comfortable for yourself. You can tell them that they have nice hair and that you would love to suck on their toes, with their permission. If that doesn't work, start crying and tell them how lonely and touch starved you are. This will likely make them feel uncomfortable and they will try to console you. This is good, since she is still talking to you. Recite love poetry - I recommend Ovid's Ars Amatoria, since it's from the Roman times and chicks dig the Roman empire. If she has to go to the bathroom a few minutes into you reciting love poetry, tell her you'll escort her there to make sure she's safe and not to lose track of her. And don't like ''offer'' to escort her there, ''tell'' her you will. That will make you seem more confident, and chicks dig confident men. If all goes well, once you get to the bathroom, compliment her physique and ask her for a blowjob. If she says no at this point, there must be something wrong with her, so feel free to call her a whore so she will stop wasting your time and to prevent her from friendzoning you, and repeat from step 5.\n\nYou're welcome!",

It just feels weird. \n\n I'd option it, but even that seems like a gamble.  The problem with meme stocks is that they get artificially bumped up by too much artificial demand, and by the time the dust settles it's overbought to the degree that it's being propped up by wishes and prayers.  \n\nDo what you want, but i'm just going to sit out NVDA for a month or so and see how the dust settles.  I hope I'm wrong, but something just feels off.  It's just not behaving as it should. \n\nAm I alone in this feeling?",
