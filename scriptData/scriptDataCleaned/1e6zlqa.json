It’s like Boeing blaming contractors for doors falling off. Maybe it is the fault of the contractors, but the buck stops with Boeing, as it does with Microsoft. Now they need to reevaluate their use of Crowdstrike. It obviously poses an existential threat to critical services. I think MS will rebound fast when and if they pivot away from Crowdstrike.
