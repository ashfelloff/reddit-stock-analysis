There were 2 unusual drops in the last quarter:\n\n1. CRM quarterly - The CRM flubbed its Q1 quarterly at the end of May, which knocked both it and all associated cloud stocks down with it. NOW dropped by 12%,\n2. Guggenheim issued lower guidance in early July that caused it to drop by \\~8%\n\nOn number #1, I made an additional $13k on this play, but that was back in June\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tckjn3b5ahfd1.png?width=1273&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a13b290b2f8a80346109b1a068b0e30bf2992e3",

I'm forced to use this smoking pile of absolute trash, from my experience, this is not a support tool, it's complete jank that feels cobbled together with tape and old chewing gum, at best it's a mid statistics tool to make charts for the higher ups that give less than two shits about anything and won't do more than glance at the colors.  \nI'm amazed that people willingly chose this, but then I'm reminded that those decision are never done by people who have to actively use it.\n\nIf you want to know where I got my experience from: Mercedes Benz. Spoiler though, they also have the worst IT infrastructure I have ever seen, it's an absolute mess with constant outages, bargain bin solutions, non functioning tools and beyond frustrated employees.\n\nSorry, had to vent some frustration there, congrats and fuck you.",

There is a huge shift underway from utilizing BMC Remedy for Service Desk support software over to SNow.  This is going to provide very solid, long-term revenue for the company and is a great foot-in-the-door for expansion of other SNow modules to be deployed for customers.",

          "body": "Agree. When I consulted for the federal government, every agency with whom I worked used BMC and hated it. Part of NOW's early success necessarily wasn't how great the product was (it had tons of issues), but that it sucked way less than BMC Remedy & HP Service Desk and the customer support was way better. As you stated, government agencies are sticky customers and don't like to change after major investments.\n\nUsually NOW gets a bump as well in their Q3 public-sector earnings as the Federal Government wraps up their fiscal year on 09/30 (Feds like to spend their remaining budget at year end).",
