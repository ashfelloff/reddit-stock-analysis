Sometimes OPEC will flood the market to drive prices down because the oil they produce is profitable at $30-$40 ppb while everyone else can't sustain a lower $50 ppb. This will shut down the smaller players and give OPEC bigger market share. Essentially what Elon is attempting to do in the EV market. Short term pain for bigger future market share. Burry might be seeing an OPEC squeeze when they cut production but this only works after smaller producers have shuttered their wells. This will shoot ppb to $100+ levels then.",

      "body": "I'm with him! There are some major players pushing back on EVs lately. In 2018 when Tesla released the Model 3 it prooved commercial viability. Many major automakers invested heavily in EVs. From 2019 to 2023.5 the thought was EVs are the future, anyone that doesn't embrace this is fucked. \n\nThe best example of this was Toyota. One of the old CEOs with his dying breath held out that EVs ain't shit, we only fw hybrids. Pretty much the second he croaked everyone at Toyota was like, okay, we're betting on EVs, that's definitly the future, that old man was suicidal.\n\nThen, around October of 2023 money started to dry up, the car market stabilized, people stopped paying over sticker for cars and every single major manufacturer started panicking about EVs. Mercedes, Chevy, Ford, VW and Honda all released something along the lines of EVs aren't profitable and there's no demand, we're slowing production and scaling back future projects. Meanwhile Tesla sales grew by 50% for the umpteenth year in a row.\n\nNow, despite this being objectively the best time ever to buy an electric car there's all this hate. I've got random fuck ohs telling me that they're bad for the planet (wtf do you know about the planet? You're a hairdresser). I've got people offended that I would support Mr. Evil Villain Elon by owning a Tesla as if the last 40 years of war haven't been centered around oil. \n\nEVs have become a massive political issue and this is as exemplified as ever by this new tax on BYD. In the last 10 years China has speedrun the development of their auto industry and now they're in a place where they're willing to fuck everyone for as long as it takes for them to win. American companies do this sort of undercutting all the time. Google photos had free unlimited backups for 10 years until Flickr was 10 buried 10 ft under ground.\n\nThe US will do anything to keep that from happening here and I don't blame them. Cars are a massive component of our economy. Back in the 60s one in four americans was directly employed by the automotive industry. It's stil a very big deal today.",
