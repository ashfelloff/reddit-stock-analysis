Or is there going to be *less*?\"\n\nIf your answer is \"more AI\", then NVDA and TSMC still have room for growth.\n\nI'm on the \"more AI\" side.  Look at [Meta's Movie Gen](https://ai.meta.com/research/movie-gen/).  Imagine creators being able to use AI to edit their videos, AI enhanced content, fully AI content.  It's just a research paper and PoC now, but to make this available to the general public will require a massive amount of compute and GPUs.\n\nEven if they make the algorithms more efficient and performance -- having better, faster hardware only means you can deliver more content, faster.\n\nWe'll eventually see AI generated shows and films, AI replacing SFX studios, AI generated games, etc.\n\nIt used to be that there were 3 broadcast channels and that's all you watched.  Then came cable and an expansion of content and topic areas -- HGTV, Discovery, History Channel, Food Network, etc.  Then platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Twitch created even more \"bandwidth\" and verticalization of content.  \n\nGen AI will power a next phase of content creation and distribution that is personal and even more fine-grained.  Advertisements that are even more targeted and personal.  We are so far from the horizon that it would seem silly to bet against NVDA.",
