I guess I was assuming he’s a frequent day/swing trader, if the position was closed out at a 98k loss, and reopened/traded for a 65k gain, the net loss for the year can only write off a max of 3k per year come tax time, but the 65k gain will be taxed as a gain if the positions gain was realized. Probably taxed 15k on that depending on his tax situation. \n\nI’ve been a little out of practice for a while now, but I believe that’s roughly how it works. \n\nIn my opinion, that’s why day trading is so risky. I’d personally only recommend day trading in a tradable IRA or Roth account because no trades have tax implications until you make withdrawals. In the long run the 10% penalty is likely less than all the taxes you’ll pay with the dramatic ups and downs of day trading… assuming you’re making early withdrawals.",

If you hold over 12 months you get a 50% discount unless you're classed as a trader in which case you don't get the discount. \n\nNot sure why this is so complicated for people?",
