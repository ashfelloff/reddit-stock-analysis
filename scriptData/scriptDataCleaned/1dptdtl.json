Literally 10+ years of “firsts” that sound super impressive on paper, but have never translated to improved business. \n\nI think the market has caught on and nothing is going to budge this stock until they show how their R&D translates to revenue. We’re in the middle of an AI/semiconductor boom and this Goliath of the industry is literally doing fewer in sales now than they were a decade ago.

Also, I think they will be moving to manufacturing for others with their new us plant, since that is in their business plan. Not sure how that’s gonna go. Most of their consumer cpus have be underwhelming for the last few generations. Plus their partner literally refuse to market their gpu’s because it’s I turn off to potential customers.",

Performance gains from shrinking the size of transistors are starting to get difficult and more expensive as we approach the hard limits of how small we can make them. Using light instead of electrons has the potential to be the next stage of computer chip development as light can travel faster than electrons and thus can allow Intel to continue to produce chips with increased performance.

              "body": "It's going to be very hard for photonics to replace CPUs. Basically, you need to make both lasers and mini fiber-optic channels for the lasers that are as dense as transistors are today, and that don't use more power than the transistors of today. Transistors have been optimized for those for decades, and it's really tough to beat them at their own game.\n\nSerDes is an ideal landing spot for photonics, because those circuits give the lasers enough power and channel length to really start stretching their legs. You really don't care how big your USB or PCIe port circuit is, and you really don't care how much power it burns, as long as it's fast enough to compensate. Photonic circuits are bulky, but they can deliver some eye-bleeding speeds.",
