  "selftext": "Seeing so many comments and threads of people asking if their $130 8/30 calls will still print followed by the equally delusional regards replying about how the market will magically gap up 12-15% by market open tomorrow, erase all losses today, and somehow pump enough for their 1dte far OTM options to be back in the green.\n\nNo, it's not going to happen. I'm by no means saying that this AI hype/Nvidia is done for, but large runups like these absolutely do need a cool-down period as a break. No stock can sustain Nvidia type growth for years on end. Nvidia has blown so many earnings reports out of the water, this time it essentially had to face the impossible task to beat the expectations to beat the sky high expectations of beating analyst predictions. On top of that 99% of the posts and comments I've seen on WSB were NVDA earnings extreme bulls, so that alone should've told you something. \n\nAgain, I'm not saying that this run is over and Nvidia will go to zero- I still think it's fundamentally a great company and has clear long-term growth potential. A LOT of people are comparing this to the dot-com bubble, but what people don't realize is that bubbles usually tend to eradicate the smaller BS companies that base their entire business on AI to piggyback the hype. Nvidia is comparable to Google, Meta, or Apple back then, and will likely be perfectly fine. \n\nWhat I think will mostly happen is that, again, soon DTE calls would go completely or near worthless in the next few weeks as Nvidia regresses and enters the backburners in terms of the overall rotation leading up to the election, and will continue its rally soon after. \n\nPositions: An assortment of strike 120, 122, 123, and 124 8/30 puts, 120/123 8/30 debit put spreads. Will soon add some longer DTE leaps. \n\nTL;DR: Your 8/30 or 9/6 NVDA calls are done for. There will be no magical 15% gap up tomorrow. LEAP holders are likely fine, and start buying shares if we dip further. \n\n",

The premium is always way too expensive.\n\nIf someone wants to trade NVDA, it's much better to trade SPY or one of the other dozens of tickers that basically correlate 1:1 with NVDA, that are way less expensive.",

A company of this size putting up growth numbers like that is impressive and indicative that this huge momentum wave in the sector isn't done. \n\nThis wasn't a case of not beating expectations. This was a case of not beating the expectation of how much they'd beat expectations. Which is a weird thing to say but it makes sense I promise. It just so happens to come at a time when the market needed reassurance in the wake of rate cut news. They didn't get it. September probably is gonna get pretty rocky.
