After the news, the AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF (MSOS-ARCA, NR) closed up 24.8% on Tuesday, though it has given back more than half of those gains with a decline of 15.0% on Wednesday. We view this as a buying opportunity for long-term investors, as the rescheduling progress has been substantially derisked with this week‚Äôs reports and confirmation by the DOJ Director of Public Affairs.",

Their alcohol is no joke either in a ton of professional sports stadiums all over the United States and even disney lol. They have a lot of stuff the general market will tear up. Their alcohol is very very up to date and they are always making some unreal drinks that not only taste great but have very very appealing looks.
