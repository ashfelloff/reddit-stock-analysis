I was skeptical of ASTS because it seemed they were competing with Starlink, which is obviously going to be cheaper for its owner to launch on their own rockets. But I spent hours this past weekend reading that 179 page PDF analysis and couldn't talk myself out of just focusing my feeble investing knowledge on acquiring ASTS shares for the next year.   \n  \nI didn't realize how robust their testing has been and how vast their contracts and partnerships are. Their leadership has impressive relevant backgrounds and are all very invested themselves (the CEO takes no salary). There's an impressive list of patents they own, and it turns out that even if Starlink gets around the regulatory challenges, their technology is not specifically designed to work with the 5g phones that are in wide use today.   \n  \nFirst thing this morning I unloaded some dumb assets in my Robinhood account (which I treat as money I can afford to lose) and bought calls and shares based on a strategy I worked out over the weekend. The result was of course a red-letter day where everything in the app was red most of the day. I'm in it for at least a year, so I just quit looking at the app. I'm still optimistic that I made a smart move, especially considering the stuff I dumped was mostly things that sounded good in this sub before I really understood the basics anyway. Not knocking this sub, though: it put me on ASTS in the first place.",

First you should have a general idea of what’s going on in the world within different industries, politics, general news. Most of it is useless and you can filter as you please, I focus mostly on the tech industry.\n\nThat helps you establish trends in the market, like the recent AI pump, and helps you pick stocks that make move based on these trends. \n\nThen you need to have a general understanding of how stocks are priced so you don’t end up buying a good company at a bad price. This takes more than just reading and learning as the market does not move as it should most of the time. You’ll get better at valuing companies as you spend more time watching and participating in the market.\n\nHope that helps\n\n**Edit: first you shouldn’t chase 10x in only month timeframes.
