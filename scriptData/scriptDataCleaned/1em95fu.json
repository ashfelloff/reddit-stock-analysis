Been a while (pre-covid), but I think the assumption was something like TQQQ would be 250% of IXIC on up days, 350% on down days (accounted for daily rebalancing and tracking data using historical performance in down periods). I ran three options: Pure QQQ, Pure TQQQ, and a hybrid where I was DCAing over a few weeks into TQQQ when monthly RSI was below 50, then gradually DCAing out of TQQQ and into QQQ when monthly RSI crossed 70.\n\nResults were that pure TQQQ only beat QQQ in periods where the corrections were shorter and sharper - if the longer period included any long, slow recessions or prolonged recoveries, it was problematic. But the modified RSI-based DCA strategy outperformed both QQQ and TQQQ over the entire period.\n\nPersonally, I think the strategy is probably even better with UPRO than TQQQ - the tracking error is less because the volatility is less - but it was a solid, fairly passive strategy that was resilient to a lot of nonsense.",

I know everyone thinks Stonks only go up and they do, until they don’t. The banks and the government are trying to figure a way out of the commercial real estate debacle, there is no way out. The $25 Trillion dollar valuation of the CRE market is now worth $14 Trillion dollars with vacancies at an all time record high of 18%-40% depending on the city. During Covid when everyone was working at home and job performance was great, it dawned on companies that they didn’t have to pay $10’s or $100’s of millions of dollars to have a brick and mortar business, they figured out that and about 45% and in some cases 100% do not have any brick and mortar offices, some don’t even have B&M headquarters ( Etrade among many others as an example) they all realized that many or most of their employees could do their job perfectly from home and it would save billions of dollars. It’s simple causality, many if not the majority of employees work from home, companies don’t need office space, the leases they signed were for 5-7 years and at a 2.5-3% rate. That was in 2018 and as the leases renew , the property has lost 40% of its value and the new lease renewal rates are 7-8.5% so what happens now? What happens to the banks, Investment firms, PE and REIT’s that own the mortgages? If you have an answer besides bail out and the general public will pay for it, try again, if you have the solution besides re-zoning the properties and turning the vacancies in to free living spaces for the unhoused population try again. If you come up with any solutions besides all of the CRE mortgage owners and the stock market taking it in the face then you should call Jerome Powell at 1-888-851-1920 , good luck with that.

How is that not buying when it's low? \n\nBtw I didn't say DCA doesn't work. Ofc you should invest every month or couple weeks with some of the money you can save in that time, but buying more shares for the same money compared to weeks ago even though \"time in the market beats timing the market\" is objectively better. \n\nObviously buying when it's high doesn't mean it can't go higher and that you can't get a good return from it, but if you already bought at a higher price, why the hell would you not be doubling down now?",
