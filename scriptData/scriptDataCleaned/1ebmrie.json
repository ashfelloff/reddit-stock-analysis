  "selftext": "Grindr CEO George Arison criticized Tinder and Bumble for neglecting their male users, who constitute 70% of their user base, at the Fortune Brainstorm Tech conference. Despite men often paying for premium services, their experience remains frustrating, leading many to quit online dating. Connell Barrett, founder of Dating Transformation, echoed these sentiments, noting that only 20% of men receive most matches while the rest struggle. Arison also highlighted that dating apps focus more on women's experiences, which he finds offensive, and called for a more balanced approach to benefit all users.\n\n“I'm not even their target audience,” Arison – who is gay – said. “But still, as a guy, I'm offended.” Dating apps like Tinder and Bumble are neglecting their male users, Grindr CEO George Arison charged this week.\n\nMatch got yet another reminder that it’s under pressure Monday as the Wall Street Journal reported that activist hedge fund Starboard Value has built up a 6.5% stake in the company and wants it to improve its growth and cut costs. If it can’t succeed, Starboard wants it to explore going private. ",

Ashley Madison for example (the app for married men who want to cheat on their wife) was found to have a little over 1,000 actual women on their app (on an app that a quick Google search claims has over 60 million accounts). And that 1,000 number was determined using a VERY low bar of \"made an account registered as a woman, and sent at least one message to another user\". (Note: There were a lot more then 1,000 accounts for women in the data breach, but the vast majority were either never used, or showed some clear evidence of being registered by the company itself and used by their own employees based on things like the IP addresses). And the only reason we even know this is because of their big data breach from a few years ago.",

Tinder has the option to say you’re looking for a LTR but then will still show you tons of people looking for short term fun anyways.\n\nI honestly think it is just the culture at this point and not anything about how the apps are designed. Women are just fatigued in the US with a feeling of over abundance of options yet also at the same time no ability to filter through the hundreds of options for true compatibility. If you travel abroad you can get hundreds of matches in a day as a guy, whereas in a big city like NYC or LA you might be lucky to get a match a week. Same app, same profile, same features. that says to me it’s not so much about the tool as the people using the tool.",

In college it broadens out a little more but throughout life, if you're fit and attractive the odds of you landing multiple women are so much higher than the average guy regardless of how hard he tries. Now if you're a good looking guy that can talk. You just hit the lottery when it comes to dating \n\nSo what I don't get is why people expect match to really do something different than what has always happened. I guess if there's a flaw from what I can tell in the algorithm it's that they don't really have any open chat. This could be my old Gen X perspective but when people all were chatting in AOL chat rooms you had a lot more fluid dating. It wasn't just look at the picture and profile and swipe. People would talk about common interests and it was kind of like an online bar. I don't really know how you get back to that but they do need a way to involve more men if they are going to continue on. A platform where you have such a high male rejection rate is not profitable\n\nEven with the dating sites. It's pretty universally accepted that they peaked somewhere between 2007 and 2014 back before you really had to pay for anything. They made money on ad revenue but it was a much more dynamic experience that was much more involved. Now it's a bunch of gatekeeping from what I understand.",
