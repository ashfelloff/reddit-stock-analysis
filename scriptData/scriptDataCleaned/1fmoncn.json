Given recent global socio-economic events, I've decided to move all my investments into an S&P500 ETF. The reasons are multiple but they can all be distilled to the fact that I think the S&P500 will give out better returns in the next 5 to 10 years when compared to a broader index like the one I initially invested in. The risk, while higher, is ultimately quite similar as the all-world index's stocks are 60% from US companies.\n\nI'm trying to decide which ETF to buy and I'm not sure how to go about choosing.",
