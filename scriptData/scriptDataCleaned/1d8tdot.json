The good ones keep the backup at least 20km away so they don't both wipe out in the same catastrophe (hurricane, etc.). They [should] have redundancy in network, power, cooling and data. A backup in a remote site of data and transactions are generally required. All this need be tested periodically, which many organizations fail to do. Worst case would be to rebuild everything and reload backup data, but that outage can kill an enterprise. \n\nThe biggest threat to all are cybersecurity. We see hits almost daily. Merck got hit by one years ago that took months to resolve. Hospitals seem to be at risk. Banks seem to be pretty good and have regulated oversight for IT.  \n\nMy advice to you is to copy your accounts weekly, monthly or at least quarterly so you can make your claim if needed.
