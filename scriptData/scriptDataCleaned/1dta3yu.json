  "score": 55,
  "selftext": "Recently caught wind of a large purchase of September 20 4$ PTON calls. Did some research and I think someone knows something we don’t. 20,429 (572,012$)Volume  on these call options purchased today. Talks of a possible acquisition by AAPL have floated around and I think we may see something soon because there is no way someone is betting on PTON to crush earnings. Think I’m going to purchase a nice stake tomorrow morning. Will update later. \n",
