  "selftext": "Man guys iv been on a hot streak! \nFull clarity for you guys… im only up 9800$ on the year. But my comeback this month has been fucking awesome. At one point I was down just shy of 10k with only 1400 left to play with. I was ready to give up. Then… BOOM! 14 out of 15 days in a row I was green by eod. I think my luck streak is coming to an end so I plan on pulling more out tomorrow. But man it feels like a dream coming back like this. From down 9k on the year to up 9k. Maybe if I didn’t withdraw so much along the way my gains would be more but…. I’m pretty happy with these results. Vacation monies. \nIf anyone cares for advice, I would say that my success besides mainly luck. Is a result of me being patient and not trying to come back all at once. Telling myself to never hold any more than a x4. No matter what the a sell order in for that price at most. But mostly uv only put out 1k at a time and never hold past my commitment I make myself when I buy the options. I also gave up on meme stocks or playing earnings outright. Now I strictly trade calls and puts on. SPY, NVDA, AAPL, BA, and TSLA. My big 5. \nAnd I have no reasoning behind my options I buy. I go straight on gut. I’m so regarded the more i analyse the greater my chances I lose money. Positions are calls and outs in the top 5 I listed above. Never more than 1w dte\nThanks for giving me the gull to make this happen fellow degenerate gamblers ",
