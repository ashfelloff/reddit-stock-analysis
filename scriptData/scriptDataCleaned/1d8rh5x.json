The only advantage I see is that miners have lagged bitcoin this cycle, so Riot may not appreciate as quickly as the underlying asset if the trade goes wrong. However, with a short interest double the daily average volume, there is some risk of getting squeezed if bitcoin moves sharply after finally reaching a new ATH.",

RIOT still needs to sell out a certain amount of BTC to get some revenue. Holding it doesn't do much for them. The drop in rates recently is taking the pressure off, but rates won't go back to previous lows that will be needed to keep this afloat. If Texas backs out of paying them, they are toast.
