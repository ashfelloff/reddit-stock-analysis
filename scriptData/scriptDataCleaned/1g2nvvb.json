  "selftext": "Alright fellas, I think now is the time to alert you, and remind a few of you about these stocks.\n\nTLDR: RE focused stocks go up for the next 12 months. Positions below.\n\nSo, overarching DD is that real estate stock, primarily the type of RE stock involved with the purchase/sale/refi of RE is obviously going to see an uptick alongside the rate cuts. I am not certain if these stocks are considered \"cyclical\", but their charts certainly have cycles. They trend pretty respectfully with the rates and with the market. Bull market with low rates, these stocks are exploding. Bear market with low rates, these are flat, and bear market with rising rates, these things dump like nothing else. Luckily for you all, you have me. I have been involved/watching this sector through all of those cycles. And we are now squarely in the beginning - Bull market with falling rates. Over the next 12 months, I am expecting SIGNIFICANT upside from this sector. \n\n\nPositions: various strike calls for zillow. 65c 70c 72.5c 100c for various expirations starting as early as 10/25 and going as far out as 6/25 for the 100c.\n\nRedfin: 12c, 15c for various expiry in 2025.\n\nRKT: none, as frankly for this play. \n\nI have 80% of my funds in zillow and 20% in redfin, and if I had more money I'd probably just put more in zillow,  but I donthink rkt will go up too.",

I know these 250k turds aren’t worth 500k. \n\nAlso, Texas supply is ballooning and prices are only going up in the states that didn’t greet an influx of buyers like the northeast and Midwest. Californians leaving Texas will continue to depress prices across this area and those lower prices are going to lure highly mobile people from other areas leading to a price suppression. \n\nFunny enough I also hold moonshot RE options. 11/15p $1 $open",

But I feel that most people did cash-out refis when interest rates were low to remodel during the covid pandemic. For people buying first homes, the interest rate doesn't matter because they figure they'll refinance down the road; for people buying a second home it's also not a big factor because either they're affluent or investing in something they expect to profit from as a rental or an Airbnb or as a flip. \n\nWhat's keeping people sidelined now, I believe, is depressed wages and a housing market that's overheated due to a supply shortage, aggravated by commercial developers buying up properties to rent or flip. I just don't think interest rate cuts, particularly at the slow and deliberate pace at which they're likely to come, will push enough people into the market to make stocks in banks, much less in brokerages, moon.",

Your site exists strangely ad a way to show RE agents that you actually do something,  acting as a recruiting method to get new agents into your circle.\n\nThis lawsuit comes up allowing you not to rely on MLS for the first time in your living memory. What do you do?\n\nScenario 1 is you decide to cut out MLS, and zillow. You now are receiving cold hits to your platform of people looking for a home.. like 3 a month. 5+ on a good month. The time your listing sit on the market creeps way up as your properties just aren't getting any attention. \n\nYour listing customers begin leaving. Their neighbors sold on zillow for .025% commissions (thanks to AI sellers agents being able to pump out an entire listing process in milliseconds. ) your neighbors got offers within days, some even hours. Yet your customers are sitting for weeks, months, price cutting  just to get out.\n\nEventually, you have no customers, you lose your rating among RE agencies, your best performing agents begin to leave.. going to agencies that use a hybrid proprietary site, zillow/redfin, and MLS advertisement methods. Your hundred year agency depletes to dust in a year. \n\nOr.\n\nWhat I imagine is most likely. MLS gets quickly snuffed out by zillow who will employ contracts with agencies like centrury21 to list their properties for a slice of expected profits that is far lower than anything required by the MLS. Zillow uses a hybrid of AI agents to take customer share from legacy agents, but also provides legacy agents a service to list their properties for a tiny tiny fee which adds up at scale.  \n\nZillow will become the Google of RE, first using search, then branching out into insane other aspects of RE like underwriting, RE law, title law, document prep. Agents will pay a \"membership fee\". Property managers will pay for their tools and reach to fill rented units.. \n\nIt's endless man.
