I don’t get it! I hate Dick’s (I know, my username does not check out) because the prices are outrageous, the rewards program is awful imo, & I’ve had rough experiences with customer service through online orders. However, the stock is strong, the company seems to always perform so well. Good for them! I just don’t get it. What’s a company/stock that you just don’t get? ",

Less of that corporate bullshit. Their products are ugly, sure, but who cares when they're running deep underground in a datacenter.\n\nOperation is also usually simpler: Dell and HPE offer more features at least on paper, with the premise that these save your time, but these come with all kinds of obtuse restrictions, licensing and operational issues which have in the past caused the worst catastrophes of my whole career. Yes, Supermicro IPMI might be ugly compared to Dell iDRAC or HPE iLO, yes it might have less unneeded features, however it will work and it will work in the future. Supermicro focuses on what makes the product good and reliable, instead of what makes the product flashy.\n\nHowever Dell and HPE are able to charge a premium of their products. Supermicro having a good product might not translate into it being a good stock. I'd say Supermicro suck at advertising and brand management, but they got the product right.",
