  "score": 83,
  "selftext": "SMCI had what I would call a very mixed earnings report. Revenue was in line with expectations but eps was a huge miss, in fact the biggest miss on earnings for the company, falling short on earnings by about 23%. But in sharp contrast to the miss was an increase to full year guidance, which is usually a bigger driver for stock price than the quarters performance (forward looking vs backward looking). Also announced was a 10:1 stock split. The stock initially rose in after hours trading before reversing course and falling. I took up a position in smci earlier this year and have added during dips. Seems like a really interesting company to watch ",

Idk if thatâ€™s why I donâ€™t see it talked about but it seems counterintuitive since people tend to post and comment a ton about positions theyâ€™re down on. Frankly I think the whole AI frenzy caused a lot of volatility as people piled in for no reason, but smci doesnâ€™t really seem to be carrying an outlandish valuation and while the margins are absolutely a concern, raising revenue estimates isnâ€™t exactly a terrible sign",
