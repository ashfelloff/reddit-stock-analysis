  "selftext": "Warren Buffett is sitting on a pile of cash, yet the market’s acting like it’s on steroids. How does this make any sense? 🤨\n\nAre we really going to ignore that one of the smartest investors ever is bailing out while everyone else is throwing money at overpriced stocks? Feels like 2008 vibes all over again.\n\nThe economy is booming - but if it’s so great, why is Buffett cashing out?",

Even if future gains were taxed at a higher rate you would still have more money with those gains than without.\n\nA couple things to keep in mind here:\n\n1. Berkshire is an institutional investor and has access to levers and insights that just aren’t available to retail investors. So the plays they are making probably shouldn’t taken as a model for how to manage your 401k\n\n2. More importantly Buffet has always been about the long term Value Buy and not short term market fluctuations.  More likely, they see good long term buying opportunities in the future (ie economic decline) and want to have cash on hand to make big buys in the next year or two.  This short term bump is just noise to that strategy.",

Literally everything you just mentioned is smoke and mirrors to manipulate your emotions into having you do the wrong thing at the wrong time. I recall a 60 minutes episode around about this time of year in 2008. It was psychological manipulation at its finest. The S&P was under 1000 and they interviewed a bunch of scared working stiffs about to retire whose retirement portfolios had just been obliterated. Think regular joes who had worked their whole life, about to retire next month except now they can't because their retirement money had lost half it's value. They're crying and acting pathetic saying shit like \"maybe I should just sell the half that I do still have because half is better than nothing right?\" If you had fell for it then you would have quite literally just sold the bottom. However, if you had just drowned out all the noise and stayed the course you were whole again in a few years. Since then it's essentially been a parabolic move ATH after ATH. The current environment is nothing at all like 2008. We are literally at All time highs now. It's risk on. 2008 looks like a minor stumble before the rocket emoji to the moon. And finally, why should I now or ever give a single solitary fuck what Buffett does? Tell me how the following Warren Buffets strategy gets me any closer to my end goals. Dude Is closing in on 100 one day at a time. Nevermind the fact that M2 money supply is the highest it's ever been so there's just more cash in the system. And where does all that cash go? It goes to the people who play the game the best. And without a doubt the Oracle of Omaha is one of the best to ever play the game. Maybe you think it'd be a lot more exciting for him to revert back to how he played the market a half a fucking century ago. The flip side of the coin of my afermentioned point from earlier though......The same as Buffett can't help you achieve your goals, He gives zero shits about what you think he should do. In fact, he isn't even aware of your existence. And I said all that and left out the most important factor of all. The ONLY move to make at this point in time if you are sitting on Hundreds of Billions of dollars is to collect your risk free 5% from the govt. Any deviation from exactly that is a losing proposition. Besides, he will probably live another 20 years and when the REAL dip happens he will have more money than you could ever fathom to throw at it. So he's either going for total world domination or he knows he'll be dead soon and he's essentially won everything he could possibly win already. That was a bit long winded I know but if you take the time to digest what I said then you could stand to benefit. Or you could continue to seek answers and get nowhere because you aren't even asking the right questions. Balls in your court regard.",
