You can’t have worse days since the 1980’s in multiple indexes and then be like “Let’s gooo we’re bullish SPY to 650”. Could this be a dead cat bounce? Because it doesn’t seem real that you have the possibility for multiple Margin calls and a 12% crash in the Nikkei and we’re back to normal. Unless the Plunge Protection Team for Japan stepped in.",
