Creating national restrictions for abortion that override state laws, likely focused on a 6 week ban (which is before most women know they are pregnant, a de facto ban). \n3. Tying federal funding to abortion bans.\n\nBet. \n\n>What system would you prefer?\n\nThe one that doesn't result in people dying of sepsis for no reason. That's what is happening right now and will get worse. \n\n>Currently, in all 50 states gays are allowed to be married and there's laws protecting them if they are denied employment or fired for their orientation. Trump never campaigned on any policy to limit gay rights? \n\n*Currently*. Again, you are aware that politicians lie, right? The SC has signaled that they want to revisit the whole thing and this is likely to result in a reversal of gay marriage. You think that rights are secure, but they are not. \n\nAgain, another bellwether. I predict that we will see gay rights be eroded in at least one of the following ways in the next two years:\n\n1. There will be an attempt at least to ban gay marriage or otherwise make it entirely dependent on where you live. \n2. Laws that currently protect people based on sexuality or gender expression will be modified to exclude them. \n3. We will see an increase in the number of laws at various levels attacking freedom of speech and that ban books with queer content.",
