Its expensive and garbage. I couldnt even enjoy it as a guilty pleasure, I just felt scammed. Wasnt even mad, I deserved it. If the burger and fries are not prepared and eaten right away, it just becomes exponentially more worse the longer it cools off. I can eat a random cold pizza I left in the fridge or even from the day before and its stil tastes good. McDonalds burger 20 minutes after its cooked taste like cardboard with ketchup and mustard on it. I havent had a \"happy meal\" at a McD ever since I celebrated my birthday at a location and was allowed to make my own burger as a little kid. Which to be fair, was an epic birthday experience.",

That at least increases the shareholder value by funnelling wealth upward. /s there is the real reason McDonald’s is crap. The people working there have to spend half a day there until they can afford a meal at lunch. If it wasn’t high in sugar/fat/cardboard they’d Probably burn more calories working on their feet all day than they can afford to consume.\n\nSeems like it’s not worth it.

Our owner got reported for shoving a girl into a corner but he never got in trouble, neither did the manager who said the n word, she got sent to a councilor and came back not able to work anymore so she got fired for not being up to par, not what she said. And it's just a few good looking chicks collecting most of the tips on the server end. I've gotta get extremely mad, slam a door, and tell him I quit to get a raise, but they only want to pay people so much before you have too much power and ability to walk out on them so I just left. It's the same with almost every business tho. I'm not someone who wants to be owned. I just wanna work and get paid lol. Not that hard you guys.\n\nLmao I know how to make cash. So you acting high and mighty from a business standpoint at all just makes you look silly, that's what they don't like, they want their get back from our get back and I'ma just get back again and again and again and again until they're all eventually too old to talk like sleepy joe 😂 and then I'll finally have my last get back and then I'll feel fine again\n\nHere's a tip at outback, just leave the sink on after you wash your hands or start cleaning the grill leave the water running for all those hours. It's so fucking funny to watch my owner treat me like shit and then I just turn the faucet on and let it run. Or oops an oil spill all over the floor and run it through his drain in the floor. \"Oopsie\" gotta call someone to fix it now.\n\nSo as an owner 100% watch how you treat your workers\n\nJail time isn't even a threat anymore, that's free rent, wifi, food, a gym, shower, bed, bath and tons of people to communicate work/life with all in one building. I'm about to go slash the presidents tires just to get in. Wont harm anyone. Don't need death row. If so many went at once it wouldn't even be scary, we'd just form new cliques inside and knock off the old ones. Yeah that's gonna cause a fight but what hasn't been a fight tbh.\n\nEat my dust",

Just political campaigns? You would still have info on you working at mcds. Anything outside of your political job towards president would 100% come up.\n\nAlso bro working fries and ice cream isn't working, it's doing fries and icecream/frappes while bagging all the orders. And giving your line instructions on what you need to be done and helping them if they need help, anyone who got stuck on one thing sucked at the job, such as the register no hard feelings y'all. I know it sucks on register too.\n\nBan my message I dare you\n\nTrump pulling up to make one batch of fries will be the funniest shit to me\n\n1983 McDonald's lmfao, they probably had 30 employees in that bitch at a time 😭\n\nTo my 3-5 at 5pm (dinner rush)\n\nLiterally training owners (as a minor) for 8$ an hour in 2021\nCuz owners don't work\n\nI just never showed back up to that job one day",
