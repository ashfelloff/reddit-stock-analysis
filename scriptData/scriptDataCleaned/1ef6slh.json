This is technical analysis combined with \"educated-guess\" timing based on the earnings calendar and the fed meeting this week.\n\nThis is the $SPY 1-hour chart.  \nWe have effectively been trading inside a falling channel since Wednesday July 17. This channel is demarcated by the support and resistance dark red lines.  \nInside this falling channel highlighted in blue are the counter-rallies. They are \"counter\" because they go against the trend, which has been down for a little over a week.\n\nAt the very bottom of the chart is the stochastic ( I use tailored settings for the stochastic so yours will likely look different )  \nEvery time the stochastic has approached overbought territory ( around 80 ) and crossed down in the last couple of weeks, it resulted in the market topping and starting a wave of selling.\n\nWe have completed two waves so far and one final shake out is likely ahead here's why :  \n1- This is the busiest earnings week for big tech, which means elevated volatility.  \n2- Fed meeting coming Wednseday, also means more volatility than usual.  \n3- Buyers attempted to clear a key level of resistance at $547 three days in a row and failed each time. They tried last Thursday, again Friday and for the third time today and failed. This is a key \"pivot zone\" because it was support in the past and has acted as resistance since. It's a \"pivot zone\" because whenever price crosses this level it pivots from support to resistance and vice versa.\n\nAll of this is happening as buyers are running out of momentum. Which tells me there isn't conviction -- yet -- to commit to higher prices. Elevated volatility and lack of conviction always leads to shake-outs. So I'm now anticipating one final shake-out sell off, to shake out all the weak hands leading to capitulation and the beginning of a new uptrend.\n\nBased on the economic calendar this week, I think the most likely day to conclude this 2-week correction and start a new uptrend is Wednesday in reaction to the FOMC. Inflation data has been surprising to the downside, bringing rate cuts closer. If J Powell hints at all that this is the case, the market will love it and we will rally.\n\nIn the meantime, I've taken profit on $QQQ calls that I opened last Friday and I'm just waiting patiently now.",

Let's dig in to this because there are lots of things to be concerned about:\n\n* Rates have been at their highest for 18 years. Unemployment has been ticking up and finally at 4.1%. We'll see what it is this friday. Historically, when unemployment is ticking up, it skyrockets over the next 8-12 months the moment rates start cutting.\n\n* The yield curve has been inverted for the longest ever in history. This is probably the gloomiest thing for the market long term. Once that short term yield starts falling, things will get ugly.\n\n* The Sahm indicator has *just* started flashing a recession warning, the first time since the first huge unemployment spike from COVID. \n\n* GDP however isn't showing good or bad signals yet. That would be the last domino to fall.\n\nWhat is your thesis for a late-year correction?",
