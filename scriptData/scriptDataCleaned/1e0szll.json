  "selftext": "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-plans-delay-robotaxi-unveiling-154306852.html\n\n> Tesla Inc. is delaying its planned robotaxi unveiling to October, from August, to allow teams working on the project more time to build additional vehicle prototypes, according to people familiar with the decision.\n\n> Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk set the Aug. 8 date for the event months ago, and optimism about the impending event has contributed to an 11-day run-up in Tesla shares. The stock fell more than 6% in intraday trading Thursday shortly after Bloomberg News first reported the delay.",
