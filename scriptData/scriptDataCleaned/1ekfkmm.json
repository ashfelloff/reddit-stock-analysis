Secondly market makers are going to price those put premiums sky fucking high because they know everyone's about to trend chase. If you can stomach watching your money disappear for a minute, strap in and go for it but that sort of action isn't for me.\n\nWe're going to see some massive selling off happening. Fuck, it already is, it's bananas right now with Asian markets and futures, like seriously bad juju. No doubt, you could buy puts and make money beginning in the morning. You could also lose your dick on a face ripping rally if the Fed announces anything major to curtail the damage or momentum shifts.\n\nThe time to get into puts was three weeks ago. The time to be cautious is now. Good luck man!",
