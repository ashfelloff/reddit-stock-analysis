So an institution like MS can make insane returns by selling options on either side of the trade … you see the last two monthly Opexs the price dropped hard right before Opex. The whole month they can buy calls early and then bid it up every day by puting a floor under the stock… (buying every share sold at a minimum price ) this insures they cash all these calls … then as they approach opex they can sell these calls and turn around and can buy  cheap deep out the money puts to extend  massive gains on the options side and even if the under stock ends up flats they hve cashed billions in premium …. The profits can then be used to continue to bid up the stock for the next opex and rinse and repeat … long story short until the regards on here stop buying super expensive options premiums the cycle will go on and on and on. So stop feeding them . There are ways to play into this that I won’t discuss here .",
