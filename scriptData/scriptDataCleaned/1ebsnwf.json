An idiot will still be an idiot whether you can compare him to someone else or not.\n\nTrying to turn this around and say \"if people vote for a senile old man over another man, what does that say about the other man\" only shows you're happy to be absolutely part of that division. No i do not like trump but turning it around like that shows your level of delusion over your party. Like I said, you 1st worlders are just plain lost",
