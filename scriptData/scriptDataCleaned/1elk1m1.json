                      "body": "I would tend to agree. LUMN is fundamentally flawed in the structure of what they are today arisen from the legacy of the telco era into what the future is unfolding towards. There is massive intrinsic and high ratio employee to income potential in their fiber infrastructure, the domestic and undersea links, and I would suggest datacenter footprint. It is weighed down by the legacy wireline, DSL, telco, CO's, tech's and trucks, etc. \n\nConsider a scenario where even someone like Microsoft themselves decides it strategic to own that fiber for AI solutions. They might also start to like owning some more DC space for more easily integrating customer assets (colo) in close proximity to their azure regions and add all this to help bolster their CD and use that to differentiate further from AWS / GCP in what they offer for cloud. Buying out LUMN for $20 a share, and spinning the legacy wireline or other non strategic parts of the business to like Frontier or Windstream who can support those kinds of fundamentals involved could make sense. Or consider who else might grab them to split them up like this to get in front of such a scenario unfolding. \n\nNothing like this plays out overnight and is totally just wild speculation so I agree and would not count on much short term and probably levels out around $5 for a while. But by end of 2025 there is all sorts of potential given what intrinsic value there is currently wrapped up in this company. Seems to me like could be a good one to accumulate and hold and would be confident in getting good returns inside of a few years. The good news is their debt is improving, the market is seeing more of the upside potential and creating a more sustainable floor in the price. I think it makes sense to accumulate and buy on dips and / or keep averaging down if you were in from higher points as long as you can hold. And with all this kind of wild speculation good chance will still see some ongoing fluctuations from short term traders on any kind of news as this stock has gained recent attention.",
