The feds have a dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices… But our country cannot handle a recession right now, they are going to lower rates. Probably an inflation is going to skyrocket and then they need higher interest rates to calm down, and then the government will be forced to get rid of their debt. 1.) debt forgiveness, 2.) defaults. 3.) inflation 4.) production boom to make the debt manageable.
