Also, I‚Äôve been buying shares with gains and never did increase position size.\n\nI am so grateful to you. I‚Äôve learned so much and have so much fun from/with you. So much love and all the best!",

Thank you for emphasizing that. I‚Äôve only started writing mine down recently and it helps very much.

I am buying up NVDA calls for SEP/OCT/NOV, while it‚Äôs down, to sell most into volatility ahead of earnings and let a few ride, depending. And SPY was down on Thursday, so I bought a bunch of September calls that I will add to if still up only 10% on Monday, and scale out as they hit 30%, 50% and a runner or two, but still sell before theta gets noticeable. I‚Äôll be selling November ASTS calls that I have already to buy shares, which I‚Äôd do if I didn‚Äôt have the calls, regardless. I‚Äôve been playing ACHR contracts leading up to earnings, and started a tiny position - will see where it is on Monday. I am also playing ENVX but getting out of calls and buying shares for long term. Then just managing the mess I‚Äôve made on a bunch of others, like, HIMS, HOOD, last LNTH call and etc‚Ä¶ selling at various levels of green depending what I want to fund next or where they are. On Monday August 9, I‚Äôll go big on long-dated or LEAPS calls on MSTR (have shares, but trading contracts gave me apoplexy, but after the split seems manageable.) Keep an eye on SPY, always. And writing calls to try to get rid of some biopharma I‚Äôd like out of, as well as 100 game store shares (same, I‚Äôm annoyed with me that I have them, but premium can be great.) Practicing hedging and buying back some contracts I sold to do so last week, aka, mistakes, on ENVX in particular.

Also, with longer dated contracts, earnings will happen along the way - I‚Äôve held NVDA calls bought on dips or lower IV 4+ months out, and sell them as soon as target is met, but *can* hold if it isn‚Äôt.

My brand new hedging practices‚Ä¶I have been writing some calls at higher strikes against volatile positions, and doing the same after the fact on two trades that turned against me to recoup some loss now and cap it later. And I did a straddle in TSLA. Learning more about delta neutral and non directional bets. But really early days! It was like a light went on - if I‚Äôm going to hold to sell at say, 30%, 50% and a runner with a stop loss, why not set it up so that gains are capped that way from the start, so that risk is capped, too. I still have some wild ones, though, and will, especially LEAPS. And, this is not a hedge per se, but understanding the greeks more in depth, sounds stupid, but being very clear what the goal is, and therefore the ideal delta, hopeful gamma and vega/IV over time (like long dated and way OTM to speculate cheaply/with massive leverage vs ATM or even ITM shorter dated calls.) Refining that understanding (I hope.)",
