Light water reactors constitute the majority of nuclear reactors [worldwide](https://www.britannica.com/technology/light-water-reactor), \\~80-90% depending on your source, not just in the US. They have the most robust precedent of all reactor types. [Much of our navy is nuclear powered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_current_ships_of_the_United_States_Navy) in the US, to include \\~71 nuclear powered submarines and 11 nuclear powered aircraft carriers, all pressurized light water reactors. Oh and, [they are parked in major metropolitan areas by the way, like San Diego, Norfolk, Puget Sound, Honolulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_submarine_bases). They generate about the same amount of power as is proposed for these Oklo reactors. I don't know where you got your information, but we have been studying, optimizing, operating, maintaining, designing, etc. light water pressurized reactors for around 70 years in the US alone.\n\nThe theory is so simple, a regard like me can explain. Water heats up, leaks neutrons, power goes down, heat generation goes down, water cools down reflects neutrons back in power go up temp goes up. Round and round we go. Because of this cycle, water is an inherently stabilizing moderator. The important is the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity.\n\nI'll give you that nuclear typically faces a ton of hurdles, but it's about time we come to our senses about its ability to fill the gap between emission generating fossil fuels and long term sustainable clean energy which is just not there yet.\n\nEdit: Adding to this, [around 63 of the 94 operating ground based reactors in the US are PWR (whenever you see PWR, think light water reactor)](https://www.nrc.gov/reactors/power.html)",

That pump was off news that Oklo has a new deal with Diamondback to provide them energy in the future.\n\nThe team behind this, the perfect timing of the merge, and Oklo being the merging company just makes sense. Sam has a vision for an AI revolution (OpenAI, MSFT, etc etc) and the biggest thing holding them back besides maybe money is energy.. If they don't have clean, cheap, scalable, and reliable energy they will all simply fail and the whole AI/EV thing will be dust. Oklo uses fission which turns nuclear waste into energy.  Sam also has investment in the private company Helion which is a nuclear energy company that uses fusion.\n\nEnergy is everything and few seem to understand that. What we've seen so far with EV/AI is literally nothing in the grand scheme of things, it's really just getting started. of course only if there is enough energy to go around.\n\n\n\nReporter: ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs exciting you outside of OpenAI‚Äù  \n  \nSam Altman June 2023: ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre gonna get nuclear fusion to work in the next few years, and importantly not as a scientific demonstration, but as incredibly cheap energy and at global scale‚Äù\n\n[https://stkt.co/LhtUMm2T](https://stkt.co/LhtUMm2T)",
