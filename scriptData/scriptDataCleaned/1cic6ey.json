Company stock prices generally rise after layoffs because they don't have to spend money on the employee anymore. Yes, I know you're thinking but now there's more work..CFOs are ruthless and liars. Our CFO just said the answer to us working harder without backfilling roles is going to be resolved by AI. He doesn't have a very good understanding of the capabilities..other than he can save the company so much fuckin dough before he moves staff to India. It's really disheartening, yet no one ever want to fan this shit in the open. Humbly, I digress, it's time to talk about it. \nEdit: All of this is confirmed by my Vice President, that's how I know about this. So downvoters beware, you're fooling yourself by being ignorant.",

She was MS' Vice Chairman of Investment Banking at the time, and became CFO in 2010.\n\nOf course, changes were happening inside Google to lead to her hiring even before they IPO'd,^† but I think that was the moment the C-suite got serious about turning Google culture around from an engineering collective—where people could work on whatever they thought would help Google's users—and into something more recognizable to Wall Street.\n\n^† Eric Schmidt was made CEO to be the \"adult in the room\" in opposition to Page and Brin in 2001 after Page tried to fire all of the company's Product Managers. I think Page more than anyone else was responsible for defending Google's idealistic culture.\n\nhttps://www.quora.com/Larry-Page-reportedly-wanted-to-fire-all-of-Googles-project-managers-at-an-all-hands-meeting-when-he-was-CEO-in-2001-What-was-it-like-to-attend-that-all-hands",
