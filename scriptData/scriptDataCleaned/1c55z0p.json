If you are prone to bad personal biases like that, then you need to reconsider your approach and find something you can be more committed to that relies less solely on your own opinion. The easiest/laziest way to go about that is to look to outside opinions, only buying stocks that have been thoroughly researched. Look for stocks that have around 50 or more ratings that are at least 75% strong buy and have almost no (less than 3) hold or sell ratings. There are actually plenty of stocks like that currently, like amazon. Preferably though, you eventually want to find a way to kill your biases so you can go beyond that, but it's a good temporary fix",
