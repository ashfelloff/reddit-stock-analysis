If you say on the sidelines at the “top” a year ago you would have missed 25% gains.\n\nI don’t think that works though for buying at 10% down. That’s a fixed figure. If you buy at 10% down and the market keeps going up, you would make more money than those that bought the top and held during the dip. Same for if the market declines — now you’re both holding a dip and if it keeps dipping you’re losing 10% less than the person who bought the top.\n\nSo mathematically this chart makes no sense. And it’s just trying to sell investment services.\n\nWhat it is really saying is: if you bought 10% of the dip in 2008, you’d still lose a lot of money. And if you bought the top pre-COVID, you would still come out ahead of someone who didn’t invest at all. \n\nThis is just too stupid and not worth thinking about.",
