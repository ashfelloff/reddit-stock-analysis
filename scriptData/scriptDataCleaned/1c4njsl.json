  "title": "Trump Media ($DJT) - Discrepancy in Outstanding Shares vs. Insider Holdings and Float",
  "score": 669,
  "selftext": " I've been looking into Trump Media ($DT) and noticed some discrepancies in the reported numbers of outstanding shares, insider holdings, and the float. I'm hoping to get some insights from the community to better understand what's going on.\n\nAccording to the information I found:\n\n* Trump Media has 136 million shares outstanding\n* The float (shares available for trading) is 36 million\n* Insiders hold 100 million shares\n\nHowever, recent reports suggest that insiders have sold 150 million shares. This doesn't add up, as the total insider shares sold exceed the total shares outstanding by 14 million shares.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around this discrepancy. Where are these extra 50 million shares coming from? Are there any recent filings, press releases, or other sources that could shed light on this situation?\n\nI'm looking for fact-based insights and explanations rather than speculation. If you have any credible sources or data points that could help explain this discrepancy, I'd appreciate you sharing them.\n\nThanks in advance for your help in understanding this puzzling situation!",
