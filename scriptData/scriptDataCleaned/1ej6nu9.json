  "score": 65,
  "selftext": "Hi guys,\n\nI hate to be that guy but being a realist and there is a gap fill that is possible at the $505 level. We may see some relief bounces but may retrace in the coming month to the .382 level before starting a new uptrend. This would be a 10.6% correction from the 565.16 top. Last year's correction was 10.9%. Food for thought and something to be on the lookout for. If we breach $528, $505 is the next key level. We are in a downtrend and to reclaim the current uptrend, need a $544 capture and hold. Lastly, we are under critical 9 and 20 day EMAs so it's no man's land right now.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3ztir2b81hgd1.png?width=2456&format=png&auto=webp&s=190ae1d7391e4578eec1101d4f3482f0fe1462f3",
