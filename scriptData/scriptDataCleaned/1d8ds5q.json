      "body": "I'm probably going to be downvoted for saying that's probably going to be against the grain here. But IMO, I think there eventually needs to be some kind of a discussion among law makers about social media influencers, and how they can move certain stocks with malicious intent if they want to (particularly micro & small cap stocks).\n\nIf certain people really wanted to make a quick buck in a pump and dump they've already shown that *if they wanted to*, all they need to do is make a few tweets about a stock that they don't even believe in, and then cash out with a sweet 50%+ gain in a single day. (Note: I'm not saying anyone has done this with the recent meme rallies, I'm saying that some people 100% could do this if they wanted to)\n\nI'm not talking about just one person with the recent meme stock rally. A certain controversial stock picking youtuber who's often mocked for his many bad picks also has (at or least had at one point) the power to move small & micro cap stocks a good bit to. Stocks he first bought into would shoot up at least 8% if not more in a single day just because he makes a video that says he opened a position and why he's bullish on the stock. This would happen despite him constantly saying \"don't buy this stock just because I am\", and \"just watching this video is not enough due diligence and research for you to buy this stock\". It got to the point that he started to build up his positions for several weeks in advance prior to announcing them publicly, because he knew it would get a lot more expensive to continue building out his positions if he announced he was buying too soon.\n\nFinancial influencers (and even the big wall street firms) can't move stocks that are too big, but they can DEFINITELY move smaller stocks a lot. And a bad actor with enough social media influence in the investing space could definitely engage in pump and dumps to make a quick buck from their audience.\n\n... But at the same time, I can't imagine it would be easy to regulate these kinds of situations without being too heavy handed and hitting a bunch of people with no real influence to move the market with a bunch of red tape.",

He doesn't make knowingly false or misleading statements. He makes disclosures above and beyond what the regulatory requirements says he has to.

People warning you that you may be doing something wrong is probably just that - a warning - stop thinking everything is a conspiracy against you.\n\n>...is somehow responsible for people‚Äôs dumb decisions and all the price movement\n\nYes, without a shadow of a doubt Keith's tweets, reddit posts, and stream have caused almost all of the price volatility. This is again, not a problem in of itself. Trying to pretend he hasn't had an effect on the stock price out of some kind of weird loyalty to him is silly.\n\n>stock after hours, that‚Äôs not retail.\n\nAfter U.S. market hours trading is almost entirely retail/amateur and some people doing arbitrage with international exchanges (don't forget about them!). Professionals generally trade at market open and close where liquidity is highest because it lowers implicit trade costs. The only people paying after hours spreads are retail and professionals trying to react to new significant material public information. What happens to prices after hours isn't really important in any case - they are irrelevant.\n\nThe reason why what Keith is doing feels wrong / illegal is because he \\_knows\\_ that there is an army of poorly informed amateur traders that will follow him into the position despite only making vague and tangentially related statements about it. He personally benefits from that - he can sell into the 'pump' - while all these retail traders get left holding a massively over-inflated position that the company fundamentals simply can't support.\n\nI have enough empathy that, even though I personally am not harmed by or stand to benefit from any of this whole saga, it kind of feels wrong to watch this guy fleece retail stock traders \\_again\\_ and to thunderous applause.",

But then it would be extremely expensive to launder through such an active symbol. However, that is not the case for something smaller like GME.\n\nIf GME were being used to launder money - the Feds absolutely would be interested in shutting down whatever is going on. We already saw this sort of laundry shutdown with TornadoCash, a mixer for ethereum, which it turns out was used by a North Korean state sponsored cybercriminal group to launder $147.5M of stolen crypto.\n\nWe live in geopolitically insane times. But terrorists, assassins, and disinformation don‚Äôt come free.¬†\n\nThe way this would be done is that there is some government Evilgov that needs to send money to deep cover operative Sleeper. Evilgov tells Sleeper to buy calls at a very specific time. Sleeper buys the calls and then Evilgov uses its media groups and covert agents to start making the stock moon. Sleeper is told to cash out at a specific time, after which the media hype and purchases stop. The covert agents start to sell, perhaps fast or perhaps slow. Evilgov has now transferred money to Sleeper without any sort of direct financial transaction. The money is now hard to trace between Evilgov, the covert agents, and Sleeper. Sleeper can now use the money to make political contributions to people who are political operatives of Evilgov; pay terrorists, assassins, and disinformation agents who work covertly for Evilgov.¬†\n\nThe Feds can‚Äôt go after Ackman. They can‚Äôt go after Burry. The American legal system believes in innocent until proven guilty. Innocent until proven guilty is also why Sleeper is impossible to prosecute, assuming their comms is secure. But the Feds will try their hardest to shut down a stock trading at over 2000 P/E during a time when there are major wars and documented disinformation campaigns, especially after the American people fell for the disinformation and voted in Trump not too long ago.",
