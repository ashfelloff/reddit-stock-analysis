                  "body": "Yes. Look at past posts on CHWY, they are nonexistent and extremely bearish. That still applies. tl;dr is CHWY is shifting from being treated as a growth stock to a consumer staple one. Consumer staples don't trade crazy high over 10x.  \n  \nSo they are going from trading well over 100x towards the 10x and shorts were fully taking advantage of that and probably playing both sides of the options. When you look at their yearly EPS, they're at much less than $1 eps, so they technically should not even be over like $10 right now, but they are and were. This last earning does not even warrant this. Q before beat by 11c, and this one only beat by 9c. Every earnings their fearless CEO keeps saying the environment is bad and growth is not going to happen killing momentum. The big difference this time was they showed an increase in subscribe orders and announced a buyback. What they are not saying is the majority of those did it because they got a $10 off coupon, and they will go back to prime if they have that already. Also the buyback might be what's fueling this for now, and buying back your shares while the price is increasing is just stupid and wasteful.  \n  \nIt was total manipulation before when it was crashing. This still looks like total manipulation, and a bunch of shorts got burned that held on tight to their bags. Everyone else who covered helped full this rise. It's going to go back down and head towards that staple valuation, but that's going to be when everyone decides to shift sentiment back to bearish short gains.\n\nIf you think it's truly a growth stock again, then sky is the limit. Right now EPS for the last trailing year is $0.18 making the current price a multiple of over 1650x\n\nIf you think it's going towards a consumer staple like everyone has been saying as it's crashed for over a year, then $0.18 x 10 is $1.80 a share.\n\nRide the wave for gains, but don't get caught in the under toe.",
