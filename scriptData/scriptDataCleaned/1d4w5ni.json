  "selftext": "Top proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Tesla shareholders vote against the re-approval of CEO Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package and withhold their support from the re-election of News Corp. scion James Murdoch to the automaker’s board.\n\nTesla’s shareholder meeting is on June 13.\n\nThe report, a copy of which was obtained by CNBC, comes after the other influential proxy advisor service, Glass Lewis, also recommended shareholders vote against Musk’s pay package. Tesla’s board is seeking shareholder approval to reinstate Musk’s pay after a Delaware court voided the package earlier this year.\n\nISS said “cautionary” shareholder support was merited for Tesla’s plans to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas, although the proxy advisor also warned that there are concerns over how Tesla’s board decided to reincorporate and over the “unknown” nature of Texas’s business law framework.\n\nThe proxy advisor recommended support for some shareholder proposals that Tesla management opposes, including one that would declassify Tesla’s board. A classified or staggered board is considered by some advisors to be an effective defense against a takeover bid.\n\n“At a mega-cap company like Tesla, what is perhaps even more relevant to shareholders is that a staggered board can hinder shareholders from holding directors accountable for poor responsiveness,” ISS said of its support for the declassification proposal.\n\nPay package push\n\nTesla has been courting shareholder support in both time-tested and novel ways. The company engaged communications firm FGS Global and proxy solicitor Innisfree M&A to win votes, and has bolstered apparent grassroots support from its large network of social-media influencers. The company also launched a website, VoteTesla.com, and has offered shareholders the chance to win a tour of Tesla’s Gigafactory facility in Austin.\n\nTesla seeks shareholder approval for Musk’s payday and concurrently to reincorporate out of Delaware and into Texas. The company has characterized the Delaware chancery court ruling that overturned Musk’s stock package as unfriendly to shareholders, noting the value that Musk has created for investors.\n\n“Over the last several years it has become clear that Delaware is no longer the right jurisdiction for us,” Tesla chair Robyn Denholm said in a letter to shareholders earlier this week.\n\nTesla has adopted tactics other companies have used in contested shareholder meetings, whipping votes and launching a concerted public-relations effort to win support. While Tesla is not facing any sort of meaningful organized opposition to its efforts to reincorporate or re-approve Elon’s pay package, some shareholders have come out against it. Billionaire Leo KoGuan has repeatedly said he will vote against the package. KoGuan says he owns around 0.75% of Tesla shares, worth around $4.9 billion.\n\nProxy advisor pull\n\nISS and its smaller peer Glass Lewis are an important factor in how shareholders decide to cast their votes at annual elections. Their recommendations are closely watched in contested situations but are not definitive calls. Still, they have developed a reputation for being important bellwethers and seek to advocate for shareholders.\n\nThey’ve also been the direct target of Musk’s ire. Earlier this year on an earnings call, he compared ISS to the terrorist organization ISIL, also known as ISIS. Musk also said they “effectively control the stock market” on X in 2023, saying they had outsize influence over so-called “passive” or institutional shareholders.\n\nInstitutional shareholders like BlackRock and Vanguard, however, do not always vote with ISS recommendations. While voting decisions are generally not disclosed until well after a shareholder meeting, those institutional shareholders have due diligence teams that help them decide how to cast the millions of shares they manage on behalf of their investors.\n\nISS in its report said its prior concerns over the pay package, which dates back to 2018, had not been mitigated and that it “remains excessive,” noting that “the board has effectively only offered shareholders an ‘all or nothing’ option in this vote.”\n\nThe proxy advisor alluded to Musk’s myriad other business ventures such as social media platform X, his AI startup xAI and SpaceX, as another reason why Tesla shareholders should not support the pay package.\n\n“The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/31/elon-musk-tesla-tsla-pay-package-shareholders.html",

If approved, Musk will have the option to purchase these shares from Tesla until 2028, so initially nothing will happen until Musk exercises these options and has to pay Tesla to obtain the shares. Tesla's cash position will actually increase.\n\nAfter that he will not be allowed to sell for 5 years, so although shareholders will technically be diluted, it won't have any effect for at least 5 more years. After that, anywhere between 2030 and 2033, the shares become liquid and shareholders may be negatively affected.\n\nEdit: It's ridiculous that we're on a stocks subreddit and people dont understand how stocks work...

Let's say you own 1,000 Tesla shares. You are holding. Do these shares suddenly no longer exist?\n\nTrading volume != total shares.\n\nMany fundamentals are derived from shares. Earnings per share, price per share, return on equity for each owner since equity is diluted, etc. etc.\n\nIt doesn't need to be actively traded for the value of each individual stock to drop, meme or not. You materially own less % of the pie and you signed away a part of the value of your stock to make up for that $58bn bonus package. The value of that bonus did not get willed into existence out of thin air.\n\nIt's effectively like a stocksplit.

          "body": "TLDR: The fact that the vote on the pay package and re-incorporates Tesla to Texas are happening represent an unhealthy relation between Elon and Tesla's board. They both signify that the board is putting Elon's interests above what is best for Tesla. A no vote on both issues is probably best for the long term health of the company and the value of the company stock. But I don't own individual shares of TESLA, and I'm not representative of the average stockholder. Ultimately it is the degree of their faith in and loyalty to Elon will likely have a huge impact on the short term valuation in response to this vote. \n\nIt's hard to say what will happen to valuation of Tesla, but it's easier to interpret the implications for the health of the company.\n\nFirst, to over simplify the Delaware court's ruling, they basic threw out Elon's pay package because the board failed in its fiduciary duty to negotiate a fair pay package on behalf of the stockholders. In short, when the board was supposed to represent the stockholders, they really acted in Elon's best interests. With this context the current this vote has two important aspects 1) it basically offers Elon the same pay package and 2) it re-incorporates Tesla to Texas. \n\nA positive vote on the pay package will only embolden Elon and the board to disregard their fiduciary duties to shareholders. It reinforces that idea board should do what's best for Elon, and not what's best for Tesla. This is a very dangerous precedent, and in the long run is an unhealthy for any company. While Elon's and Tesla's interests are often aligned, they are not perfectly aligned. Negotiations over Elon's pay is one area where the competing interests are highlighted. But there are other areas where the two interests may diverge. In these case you want a board that does what is best for the company not the CEO. \n\nIf the pay package is passed, then there will likely be legal challenges. This gets complicated because of the second vote on the move to Texas (more on this below). Based on the outcome of that vote, these legal challenges might be heard in Delaware or Texas. There may even be challenges to which court hears the case. If the case is held in Delaware, then I suspect the package will be quickly thrown out based on the prior ruling. If it's heard in Texas, then there will likely be a long drawn out trial with an uncertain outcome.\n\nIf the pay package is rejected, then I doubt Elon will quit despite his threats. Elon owns a lot of Tesla stock, and he has a lot of debt tied to the value of his Tesla stock. If he quits, then it will likely tank the value of Tesla. This will have cascading effects on his personal wealth as his creditors will come knocking. For this reason he's not likely to quit. But if he did, then get out the popcorn because it will be a master class of self-immolation.\n\nIf the pay package is rejected and assuming Elon doesn't quit, then this will put pressure on the board (and Elon) to act in the best interests of stockholders. Hopefully they will respond by negotiating a reasonable pay package. Then there will be a future vote on the outcome. Honestly, this is the best outcome for Tesla.\n\nFinally, the vote to move to Texas introduces additional concerns. Most companies incorporate in Delaware because the Delaware courts of Chancery are the experts in business law. There are decades of business related case law, which makes the outcome of cases easier to predict. The judges and their staff are experts in business law, enabling them to make timely ruling on very complicated matters. It's often far better to lose a case quickly, then to have you assets tied up in legal limbo for years while a case is ongoing. From a business standpoint, the predictability, the expertise, and the timeliness are hugely important. No other state in the USA has the courts that can provide these three things. Texas is trying to establish a similar court of chancery, but frankly those courts are in their infancy. \n\nElon wants to move to Tesla because the Delaware courts ruled against his pay package. But it's not clear that the Texas courts would rule differently, and it will likely take the Texas courts longer to make a ruling. But the real kicker is that Tesla will have to suffer through all the early adopters pains. The outcome of all cases in Texas will be far less certain, the judges and courts will be less familiar with standard business practices, and the cases will take longer to resolve. It's not clear what Tesla gains by moving to Texas, but Elon hopes to benefits by having his pay package heard in a different court. I suppose Texas might offer some companies some minor incentives for being early adopters of their courts. But frankly it's hard to see them being worth the added legal issues. So voting to move to Texas is really a vote to do what is best for Elon, not what is best for Tesla.",

The $50 billion would be nice to have but more it would tank the stock for him to just sell everything for no reason at all. \n\nLosing this proxy battle sets the groundwork for him to rage quit the company and start something new without it seeming as bad. He’s also just fired his top people so he can poach them without consequence from current shareholders. I dunno.
