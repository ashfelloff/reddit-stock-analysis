New generation will regain the performance leadership per core, that they will lose with Zen 5 in a week or 2. Server CPU, specially the one with E cores looks extremely competitive and the one with P cores is designed to close the gap to AMD CPU. If you watch reviews, last gen server CPU narrowed the gap to AMD, this one will narrow it even more or even close it. Then they have Gaundi 3 which will start generating revenue. Plus, most of the fab investment was done, they need to ramp up production. The way I see it, Q3 & Q4 will generate strong revenue in client segment & stagnating revenue in Server segment at worst. So say worst case scenario, 1B per quarter loss, they still have 11B cash. Once they ramp up 20A and 18A processes they increase efficiency and will be back in net profit from Q1-Q2, while still having at least 5-7B cash to burn. Debt is not that bad, they have 50B. TSMC has 30B. \n\nSo with all respect, I would like to understand what scenario would lead to Chapter 11? I do not see how they could have the client and server shrink significantly in next quarters for them to eat the cash and I do not see how a bank would refuse to lend them a few more billion given that debt to equity is only 0.5. Also given the cost reduction measures, I'd be extremely surprised if those are not going to pay off.",

I read the full review of 6780E server CPU, made with their 3nm process and personally I was shocked. It's a more specialized CPU and for the scenarios for which it was designed, it's quite competitive to AMD CPUs, both in term of performance and efficiency. And this was the version with 144 cores. They will also have a version with 288 cores in Q1 2025. And from what I read from reviews, Gaudi 3 is between current Nvidia solution and the one that they will launch soon, which makes it quite competitive if sold at the right price. Bottom line, they have to fail to execute for 6-7 consecutive quarters for them to go into default. I don't see how this can happen. Their 3nm is the equivalent to TSMC 4nm. If I understand well their strategy, they intend to always keep their internal projects on best nodes in house while selling capacity from their retired nodes to external customers. This will change drastically the dynamics of the fab revenue since this will very likely double their life, thus getting them on pair with TSMC for profitability. I think their strategy of splitting the fab and product development is a hedge against competition. If one product is not competitive enough, they scale down and sell the capacity.\n\nAs for lithography, this is all ASML machines and finetuning of transistor design. I think here, if Intel has problems, TSMC or Samsung will have too. Base wafers I'd take it as a temporary problems.",
