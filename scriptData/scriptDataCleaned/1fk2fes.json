  "selftext": "A 25 bps cut would’ve been bullish as fuck because it would’ve shown that everything in the economy was going to plan. That the FEDs soft landing plan was succeeding.\n\nTo me, a 50bps cut, and forecasts of another 50bps cut before the end of the year, and then a total of 100bps cut in 2025, seems more like the FED in total panic mode because they realised they have left it too late and are now attempting to play catch up. The way I look at it, they’ve put all the data together, crunched the numbers and came to the conclusion that the economy is starting to look like it will stagnate and they’re trying by any means possible to reanimate some life into it. \n\nBut will it be enough? I have no fucking idea. Nobody has any idea. The SPY graph today looks like a heartbeat monitor in a hospital scene of a film, clearly no one knows. I’m waiting for the next quarters data. \n\n- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone up, and/or inflation has gone up, without any notable growth in inflation adjusted consumer spending, I’m selling everything and shorting SPY. Hard landing incoming. \n\n- If by the end of the year, unemployment has gone down, without inflation going up a load, and there hasn’t been any noticeable hit to consumer spending, then it’s soft landing confirmed. All aboard the bull train.\n\nBut seriously, until we get a good amount of data indicating how the cut impacts the economy, no one will have an actually accurate idea whether this marks the start of the greatest bull run ever or the mouth of the cave of stagflation. \n \nThat being said, I have no fucking idea what I’m doing and when I was 18 I lost big time on the fucking towel stock so probably inverse what I say idk\n\nPositions - 100% of portfolio is long on SPY. Boring I know lmao",

Now they see dropping wage growth and dropping price inflation (and other indicators) so they start cutting.
