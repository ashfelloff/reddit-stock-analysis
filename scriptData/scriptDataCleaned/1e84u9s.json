  "selftext": "Saw a lot of bearish posts but no positions to back it up. I don't see the company recovering from this kind of blunder. Sure people make mistakes but this kind of blunder is not one that a cyber security company can recover from. Cyber security relies on reputation and trust. CRWD had that as a big advantage in the beginning; now that trust is gone. The irony of paying a cyber security company to protect you only to have them destroy your business far worse than an actual virus/hack attack would is insane. Hospitals were literally not operational; doctors and nurses couldn't check patient data on charts and had to cancel live saving surgeries, airports were all closed down costing airlines billions, hell you couldn't even call 911 for emergency services because that was down as well.  \n  \nLooking at the fundamentals and financials of this company it does not have anywhere near enough in it's cash reserve to cover all the incoming class action lawsuits that will be headed it's way. I see some people saying comments like insurance will cover it all. Insurance does not cover gross negligence. This was supposed to be a top of the line cyber security company that I was initially bullish about before this blunder. Where was the quality assurance? Why was their update not tested to make sure it worked properly first before sending it out to billions of devices world wide? This company is going to get absolutely buried. \n\n[CRWD YOLO](https://preview.redd.it/s11v1jpfgqdd1.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=3223deecc72377148836e1e13bd6979417f2feb3)\n\n",

Larry Williams book at the bottom is solid fucking gold. Technical analysis of financial markets is The Bible for decades and all of it holds true. I think overall ict is the best but it’s also cumbersome and hard. Learn Larry Williams style for swing trading and ict for day trading. Also the best loser wins is fucking amazing. Trading in the zone is older and follows so much of what’s there. I promise you if you never stop learning. You will do decent. So long as you have self mastery.
