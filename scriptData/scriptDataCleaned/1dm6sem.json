  "selftext": "It seems like most people here think that once the fed cuts rates, that's going to be extremely bullish for stocks...something about risk free rate, trillions in money markets, nowhere else to put cash to work, yadda yadda.\n\nBut if history tells us anything it's that interest rate cuts are usually met with a bear market. Why would anyone think that it could be different this time?",

                      "body": "Ok. Did you know that the carry trade in Japanese banks holding US bonds appears to be unwinding over the next year or so? Those banks hold a bit over a trillion dollars in US bonds. \n\nWhen I say unwind I mean they are losing money on the carry trade so are pulling the plug. That means they will have to sell those bonds at a loss. That means they are not only not buying US bonds right now but are likely going to dump a huge amount of US bonds onto the market in the near future. That means the newly issued US bonds will have to yield even more to get people to buy them. That will be a crisis. The Fed will act because this has the potential to really screw up the global monetary system. \n\nHow will that play out? I dont know, but it will act in many ways like a margin call for a huge portion of the global monetary system. It could easily blow up a lot of precarious positions. That to me sounds like something the Fed would like to avoid. \n\nCan they stop it if it starts blowing up in a big way? Probably but it will come at a cost. Remember all those banks that are required to have reserves? A lot of them are already underwater because the bonds they own are worth less than they paid for them. Its already a problem. This is going to make those bonds worth even less. Oh and this isnt just about the US bonds. These guys were doing this with a bunch of assets so its likely to hit all kinds of things. \n\nEssentially the process of unwinding will mean they sell bonds at a loss and then pay back their borrowing from their central bank. They are having to do this because the Bank of Japan had to raise rates and it looks like they will continue to do so until they fix problems they are having. That rate increase is tiny, but the spread involved is tiny as well. The key thing is that a huge amount  of borrowing globally is tied back to this and its going to ripple out. \n\nHas this happened before? Yes. The last time the carry trade started blowing up was in 2008. Google Japan carry trade unwinding and start reading the articles. Its been a concern for the past year but the next big pile of articles are back in 2008. \n\nIf there was one thing you didnt follow before that you should probably start following its this. The estimate for how much lending is tied to this is around $20 trillion.",

That means debt that is extremely cheap to borrow, interest rates back down to the 0% neighborhood, or ZIRP. \n\n\n This is achieved only by QE, or quantitative easing, where the fed creates reserves out of thin air to buy bonds onto its balance sheet from the wall street banks. Only the fed has enough firepower, or theoretically unlimited money, to buy enough bonds to literally push interest rates down to near 0% \n\n\n This is what the markets are anticipating. If the markets get this, the markets will pump. Perhaps initially the markets may have some fear and stocks will sell off on the news of rate cuts. Maybe something will \"break\" that initiates fed rate cuts. But as long as interest rates get taken back to near 0% the markets will pump. \n\n\n What's the alternative? Fed may cut rates but won't take them down to the zero bound. Maybe the fed gives forward guidance that they will only cut a certain number of times and their target rate will be around 3% for the fed funds.  \n\n\n In such a scenario where the markets do not get their easy money dream, where interest rates don't get taken all the way down to 0%, there is a high high likelihood that stocks will crater, or at the very least not do as well as people are hoping.  \n\n\nIf the fed isnt going to print money to buy bonds, where is the demand fir bonds going to come from? Who's gonna buy bonds? The only reason people are buying bonds is if they know the fed is gonna be coming behind them with a firehouse of printed cash to buy bonds. If the fed isn't going to be doing that, then I could see a scenario where long duration bonds actually sell off and yields go up \n\n\n Fed cuts interest rates half heatedly when inflation is already high. Market will realize massive inflation is coming and the long duration bonds will selloff. This woild cause the stock markets to absolutely crater.",

That way, they can fix the interest on the national debt to a rate the Treasury can afford. And they'll pay for this all with currency inflation.",
