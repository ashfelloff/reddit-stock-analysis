I believe the Feds want to reduce it close to 2%, but would prefer inflation above 2% than below it. In the 2010s they struggled to keep inflation at 2% with many periods where inflation was significantly below their target. For example YoY inflation was below 1.5% starting in Nov 2014 and didn't get back above 1.5% until Sep 2016 with a few months in early 2015 even having deflation. This was happening despite low interest rates at that time which, AFAIK, limits the Fed's ability to start the economy. That period of time was a lot like what Japan has been experiencing for the last ~30 years and they've had a very challenging time breaking the cycle. In summary, slightly above 2% is preferable to slightly below 2% because they have more wiggle room to drop interest rates if the economy shows weakness.",

It will also mean the final destination might be a little higher than what market expects, which is around 2.75% right now by end of next year. It might be 3 to 4%.\n\nThe Fed has 3 tools : interest rate, forward guidance, and balance sheet purchase. Even though they haven't reduced rates yet, they have been putting out very dovish forward guidance, easing financial conditions before they even cut rates.
