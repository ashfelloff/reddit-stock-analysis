  "score": 28,
  "selftext": "In Mar this year, NVDA was just completely stagnant and didn't manage to push back into its ATH of $900 until 2 months later. \n\nWhat are the odds we may see this happening again? Or perhaps something even more prolonged? This is what scares me the most. I have long-term calls expiring like 4 months from here out but it still worries me if I'm gonna see everything evaporate if the stock just stays stagnant all the way",

Idk when the weight shifts have to be finished executing by, but I think it might be today and that is why we are seeing such weird behavior with AAPL and NVDA today. It is all to rebalance a large ETF without causing mass devaluation of one of its largest holdings despite a mandatory mass selloff that is being leveled by other big players who have a vested interest in maintaining most of the value of both stocks involved in the reweighting.\n\nEdit: No, I think you're right that NVDA has to close higher than AAPL today for the reweighting. Which is probably why NVDA has dropped today. AAPL would see a sharper drop from its sharp recent rise that is entirely based on its AI announcement that is based on NVDA GPUs if around 47m shares suddenly came on the market",
