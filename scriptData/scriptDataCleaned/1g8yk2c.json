The only one getting *laughed out of the room* is you with these misinformed responses across threads.\n\nTheir 2020 submission was a first-of-it’s-kind COLA, which was an application for design certification, as well as construction and operating licenses. There was no issue with the design (duh, it was tested for over 30 years) or the construction piece- but instead on the operating license due to lack of case studies on potential safety incidents. They will have had three years to work on explaining those scenarios, which I’m not concerned they will adequately address.\n\nThey are already preparing the site in Idaho for construction as we speak. Once Oklo submits next year, they will have two full years to build while they wait for the approval decision in 2027. Following that, they can begin to sell power and capture their first revenues.",
