  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "Listen up fellow degenerates. UNFI has a market cap of $620m but a book value of $1b. It has an average free cash flow per share of $2.9 over the last 5 years. It has stable revenues and reducing its debt over the last few years. This stock is undervalued.\n\nThe company sells whole foods. You poors probably donâ€™t understand how important that is because you eat at Wendyâ€™s. Hereâ€™s a stat for you: eating processed foods kills more people prematurely than cigarette smoking. Eating processed foods kills brain cells (not that you have any to start with), leads to weight gain, cancer risk, and heart disease. You know why you feel like shit? Itâ€™s because you are what you eat. Processed foods have chemicals to keep food fresh by preventing microorganisms from eating it. These chemicals kill microorganisms, think about what it does to your body. Whole foods are here to stay.\n\nTldr: Eat fresh whole food. UNFI price target: $15",
