When you need to apply for a new line of credit or new bank account, just go onto the website and temporary unfreeze it.\n\nIf you have an active freeze, people can't take out accounts in your name -- which is only increasingly becoming more important over time because I guarantee your name, DOB, address, SSN, relatives, etc information is all readily available for someone to buy for a few bucks off the dark web. These processes will probably start to be more and more automated once people figure out how to bot new credit lines for millions of citizen data en bulk a day.\n\nAlso I suggest you sign up for [SSA.gov](https://SSA.gov) as well just to get your account in place.",
