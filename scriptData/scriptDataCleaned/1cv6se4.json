  "selftext": "New to this group; I would characterize myself as a lucky investor who jumped into Tesla at the right time. I don't know a lot about Markets/Economics, just enough to get what I see on CNBC.\n\n  \nI read a lot of doom and gloom in here about a depression/recession; but why is there one that is so eminent? I was doing a little reading recently, no government (In a \"modern\" economy - and a modern social/economic milieu) has carried as much of a fiscal deficit as England did after the Napoleonic Wars. The Deficit they ran (proportionally) was over twice what we're running in the United States.  \n  \nNow I want to be clear about something here; I am not contesting that because we're not as deeply in debt that we are therefore running a responsible economic policy. We're clearly not; but things don't just get worse - they get better too. People are irresponsible, bad things happen - but people change, things change, things get better as well as worse.\n\n Why is it that our country, our economy, and everything else is only going to get worse - and not better? What is the reasoning behind the belief that we're heading towards a recession. Please explain it to me as you would a young child, or a golden retriever.",

We got a preview of things to come in mid April.  About 250B got locked up during tax day.  The absence of that liquidity is what caused the market to fall so hard.\n\nThe market is most likely going to drop from here until the end of the month.  Then, after T+1 kicks in, we'll probably hit the stratosphere.  It's going to be a new paradigm, and I have no idea how high it will get, but 5500 won't surprise me.\n\nUnfortunately, it won't last long.  The higher the market goes, the more liquidity will become and issue.  Moreover, the Treasury will do a little over 1T in new debt issuance from June to Sept.  This will suck out what's left.  We could see things start to unravel as early as late June, and probably no later than August.\n\nEdit: Only -3 down votes? Cmon, you guys can do better than that.

      "body": "There’s concerns about a recession moreso than a full on depression because of rampant inflation.  A recession is a time of deflation. The Fed uses the interest rate to try to tame inflation by raising the interest rate to try to drive demand down.  It has a mandate to keep inflation in check at 2% - but our Fed also has a second mandate of maintaining full employment which is unemployment at less than 4%.  If it cannot reach it the “break glass” action is to send the economy into a recession.\n\nSo all the current talk about a recession is since the Fed has jacked up interest rates the inflation readings have basically told JPow to F-off and have still increased.  This is due to multiple reasons but JPow’s job is to act and our job as the market is to react.  So long as we still have full employment he needs to get money out of the system and find ways to reduce demand.  If he acts and pulls the rug out, the system is fragile enough that demand won’t just gradually decrease - it will fall off the cliff. This is the difference between a soft landing and hard landing.  Historically, landings have been hard.\n\nThe sticky parts of inflation are housing equivalents which they’ve been patiently waiting to see come back down to earth.  It was a little better but not great.  This indicator is extremely lagging as rental lease times are fixed annually and housing equivalents tend to be more fixed.  If JPow was getting impatient the only tool he has left now is to send the economy into a full blown recession by jacking rates.  A few hawks think we should be adding another hike.\n\nPersonally, we’re in this weird stagflation period where the hikes are working, just slowly since there is so much money in the system now.  Once the money dries up we should start to make more progress but the employment mandate might catch up first. We saw it in the last claims report.  PPI data is basically unreliable and useless.  CPI is somewhat better.  The PCE coming up will tell us a lot.  So it’s not bad Powell has been cautious.  The last PPI showed a revision that actually brought in deflation and the difference was more than the first numbers (last Q went from .2 to -0.1).  CPI wasn’t bad at all.",

Since 2021-2022 inflation was so high due to such a rapid increase in the money supply in 2020-2021, the thought by many was that the recession would be severe.\n\nInstead, we have witnessed the Fed pussyfoot around with QT, increase liquidity with the BTFP, and seem to be totally ok with inflation at 3+%. Without the BTFP in March 2023, the world would have entered a massive credit event and recession. The congressional deficit of over 5% annually since 2022 and the illegal migration are no doubt also contributing to both higher GDP and lower wage growth. On top of this, money is very global now, so the printing done since fall 2022 in Japan and China has definitely contributed to asset valuation.\n\nSo I actually think the predictions were right.

      "body": "History major here: there is vast lack of understanding of what caused the great depression. Everyone thinks the market cratered on a Tuesday in October of 1929. But there was a lot of other factors. Farmers and those in rural areas were in a vast recession for most of the 20s. Good chunks of the economy didn't fully recover until the mid 1950s. WW2 certainly bailed out the 1% and eased joblessness however war production doesn't help the economy in a great way. You aren't producing consumer products,  homes, or building infrastructure. We got extremely lucky because none of our cities were bombed backed to the stone age. And all our economic revivals were worse off after the war than before it began. \n\n\nRetail is basically our 1920s farm economy. And it is definitely in a deep recession. Major retailers are pulling back and closing stores while simultaneously the market is melting up. There's deep parallels.",

      "body": "Anyone telling you that what will happen in markets has already been determined is full of it. If that information existed, it would already be priced in. This is one of the foundations of economics in an efficient market (high liquidity, high information).\n\nPeople have been predicting a crash throughout history. Anytime markets run up, there are bears who tell you “what goes up must come down.” And certainly there have always been cycles - but the ups are always bigger than the downs.\n\nSince the brief pandemic crash, the S+P has more than doubled. I think this is why bears feel like we must have a crash to “balance out,” that crazy growth, but that’s just not how it works.\n\nThe best argument in favor of an impending crash is government interference - it’s reasonable to believe that shutting down society in 2020 was supposed to crash our economy, and the only reason it didn’t is because the government started printing money. New money without proportional increase in goods and services causes inflation. \n\nIf things get too expensive for ppl to afford, the government can a) print more money, creating a spiral of hyperinflation or b) raise interest rates to discourage future economic growth and gently reign in inflation. We’ve raised rates several times over several years, from 0% to over 5%, and still have not seen any catastrophic drop in the market.\n\nBears, feeling a drop is around every corner, are wondering when those rate increases will produce the expected drawdown. Nothing scares a bear more than seeing their predictions of doom fail to come true - “the longer it takes, the worse it will be.”",
