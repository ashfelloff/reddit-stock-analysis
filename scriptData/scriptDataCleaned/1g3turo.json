  "selftext": "Dear gamblers,\n\nI'll keep it short, if the world doesn't put all its effort into nuclear energy we are all going to die. So you win or you literally die.\n\nWith the increasing demand for energy driven by AI, all countries will eventually require nuclear energy, there are many options to invest in, from startups like OKLO, as well as miners like UEC, CCJ, LEU also PCG, right now they're up a lot, but I consider that it will be a central point with the growing discussions in Congress to further promote the cleanest energy in the world! and also the most efficient not like wind and solar energy which are basically scams.\n\nBill Gates has a lot of money in TerraPower, located in Wyoming, it's a startup that's not public yet, but UEC is in the same state, being the largest uranium miner in the US. I haven't bought options because I'm not single anymore. Nuclear energy is the cleanest in the world, but its waste is dangerous. Also invest in companies that can handle toxic waste... WM for example.\n\nFrom now on, my portfolio will consist only of nuclear energy ETFs, startups and everything that has to do with nuclear energy. You can also diversify with companies from Kazakhstan.\n\nWith fluctuations in oil and coal prices, Germany (the only country in Europe that we care about) will eventually go back to nuclear energy. This is just the beginning!",
