Was down 10k at this point (noon dip). Then it started going up and I sold all of it at .44 each. \n\nPersonally, the more calls I hold, the more I'm likely to paper hand it for a profit just cause any direction causes a greater change so riskier to hold. If SPY had just hit 547 only, I wouldn't be feeling this bad but didn't think SPY would hit 547 and then actually 548 and then 549 at close. \n\nLooking back, buying the dip could've fucked me over hard cause it could just keep going straight down (had this happen before) but i feel like the market usually V's more often than not right now so dip buying is generally OK. Caveat: 0DTES are already risky af so dip buying is basically praying that it'll V lol",

                                  "body": "I think it’s really impossible to time the top. We could be having the same conversation about how we should have closed out at .44c each or whatever. \n\nGoing forward, if I think that there will be continued momentum, I will still close some of my position to make back my original + a little profit, then set a price target and kind of “let it ride.” The tricky part is the price target. \n\nI think you have to gauge the price action and take a look at the maximum open to high or open to low. On average, in the last 120 trading days, the SPY had a +.9% move every 11.7 days and a -.9% move every 7.8 days (open to high or open to low), even with the upward trend. So SPY likes to slowly go up but drops faster when it does have a red day.\n\nIn setting the price target, I’m trying to take this into account and so I figured about $548 was a good number (a +.8% move from the open), but of course it continued up to $549 and we ended up having one of those rare +.9% days (I think it was around +.97%). That last .17% is the difference between selling for 850% or 1450% gain. \n\nHonestly SPY 0dtes are very easy to make money, but having the right exit strategy is the most important part.\n\nEdit: an interesting thing is that if you _knew_  (or at least suspect) it was gonna be a really volatile day (meaning at least a .9% move in either direction), you could open a straddle about $4 OTM on either side at open and you’ll come out way on top. One side goes worthless, other side will be 8-13x.",

I've been burned before sometimes for \"letting it ride\", but I do agree letting some ride is the best strategy overall in the long run just because of that potential profit that you miss out on by closing out entirely as SPY continues going up. Even just letting a tiny amount ride is probably better (mentally).",
