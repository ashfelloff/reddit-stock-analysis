But look at your hedge as insurance for your investment. If the stock goes up, your calls made money and your puts are worthless (think of them as your insurance premium). If the stock goes down, your calls are worthless and your insurance kicked in (your puts made money).\n\nThis is assuming you‚Äôre gambling with calls that are close to expiring, it‚Äôs not necessary to hedge calls that have months left with reasonable strikes or are investing with a little money. Starting off with options, i‚Äôd recommend just selling calls against shares you already own (selling covered calls).",
