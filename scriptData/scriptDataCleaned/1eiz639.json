Desktop/laptop chips are not a huge deal , people use phones, tablets more. Also server chips and chips used in AI or graphical cards are also more important. Even in desktop their bread and butter they have competition from AMD , companies are also moving to RISK chips like arm \n\n2. They completely suck at Manufacturing, and are way behind TSM in their capability so far they are actually outsourcing to TSM , but they still are trying to save their manufacturing side.\n\nand I am not sold on their turn around plan. They are cutting R&D. I guess if they threw up their hands and said they are giving up on the fabrication side it might be ok, but it seems weird. Their fabrication sucks, to me they should either A. Give up and get out of the fabrication business all together and just use TSM, B. Fix the issues if they want to keep the business and try to catch up to TSM\n\nBut keeping the fab side and cutting R&D and Cap Ex on the Fab side? Sure they will lose less money but its not going to fix their fab side and they will keep plowing some money into it and keep falling behind .",
