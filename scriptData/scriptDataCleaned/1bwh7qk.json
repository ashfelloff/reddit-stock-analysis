  "selftext": "Sometimes... good news is good news.  Interest rates are staying higher for longer - and that's because economy remains strong.  Next quarter will outdo the current quarter.  Buy buy buy!\n\nLoad up on the beaten down stocks - they are going to be making a comeback this quarter.\n\nFor those looking to diversify beyond the typical large-cap index funds/ tickers like NVDA, SPY, and QQQ, I suggest examining the fundamentals and exploring some of the market's subsectors that have been relatively underperforming in the first quarter.  Current environment will support gains in oil (expect it to hit 100 by the summer).\n\nConsumer discretionary will benefit as people loosen their purses a bit, select energy plays that haven't yet spiked, utilities, banks, and cybersecurity should benefit.  A word on cybersecurity, China and Russia are super active in the election year and many names have been left behind. Look also for companies with exposure to the public sector (I won't name the names as they are hated by most!!! - one name I can speak of that combines both cyber and public sector exposure is $ZS).\n\nIdentify the pockets of the market that have been left behind as the select names have rallied. As those large-cap leaders consolidate and stabilize at current levels, which I expect to happen in the second quarter, these overlooked subsectors will present opportunities.\n\nFind undervalued gems before the broader market rediscovers AI.",

It's only been the last 20 years that this idea has taken hold.  In the 1980s we had an incredibly strong vibrant and growing economy with interest rates continuing to go up to absurd rates.  Mortgage rates were north of 10%. We have plenty of room to grow without rate cuts.",
