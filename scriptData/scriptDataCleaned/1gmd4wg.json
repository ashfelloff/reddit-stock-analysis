[Their gaming division profits nearly tripled to 138.8 billion yen](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sony-reports-healthy-profits-strong-085124323.html) and they're dominating in multiple sectors. PS5 sales are solid with 3.8M units this quarter. Their music division is booming thanks to streaming, and those image sensors are selling like crazy.\n\nThe Hollywood strikes hit their movie division, but that's temporary. What matters is they're still projecting 980B yen profit for the fiscal year. Strong fundamentals across gaming, music, and hardware.\n\nThe PS5 Pro launch is perfectly timed for the holiday season. Next year looks even better with Monster Hunter and GTA VI dropping. This isn't just a gaming play anymore - Sony's got their fingers in every entertainment pie that matters.",

Not sure exactly what you're asking, though, but you're certainly not alone, as a number of PS4 players have yet to transition to the PS5. However, I think they will continue to benefit from growth in the network services segment. PlayStation Network, including PS Plus service/ software sales count whether they're on PS4 or PS5. \n\nFrom the Sony earnings report: \n>PS Plus is providing a stable base of earnings as sales on a U.S. dollar basis increased 18% year-on-year. This is due to an increase in ARPU (average revenue per user)primarily resulting from a shift to higher tiers of service and the impact of price revisions.\n\nThis is with the PS5 sales (65.5 million)slightly lagging PS4 sales during the same time period by roughly 2.2 million units. PS5 Pro enthusiasm and holiday deals might help push things even further in the right direction, reducing that gap.",
