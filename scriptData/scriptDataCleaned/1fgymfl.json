  "selftext": "Just a lil yolo & DD to see how far we can go with this, Cava is a mediterranean salad bar style restaurant that has been on a monster run over the past year but is currently trading at an outrageous share price. It generates around 30 million per quarter and has 350 locations YET its share price reflects each of these locations is worth around 37 million dollars. So do they add gold flakes to each salad or give each customer a happy finish after meal? Short answer is NO. They are a common place restaurant in a super competitive industry that offers nothing other than another hyped up growth story and a phat PE that would make any sane bear hard as a 💎. On top of this very in depth DD is the fact multiple insiders have been dumping consistently since there last ER. The CEO was also on Jim Cramer trying to pump up his over priced salad bar chain this last Friday so i figured that was the o ting on the cake and perfect time to short & got in Friday morning. My assumption is within the next year n half there is going to be a cava cave and my hands are solid. \n\nLet’s see how far 30k goes 🥴 also first investment post on this sub after 4 years so hoping the market uses lube.

Cava has no problem selling their food.\n\nMost people who are bullish on Chipotle are usually from suburban areas, and they are JUST getting their chipotles now. I live in NYC, but spend a lot of time in Tampa Florida and other areas. Tampa just got a Chipotle in their downtown and it was this huge fkin big deal. \n\nReminds me of when Starbucks was running for over a decade in NYC and SF and LA, and then other states and small suburbs got starbucks and it was big news.\n\nI'm not saying Chipotle is going out of business, but I can guarantee you growth for Cava will be exponential, especially being a dub 15B Market cap, with tons of upside.\n\nChipotle will be fine, but it def is going out of favor in many places.",
