  "selftext": "On Monday, I went full regard. Decided to go all in on some QQQ calls after that big drop, but cut the trade early after it dropped more, about a 5k loss taken.\n\nThen my genius move was to buy into some YINN at literally the last minute possible (I didn’t realize this at the time until checking trade confirmations). God I wish something held me up for another 30 seconds. It had been running all day and I was confident GYNA would come back strong after a week off. What a life changer. \n\nNow I’ve just been moping around the last few days, wondering what to do with my life lol. Most likely going to join the military and just start over. \n\nDon’t be like me. I would do anything to go back and just put the phone down for the day. ",
