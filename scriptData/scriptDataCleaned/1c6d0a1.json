Contracts I paid 1.60 for are now at 8.99.  \n\nSome people might look at this and be like \"DUDE IF YOU HELD ALL 20 ...\" and those people are poor because of exactly those thoughts driving their decisions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/26h8ki9672vc1.png?width=902&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ba4b07345d4bad789a28136308107ef90ca19c",
