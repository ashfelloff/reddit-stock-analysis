Sold maybe 25% on the first big drop and tripled down on the way up and sold the rest at the absolute bottom and bought a call then too.\n\n  \nI expected a breakout to 562 before the close but I already made so much gain from that play and got tired of waiting so sold it before the drop which eventually rose back up to 562.",
