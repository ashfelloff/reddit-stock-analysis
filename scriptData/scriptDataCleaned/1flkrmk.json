Bigger problem here is there's no point acquiring Intel when the x86 license is not transferrable, majority of the IP would be worthless without the license to make them.\n\nIf Intel's management wants the company to remain independent, they are going to leverage the x86 license like a carrot so Uncle Sam have no choice but to help Gelsinger with his brain dead fab plan that'll burn money they no longer even have in hopes they'll survive till it's profitable. US is better off suing both Intel and AMD on grounds that the x86 licensing condition violates antitrust and force them to open up slots to let other ‚Çê‚Çò‚Çë·µ£·µ¢ùí∏‚Çê‚Çô companies apply for license.",
