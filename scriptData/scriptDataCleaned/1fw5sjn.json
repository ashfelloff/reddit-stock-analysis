It’s predicated on allowing some “AI” system that is clearly faulty to make decisions to tens of thousands of people without any oversight.\n\nI mean, technically we already have that since all medical software is or will soon be going through LLMs in GitHub copilot, and that includes heart monitors, glucose pumps, etc. or that we aren’t already relying on predictive analytics in hospital patient health management systems. \n\nNo- what I expect is that humans will increasingly accept a continually improving, near-perfect “narrow AI” as part of their healthcare the same way they do with most other stuff. Technology with human experts in the loop assisting them making critical decisions- and almost always getting it right, and much faster than a human. Ultimately helping to scale up a precious and limited human labor pool in healthcare.\n\nNot scare monger about how AI might kill someone some day and ooga booga lawsuits.\n\nPush will come to shove",

We can make those decisions right now, we all know what the problem is - it's just that the politicians are corrupt and are bribed to not care and they have all the guns.\n\nSo I have no faith that these automated systems and technology will actually improve the lives of healthcare professionals or improve quality of service. It might - and I really hope I'm wrong and it will - but that is not their goal. The reason is because the healthcare system in the US does not exist to serve patients, it exists to serve capitalism and make money. It just has to be cheaper for the insurers and the medical groups and it will be adopted.",

          "body": "As a resident physician, I am honestly pretty skeptical depending on clinical context. If you give an AI and a physician a completely accurate assessment, full description of symptoms, and appropriate and complete workup (and also in a common format that can be easily and automatically referenced by an AI), sure of course the AI will perform well with regard to diagnosis and first line therapy. Reality is that part of our job (again, depending on specialty/context) is recognizing garbage in/garbage out to such a significant degree that I doubt AI would be able to distinguish, and recognizing nuance that would significantly affect the most appropriate next steps in patient care. AI certainly can and should be used as a facilitating tool in tandem with clinical practice that can make us more efficient (there are already AI scribes that work fairly well, for example), but I doubt it's anywhere near a position to replace any specialty.\n\nEven if a system were to somehow be so advanced that it *could* account for an infinite set of complicating factors and distinguish garbage from clinically relevant *and* accurate details from all interviews, notes, labs, images, procedures, etc. in the chart, there is a lot of inherent danger to trusting a black box decision process. Let's say that a treatment (or a diagnostic exam, e.g. outpatient MRI) is indicated for a patient, but a patient's insurance denies it because their AI system says it's not indicated. That just means a whole lot of wasted time where nobody on the insurance side/during a peer-to-peer may know *why* the AI system says it's not indicated or if the AI simply did not have access to crucial information, but the insurance company might want to employ such a system because the costs saved from denying those diagnostic exams or therapies would outweigh costs incurred by increased burden on reviewing/appealing denials.",
