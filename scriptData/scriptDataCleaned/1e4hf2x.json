This isn't me being sarcastic, they have literally stated this in their decisions.\n\nThey believe the only purpose for donation limits is to prevent quid-pro-quo corruption, literally money-for-a-single-vote. Thomas doesn't even believe in that.\n\nEven better: with the latest ruling, you could pay Biden to veto a law and if the justice department decided to charge him with accepting a bribe, *they could not use the veto as evidence*.\n\nThat's where we are.",

I think that day he just let his ego take over him and he decided to just live a life that causes him pleasure, regardless of who it may hurt. As long as there are a bunch of bros aspiring to be him, cheering him on, he will feel loved and fulfilled in life with billions of dollars to do whatever he pleases. He most likely believes he deserves it and is entitled to the behaviour for everything he's accomplished. He also sees the world through a different lens of superiority.",
