According to their public balance sheet their net assets (including cash) are valued at $580M, and they have $600M in liabilities, giving a net debt of $20M.  So no, they don't have more cash on hand than their market cap.",

          "body": "I think it will be connected networks of different and mostly specialized LLMs combined with some other techniques. It's nonsense to have an expensive Renaissance \"knows-it-all genius\" explain to me how an Iron Condor works, an LLM trained on economy, finance and closely related  topics is much better suited. CHGG needs something highly accurate when it comes to LLMs. I would not trust current LLMs, they offer great support but often deliver plain wrong responses.\n\nIt's a business with an extremely high turnover, which is a challenging business model. On the other hand they sit on a trove of paywalled data already, so they have a huge MOAT and still have over 4 million subscribers and there's a clear demand. I don't think they have fully penetrated the TAM, if I would do a survey I am sure less than 1 in 10 even heard about them. But that's more long-term potential.\n\n\nGurufocus currently says \"CHGG's Price-to-Projected-FCF is ranked¬†better than 96.18%¬†of 157¬†companies\nin the¬†education¬†industry\nIndustry Median: 0.76 vs CHGG: 0.12\". CHGG usually has a stellar performance in November, however September is weak but there's probably a general trend this year with interest rate decision that lifts everything earlier. A doubling in price wouldn't even move the needle when they are 7 times below the industry median.",
