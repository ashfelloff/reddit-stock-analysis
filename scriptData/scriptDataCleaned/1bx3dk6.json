He didn't run them, Harrahs did (at least one of them).   What's typical with Trump, the so-called smart business guy, is he gets into these things with big loans, then has grandioise ideas on making them gaudy AF which requires even more money.  So they ended up with a shit ton of debt they couldn't service with the gambling revenue.   At some point they got investors and sold stock.   So he pretty much unloaded the company and debt etc to the investors.   Meanwhile, he paid himself and family (?) a ton of money as compensation.   Eventually the weight of the debt sunk the casinos.\n\nI also think, again IIRC, that he bought these from larger companies and they saw the writing on the wall with Atlantic city not being able to sustain that many casinos etc. and found a useful idiot to buy them.  \n\n\nEDIT: Some corrections and this isn't exactly right, but is the basic gist.  At least one was sold to him b/c the owner (large hotel chain) couldn't get a gambling license.",

No one with a bag of that shit expects to hold it past the second tv commercial, you dump immediately after the spike and let Fox News zombies fight for scraps when that shit contracts 90% a week later.\n\nTruth social just fucked it up because unlike crypto they actually have to show their financials, also pretty much the whole board and founders were running a double grift inside the company itself, they couldnt just wait to fuck over the normies after the launch so they started fucking each other basically since it was started. \n\nJust like most things Don endorses, Truth social is going to suck money out of everything it touches but Donald and probably put most of the people involved other than Donald in jail.",

That was back when Disney and other large corporations were advertising on the platform. Advertising doesn’t pay the bills... it just helps slow the bleeding. In social media and search, big (stolen) data pools pay the bills. The truth social user data pool would be nearly worthless as it represents niche boomers and sniveling journalists/influencers seeking content to hyperventilate about elsewhere. I doubt the DJT board even knows where to get the people they would need to build big data pool infrastructure into the app.\n\nAll this to say purchasing puts is just as terrible an idea as purchasing the stock. Both are recipes to sit and watch your cash burn to zero. Decay will more than eat any gains at this volatility. If you want to gamble, go pick a crypto coin.",
