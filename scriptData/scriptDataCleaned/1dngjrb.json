But when buying calls you are just dealing with the price of the contracts, not the share price. So because he probably bought them when the share price was lower the contract was worth less, now that the share price probably went up a bit the contracts are worth more.\n\nAlso, a contract is that price x 100. So if it says 1.64, it's really $164 per contract.\n\nHe has 115 contracts, so that would be $164x115= $18860 he paid. And they are now worth $20815",
