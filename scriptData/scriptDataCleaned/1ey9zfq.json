  "selftext": "HSBC analyst raises Nvidia stock price target before earnings\n\nOn August 21, HSBC analyst Frank Lee raised Nvidia’s price target to $145 from $135 and kept a buy rating.\n\nThe analyst sees continued strength for Nvidia driven by underlying AI GPU demand, with “limited impact on earnings from any product roadmap delay.”\n\n“The 2025 AI hyperscaler capex trend remains intact, along with underlying AI demand,” the analyst said.\n",
