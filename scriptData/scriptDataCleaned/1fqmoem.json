So they flooded the economy with mass new wealth to defeat inflation...Corporations lend on longer rates anyways.

The metric I would be most concerned about is total personal debt (which has skyrocketed) and loan defaults (home, auto, cc) \n\nFor reasons I will never understand, most people don’t change their lifestyle when they experience financial stress, they go to their credit card. \n\nFood, fuel, rent, insurance, etc.. It all doubled.\n\nI would time the crisis a hot minute after enough people hit spending limits on credit cards, or lose credit for nonpayment that the news takes notices and starts talking about it.\n\nNews will drive the fear and panic.
