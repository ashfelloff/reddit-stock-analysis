  "selftext": "At this point I think it’s clear to all the mega tech companies are pouring money in to AI investments at an astonishing rate. With that said, very few companies have scaled/monetized anything to see benefit from that investment, but the market has punished segments/companies they deem at risk of becoming obsolete.\n\nFor all the hype and growth in some names, the market has been equally as punishing to others. Curious to start a discussion on what segments you feel the AI impact may be overblown in the medium term. For example small/mid digital education platforms (ex: COUR), CRM software (FRSH), and other software types (PATH, U, ASAN, etc) are trading at all time lows for multiple reasons, but in no small part due to threat of AI disruption. \n\nWhere do you think the market has it wrong?",

How can you trust that to be correct when you have Ai's telling you to put glue on pizza and making objectively false statements? Forget about surgery, no hospital is gonna trust computer vision with something that can lead to a massive lawsuit like this. Nutrition and crops don't benefit from LLMs. That's computer vision, a technology that's been around for years, and plenty of companies have already tried the crop automation and harvesting. So far, none have succeeded at scale. Education, well, ChatGPT already makes so many basic errors that trusting something like it to teach the youth is just flat out stupid. Weather is already a science we have figured out, using super computers. Business development is just a buzzword you've thrown in here, that I can't see any applications of Ai in. Video, art, and sound are areas where Ai is applicable, but even if all these are successful, the cost of developing and running Ai is billions of dollars to provide millions in value. \n\nAi is a bubble because only Nvidia is making money on it. Bubbles are bubbles because the valuations and hype significantly outpace the actual substance.\n\nLarge companies pouring money into things is a terrible indicator of whether it's good or not. Meta spend tens of billions on the Metaverse, and it still hasn't gone anywhere. Google has poured billions into self driving cars, and still hasn't made jack on it. Ai just so happens to be the big thing right now, but until revenue catches up, it's a bubble through and through.",
