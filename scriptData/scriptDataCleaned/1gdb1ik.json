Should I sell it off or keep holding it? Not sure if what surprises the next earnings would bring.",

Buy another stock, hold cash, or pull the profit for use? I’d say take some profits (50% instead of 100% profit) and let some of your gains also work for you.\n\nIf your sentiment toward the stock hasn’t changed, and you feel it will continue to ascend, there’s no real reason to pull the money due to an arbitrary number. If you didn’t sell at 25%, 50%, etcetera, and you still believe in the stock then I see no reason to pull the money. People on here constantly kick themselves for selling a stock too early. No need to reflect back one day (this is all theoretical) and say I lost out on 400% profit because I sold at 100%.\n\nIf you have confidence but want to be more risk averse then sell some. If you can see PLTR at $100 in the future/near future, keep it where it is. Currently over 400% with NVDA and I’ve had no plans yet to sell. I see PLTR going on a similar path. Until news indicates otherwise it’s not the worst place to keep your money parked.\n\nYou could look at putting profits in a less volatile sector. It’s easy to be in a tech heavy sector because the money comes fast when it does, so do the losses. You could look at other stocks that guard against rapid deceleration and volatility when the day comes that tech stocks slow down and market corrections occur.
