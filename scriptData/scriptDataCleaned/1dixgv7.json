  "selftext": "If you were an investor in Okta back in 2021 (or you just monitor the dark side of the Telegram), you must have heard about one of the loudest security scandals Okta had.\n\nThat's the short story for the newbies: in 2022, the hacker group LAPSUS$ shared screenshots on the Telegram, showing they had accessed Okta's internal data. After that, Okta denied all that and said that it was just “unsuccessful attempt”. \n\nBut only a few days later, Todd McKinnon (CEO) confirmed the breach on his Twitter.\n\nAfter all that, not only direct customers were hurt, but their investors as well (obviously). And now they decided to resolve it with investors at least by paying $60M. So, if you were an investor back then, you can [check it out](https://11thestate.com/cases/okta-investor-settlement).\n\nI guess it would be easier to hire Lapsus to their security department, maybe it will solve two problems at one time atp",
