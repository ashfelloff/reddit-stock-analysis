  "selftext": "Like all great things, my FD kill streak has come to an end.  \n\nStarted getting wreckless with a lucky SMCI fd put the eve of the Hindenburg report, went 5x, and I sold early.\n\nThought I was being responsible playing SPY and QQQ weeklies, well in this volatility I was taking +100% on both sides.  The inflection points seemed so easy to read a regard could do it, and I did with 1 or 2dteâ€™s, taking no more than 100% profit but always winning.  I kept banking the cost basis and buying fdâ€™s with the profit, almost every day.\n\nThen yesterday happened, I made like $13k on puts in the morning, $1000 on calls in the afternoon, and then switched back to puts.  Transferred money out this morning, bought more fd puts with the rest, was up 40% on this morningâ€™s dip then got blown the fuck out.  \n\nI hope you bulls get wrecked for ending my streak, but I wonâ€™t have anything to do with it, time to quit.\n",
