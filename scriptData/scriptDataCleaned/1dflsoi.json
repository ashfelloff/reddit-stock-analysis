  "selftext": "US equities for right or wrong reasons [that is debatable] are in a state of Euphoria.\n\nS&P breached 5400 [5433.74 at closing on 13th June] and has delivered a scorching 690 points gain YTD.\n\nMSFT, APPL, NVDA are at >3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe latest data CPI, and PPI has softened [but still at some distance to Fed's 2% target] and the Fed [taking out the uncertainty] only 1 rate cut for 2024: US equities bull appear to be healthy, strong and without restraint.\n\nSelect companies have continued to given strong results [Adobe and Broadcomm being the latest] and so 2024 seems to be a dream year where investors may mint a lot of money.\n\nWhile, this sense of optimism is positive for the equities: taking stock of situation and evaluation portfolio now and then will not hurt anyone.\n\nThese are general suggestions, feel free to adjust/modify as per your risk appetite and investment style:\n\nPortfolio concentration: while tech/AI has been handsomely rewarded [investors who were in since Jan, '24 may be looking at >50% returns], most stocks are now at expanded multiple PE. One may argue there is more room to grow because revenue etc may catch up but if your portfolio is overly exposed to tech/AI: now may not be a bad time to take some money off the table.\n\nAs I had pointed in one of my earlier post: energy, sector may be worth investing at the moment. Other sectors being health and dividend stocks in various sector [Coca Cola, Mondelez, General Mills, and 3M].\n\nDifferent opportunities: seek strong companies/stocks that may have been overlooked by the market [Automatic Data Processing, Illinois Tool Works, Colgate Palm-Olive].\n\nCash: keeping some cash handy to buy favourite stocks at a dip may be a prudent strategy. Companies are being judged harshly during earnings and any mis-step may cause of significant drop in stock price of an otherwise strong company.\n\nTDLR: US equities look strong as ever. However, investors may consider to take some steps to protect their YTD gains.\nKeep AI/Tech concentration <40% of your portfolio.\nFind different/non tech opportunities.\nKeep cash (upto 10% of your portfolio) to buy strong companies after a market correction.",
