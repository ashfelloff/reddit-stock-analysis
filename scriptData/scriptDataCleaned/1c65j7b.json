  "title": "Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",
  "score": 214,
  "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nI do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)\n* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)\n* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive\n* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport\n* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [\"Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia\"](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.\n* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**\n\nIn this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)\n\nIn Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.\n\n**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** \n\nWell, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)\n\nStill, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mlcvvk9a80vc1.jpg?width=1107&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee317bc8a9f6f642f8700f9f67d94014eb03a24e\n\nMusk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** \n\nThese are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:\n\n* 2024 1'950'000\n* 2025 2'280'000\n* 2026 2'750'000\n* 2027 3'340'000\n* 2028 4'150'000\n\nAs you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? \n\n First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late\n\nSecondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?\n\nThirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. \n\nFourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. \n\nIn conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !\n\n**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**\n\nDespite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:\n\n* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)\n* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)\n* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)\n\nThis is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.\n\nAccording to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2\n\nProbably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.\n\n**CONCLUSIONS**\n\nI would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.\n\nMorgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

Your assertion that 'they would have won already' is based on what exactly? Are you suggesting they don't have the video? What's so hard to understand that they have by far and away the most video, but at the same time, not as much video as they need to complete FSD. Is that really so hard to comprehend? \n\n>  basically what waymo\n\nI think at this point, Tesla collects more data in one day than Wyamo gets in a year. Waymo doesn't have the miles other than to somewhat work in very closed environments with lidar and HD maps. That isn't a scalable solution.",

When looking at debt, once should always look at recourse versus non-recourse debt. The debt you are talking about is backed by the vehicles and energy products they sold and are paid back by the purchasers of those products, not Tesla. It is non-recourse debt. It isn’t the same as general corporate debt.\n\nTesla had been aggressively paying off their recourse debt. Matter of fact, their entire recourse debt is now a mere $37 million as of the end of last year.\n\nAll of the rest of the debt is non-recourse debt to be paid off by purchasers of their products ($1.5 billion) That also means their cash balance is truly their cash balance - $29 billion.",

The tesla bears always say the same thing, and then tesla triples its stock price and they wonder why they lost money. Same thing happened in 2023 when they were saying it was going down to double digits. I bought some at 110 and sold for a nice profit at 250. Buying more now at 160.\n\nStock prices move ahead of fundamentals. If you wait until the coast is clear to buy, it's already pumped to near all time high. If you wait until the bad news pop up to sell/short, most of it's already been priced in and it's down 50% from its 2023 high.",
