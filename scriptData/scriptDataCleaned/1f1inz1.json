Though by the same logic if we were to compare to Airbus they have only released 2 new aircraft(1 which is since ended production) since 1997 and both were designed to compete in markets against already existing Boeing aircraft. Designing new aircraft takes decades even on the military side of things but the commercial side of things takes even longer when going through all the certifications. Also airlines do not want brand new airframes because of the cost of retrain and certifying pilots. It's a big part of the reason the 737 Max has issues which led to the crashes was because Boeing was pushing the limits of the 737 platform because Airlines wanted to avoid going through retraining their pilots.",

That's fine if the company is good shit like google which Boeing back in the day it was. Problem is that Boeing isn't a monopoly anymore in either aviation or aeronautics.\n\nBoeing had \"strong ties\" with the US government. Folks in US government got lobbying dollars, campaign donations, and under the table gifts. US government itself got special contracts, a leading/dominant aviation company that remained in US borders under US supervision, and a strategically important manufacturer should another major war break out. Boeing got monopoly status, special contracts, and other goodies/freebies.\n\nProblem is Boeing got lazy and fat from being in a cushy situation. Because of market dominance they took their eyes off innovation and competition. They instead focused on building their moats via government restrictions and maximizing \"shareholder interests\" by cutting costs or doing stupid shit that doesn't keep them competitive in the long run. Happens quiet often (same shit happened to INTC or T).\n\nA repeating pattern is it accompanies some CEO that didn't work their way up via engineering/tech/STEM but it often is some fucking biz major (I'm not being majorist here. I also majored in biz). They kiss ass, use social connections, middle manager tactics, and play the office politics game to get to the top spot. After getting to the top they use the same BS because they think that's what works: \n\nT Ceo had basically a near oligopoly, was paying solid dividends, AND exclusive deal with Apple for iphones. Mofo instead of focusing on phonelines and internet decided to buy Time Warner in one of the worst mergers ever since it loaded T with too much debt. Also bought dish. Didn't have a streaming plan. Also used more debt to maintain the dividend until they had too much debt. Even now the US and government don't have that many alternatives to T but T is so shit it can't make major money.\n\nINTC ceos also had a near monopoly with then AMD being near dead and NVDA being known only by little rich kids with enough money to game with graphics cards. Again, focused not on the tech and being a leader there. Instead they focused on government contracts and fab work. Reality is that's a plus you can get from the US for having fabs here but you still need the tech lead to be relevant. \n\nBA I don't need explanation since most here already know their woes. Same shit. Biz ceo cut capx and research. Quality dropped and innovation stifled. Right as Airbus and SpaceX came around. Even without those LMT/RTX/NOC have been winning contracts with the US because BA is so shit.",

Also I did mention cutting costs being a unifying trait too. However those CEOs never think to cut c-suite pay. Only everyone else. In the case of BA its' the janitor, to inspections, to engineering, to QC, etcetc.\n\n>https://np.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fd1lvhcimowqc1.png\n\nYou can see the exact fucking moment the BS started at BA was in the mid 90s but it really picked up after the 00 burst and GFC as they never went back to capX and instead doubled down on dividends and share buybacks. It's doubly shit since you're not only not investing in what's important (the company for real) but just wanking your c-suite, investors, and company off while not actually improving it. \n\nIt's one thing for Apple or Berkshire Hathaway to buy back their stock because their company is GOOD. Apple buys back with it's surplus cash stockpile AFTER investing in product quality, research, employees, etcetc. BRK buys back strategically when they feel their shares are below market value, can't add new positions, or BRK is better than the market. BA was cutting research/capx, capping engineers, lowering QC, and cutting corners so they could have more dividends and buybacks.",

Simultaneously his ability to generate hype and wealth for employees is unmatched except for a few outliers. Combine those with an exciting project/mission and you have a team that can accomplish anything (even if it’s usually later than his notoriously optimistic timelines).\n\nCompare that with the prospect of working at Boeing out of school. You get to work with a bunch of near-retirees, with the promise of slowly climbing some dumbass promotion ladder, and zero upside to any company stock you receive. Most people who are the type to work at SpaceX see Boeing as the sort of place you “retire” to once you’re ready to put your career in neutral and focus on other aspects of life. So it’s harder to attract and retain good talent, and leadership ends up being a bunch of greedy bean counters who have no real goal outside of draining the American taxpayers’ wallets.\n\nExpect to see more of these dinosaur companies who refuse to change get de-throned by the SpaceXs of the world.

The Boeing's management probably thinks the same.\n\nA while ago, after Musk announced layoffs in Twitter, Google and Microsoft announced layoffs soon after. What does that tell you? Neither Pichai nor Nadella are making any decisions of their own. They aren't thinking about what's the best way forward. In fact they aren't thinking (about their jobs) at all.\n\nThinking is dangerous, you see. If you think, you could be wrong and, if you are wrong you could be fired.
