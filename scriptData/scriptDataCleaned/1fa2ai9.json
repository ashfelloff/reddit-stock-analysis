  "selftext": "Broadcom reported fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday that beat Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings.\n\nBroadcom shares fell 7% in extended trading after guidance was in-line with expectations.\n\nHere is how the chipmaking conglomerate did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter that ended Aug. 4:\n\nEarnings per share: $1.24 adjusted vs. $1.20 expected\n\nRevenue: $13.07 billion vs. $12.97 billion expected\n\nBroadcom projects current-quarter revenue of $14 billion, versus $1.36 per share on $14.04 billion expected.\n\nBroadcom reported a net loss of $1.88 billion, or a loss of 40 cents per share, versus net income in the year-ago quarter of $6.12 billion, or $1.24 per share.\n\nThe company said the net loss for the third quarter includes a one-time tax provision of $4.5 billion related to trading intellectual property rights from one company segment to another based in the U.S. as part of supply chain management.\n\nBroadcom stock is up 75% in the past year as investors have come to appreciate that the company produces several parts that are required for big data centers or can be used to create infrastructure for artificial intelligence. For example, Broadcom works on Google’s TPU chip, which Apple used to train some of its AI features.\n\nBroadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that the company expects to record $12 billion in sales from AI parts and custom chips in fiscal 2024, up from a previous forecast of $11 billion.\n\n“Broadcom’s third quarter results reflect continued strength in our AI semiconductor solutions and VMware,” Tan said in a statement. The company reported $7.27 billion in semiconductor sales during the quarter, up 5% annually. It is still larger than Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, which reported $5.8 billion in sales, much of which is from the company’s VMware acquisition.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/05/broadcom-avgo-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",

If it takes 6-8 years to pay for itself, then that is an investment that beats the returns that most companies will ever see. If this is the case for LLM/Transformer GPUs, you will have to wait at least 6 years before you are convinced of a use case. There are some outlandish claims of 400-700% return on Nvidia GPUs, which I am pretty skeptical of, though that would be nice. \n\nIf you don't think that the huge and increasing upfront investments in chips and AVGO's custom chips are a disastrous financial decision, then don't get mad, short (I don't think this is good investment advice, to be clear). I own NVDA, AVGO, and TSM, and I'll keep buying shares from people who are shorting whenever there is a crisis of the month, while waiting for the Fed funds rate to eventually drift down. \n\nI'm not inflexible though, when AI spend hits a wall and margins trend towards zero, I'll cash in (probably a mere 20-30% lower than the high) and look for more conservative investments.
