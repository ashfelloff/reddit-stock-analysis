  "selftext": "Watched a great Morgan Stanley presentation with the CFO of RKLB last night.  So much to like about the way their business is developing and the level-headed folks running it.  This wasn't part of this presentation, but I spent a good deal of time thinking afterwards about how things might play out for Rocket Lab in the near term.  I wonder if they don't become a target for some company who wants to have an end-to-end, ready-made constellation of communication satellites a la Starlink.   Why not purchase the company that develops, builds, and launches them for relative peanuts; before they really start generating positive revenue and the stock runs up?  \n\nI'm thinking about you, APPLE!  What say you?  Talk amongst yourselves.  Who else might be a natural fit to buy a company like Rocket Lab?  I know APPLE is a left field idea, but heck, they almost went into the auto biz.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vm0mqv7okod1.png?width=758&format=png&auto=webp&s=6191892cdc60774d1fb6405897f4d9f5b8b0c453\n\n  \n",

That company is his baby, his life‚Äôs work and New Zealand‚Äôs pride, that he started building since his 20s. I highly highly doubt someone would ever buy them out. \n\nIf Apple wanted to enter the space market they‚Äôd likely either buy someone else out who‚Äôd be more receptive to an acquisition, or just pull a bezos and build their own space program up from the ground",
