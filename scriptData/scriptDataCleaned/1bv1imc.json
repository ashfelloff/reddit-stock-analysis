This is moot, however, as Apple probably was already working on home automatization to some degree. They work on a lot of things at any given time. What has changed is the narrative. Bloomberg now paints a story about a company pivoting from cars to robots, but likely they had engineers working on both things for a while. Staff from the car team is now being reassigned and so robotics efforts are being reinforced, that's all.",
