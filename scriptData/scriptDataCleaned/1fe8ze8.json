  "selftext": "The consumer price index climbed 2.5% year over year in August, according to data released Wednesday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, this was in line with the last-minute downward-revised forecasts at 2.5% (previous forecasts at 2.6%).\n\nSo, Fed can go ahead with the 50bps rate cut next week? In my opinion, 25bps will be more realistic after this CPI release \\~ but let's see.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Consumer prices rose 0.2% in August with core inflation higher than expected**\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/cpi-inflation-report-august-2024-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/cpi-inflation-report-august-2024-.html)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Prices increased as expected in August while the annual inflation rate declined to its lowest level since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report Wednesday that sets the stage for an expected quarter percentage point rate cut from the Federal Reserve in a week.*\r  \n\r  \n*The consumer price index, a broad measure of goods and services costs across the U.S. economy, increased 0.2% for the month, in line with the Dow Jones consensus, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.*\r  \n\r  \n*That put the 12-month inflation rate at 2.5%, down 0.4 percentage point from the July level and compared to the estimate for 2.6%.*\r  \n\r  \n*However, core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% for the month, slightly higher than the 0.2% estimate. The 12-month core inflation rate was 3.2%, in line with the forecast.*\r  \n\r  \n*While the numbers showed that inflation slowly continued to moderate, housing-related costs remain an issue. The shelter component of CPI, which has about a one-third weighting in the index, increased 0.5%, accounting for much of the increase in the all-items measure. The shelter index was up 5.2% year over year.*\r  \n\r  \n*Food prices rose just 0.1%, while energy costs slid 0.8%.*\r  \n\r  \n*Elsewhere in the report, used vehicle prices decreased 1%, medical care services declined 0.1% and apparel prices increased 0.3%.*\r  \n\r  \n*Stock market futures moved lower following the report though Treasury yields spiked.*\r  \n\r  \n*In the fed funds futures market, traders priced in an 85% chance that the Federal Open Market Committee will approve a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis point, interest rate reduction when its meeting concludes Sept. 18, according to the CME Group″s FedWatch measure.*",

This is all reducing the size of the labor force.\n\n2) COVID caused a bunch of people to change careers, especially in minimum wage industries like retail and food service. This farther shrinks the size of the labor force in certain industries.\n\n3) So the end result of 1 and 2 is that wages have to go up in what's long been lower wage industries.\n\nThere's also some sector specific things driving up prices to, like lack of homes driving up home prices to outrageous levels, and the Ukraine war driving up the prices of certain types of foods.",
