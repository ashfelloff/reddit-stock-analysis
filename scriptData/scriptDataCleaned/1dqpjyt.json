                  "body": "> Sodium ion gravimetric energy density is currently around 130 Wh/kg to 160 Wh/kg, but is expected to top 200 Wh/kg in future, above the theoretical limit for LFP devices. In power density terms, however, sodium ion batteries could have 1 kW/kg, higher than nickel-manganese-cobalt’s (NMC) 340W/kg to 420 W/kg and LFP’s 175 W/kg to 425 W/kg.\n\nSo a bit less right now, but has potential for significantly more in the future. With Sodium cells being as much as 30% cheaper than equivalent Lithium cells, They seem like a decent choice moving forward. It does seem strange that you have Lithium vs Sodium comparisons, and nmc vs lithium, but not much in terms of nmc vs sodium though.",
