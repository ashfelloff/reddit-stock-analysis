  "title": "The SaaS Massacre is Over - $NVDA is a Hold, Loading Up on SaaS Names ($MDB, $SNOW, $ZS) ",
  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "Update. My apologies to anyone who bought $MDB based on my note. This was my weakest DD. I am still staying invested, but not my best call. I have moved hard into $ZS due to the acquisition reporting on top of strong results.\n\n[https://csec.substack.com/p/zscaler-plays-coy-but-is-a-broadcom?r=3xqwa9](https://csec.substack.com/p/zscaler-plays-coy-but-is-a-broadcom?r=3xqwa9)\n\nOriginal note below:\n\nThe brutal selloff in high-growth Software as a Service (SaaS) names seems to have finally run its course. While $NVDA still looks fairly valued here, I've been aggressively buying the dip in beaten-down SaaS plays as interest rate cuts get priced in.\n\n**$MDB** - Initiated a position at $380. Expect this one to start ripping higher in the coming weeks as the easy comps and growth re-accelerates.\n\n**$SNOW** - Bought at $168. Looking to be green on this one tomorrow already and I think it takes out the February highs before summer is over.\n\n**$ZS** - Started building a position around $192. Expect this to cross $200 on earnings and make a run towards $250 later this summer. There have also been some interesting acquisition rumors swirling around. Details in this write-up (long but highly recommend reading):\n\n[https://medium.com/@thonkponk/zscaler-intrigue-in-the-cyberland-8e53ab99dc6d](https://medium.com/@thonkponk/zscaler-intrigue-in-the-cyberland-8e53ab99dc6d)\n\nInterest rates seem to have peaked and with earnings/growth re-accelerating, I think we're set up for a monster rally in high-quality SaaS names off the lows.",
