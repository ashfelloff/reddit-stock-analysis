If you get in on high risk trades and you are losing 1/3rd of your account in a day, i would recommend you make much much smaller trades as you learn, and continue to learn. You won’t learn how to trade in a few months, or even a year. It can take years. As entertaining as it is, you won’t learn shit on WSB. There is a reason the word ‘bets’ is in the sub. It it a fun sub, with many risking insane amounts they can afford to lose (and many that cant afford to lose). But dont put 30K into an account and just assume you know what you are doing. Learn more, keep WSB as a source of entertainment, not for trade ideas or strategy.",
