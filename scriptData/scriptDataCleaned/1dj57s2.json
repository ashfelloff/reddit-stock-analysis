  "score": 51,
  "selftext": "$CELH stock has been doing well this year but tanked in May. All the analysts still uphold their buy rating and 12-month target price well above what it’s trading at now. Do y’all think this stock would be a good investment now and go back up to those record prices ? There was a lot of insider selling back in May which is concerning but again, the vast majority of analysts say it’s a good buy right now. Do these guys ever completely just play the market for personal gain ?",
