Therefore they will be selling more to countries ex china.\n\nIf they sold to china, and china builds a competitor to tsmc and builds their own semi supply chain which outcompetes other companies then that pushes US chip companies to be dependent on china which is a lose situation in the long run.\n\nBasically these events are expected and asml has no fundamental problems.
