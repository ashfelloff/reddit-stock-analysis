  "score": 73,
  "selftext": "I've been seeing the idea of a great rotation floating around -- there's a major shift happening. ‚ÄúThe funds have started to sell off big-cap stocks and instead buy small-cap.‚Äù But is this just more bullshit designed to drive clicks?\n\nThe idea originated when SPY had an unusually bad day at the same time that the Russell 2000 -- an index tracking small-cap stocks -- surged 10% in a week. However, such large jumps are normal for the Russell 2000 index since it tracks volatile small-cap stocks. So this doesn't really justify the great rotation.\n\nHowever, the great rotation idea does seem to capture an interesting sentiment that SPY is overvalued relative to the rest of the market. And with major stocks like TSLA, NVDA, and GOOG all having a terrible week, some people have started to wonder if we are entering a bear market. \n\nWhat if the Magnificent 7 are simply overvalued and we are starting to see some correction now that the earnings are not living up to expectations? Look at their PE ratios: Goog - 24, META - 26, AAPL - 34, MSFT - 36, AMZN - 51, TSLA - 62, NVDA - 66. These companies are priced for incredible growth, yet all of these are mature companies, and some of the largest corporations on the planet. There is not much room for further growth to justify these prices. Google is already hitting the limit of the number of humans on earth. And there doesn't even seem to be enough electricity to power all the GPUs that the market seems to expect NVDA to produce. \n\nIf these giants cannot live up to their growth stories, the price will correct. I don't think it's some sort of major macroeconomic trend‚Äìit's more a micro individual company trend. And since the Magnificent 7 makes up 30% of SPY by weight, bad news in one of these companies will drag down the entire market.\n\nGiven how inflation has been coming down and the Fed has been talking about a rate cut, the party will go on‚Äìjust maybe not for Magnificent 7, since it's easier for them to disappoint than to live up to the incredible expectation everyone seems to have of them.",

      "body": "The pundits always need to keep things churning, because churn is what generates the fees, not the \"research\".  So they have to keep people anxious, and if they're not anxious, the \"experts\" will MAKE them anxious.  The idea of buying good companies and holding is anathema to them and their way of life.  Keep 'em nervous, keep them uneasy, keep 'em moving in and out of stuff. \n\nSo they tell everyone they're not in the right thing, or their right thing is about to be the wrong thing.  And there you have it, \"The Great Rotation.\"  The idea that you have to keep moving between segments of the economy.\n\nPersonally, as an old guy, I've long since gotten tired of \"rotation\" and such.  I've been waiting over 45 years for gold to be the best investment.  I keep hearing about how I should put a lot more money into international stocks because they're \"bound to outperform\" domestic stocks.  The problem is that I've been hearing that same thing since at least the late 80's--and look how much I'd have lost had I followed that advice back then.\n\nThere is no doubt that you can sometimes make more money moving things around.  The problem is that no one is consistently successful at it.  It's easier and much less nerve-wracking to pick good stocks, reinvest your dividends, and do your own thinking as to what and when to buy or sell.  You may miss out on a little bit of performance, but you'll generally do alright, and you'll sleep better.",

Hedge funds are known for employing sophisticated strategies to maximize returns, especially during periods of high volatility. They may buy put options and sell stocks to drive prices down, creating uncertainty and potentially benefiting from the decline. Subsequently, they could buy calls and repurchase stocks after volatility subsides, particularly around earnings announcements, to profit from the rebound. This approach leverages their ability to influence market sentiment and use derivatives to hedge and amplify their positions.\"",
