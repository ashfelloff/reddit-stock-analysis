ARKK isn’t a large cap blend index like the S&P 500 so let’s use Vanguard’s Mid-Cap Growth ETF (what ARKK is labeled as). That fund is up 6.3% YTD.\n\nIt’s one thing to have a high beta strategy that goes up more than the market during bull markets and down more than the market during bear markets. It’s another thing entirely to be down over 15% while the market is ripping higher.",
