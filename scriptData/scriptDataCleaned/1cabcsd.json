Copying my comment from earlier: \n\nOptions are actually a type of insurance policy.\n\nImagine you have around 1,400 shares of META stock, and you're going to use it to retire. But you're worried that in the next 6 months, the price will drop significantly before your plan to start selling the stock for retirement money. Instead of selling the stock now, you could instead buy something like 14 put contracts with a strike price at or around the current price of the stock, and an expiration date 6 months out.\n\nThis way if the stock price goes up, you're happy because now your investment is worth more. And if the stock price drops massively, no worries because your put contract allows you to sell the stock at the strike price, even if it dropped lower in reality. And the only cost of this safety hedge is the premium that you paid at the outset. That premium is a near guaranteed loss in most situations, but it allows you to smooth out bad situations. This should sound familiar because that's how traditional insurance works. You lose a small amount of money to guarantee avoiding a bad situation later.\n\nSo with that in mind, buying short-dated options contracts just means you are paying high premiums on repeat. Insurance policies are DESIGNED to lose you small amounts of money, so obviously those people who spend lots of money buying loads of insurance policies are going to drain their money away quite quickly.",

Yes, it is cash intensive but it should also keep you from blowing 99.29% of your money with nothing to show up for. It will also be boring.

You can make $60 or so, maybe, but it's work and risk for a modest payout. Option gains with a higher payout will usually be heavily weighted against the consensus price on the stock action. The market isn't stupid and professional traders are savvy. They won't buy or sell an option that is far outside of the expected price. Most options will be carefully priced so that making a lot with this strategy isn't a good idea. I've had much better luck finding good stocks at a fair price and holding them.",
