A lot of people may not realize this, but rate cuts always line up with bear markets and big down turns. 2000, 2009, 2019 as examples. As example, think housing. If new buyers see FED will cut rates for next year or two, why would they buy now instead of waiting for lower rates? IE less demand, IE decline in home values. As I am sure you have seen, housing and market correlation has been pretty much in sync as money supply increased.",
