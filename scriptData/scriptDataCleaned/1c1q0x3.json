I’m guessing you have a lot more money now than you did then.\n\nImagine the same trades, just with 10x the money.  Or 100x.\n\nYou can keep every nickel you have in the DUKs and the MSFTs.  Then you’ll have your margin buying power which not only allows you to 3x your equity for day trading, it allows unlimited trades with that equity (no waiting for funds to settle)",
