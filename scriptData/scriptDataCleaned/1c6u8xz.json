  "selftext": "I asked my dad today about his short term view on Netflix stock. My dad, who has decided to hold Rivian shares until 0, has informed me that he thinks Netflix stock will \\*\\*\\*\\* the bed on earnings. I am so sorry to all Netflix bears, my dad will run your brokerage accounts dry. \n\nHe says that its 'because he saw the financials' while working on a accounting software deliverable for SAP with Netflix as its customer. But, when I pressed for more specifics, he refused to elaborate. \n\nBetting against Netflix stock before earnings is no longer safe. My dad buys terrible companies regularly, and gets it wrong about the Mag 7. If you are betting against Netflix stock, your funds are not SAFU. \n\nOn another note, Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count. This investor bank rated one star on Google Reviews has regularly delivered inaccurate stock recommendations to me. The only stock that it has accurately upgraded and downgraded consistently is William-Sonoma.\n\nIn conclusion, it will not be safe to bet against Netflix stock on Thursday. \n\n ",
