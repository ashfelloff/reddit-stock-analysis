  "selftext": "Roast Me: bought $150k worth of Lyft 3 days ago - this is 75% of my money, no more savings \n\nBought it on the hypothesis:\n\n- Public relies on Lyft and Uber for so many use cases (healthcare, work, public transport, leisure, etc)\n- They are the only two successful rideshare companies in US, nobody close\n- Lyft was near all-time lows, yet they reported on good numbers, moving towards profitability \n- yes regulations make it difficult for Lyft to turn a profit, but when they threaten to pull out of city, politicians balk because rideshare is part of the fabric of the economy  (Google Minnesota and Uber) \n- it’s an obvious acquisition target if it stays this low for one of the autonomous companies wanting to purely focus on manufacturing and not demand generation\n- new CEO is from AMZN, look at their stock\n\nIm up >$20k so far and don’t plan to sell until it reaches $100/share\n\nThoughts? Counter-arguments? Let’s hear em. ",

There are two outcomes to your situation as I compare what your doing to gambling. Situation 1....your up 10% now in the positive and feeling that high so u continue to hold hoping for that 10% to turn into 20% 30 40 100 etc. Maybe it goes up a bit mo4e from her3 but then starts to fall back and bleed if the s&p starts to reverse again. Now ur back at even and u say to urself I'm still even ill just hold...weeks/months pass and now ur down 10-20% and u start to get nervous and that sinking feeling in ur stomach and decide to sell at a loss loosing 30k. Situation 2 u make money and book a big profit and suddenly think your nostradomous and can repeat it again with another stock so u do it again except it doesn't have the same outcomes and u loose big. Investing is a slow patient game doing what your doing is just Goin to get u addicted to gambling with your portfolio and when it comes to gambling a big win is far more dangerous then a big loss.",

Extra few thousand a week with premiums, and worse case if you’re assigned it still sells at a profitable price for you. If assigned, just buy back in later when price drops. \n\nEither way it doesn’t risk your current gains.",
