  "selftext": "The US equities market are about to experience a powerful surge in the coming weeks as the participants gets clarity on:\n\n1) US election results (Nov 5): Kamala and Trump have very different ideas on managing economy, international trade , and foreign policy. The market is sitting on the fence (not commiting any more cash and rightly so) till the election results are out and investors know how a sector is likely to perform in next 12-24 months.\n\n2) At least 25 basis rate cut by US Fed (Nov 7):  CPI report last week was benign enough to free US Fed for another rate cut of 25 basis points. US middle class, small businesses, and even investors are reeling under high interest rates. And another rate cut will bolster their confidence to invest and bring borrowing costs lower to spur consumption.\n\n3) Nvidia earnings (Nov 20): Nvidia has been the bulwark of AI sector. Most fabulous amongst the fabulous 7. Its earnings results are likely to give another confirmation of high demand of AI chips (which will lead to higher productivity and efficency) and provide a strong boost Nasdaq returns by the end of the year. \n\nHow to trade:\n\nBuy Nvda Calls at strike price of 145$ with 4 weeks expiry.\n\nBuy SMH ETF Calls at strike price of 255$ with 4 weeks expiry.\n\nBuy VOO ETF Calls at strike price of 545$ with 4 weeks expiry.
