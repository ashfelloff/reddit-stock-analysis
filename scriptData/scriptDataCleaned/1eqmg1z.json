The stock went to 120 after AMD beat... what do you think is going to happen if it itself beats?\n\nIdk why people think the #1 market mover stock of this years upside is where it sat at post split.\n\nExpected price target for most people is $150 by Jan 2025 based on most strike. The moment blackwell gets announced as on track the stock will  squeeze up because all the bad news is priced in.\n\nAlso if you want spy/qqq to rally why would you bet against Nvidia?
