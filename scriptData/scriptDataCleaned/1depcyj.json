      "body": "It's random, there's no gatekeeping: you make money when you're useful, it's hard to be useful as a scalper, so most of the time you ll make money market making: you ll buy too high then sit on it until there s really a huge demand and price recovers and you ll sell too low but sti higher than your entry price.\n\nYou usually get interested in a stock after a big run, and get scared of stocks after a big dump. You're going to have difficulties being an efficient contrarian because the price doesnt follow company fundamentals it follows crowd sentiment. But if you re not a contrarian you ll never make much money.",

I had to lose a bit of money, make a few mistakes, kick myself for not exiting when I should have, &again when I exited too soon.\n\nUltimately after 2/3wks, I'm up ~3k. Considering I started w/under 1k, I'm happy with it....I've also been super conservative. One contract at a time. Eventually I will be comfortable enough with my knowledge to buy in multiples, but for now it's one at a time until I feel better that I know what I'm doing.\n\nThanks again for the intro lesson!! It is much appreciated!!",
