Probably for its App simplicity.. It’s the easiest to use, and I save a lot of money with options trading being practically free. I’ve def had my share of frustrations w them, but all brokers have their own bs I can complain about. The ease of use of their app is second to none which means a lot to me having a busy career & just reading part time. If I was day trading professionally full time as my day job, I’d likely use TOS or something else but for just casual trading; it works great. RH boat since 2016/2017",
