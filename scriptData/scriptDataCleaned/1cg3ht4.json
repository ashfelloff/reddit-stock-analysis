  "selftext": "(Posted originally with percentage, rather than dollar losses and mods removed understandably, so here we go)\n\nOuch. See my original post for â€˜investment thesis.â€™\nIâ€™m still holding though, I didnâ€™t full YOLO to 0dtes or weeklies on purpose here. Figured we might get some wild reaction like this. I think we see a rebound this week after earnings is digested and potentially getting more coverage.\n\nComing from my FinTech experience, this is what I really honed in on during the CNBC interview, when Sara asked about the tech platform:\n\nNoto:\n...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, weâ€™re building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and weâ€™re the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, weâ€™re building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and weâ€™re turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.\n\ntl;dr yolo not looking so hot, but smooth brain still like stonk",
