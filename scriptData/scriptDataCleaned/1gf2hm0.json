  "selftext": "Here’s what im doing just to make extra money every day. \n\nI have a cash account with about 1k in it. Every morning I’m monitoring nvidia and apple mainly and any other big news that could drop. At approximately 945-10am once volatility slows down and the market seems to pick a direction I purchase 20 calls or puts about $3 OTM and set a stop loss. \n\nThen I’m in and out within 2-3 minutes usually once they go up a few cents and boom that’s an easy $50-100. So far this has proven a reliable strategy for lunch money.",
