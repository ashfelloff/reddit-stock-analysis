Not financial advice assuming you degens will do detailed research\n\n**Downside:**\n\n* Stock is heavily shorted and targets by shorts. SI is 76%\n* It is shorted to shits for a reason. Company is accused of fraud, linked to a known fraudster Kahn and is super delayed on its 10K, a red flag. Clearly it is not all roses\n* Real chance this can go to zero if company never submits a 10k or changes their numbers materially\n\n**Why did I still YOLO**\n\n* Well this sub is not called valuw investing. Taking Bets is part of the game and risk\n* Fair value of this company is $50-70. It was around this price before the shorts attacked them. Currently It is at $21\n* Few positive catalysts in the last few weeks\n* While company is delayed in it‚Äôs 10k it clearly said they don‚Äôt expect any material changes to its numbers\n* Filing last week stating they have agreed to an extension with their lenders and will submit the audited 10k report latest by April 29th. So now we have a clear deadline\n* The above two are both in their public filing\n* Well SI is 76%, one of the highest in the market, if things come out clean, a squeeze can be a real bonus here and short term who knows what happens. Again, this all depends on the 10K. But currently no shares to borrow, CTB 90% and Utilization 99%.\n\n**TLDR** ‚Äì Company accused of fraud, shorted to shits , can go to zero, but trading well below fair value, can easily spike up on audited clean financials and a squeeze can be a bonus.\n\nPutting my money where my mouth is but maybe see you behind Wendy‚Äôs in July\n\nManage your risk!\n\nEdit 1: The OI on April 19 20c jumped from 5k to 7k while puts dropped from 13k to 10k.\n\nEdit 2: Clean 10k out LFG!!!!",

I am sure the lender was given some assurances\n\n4. Their auditor has received letters from shorts, I am assuming along the lines of potential lawsuits if a clear audit is filed\n\nAgain this can all blow up, but my conclusion is they will file before April 29th, with some changes, but not material enough hence still blowing up the short thesis.
