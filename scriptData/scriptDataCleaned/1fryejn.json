Although I'd love a slow grind up and a bigger blow off top in Dec. I think latest it would go to is June.¬†\n\n\nIf you're interested follow coinbase app ranking on Twitter. I'm sure you could use that as a basis of when to enter and get out. When it gets to 100 buy calls and when it gets at or near the top 10 flip and start shorting it.¬†\n\n\nI really wish I understood options üòÇ",
