I have deposited and withdrawn on this account throughout the year, took a bit out today but will be keeping it at $11k for now. I trade puts more than calls in general. I short tops and lows, and avoid big green days. Sometimes I will buy calls but more confident shorting.",

Think of it like when a stock is pumping and its breaking a resistance or a previous high, exactly the same but as a short on the opposite side. Also no indicators just moving averages, rarely I will look at RSI but it doesn't really help me its too slow. Moving averages catch up faster to current price especially if you use the 9 and 21 EMA.",
