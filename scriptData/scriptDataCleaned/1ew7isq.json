                      "body": "because the S&P Dow Jones Indices’ SPIVA that tracks actively managed funds performance against benchmarks.\n\n\"Over its 23-year history, the SPIVA report shows that, on average, 64% of active large-cap fund managers fare worse than their benchmark (the S&P 500) in any given year. Some years feature truly dismal performances, such as in 2014 when 87% of analysts lagged behind the index. In 2023, “only” 60% underperformed, a result the SPIVA report deems “benign” considering the S&P 500’s reliance on a rather narrow set of stocks for its performance.\n\nPerhaps this makes investors think that success is a simple matter of choosing the best managers. It may sound reasonable to assume that there are a bunch of below-par managers out there and a simple online search should make it pretty clear which ones you must avoid. But here’s why that’s not the case.\n\nActive managers who outperform the index one year tend to fall behind the next. After three years, only 20% of them outperformed the index. And this doesn’t even mean they do so in each one of those years; it rather means that their total return over the period exceeded the index, but it could have been lower in any one or two of those years. According to SPIVA, no manager stays in the top 25% of all managers, let alone outperform the index for 5 years in a row. Only just over 1% manage to stay in the top half. In essence, those demonstrating superior performance today are highly unlikely to replicate that success in the upcoming year.\"\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/raulelizalde/2024/03/08/active-equity-funds-consistently-underperform-the-sp-500-choose-this-instead/",
