It's strong performance the last decade was because EPS grew at 12% and P/E grew at 7% (plus a small dividend). Now it sits at 50x+ earnings.\n\nP/E isn't just going to double again in the next decade. So without P/E expansion, you're looking at 12% returns from earnings growth plus the dividend. But wait, what happens if the P/E reverts to something more reasonable, say 30x? Or even 35x? Now your returns are in the 6%-7.5% range. Not terrible of course, but that's more along the lines of what JNJ put up the last decade and not what I'd consider a choice for a top growth stock.\n\nOf course, it could keep trading at 50x earnings and you end up with 12%+ returns, but who will be willing to pay 50x for the stock after another decade of growth? How much bigger can they get at that point and will they continue to grow at high rates?",
