A key focus was sweeping reform of Australia‚Äôs industrial relations laws. This saw the introduction of the Workplace Relations Act. This Act sought to move power away from trade unions by restricting their ability to take industrial action. In the government‚Äôs sights were unions such as the Maritime Union of Australia. Behind the scenes, the government met with waterfront employers, including Patrick Stevedores, one of the largest employers on the waterfront. They worked with Patricks on a plan to remove union workers from Australia‚Äôs waterfront, which they saw as dominated by the MUA. If Patrick and the government could take down the MUA, then the hope was that this would set a precedent for other employers to take on the unions.\n\n>The government and Patricks embarked on a covert plan to recruit and train an alternative workforce that would step in and take the jobs of sacked workers. The plan, devised by Minister for Industrial Relations, Peter Reith, involved the training of former and current military personnel in Dubai. The plan was to be kept secret, and was devised outside of cabinet, but the MUA was tipped off in late 1997 and Labor Leader Kim Beazley revealed the plan in parliament in December.",
