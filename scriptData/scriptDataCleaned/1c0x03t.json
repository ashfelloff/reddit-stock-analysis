  "selftext": "First DD so go ez on me lol. TLDR at the end.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNFA\n\nWanna make ez money? Well TSMC’s earnings report on the 18th is gonna be a very noice 8-15% jump on their stock price. I was waiting to put this out until after April 10th because of the Monthly Earnings which might have been impacted by the earthquake, but all is still good according to them so here we go.\n\n \n\n\\-----Revenue-----\n\n1st quarter revenue is crazy good.\n\nJanuary up 7.9%        Y-o-Y\n\nFebruary up 11.3%   Y-o-Y\n\nMarch up 34.3%        Y-o-Y\n\nMarch 2023 was pretty bad last year, but she stepped up big time this year with some very nice Y-o-Y gains.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wz2ovevnvptc1.jpg?width=679&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3870d6e46d62acadea97671aae62ff8afcd370\n\nIn the March 2024 Revenue Report listed above, January to March revenue is up 16.5% Y-o-Y, very good  Y-o-Y gain for a company of TSMC’s size.\n\nIt gets better though. \n\nLooking at 1Q24 guidance from the Q423 earnings report, revenue was estimated to be between 18 - 18.8 billion dollars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x3puidx2wptc1.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=65cd7f1d7db65312681663f9b1048bfa12431280\n\nUsing the above guidance and converting  NT$ to US$ we get about 18.4 billion dollars for January to March revenue for 2024, pretty much right in line with the guidance. I don't have all the info on other more boring stuff, but from what I see, we are pretty solid right now for the revenue numbers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-----EPS-----\n\n \n\nIs TSMC going to beat the expected/forecasted EPS ?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nIf we look at the numbers from last years expected Q1 2023 eps of 1.21, it was beat with an actual EPS of 1.3, and that's with a pretty bad march 2023. And if you remember, this March we have a 34% increase Y-o-Y AND a 7.5% M-o-M increase from February. It's looking very good so far.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/k4r3a1mlwptc1.png?width=226&format=png&auto=webp&s=01d7fd0e12ed8b7a0243290ef47cde2a94764f4c\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe forecasted EPS is around 1.29 - 1.3 right now.\n\nIn Q1 2023 the EPS estimate was beat by around 8.2%\n\nWith a 16.5% Y-o-Y increase in revenue for January to March,and only a 6.6% increase in estimated EPS Im guesstimating a surprise EPS of around 1.4 - 1.45,  beating estimates by 8.5 - 12%.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n \\-----STONK PRICE-----\n\nHow much of a jump am I thinking in the stock price?\n\nOver 10%\n\nRecently Q4 of 2023 had a surprise EPS beat of 5.11% and the stock price jumped from around $100 to $110 over the course of a day. With a better EPS surprise I think we can rally around 8-15% over a day or 2 with the ai hype train going on and the expected 20% growth for TSMC estimated this year by themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBelow are my positions, mostly ITM calls that have gone up over the past 2 weeks:\n\n \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wlu7mh8dxptc1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aad94ad6037143e83407694af4ce38038b69e48c\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n TLDR: NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, but if you want to buy 150  thru 160 calls you should make a pretty   \ndecent profit, 170 if you are feeling ballzy\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

There is so much open interest at 150, 155, and 160. It's gonna be a battle either way.",

Am I willing to bet my positions that it does? Nah I’m not. I’ve been burned by the sideways trading and sandbagging. I say all this while I’m currently up on tsm but have a position expiring on the 19th. Don’t think I’m willing to let the theta get it. (Edit) Will say this, if PPI is decent then it can pump a bit tomorrow. TSM was holding well vs the CPI.",
