So it is even more evident.  \n\nNeo-Nazis use the number 88 as an abbreviation for the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. The letter H is eighth in the alphabet, whereby 88 becomes HH. \n\nYou will often see neo Nazi flags, and tattoos with 88 incorporated into it. And some times it is in association with the number 14, such as 1488. The 14 represents the \" 14 words\" that was coined by prominent Neo Nazi / white supremacist David Lane. \n\nMaybe this is conspiracy-ish, but this seems like a Nazi dog whistle. Musk is to smart to be ignorant to this association and I do believe he is know for putting Easter eggs and clues into some of his posts.",
