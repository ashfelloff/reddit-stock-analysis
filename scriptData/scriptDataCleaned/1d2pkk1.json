I’m going to look at it tonight and add a limit order for a smaller number of shares on an expected move type pullback. I don’t want to try options on something like this for a few reasons. But longterm hold shares, to shore up that area of my portfolio, seems wise. (I am very tech heavy, plus a couple of very speculative positions, have been looking at companies like Celsius, but am nervous about the really expensive seeming restaurant stocks and things that are more subject to changing fashions.) I will say that my local market added an entire new cooler of it recently, and it tasted improbably good! (My son chose marshmallow citrus?)",
