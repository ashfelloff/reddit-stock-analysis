This will keep working until it definitely doesn’t work anymore. \n\nStocks dipped from the highs so I thought I was going to be clever and buy the dip. \n\nBought 522c for .53. Sold 20 minutes later for .20. \n\nFuck it, full send inverse myself. \n\n521p for .88 and 1.00. Cost basis .95. \nSold an hour later for 5.55. \nCould’ve gotten WAY more but let’s take the big W!\n\nAlso sold off my 4/12 521p for a decent profit overnight. Will reevaluate tomorrow again",
