Restaurant margin, as a percentage of restaurant and other sales, increased to 18.2% from 15.7% in the prior year driven by higher sales. The benefit of a higher average guest check and improved labor productivity more than offset wage and other labor inflation of 4.4% and commodity inflation of 0.4%\n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 46.4% primarily driven by higher restaurant margin dollars partially offset by higher general and administrative expenses and higher depreciation and amortization expenses\n\nSix company restaurants and three franchise restaurants were opened\n\nCapital allocation spend included capital expenditures of $77.8 million, dividends of $40.7 million, and repurchases of common stock of $26.2 million.\n\n2024 Outlook:\n\nComparable restaurant sales at company restaurants for the first four weeks of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 8.0% compared to 2023\n\nStore week growth of approximately 7.5%, including a benefit of 2% from the 53rd week\n\nhttps://investor.texasroadhouse.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2024/Texas-Roadhouse-Inc.-Announces-Second-Quarter-2024-Results/default.aspx",
