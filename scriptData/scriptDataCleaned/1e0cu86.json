So you can’t definitively say anything. \n\nIt’s also possible Tesla’s revenue per unit and profit margins have fallen significantly we’ll have to see in the quarterly report. The price per kWh paid for grid storage units has been tanking the last year. Down 40-50%.\n\nhttps://www.rechargenews.com/wind/us-grid-scale-storage-installations-double-in-q1-on-staggering-decline-in-system-prices/2-1-1663221?zephr_sso_ott=8jDk43\n\nSo Tesla may have seen 200% growth in deployed capacity but seen revenue grow at a much slower pace and seen profit margins contract. It’s still early days in more interested in what happens at maturity and that’s likely the same thing as EVs. A price war and shit profit margins.",
