  "selftext": "Before Nvidia we got NVAX (no comparison though, NVDAðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€). \n\nI don't know how much you lost if you were on a Nvax team during the 2020, but I guess it might be quite a lot. \n\nAfter their fail with Covid vaccine, they never hit $200+ since then. I still think that that $1.6B fund from the government and the development afterwards was all screwed up. And on top of that, they had long approval battle with FDA. \n\nI also found that Novavax is paying $47M settlement to \"all persons who were damaged.\" Yeah, $47M with damages of $2 billion (their whole market cap now lol). Anyway, they have quite ok payout per share for this type of payout, though I'd prefer they paid out these 2B. So you can [check it here](https://11thestate.com/cases/novavax-shareholder-settlement) if you had Nvax during the hype, since they still allow to file even after the deadline.\n\nDid you bet on NVAX back then? Where are you now after that Novavax's ggwp?",
