So I shorted the 5,500 and bought 5,470/5,530. And I had to do the 5,490 and the 5,500 independently. That means $3k margin per contract. I am uncertain whether both transactions would require separate margin for you, but for me, they didn't, so it was $6k total margin for the $1k gain.\n\nIt is a risky trade though. It can go wrong badly. Be cautious if you ever do it. I would have lost with a 5,506+ close because I would have lost $5 on the 5,490 and made $5 on the 5,500.
