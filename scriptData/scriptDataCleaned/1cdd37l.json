Trump... touch and go especially with the criminal case (which you can also bet on lol, I'll circle back to that...) but even if Trump kicks it, I think Biden is winning either way so I wouldn't worry about him on that front. \n\nYou can also bet on the criminal trial outcomes too (all of which I have zero fucking idea about the legalities of XD) \n\nI was tempted to bet against conviction on the Florida documents case. Even though it's a slam dunk on the facts (hence the current odds), Cannon seems like she's doing everything she can to protect him. But now No on Conviction is down to +115. If it was still at +400 I'd throw a couple hundred away on it and let my other bets cover it. \n\n +1000 on imprisoned before the election. That's banking entirely on the NYC case at this rate.
