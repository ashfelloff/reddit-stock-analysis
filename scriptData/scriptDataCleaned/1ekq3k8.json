Also, before that split it was below $4, but you can no longer see that price because of the reverse split. You should look further back. At one point it shows it at 400mil for 1 share.\n\nWhenever a split or reverse split occurs, all past data is instantly charged to reflect what the price would have been with the current amount of shares. That's how 1 share of Tops Ship Inc (TOPS) can show being worth over $229 trillion in 2010, more than all money that has ever existed in human history:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uiyriqh5kdhd1.jpeg?width=2220&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=44ba0d1e8a00288101e10c5dc589c0629e314c9a",
