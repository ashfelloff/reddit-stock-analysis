They have money market mutual funds, but your cash is tied up until next business day should you wish to access it.\n\n  \nCurious what others are doing in my boat... active trader who sometimes goes multiple days (sometimes weeks) without making a trade, but doesn't want to not be able to make the trade when the market conditions say to.\n\nHow to earn yield on cash at Schwab without being unable to access funds?\n\n  \nThanks all",
