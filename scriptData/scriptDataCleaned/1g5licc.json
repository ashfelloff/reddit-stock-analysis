  "title": "ASML's sell-off was an overreaction - there would be no high-end chips without Dutch EUV lithography systems.",
  "score": 57,
  "selftext": "Chips with single-digit nanometer transistors can't be made without ASML's extreme ultraviolet lithography systems. The Dutch company has such an insurmountable technological moat that restricting the export of its products is of vital geopolitical importance. \n\nWhoever does not have access to ASML's technology will most likely not be able to produce high-end chips in this decade. Given ASML's pivotal position in the AI revolution, I think yesterday's sell-off was a complete overreaction. TSM's great results reported today show where the journey is going.\n\nDue to the Sino-American tensions, I expect a reshoring of chip production, which means an increasing demand for ASML's lithography systems over the next decade.",
