I did some googling and that found over 2.3 million contracts are expiring this week (July 05).\n\nI don't actually know what this means, but 2.3 million sounds like a big number. And big number of options mean big volumes of trade. And big number of trade means the stock will either move up or down bigly. \n\nSo I did the trade thing that wins if big moves happen, and loses if stock doesn't move.\n\nI guess you can say I'm now a tesla bisexual.",
