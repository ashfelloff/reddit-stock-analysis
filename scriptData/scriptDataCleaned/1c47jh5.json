Meanwhile they don’t seem to be ramping up the semi, and they said they were limiting big battery because of the cybertruck battery needs. Which was actually trending towards a great profitable product. And then there’s the fact that it seems the new battery tech they presented a couple of years ago has not paid off at all. They were supposed to be much cheaper to make (afaik this is not the case atm) and the density was supposed to be up by a lot too(they are barely even at parity with the regular batteries). Meanwhile Chinese battery tech is ploughing everyone including Tesla. \n\nTldr: cybertruck was a mistake and new battery tech is not delivering. And China is genuine competition.",

They build physical things in the real world that require a lot of capital, and based on their valuation, the market clearly assumes that not only will they completely and utterly outshine their competitors, they will also grow new markets or the TAM of the markets they're already in will grow massively and they'll get almost all of it.\n\nProbably a good time to buy calls, but in a rational world it wouldn't be.",

Their purpose isn't to optimize anything, it's to provide a veneer of legitimacy to existing plans that upper management already has in place.

However, if they bring in a bunch of McKinsey MBAs with Harvard degrees to underwrite their \"process optimization plan\" then the dipshit shareholders will be fully on board. \n\nI'd be fine accepting a comically large check to just tell the C suite dumbasses what they want to hear.
