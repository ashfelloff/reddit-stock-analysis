The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*\r  \n\r  \n*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*\r  \n\r  \n*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*\r  \n\r  \n*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*\r  \n\r  \n*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*\r  \n\r  \n*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*",

This is an internal controls issue - they're basically saying that the CEO could easily cook the books because everyone will agree with whatever number he wants.\n\nHowever, E&Y specifically states that there are no disagreements with any accounting principles/practices, nor were there any reportable events. This means that they don't have an issue with the numbers per se.\n\nReading between the lines, they might be saying that the numbers aren't cooked this time, but without doing a shit ton of work + hiring additional firms to specifically check for fraud, there's no way for them to know whether the numbers are actually correct. As in, SMCI's numbers are correct this year but it was just by luck.\n\nBut if it was that simple, they didn't need to resign - they could have worked with SMCI to fix their internal controls for next year with the threat of resignation.\n\nSo my guess is that the numbers are probably cooked a little?

Nvidia sells AI chips to Microsoft, showing revenue and profit, who then leases them to OpenAI via Azure, showing revenue and profit, but most of this money comes from Microsoft/Nvidia's \"investment\" which isn't recorded as an expense.\n\nFor this to work out, OpenAI needs to achieve the impossible and generate an amazing return for microsoft/Nvidia by both insane growth, and a path to profitability.\n\n75% of OpenAI's revenue comes from consumers rather than their API, suggesting that their product is mostly used as a novelty, and that businesses haven't been able to utilize their product at scale to generate value. This is a problem, because right now OpenAI's Margins are very unprofitable, and consumers are very sensitive to price.
