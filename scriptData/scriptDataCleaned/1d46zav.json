  "score": 350,
  "selftext": "I’ve been hearing the rumors that Kohl’s is undervalued for some time now. Today they pretty much hit rock bottom after a terrible quarterly loss statement. I usually don’t have faith in retailers but their case seems different since they are pulling in Sephora and BabiesRus instead of clearing house like B** B*** & B*****. \n\nSephora is up +90% something percent YoY, maybe this haloes into KSS performance or maybe KSS will continue to plummet and I’ve made a grave mistake in holding and buying today. \n\nSometimes I get overly excited by drastic DoD drops post earnings reports but I think there’s a possibility that KSS will move nicely.\n",

As a cardholder, I often get 40% off coupons, and we go in as a family and purchase $1K of clothes and accessories. Some brands are eligible for the discount whereas most in-house brands are always eligible.\n\nThe point I want to make is that on the days when insiders get their 30% and 40% coupons (usually around big shopping days such as Mother’s Day or Memorial Day), the place is packed. Its seasonal.\n\nHowever, my family and I often feel guilty about ripping off the store because sometimes we walk out with $2K of stuff for $500, after markdowns and the coupons.\n\nAnd then the story doesn’t end there. For every $50 of spend, they give you $10, and this is usually timed for non sale days. So, spending $500 gives you $100 cash for spending later.\n\nAnd then, there’s more… if you have a kohls reward account, you get an additional 7.5% cash back for spending in the following month (use it or lose it).\n\nSo, they keep you coming back…\n\nAnd if your family is mostly women, then they have another attraction with Sephora , which is a store within the store, with its own rewards system to lure them back.\n\n\n.",

I know I'm not the first person to realize that you can buy some $2 piece of shit off Amazon and return it to get a 25% off coupon for Kohls. I do think they limit it so if you do it too many times you only get $5 in Kohls Cash. That happened to me before. You just need to chill out a bit and you'll get the 25% off coupon again. \n\n\nAll the stock at my local Kohls sucks ass, nothing decent and I've heard the stuff they stock is B grade quality, which is why it (used to be) cheap. For some reason they keep moving shit around, and I can never find anything I would be interested in because it isnt where it was before. They even move the Amazon returns section from one back corner to the other back corner of the store which is annoying as fuck. \n\n\nThere is no self checkout either. Instead, they have senior citizens working the registers that are slow as fuck. Half the time they're just shooting the shit with customers or each other when they need to be ringing people up. I dread going there because I know if I'm buying something then I'm going to wait 10-20 minutes just to check out.\n\n\nPuts on Kohls because the shopping experience sucks and everything is B grade quality that's overpriced. ",

It's freaking GOAT to just park at Kohl's and stroll over to In-N-Out.\n\nShort-term, I'm buying calls on Kohl's for their easy Double-Double access. Long term, I'm buying calls on the zillions of condos they're inevitably going to develop on that parking lot after the Kohl's is torn out.
