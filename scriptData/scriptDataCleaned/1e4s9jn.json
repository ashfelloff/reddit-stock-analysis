It seems like Intel does a lot of things, but they get beaten by more specialized competitors in each area. GPUs they get beaten by Nvidia, CPUs they get beaten by AMD, Founderies they get beat by TSMC. Doesn't really sound cheap to me. A hurt dinosaur with the potential to turn around should more likely sit in the 15-20 P/E range.",
