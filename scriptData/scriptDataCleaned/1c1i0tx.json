The DR for UHC is in a rough spot. Govt regulation and regulatory scrutiny. \n\n\nPlus UHC loans have predatory terms and I’d be projecting a bit but it looks bad when you get hacked.

          "body": "UNH is a payer thus while is seems their main customers are us as human beings with UHC insurance, the money is really exchanged between UNH (Payer) -> Providers(Doctors, Dentists, etc.) both public and private. \n\nBut it doesn’t stop their UNH/UHC is “goat’ed” because not only because they are Payer, they are a PBM (control supply, cost, and reimbursements of medications), they’re also a clearinghouse (providers submit bills , UNH validates insurance, give back money through reimbursement, this is what Change Healthcare is), and they are an actual provider (Doctors work under UHc umbrella).\n\n\nSo through acquisition they’re built an insanely tyrannical monopoly .\nThey’re vertically integrated out the ass. \n\n\nSo when you ask demographics… it’s the above and for seven weeks UHC was down. 1/3 of medical claims, 63B transactions a year … do the math ya know?!? and once HHS stepped in to help get money to Medicare providers (ignoring private) , you have to think that businesses absolutely had to switch to keep cash flow going , because what’s the other option? No one was getting paid for six weeks  and the paltry loans don’t really cover everything. \n\n\nSo for example, I’m Sam’s Pharmacy. I’ve worked with UNH and I submitted about $100k a month in reimbursements. I have the customer pay, but that money really goes to UHC and they decide how much they reimburse and give back. So that $100k might be $300k but the pharmacy only gets a 1/3.\n\nBecause the pharmacy has to wait on UHC (since they were the ones paid at the checkout) to give them money back. \n\n\nDuring the hack, UHC goes do and tell me to submit paper invoices, but guess what they don’t respond because the system is down. So after a week , Sam’s cash flow is drying up and I’m desperate so I hear UNH is offering loans “. \n\n\nGuess what! They offer me 2-3% of my historical claims… wait $2-3k from $100k !?!? Plus they have terms that I have to pay within 8 days of demanding. Well even if I signed up, they system was launched but broken for a week. \n\nSo what would you do? Take an insulting low offer and go bankrupt OR switch off UHC and say screw them? \n\n\nI’ve already talked to friends in the industry, it was either switch or go bankrupt….",

Even though it’s down, the companies need to hedge the cost and time of switching v just waiting it out. If you’re that broke, you probably won’t have the additional funds to bring in the consultants to switch from CHC.  It’s one of the unfortunate things UNH is banking on throughout all of this.  From experience and last I read somewhere to integrate and send a test claim takes like 3 months if you wanted to switch.\n\nI’m with you that I expect this to tank the stock.  Between the lawsuits and fines and costs to remediate they will need to take a huge charge off.  What would really make me happy though would be if DOJ steps in and orders them to separate the Optum/CHC business from the core carrier functions and break up the companies.  They’ve basically have created a monopoly where if you take their insurance you’re forced to work with CHC/Optum.",
