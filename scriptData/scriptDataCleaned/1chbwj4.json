Wait times for drive through go up. All the employees are done with Starbucks. Mental health down the drain. They could CARE less about making your drink because all Starbucks employees are just fed up with the company at this point \n\nWhen your employees suffer so will your business. \n\nStarbucks just started a new policy, \"fuck customer connection get them in and out as fast as possible\" \n\nThey are scrambling to raise profits while slashing employees compensation by forcing stores to run short staffed. \n\nAlso doing things like releasing a new drink that's ....
