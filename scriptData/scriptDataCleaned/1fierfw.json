  "score": 291,
  "selftext": "Intel shares jumped almost 10% in extended trading on Monday after the company said it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital.\n\nAs part of CEO Pat Gelsinger’s effort to turn around the struggling chipmaker, Intel said in a memo to employees that it will also sell off part of its stake in Altera.\n\nGelsinger said the restructuring would allow Foundry to “evaluate independent sources of funding,” and comes days after Intel’s board met to assess the direction and future of the company. The foundry business, which Intel plans to use to manufacture chips for other customers, has been a big drag on its bottom line, with the company spending roughly $25 billion on it for the last two years.\n\nBeyond just considering outside funding, Intel is weighing whether to spin off the foundry business, possibly into a separate publicly traded company, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named to discuss confidential information.\n\nWith a standalone “operating board” and a cleaner corporate structure, the mechanics of a separation become far easier than trying to turn a fully-integrated unit into a separate company.\n\nIntel has lost almost 60% of its value this year, as the company has lost market share in its core PC and data center market and watched Nvidia run away with the market for chips that power artificial intelligence workloads. Last month, Intel reported disappointing quarterly results, sparking the sharpest selloff in 50 years, and said it would lay off over 15% of its workforce as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.\n\nIntel will also pause its fab efforts in Poland and Germany “by approximately two years based on anticipated market demand,” Gelsinger said. The chipmaker will also pull back on its plans for its Malaysian factory. U.S. manufacturing projects will remain unaffected, the company said.\n\nThe company is also roughly halfway towards the layoffs announced in August, Gelsinger said.\n\nIntel also announced on Monday that it had entered into a deal with Amazon Web Services to produce custom chips for AI.\n\nThe move is a vote of confidence in Intel’s quest to manufacture custom chips for companies in its foundry business, in addition to designing its own products.\n\nIt extends a long-running partnership between the two companies. Amazon is a large end customer of Intel chips to power its AWS servers, and will buy a custom Xeon processor from Intel as well, Intel said.\n\nIt also will allow Intel a new foothold in the growing industry for AI server chips. While Intel has several products that can be used for AI, including one called Gaudi 3, Nvidia has largely taken control of the market.\n\nAmazon has developed its own AI chips, including one called Trainium, for over five years. Companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google have invested heavily in custom chips to run AI in hopes that theirs would be less expensive or offer other advantages over than Nvidia’s general-purpose GPUs.\n\nThe company said that the chips would be made on the company’s 18A process, which is expected to be used in production in 2025. Analysts expect the manufacturing technology to be similar to TSMC’s forthcoming 2nm process. (The first chips using TSMC’s 3nm process are shipping now in Apple’s iPhone.)\n\nIntel said that it would perform its most advanced manufacturing, including the AI chip for AWS, at its plant in Ohio that’s currently under construction.\n\n“All eyes will remain on us. We need to fight for every inch and execute better than ever before. Because that’s the only way to quiet our critics and deliver the results we know we’re capable of achieving,” Gelsinger said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/16/intel-turns-foundry-business-into-subsidiary-weighs-outside-funding.html",

                          "body": "Lol \"they don't design good chips\". As if most consumers, or investors know anything about fabrication. \n\n  \nTheir chips are still on par with AMDs albeit with more power in some use cases. So unless AMD is also making trash, you are talking out of your ass here. \n\n  \nIntel has long since been oversold this year out of panic and a lack of underestanding of the semiconductor industry past the latest quarter. Intel still leads AMD in some technical areas and also in nameshare. They aren't just going to disappear. Also in a lot of smaller eastern countries, Intel is significantly cheaper than AMD and maintains market dominance there as a result.\n\n  \nThey aren't just going to disappear. Look at Carvanna last year to see a similar market overreaction. 4-5 years isn't a long time for a company like them. It is a typical product development cycle. They missed cadence on one and pivoted the node, AMD nearly missed on 3 consecutively. \n\n  \nI think you need to re-evaluate your assessment of them. I told folks when it was at $18 it was an market exaggeration and you would have your money back in a couple months. I made mine back, and I'll keep averaging down when the doomers tell me the company that led the last 15 years in computing can't turn around one bad node. \n\n  \nGranted manufacturing at smaller and smaller scales will become exponentially more difficult due to physical molecular limitations, it's not impossible. I am bullish on Intel.",

They beat AMD on price in a ton of them because their 18nm and 14nm offerings still have comparable single core speeds to AMD. It took them a decade to catch Intel and so Intel can still use those older fabs to sell cheap chips across the world. AMD has to use it's more expensive node so low level offerings are still more expensive as they recoup fab costs. There's so much more to the equation but folks panic sold.

The biggest business for Intel, ccg, just released Lunar Lake chips that bring x86 efficiency that's on par with what was seen in Arm based devices, with none of the downsides of using an Arm based machine. \n\nThe only thing that matters to get Intel stock price to go up is Revenue growth and capex. Right now the market does not see results for the huge investments the company is making and that is a problem. If you invest 100B in anything it should be expected that revenue would grow but instead revenue is decreasing. The foundry business loses money every quarter due to massive investments and is bringing the whole company down with it. Without it Intel would still be a healthy company. However, investment is needed to reach leading edge nodes or else they would have to go the fabless route.",
