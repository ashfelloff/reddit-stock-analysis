Crypto is not stable, and is not widely adopted. It is also backed by nothing.  As far as limited supply goes -- the fact is that Bitcoin can easily be displaced by any number of similar (or better) crypto schemes. There is nothing special about Bitcoin other than the fact that it was the first attempt.  Unfortunately for Michael Saylor, if the USA or the EU or China, etc decide to go the route of crypt currencies, they will certainly mint a new one rather than adopting a currency that is 90% owned by the top 10% of 'investors'.",

Instead we’re seeing decoupled semantic layers growing in popularity paired with lightweight BI tools (and more modern self generating BI tools). It makes more sense with embedded analytics and LLMs increasingly overtaking BI dashboards in the presentation layer. Relying on MSTR’s semantic layer means vendor lock and tech stagnation. MSTR should have open sourced their semantic layer and offered cloud hosting for it to stay relevant years ago. The pivot to Bitcoin came at the right time.",
