Also people seem to be really freaked out by the fact customers were getting arrested due to incompetence of record keeping at hertz resulting in people being accused of not returning cars etc.\n",

The company has written down or sold for a loss about 467 million of their EV inventory since 12/23. Of note, they still have EVs, but I couldn't find the specifics on how much they have left. I don't think they'll go bankrupt soon, based on their debt maturities, but I wouldn't be suprised if they filed in 3-4 years based on their terrible decision making.

Quite possible. Could it short squeeze? Sure, 30% short interest but that would likely require good news and the news earlier this week (https://www.ft.com/content/5f170573-1d36-4917-a6b1-146f5f228402) that it was ruled that Hertz underpaid bond holders post prior bankruptcy by $270M is definitely not positive. I'm sure that will be appealed, but if they have to pay $270M at this point after the decline in the business that it's had in recent years, that will be a problem.\n\n\"They are trading at $3usd as of writing this and its so far down over the past few years it looks like its on a path to $0.\"\n\nI mean, we're talking about a company that went public again in 2021 after bankruptcy and has proceeded to lose about 87.5% since in pretty much a straight line - as someone else noted, the move into EVs went very poorly and certainly didn't help. **Completely** agree with this from the same person: \"I personally wouldn't ever invest in company that's so short sighted that it's flirting with bankruptcy a few years after exiting bankruptcy.\"\n\n Maybe it's not a straight line for the stock from here to 0 but it 0'ing again would not surprise me at all.",
