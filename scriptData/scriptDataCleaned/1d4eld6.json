  "selftext": "Stock down 20% today. Quarter was complete mess, miss on top line and weaker guidance than expected but I can’t help but wonder if it’s a good buying opportunity. They have compounded primarily through M&A and I wonder if Benioff has something cooking that they haven’t announced yet ?\n\nA lot of the software is in the category of “not a wonderful experience to use but necessary for thousands of businesses”… which obviously isn’t sexy but once you have teams ingrained on them it’s such a sticky product.\n\nAlso feels like CRMs might be more insulated from A.I. than other software? Like it’s more mechanical plumbing than creative outlets. Stock is still on like 30x PE though. \n\nAnyone own it? Anyone have a fully fleshed out bear case?\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/salesforce-stock-fall-earnings-revenue-miss.html",

The thing is most of Salesforces revenue comes from enterprise businesses that pay $10-100 million a year to use their various products. The decision to buy is made by executives at these companies and not the people who actually have to use it every day. If there’s any hint that a large customer wants to leave they take the executives out to dinner with Matthew McConaughey and that gets them to stay.",

          "body": "I think a big problem with Salesforce may be that they charge per-head fees for their software rather than using a consumption model and laying off employees at software companies to invest in the AI that may one day replace them is \"so hot right now\", which means less heads that need to access Salesforce. Also, I have seen way too many Salesforce ads in the last year. A company can burn money to juice revenues with a massive ad campaign for as long as they keep it up, but as soon as they pull back a bit, their revenues will be hit but earnings will go up, which is consistent with their revenue miss and earnings beat. I haven't checked this lazy hypothesis, because I'm not interested in buying CRM right now. I think CRM would jump if they announced that they were A/B testing a consumption model. \n\nWith SNOW, I think the problem is that they don't have positive earnings and good cash flow when we are in a higher-for-longer environment with treasuries knocking on new highs. Also, as a tech sector, software has underperformed this year. You can't just say AI three times and have investors scramble to give you money right now. Now you have to say AI and either post good growth or give good guidance for investors to throw money at you. This is a modest improvement.",

His company wide conference calls are a fucking mess (cited from a friend in CRM)\n\nThis is dead money until the multiples compress further and the fundamental revenue growth story returns.
