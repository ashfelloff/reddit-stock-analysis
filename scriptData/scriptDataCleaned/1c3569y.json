              "body": "lol holy shit.\n\nMy ex gf once got like $1k from a slot. She literally put $1 in it or something. I had just lost $50 or something on the slot next to her and she decided she'd give it a go once my $50 was gone. First spin she hits the jack-pot or something close to it. The thing just kept flashing and dinging and the number kept going up and up and she was sitting there like \"OMG what is happening??? What is this?? Did I win?!\" and I'm like \"YOU TOTALLY WON BIG YEEEE HAWWWWW!!!\"\n\nAnyways, that was the end of the gambling for us. Cashed out her $1k and went back to our room. One thing that kinda pissed me off was that she never like suggested we go out for a nice dinner or do anything together with that money lol, she simply put it into her bank account and I paid for our breakfast the next morning lmfaoooo. I shoulda known then that she was not the one. Like how do you not suggest a nice steak dinner or something after winning big on a single random slot machine gamble? When on vacation with your bf or gf...? Really odd IMO. Like it was her money, totally, I ain't saying she shoulda spent half on me or anything, but maybe $80-100, ya know??",
