I just buy other semi stocks that make efficient computing be it CPU or GPUs. Buying AMD is like shorting INTC without having to pay interest.   \n\nIntel is not that.  And I was a big Intel fan, I started working with their Nehalem design after college 15 years ago.  This cpu reshaped cloud computing.  It blew everyone away.  This Intel CPU changed how virtualization was done, we went from hosting a few thousand virtual machines to 10 thousand virtual machines in a small part of a colocation.  Our business  went 10x because of this and probably AWS did too.  If you ever owned I think a Sandy Bridge CPU from 2010 you’d know what a beast that was built on the same Nehalem design and was useable for consumers for 10+ years (it’s not a useable design for datacenter too inefficient now) \n\nFast forward 8+ years, Intel did minor tweaks if any to their design.  Great world changing cpu in 2008 but in 2016 that cpu was showing its age.  \n\n\nIn ~2016 I said AMD at $1.80 with their new design, INTC lack of innovation would be beginning death blow to INTC monopoly.  \n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\nINTC is not something anyone should invest in,  I’m seeing ARM, QCOM, AMD, MSFT, GOOG, AAPL, AWS and many more just make better stuff, way more energy efficient.   Why do you think all new MacBook even an old M1 from 2020 blows away a current Intel, I can render a movie 10x faster on my phone than my Intel desktop, and my phone is only a few watts while my Intel desktop takes hundreds of watts doing things 10x slower using 10x more power and heat, companies are moving to Snapdragon, Graviton, ARM, their own designs, AMD\n\nIf in the last 8 years if you invested in any semi stock be it AMD, NVDA, ASML, TSM, MSFT, AMZN, AAPL, NVDA, QCOM etc you’d have millions.  INTC some how in the biggest multiple tech boom and QE, and stock boom run has some how lost money in their stock price.  \n\nLook at the shit that was AMD Opteron bulldozer in around 2006.  It took AMD 10 years to redesign and have a CPU take off again.  It’s a slow process.  If you are hell bent on putting money in INTC wait 10 years that’s how far they are behind.\n\nI have never seen anyone ever install an Intel GPU for AI or even given it thought.  I’ll look at other racks at colocations and I’ve never seen an Intel GPU for this purpose.  \n\nLiterally just put a dartboard of semi stocks and buy anything else, doesn’t mater if you’re at a loss on INTC now the opportunity cost of holding INTC is too high when there are semi stocks that could change your life.",

Additionally, their 5 nodes in 4 years plan is actually on track and INTC is expected to beat TSMC to 2nm this year.\n\nI'd argue that AMD have rested on their laurels for too long, recycling their Ryzen design from 2017. Their Zen 4 chips expected to be released this year, still doesn't use big.LITTLE and they use 2 CCDs, unchanged from 2019. The fact that Alder Lake almost caught up to Ryzen 2 years back despite being fabbed on an inferior node, makes me think AMD are going to get destroyed in the next release cycle.",
