      "body": "deal fell through because mainland parties in the settlement (prob insurance companies) refused to pay their proposed share. governor threatens to out the insurance companies if they don't agree. Some might argue that could drive mainland insurers out of hawaii like how state farm left california after their devistating wildfire.   FYI home insurance in hawaii is skyrocketing due to the wildfires.\n\nSeems to me that MAUI C&C should be more to blame because their FD claimed the fire caused by down lines was 100% extinguished, they left. later the fire reignited and then the rest of lahaina burned. the cops couldn't communicate with the FD because of their radios. the cops wouldn't let people out of lahana to supposedly prevent them from driving near energized power lines. However, \"The control room advised the Maui Police Department on multiple occasions during the day, starting in the morning and extending into the late afternoon, that the company's lines in Lahaina were not energized,\" The cops redirected people to front street to take the 'back way' out of lahaina which was a gigantic traffic jam and most of the redirected vehicles were destroyed and many lives were lost as a result. ¬†  Not to mention the head of Maui's emergency management agency resigned after not sounding emergency sirens.\n\nThey need to settle as one big case because multiple long drawn cases will cost them additional millions. But like the bloomberg article said HE could be liable for AT LEAST 1.5B of the original estimate of 5.5B in damages.   \n\nSome good info here\n\n[https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/21/breaking-news/maui-wildfire-victims-sue-insurers-over-proposed-4b-settlement/](https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/07/21/breaking-news/maui-wildfire-victims-sue-insurers-over-proposed-4b-settlement/)\n\n - [https://www.civilbeat.org/2024/06/a-long-awaited-federal-report-on-the-cause-of-the-lahaina-fire-is-just-waiting-for-maui-county-to-release-it/](https://www.civilbeat.org/2024/06/a-long-awaited-federal-report-on-the-cause-of-the-lahaina-fire-is-just-waiting-for-maui-county-to-release-it/)  waiting",
