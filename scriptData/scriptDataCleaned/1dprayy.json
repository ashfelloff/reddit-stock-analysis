  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_?‚Äù will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. ‚ÄúIs \\_\\_\\_ a good investment?‚Äù will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [US Recurring Jobless Claims Rise to Highest Since End of 2021](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/us-recurring-jobless-claims-rise-to-highest-since-end-of-2021)\n\nMostly earnings aftermaths today. Also, hyperlinks to Finviz added, hopefully I'll be able to implement this going forward in the future! :)\n\n[**MU**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=MU)**-** Beat earnings estimates, due to strong demand for memory chips, but current quarter forecast wasn‚Äôt as positive as investors wanted. Company forecasted next quarter revenue in line with investor expectations. Reported $6.81B vs $6.67B revenue expected. Remember that MU makes the chips that NVDA that are used in the AI processors designed by NVDA. (I will do a writeup explaining semis in the future.)\n\n[**WBA**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=WBA)**-** Fell due to the company missing expectations, slashing profit outlooks, and cited a challenging environment for pharmacies and US consumers. Expects EPS 2.80 vs 2.95 a share for 2024. Reported EPS of .63 vs .68 expected, and revenue of 36.4B vs 35.94 expected. Worth watching if we have any sharp selloffs. CVS down in sympathy.\n\n[**LEVI**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=LEVI)**-** Reported revenue of 1.44B vs 1.45 expected, and EPS of $0.16 vs $0.04. Beat expectations, but CFO warned that consumers have been ‚Äúgenerally cautious‚Äù about spending.\n\n[**AMZN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)**-** Hitting all time highs, watching 195/200 levels. No ‚Äúnew news‚Äù beyond that, so mainly will be patient for this one.\n\n[**RIVN**](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=RIVN)**-** No new news beyond the Volkswagen investment, but still watching this.\n\nEarnings today: NKE\n\nIPO today: WBTN (Webtoon, extremely interested in this. They host \"webcomics\" for artists and have a great product I love. [Prospectus linked](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1997859/000119312524151708/d396527ds1.htm))",
