At this rate, the company essentially makes back it's valuation in 3.6 years. Thats 27% return annually! \n\nDividend is at 6.45% annually and it only accounts for 18% of their profits. This is not like traditional dividend stocks that pay 100% or even above 100% of their profits. They have additional cash left over to grow/ buyback shares. \n\nDoes anyone have insight that I've missed? ",

      "body": "One of the reasons why I swore off Japanese stocks is exactly for this reason.  \n\nA company with ostensibly great financials and a ridiculous p/e ratio, creating a value trap for foreign investors who have no idea of the culture, language, or competitive landscape of Japan but see numbers on a chart and think, \"what could go wrong.\" You haven't done adequate research on this company because your google search was, \"Toyo Tires Stock\" and you looked at two numbers, quite frankly. \n\nIf you were Japanese, you'd google \"トーヨータイヤ株\" and start your research. From there, you'd find that they have been mired in scandals and their stock has gotten pulverized in the past from scandals. More likely, you probably would've known about it anyway. And one of the reasons why it's so dangerous to invest in Japan is that you simply have no idea of the risk you are trafficking in. Additionally, this is NOT the U.S. where fraud and a history of scandals is just the cost of doing business. Japanese markets react horribly to these types of stocks, often irrationally, despite the financials painting a much brighter picture. \n\nA lot of this is simply driven by culture, but Japan will destroy a business overnight, both from governmental pressures and public outcry, to these types of companies. REGARDLESS of how juicy their p/e is.",
