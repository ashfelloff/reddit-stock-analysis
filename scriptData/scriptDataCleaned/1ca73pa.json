This includes closing at-risk positions prior to market close, and isn’t limited to spread positions with a theoretical maximum gain/loss.   \n  \nIt’s also important to remember that:  \n  \nRisk checks generally occur within the last 30 minutes before market close on expiration days. Please note that the risk check may occur earlier during periods of high volatility or during other extenuating market conditions.  \n  \nThese checks are in place to help protect both your account and Robinhood from the potential of substantial leverage.   \n  \nHaving the collateral to place the trade is different from having the collateral to support exercise or assignment.  \n  \nYou cannot opt out of this risk check process.",
