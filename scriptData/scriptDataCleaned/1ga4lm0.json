ARM said \"Uh hey you can't use that IP because the ALA it was designed under is not assignable to you\". Qualcomm shrugged, sequestered the Nuvia IP then redesigned it all under the Qualcomm ALA. \n\nARM got TURBO MAD about that because now their #1 customer who used to buy TLA cores from them at a 5% royalty rate is now using an in-house design where they only pay 2%. \n\nIn typical insane people behavior they're just going to revoke Qualcomms ALA so they can't sell their custom CPUs, in hopes it will force Qualcomm back to their TLA's and they can continue on as if Nuvia never happened.",
