  "selftext": "I am 43 years old and just started investing in March of this year. I am a low income earner. I opened a Roth IRA and have done a bit of trading. I have deposited $5000 into my IRA so far this year and was up about $1000 and felt I was doing pretty good. I have done my best to learn as much as possible but with the way the market is now I find myself losing a bit daily no matter what I do. I really wish I had started investing years ago to put my money to work but I feel with the way things are now it‚Äôs just not that safe to buy into anything. I find I will invest and be up for a couple of days and then go back to the negative. I owe around 60k on my house. I have an emergency savings but other than that I have nothing else. I am not in the best of health and I really hope to pay my house off by age 50. My house is 3% Interest so I thought playing the market may be the best way to go about things and also leave a bit behind just in case something were to happen to me. I do not mind being a tad aggressive but have recently become nervous. I am going to try and max out my IRA each year but I should be able to at least contribute 5k a year. My significant other would be able to just barely afford the house if something were to happen to me and my biggest fear is leaving her with nothing. I feel at this point I am even cautious buying into the S&P. As of now my money is parked in Fidelity Spaxx. Is there any advice you can give me?\n",

      "body": "What you‚Äôve been seeing for the past week, imo, is institutional end of quarter rebalancing. Most actively managed institutions have policies that want to limit exposure to various sectors to certain percentages. Notice that the tech sector, nasdaq, which has been ripping all quarter, is dropping the most over the past few days. At the same time the DOW, which is made up of very large blue chip stocks, which have been underperforming this past quarter, has been rising. Meanwhile the S&P 500, which contains all sectors, has only moved .01% in the last five days. This is all perfectly normal,healthy, and sets up the large institutions with a rebalanced portfolio going into the next earnings season that starts towards the end of next month. \n\nDon‚Äôt read too much into short term dips as it all becomes just a blip over the long term. FOMO buying at tops and then panic selling on dips is a losing strategy. Take emotions out of it and contribute every month, dollar cost averaging.",

You can put together a forecast as to where you will be in five years given some estimates for an anticipated rate of return. One of the advantages of taking this approach is that you shouldn‚Äôt worry about every up or down move. Just add to it regularly. \n\nIf you want to put a smaller amount into individual companies, then I‚Äôd recommend concentrating on sticking with the big and growing companies rather than swinging for the fences on high risk/high reward approaches. \n\nYou‚Äôll also want to think about tax advantaged approaches and see if there‚Äôs any matching programs from your employer. I think you mentioned that you have $60k left on your mortgage that you don‚Äôt want to leave to your partner to pay off in case of an emergency.

If you are investing in stocks, you should really be thinking 5+ years at least, preferably 10+.   What happens today, tomorrow, next week, 6 months, or even 2 years, should not be a concern for you.   You invest in stocks because you believe (based on an incredible track record) that your investment will grow over a longer time span (at least 5-6 years, preferably a decade or more).    If you don't have that much time, you shouldn't be investing in stocks.\n\nAlso, when I say \"investing in stocks,\" I mean index funds like the FXAIX that you got out of.   Don't day trade, and don't try to chase winners - it's a good way to end up behind where you would be if you just bought and held things like FXAIX.   Arguably you should diversify even beyond FXAIX.   Seriously consider adding some international diversification, and also small and mid cap.\n\nIf you are risk averse, you should perhaps put more money into a bond fund, or things of that nature.\n\nA good simple way to achieve a good, all in one portfolio, is via a target date fund.   IT will have you diversified across the US market, and international, and will slowly add bonds as you get nearer to your target date, making your portfolio less volatile and more secure as you get closer to actually needing the money.\n\nAt any rate, any investment is going to have its ups and downs.   We are interested in long term trends.   Long term, if you invest in a diverse portfolio (things like FXAIX, or VTI, or VTI + VXUS, or VT), you can reasonably expect to earn about a 5% yearly return, on average (edit: real return, ie accounting for inflation).   Obviously you will not get rich quickly this way, but historically it is a pretty reliable way to build your wealth over a long time span (again, think 6+ years... ideally much more than that).\n\nMoney that is needed in a year or two probably should not be invested in stocks at all.  And again, don't pick individual stocks.   Doubly so if you dislike volatility!   Diversification is how you lower volatility!",

Unfortunately we have a way to go. I have been looking around for health insurance for myself and my employees. Many ppl (that do not really know me) tell me to go find another job but I love what I do and it is a big need for the community. I have definitely sacrificed a bit by doing what I do but at this point it is my whole identity. The town I live in is fairly small and if it weren‚Äôt for volunteers I am not sure what I would do. It is important to me that I make a difference but I suppose I am reaching the age of being consumed with guilt and worry. I have tried to teach my children to do something that matters and thankfully they are all doing extremely well. I would die a bit more peacefully knowing there is a cushion for my significant other and to not put that burden on my children though.\n\nI will look into a cheap life insurance policy. It‚Äôs definitely better than nothing at all.",

So, i similarly worked at a non-profit for ~10 years. I was making below the poverty level. Renting rooms in communal housing, barely paying bills, no savings. When i hit 40 I ‚Äúsold out‚Äù and went corporate. I had $4k to my name. Now i have almost 1/2 a Mill across all my accounts. \n\nI had to give up the life where i felt i was making the greatest difference for the most people in need to focus on myself for awhile. I wish i would have made that choice earlier and maybe i could be a homeowner instead of a renter today. Just wanted to add my experience since it sounded like we were in the same spot.",
