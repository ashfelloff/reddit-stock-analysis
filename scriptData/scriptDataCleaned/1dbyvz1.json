  "selftext": "With all the talk about commodity supercycles, I was reminded of one of the greatest loss porn sagas of the twentieth century - when the brothers Hunt decided to try to corner the silver market.  \nHere is one account of how that went down.... one heck of a YOLO.....\n\n[https://learn.apmex.com/learning-guide/history/silver-thursday-the-hunt-brothers-scheme-2/](https://learn.apmex.com/learning-guide/history/silver-thursday-the-hunt-brothers-scheme-2/)\n\n<edit> I tried to post this earlier, along the lines of \"history may not repeat, but it rhymes\"..... but I made the mistake of adding the YOLO flair, which is reserved for new and open trades, and offended one of the automods.  So let's just call this 'discussion'.",
