It's a monthly, reoccurring cost we can save on so why not do it? \n\n  \nThe reality is it's so comically cheap for a large company to provide coffee service that it's a rounding error. My branch pays $150/m to stock 3 break rooms with the machines and all coffee/tea components for a site that can hold about 120ish people. It's nothing to any company of any serious size. \n\n  \nOn the employee's side it means everything though. It can really impact basic good will and bring moral down the tube.
