  "selftext": "Throughout this year, the prevailing narrative has been one of a robust economy, with assurances of widespread prosperity: low unemployment, rising wages, and increased earnings for the populace. However, from my perspective, this portrayal doesn't resonate with reality \n\nThe US economy is officially in stagflation, possibly worse, and I believe it's in a recession but no-one will admit it.\n\n* Despite indicators, official media outlets are hesitant to acknowledge economic downturn.\n* Recent comments by the Fed Chief during the latest FOMC conference dismissed stagflation and inflation concerns despite all of the data saying otherwise.\n* GDP growth was just 1.6% in the latest quarter, the slowest since before the 08 crash, effectively zero when adjusted for inflation.\n* Job market growth fell far below estimates with only 175,000 jobs created compared to the expected 3,100,000.\n* The Fed is struggling to meet its 2% inflation target, despite insisting it's achievable.\n* Rising everyday prices are evident, impacting everyday expenses like fast food and coffee (see starbucks, fast food chain sales declines). Consumers are stretched thin.\n* Credit card defaults are surging across the US, reminiscent of the early stages of the 2008 financial crisis.\n* Capital One, the fourth largest credit card issuer in the US, reported a staggering 5.9% charge-off rate (basically defaults), the highest since the 2008 financial crash.\n* This charge-off rate has risen by over 230% in the past two years, indicating a significant increase in accounts being shut down due to non-payment.\n* The surge in credit card defaults is a major concern for the US economy, suggesting that consumers are struggling to cope with inflation and excessive spending. These defaults may serve as a leading indicator of economic trouble ahead\n* Lower-income US consumers are bearing the brunt of loan stress, as noted by Fed Goolsbee, \n*  Biden downplayed inflation concerns...suggesting people have extra money to spend lmao\n* The Fed's approach to fighting inflation seems ineffective, as they've begun the process of quantitative easing (big one)\n* The Fed's actions suggest a pivot from fighting inflation to easing monetary conditions (again lying about the 2% goal)\n* Despite holding interest rates steady, the Fed is making bank lending conditions looser, favoring investors over ordinary people.\n* If the Fed wanted to curb inflation, they would need to address rising asset prices, particularly in housing (but we've seen massive drops in first home buyer interest and increase in time houses are on market).\n* The latest job market report marks a turning point, with job creation slowing by 30% and a rise in long-term unemployment (companies especailly in states like CA are no longer hiring - first sign of future lay offs).\n* Most new jobs created are part-time, indicating a shift in employment patterns.\n* The number of people working part-time due to inability to find full-time work has increased from 800,000 to 1.1 million year over year.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3evgicxy750d1.png?width=2136&format=png&auto=webp&s=b98dbcbe9f48d6c79a942bfc5ca200416cb1fd26\n\nTLDR; Recession incoming cause we have all of signals that the canary choking in the coal mine\n\nSo obviously with all these we'll probably see consecutive SPY ATHs because stonks only go up - I'm full port calls at open  ",

Folks have just gotten soft. \n\n* Growth is stronger than in 2008-2012 or 2020 (doesn't even compare to the 70s) bottoms: GDP growing, markets at all time highs, bond markets stable, unemployment low, banks still lending, and anyone who wants a job can get a job which means ***MOST PEOPLE^&*** are working, living life, having sex, getting married, buying homes, getting promoted, having kids, etcetcetc.\n\n* Inflation is down to 3-4% range. It's not at TARGET 2% but it's comically low compared 1910s, late 1940s, 70s/80s, or even a few years ago. https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/historical-inflation-rates/\n\n* Any downturn will be likely short and shallow because it will be created by Fed tightening to reduce inflation. Recession kills inflation because it LITERALLY is deflation of the economy. Fed can fix any problem they cause. GFC and 2020 were much harder because they are black swan type events rather than the Fed over tightening. Fed can easily fix any market downturn with a dovish stance, reduce QT, enact QE, lowering rates, opening lending window, bailing out banks/companies/industries with liquidity, infinite printer go BRRRRR, reverse REPO, 999999 other things they were doing during the pandemic like buying MBS, etcetc\n\n* OP was mainly talking about the US economy and US markets, but we can see a few months ahead in a \"bad case\" scenario by looking at Europe and parts of developed East Asia. Japan, UK, and a few others have slowed to the point of low to no growth. And yet their markets are at ATH because of expected rate cuts (also cause fiat is trash). Inflation was higher in Europe and EAsia but even they have reduced it to their needed levels. So why the fuck would you go short US when there are easier markets to short? That's like trying to steal candy but choosing to steal it from prime Mike Tyson rather than a little baby. Regarded/10\n\nSo I'd normally end by saying OP is a regard 🌈🐻 who's doomed to lose but it seems they know they are regarded and might inverse themselves? *\"So obviously with all these we'll probably see consecutive SPY ATHs because stonks only go up - I'm full port calls at open\"*\n\n^***&*** >!\"Most people\" aka not regards on reddit subs like antiwork or wallstreetbets!<",

My homeowner's insurance is over 100% more than it was in 2019, I've had to drop my replacement cost policy for a worse depreciated policy, and its still double! Pre-Pandemic we were grocery shopping at our local organic grocer, spending about $150/week, now we grocery shop at walmart and are spending $250/week, and buying more chicken and ground beef and less steak. I've only bought new clothes from Walmart the past 2 years, despite making more money than I've ever made in my entire life. I've never made so much money and felt so poor at the same time. An oil change on my truck is over $120 full price, I used to always get it done at the dealership now I use coupons and go to 5 minute oil change and get it done for \\~$75, same it used to cost full price at the dealership.... I just got a quote to fix my driveway the best quote to repave my small driveway is $16k, I can't afford that, so just repaving the first 11ft or so of my driveway is going to cost me $5K. Roofing and fence work is astronomical right now, both are services I'm going to need soon and absolutely dreading, I'm hearing horror stories about roofs costing 20k+ and fences costing 10k+, neighbor just got one length of fence redone, one side of his house cost him 12k. Me and wife get taco bell for dinner maybe once or twice a month, these days its over $20 bucks for both of us to get taco bell, other fast food is same or worse. I remember when I was in high school \\~2010, me and a friend got really stoned and went to taco bell like a couple bandits and ordered practically everything on the menu and it came out to roughly $20, and were laughing hysterically that we actually racked up $20 worth of food at taco bell, for two people to order $20 worth of food at taco bell was HYSTERICALLY laughable 15 years ago, right now its literally completely normal. Prices that people commonly have to pay for common goods and services are easily almost twice what they were pre-pandemic. You have to notice this, articles be damned, compare your monthly rent cost year over year the past 5 years, what kind of increase are you noticing? Does it look like a steady 2-10% increase each year? My guess is the SMALLEST YoY increase you've seen in your rent the last 5 years is 10%, which during normal times a 10% YoY increase in rent would be alarming. These price increases are not okay and most people will not be able to sustain this for much longer. Even the people I know who are top earners and financially well are complaining about costs, My friends who are young renters who make 6 figures who were looking to buy a house in \\~2019 are now coping and telling themselves they really don't want to own a house now. You can even look at all these ATH in the stock market as an indicator of inflation, simply the cost of owning a share of stock. S&P is 25% YoY lol THAT'S INFLATION! The S&P 500 companies aren't 25% more valuable intrinsically or more productive than they were 1 year ago, they are 25% more expensive because of all the cash in the market attempting to seek assets, same with every good and service.",

No arrests because no crimes were committed, no obstruction of movement, etc. sympathized with those guys 500% more than our rabble.\n\nAmerican people know no such discipline.
