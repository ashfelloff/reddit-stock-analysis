      "body": "It’s one of the most dangerous problems in cybersecurity - a shape-shifting digital threat that continually alters appearance to avoid detection.\n\nCalled polymorphic malware, it’s a major risk to governments, financial institutions, and individuals alike.\n\nCYBR International combats polymorphic malware with AI and machine learning. The company’s unique detection system is applied in systems used by major defense contractor Raytheon, AI leader IBM, and infrastructure provider Amazon Web Services.\n\nCYBR International also holds multiple certifications that provide bidding advantages on exclusive government contracts. HUBZone certification guarantees percentages of set-aside revenue, and increases their visibility among all federal agencies.\n\nTheir HACS SINs certification means CYBR International is pre-approved to bid on all federal cybersecurity servicesand streamlines the federal contract procurement process.\n\nTo date, CYBR International has raised $1.6M without any institutional investment. The company has been profitable since its founding in 2022.\n\nTrusted Partners:- Contracts with Raytheon, IBM, and Amazon Web Services   Bright future:- Current sales pipeline of nearly $25M   Government certifications:- Guarantees bidding advantages, set-aside revenue on contracts, and pre-approval for all federal cybersecurity services\n\n“AI is just a part of the solution, i.e. where other companies use 25 year old CPU tech (I..e A/V), we use GPU. We’ve “Vetted” our tech in labs like the Dell Solutions Center. The original tech \\[now CYBR’s proprietary owned\\] was awarded Dell Founder’s 50 club status. That means Dell found it to be one of the 50 most disruptive technologies GLOBALLY! “\n\n•⁠Shawn Key, founder.\n\nThe deal room link below  for all the information (so much to read through the above is just the tip of the iceberg)  regarding CYBR International & current discussions:- [republic.co/cybr](https://republic.co/cybr)\n\nWebsite:-\n\ncybrinternational.ai\n\nCYBR International crowd fund is live on Republic.com @joinrepublic\n\nJuly 25th they will be having an AMA session on Republic.com It will be available to its entire investor community!  & more announcements 🔜\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2uq1z990hjcd1.jpeg?width=1151&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b864321ce658637d7ea04edcfc13b0a460fa01d1",
