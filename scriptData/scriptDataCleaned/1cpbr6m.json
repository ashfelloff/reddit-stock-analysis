It happens to all of us at one point or another. \n\nItâ€™s extremely hard to make money being a trader, something like 90% of people who trade options lose in the long runâ€¦.. you have better odds being a good sports gambler.\n\nTake that money out if you think you will need it, you wonâ€™t stop chasing those losses.",
