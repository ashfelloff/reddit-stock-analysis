  "title": "What Happens to Berkshire When Buffet Kicks the Bucket?",
  "score": 363,
  "selftext": "I see regular posts on here and other subs regarding how much Berkshire is selling and how they are quickly building up a very large cash position. But I haven’t come across posts about what happens when the grim inevitable happens.\n\nThe current foundation of the company is attributed to the financial success largely brought to it by Buffet and his now deceased (at 99) contemporary Charlie Munger. Buffet is currently 94 years old; with no investing ‘equal’ to trade ideas with anymore; in a slowly changing landscape with retail investors now in the mix; and countless other factors.\n\nI think if they go private they’ll be okay, but if not the future doesn’t seem too bright to me.\n\nI am curious what others think will happen to BRKB/BRKA when the time comes? The most likely and immediate/short term answer: 📉\n\nBut what about afterwards, say 3/5/10 years down the line when the cash is reinvested? Can the success of the company remain as successful (if not more so) as it is now under a new CEO/management?",

Currently, Warren owns a majority of the voting shares and therefore has control of Berkshire. \n\nSometime time after he has passed, the share total remaining in Howard’s control will be insufficient to retain control and the company will become vulnerable to Wall Street interests like most companies. \n\nWhen Wall Street can get voting control, I would not be surprised if the major investment banks and activist investors look to break up Berkshire and sell-off the major parts. \n\nThe allure of perhaps as much as $40 Billion in cumulative fees may make it irresistible for them to breakup Berkshire to “unlock shareholder value”. That’s baloney, of course, but the possible fees would be unlike anything they have previously seen.\n\nI’m just an amateur, I could be wrong. I hope I am, it would be a shame to see Berkshire dissolved by Wall Street just to generate fees.",
