Their past splits have all shown a post split price decline for 12 to 24 months. After that they returned to new highs.  The big difference though is the AI push. For all practical purposes NVDA has no competition right now.  AMD is playing as a lackluster also ran and Intel is building their own chips at The Foundry; they faltered just building 7nm chips so I don't see them catching up soon.",
