The man is not a scientist, he constantly get basic things wrong. The only thing is good at, and I will admit he's very good at it is being a hype man and pumping his stocks. \n\nThat does make it very dangerous to bet against him unless you can really time things and fortunately, this time I closed my puts yesterday for a small gain. I might sit out the robotaxi event out because I'm sure he'll get lots of positive media coverage for whatever he does. Hopefully, that still lets me get back in before earnings which will miss again, because they always do.",
