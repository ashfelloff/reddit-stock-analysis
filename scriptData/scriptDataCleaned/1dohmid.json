Hedgefunds been sneaking in and buying up $20 July 5 puts get out by then a blood bath short position is going to drop, my lowest was $24.50 and shit got hot there on action twice today. I dunno lower than that to know how hard the hit will be but at least 24.50. Upgraded that and my $26 to $29 since only lower popped and $29 dumped right after. Holding enough to get me $9m if stonk hits $20 by July 5. Would easiest thing I ever did starting from 0.13-.16 24.50 puts. Congrats man!",
