  "selftext": "\\*\\*Background\\*\\*\n\nI was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)\n\nWhy would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says \"it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.\"\n\nTS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)\n\nSo, obviously it's not that.\n\n\\*\\*Theory\\*\\*\n\nWhy else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\\_2006/pinedo\\_tanenbaum\\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)\n\nBut why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?\n\nAnswer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.\n\nFIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. \n\n\"But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!\" > at the discretion of the issuer\n\n\"But never agree to low price / it's fraud!\" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like \"50% of the current value of shares.\"\n\n\"But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!\" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.\n\n\"But you'd have to say something to someone!\" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).\n\nSECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.\n\nTHIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.\n\n\\*\\*Trading hypothesis\\*\\*\n\nDJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic \"but norms\" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.\n\nDJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.\n\n\\*\\*Positions\\*\\*\n\n$3k in Puts at price points between $25 and $5 over the next 8 months.\n\n&#x200B;",

I was reading a bunch of $DJT posts on TS, and it is amazing. No idea at all about how finance, economics, market forces, or anything else. \n\nMost of them think TS is going to be Meta, Alphabet, Netflix, Amazon, or Twitter.... they say, look at how long it took for other social media complanies to be profitable. I said yes, but also look at AOL, MySpace, and the other 1000 companies that went bust during dot com. the less than 1% that deserved their early valuations, were big winners. Only after then invested all their earnings in technology and the companies. the problems with TS is that it has no income! yes there is 200miil on hand, but they have plan to disperse that pretty quickly to things not related to growing the organization. 200mil is a drop in the bucket for a Netflix or  Meta investment in developing a streaming service or enhancing the products. And went on to say, how is TS anything not available in Reddit? \n\nresponse - we just ban anyone who doesn't agree with us... \n\nAnyone who questions the valuation model of why it's $45 today, and how they get that to $500 in November (as many of them think), gets banned. Anyone who says maybe we already go the 100x high growth tech company baked into the current price, gets banned...",
