This has been their MO since the first GME short squeeze attempt, and will be their MO on every subsequent attempt. There will be no mother of all short squeezes under this persistent dynamic. \n\nOn the bright side, GME has money that they can put in an account and earn 5% ROI. Maybe Ryan Cohen can pull a rabbit out of his hat and get 10% ROI with the cash siphoned off from retail investors. I can't blame gamestop for selling off their shares when the share prices are ridiculously inflated, just like I can't blame a company for doing a massive buyback when their valuations are low. If you play gamestop for its volatility, you are playing against very good and extensively backtested hedge fund automated trading algorithms, so make sure that your algos are very good and that your high-frequency trading system has a minimal delay.",

It was at 20-21 and his break even was $26. So he was poised to take a loss, posted his massive position to people that could cause a spike. The head of the SEC publicly commented on it right after and I bet $5 he got a not friendly call from some prosecutors hence his lawyers telling him to not exercise the options and do his little livestream where he essentially just related what his lawyer told him to ",

He was VERY careful with what he said today, and I think that is super fair, he is trying to avoid being prosecuted. He did show his positions on a browser page, and then for some reason he also showed that he could delete the logo of his broker on that same page by editing the html of the page. Take from that what you will. \n\nOverall it really seemed (to me) like he did the livestream to try to avoid being prosecuted. It was a smart move by him. He did mention he thinks that the stock could still be good in a few years, but in general he was very very careful about saying anything that could be construed as advice to buy the stock now. \n\nMy opinion: GME surprise announcing some stock dilution along with pretty brutal earnings numbers was definitely planned and not a random occurrence. I respect dfv, and I get why he did what he did today - GME’s move today was not his fault. What I don’t really get is why you would want to go long the stock here. The company used the hype to unload a bucket of crap on its shareholders. They saw their window of opportunity and they took it. The pump is over. Yeah it could happen again down the road, but now? What is the catalyst? For me it is an avoid, give it time to settle out, and look to re-engage when there are new catalysts that can drive the price higher.",

I'm sorry but if you think someone of his knowledge truly believes GameStop could turn it around operationally, you're as high as a kite.\n\nYes, GME has billions in cash thanks to equity financing. They got lucky because meme craze saved them again. The problem is that won't help them operationally because they can't pivot anywhere else. They don't have the tech expertise to become sorta like what Twitch is and gaming developers have moved past the business model of distributing games. They do it themselves. Why do they need GameStop to sell games for them and take margins?\n\nYou seem like a novice repeating nonsense. Video game retailing is dead. It's not an industry ripe for innovation. This isn't some software or AI company. It's a company that receives games, sells games, and takes some profit off of it. There is no ifs/buts about it. It'll be the same fate Blockbuster went through but the only saving grace for GameStop is gaming is still a growing industry so GameStop can still peel away some customers. But 3-5 years down the line, what exactly are they pivoting to? Read their annual statements. They have nothing of substance other than closing down stores to decrease costs and increasing e-commerce presence, which has been a dud unless you shop at GameStop for keyboards and mice.",
