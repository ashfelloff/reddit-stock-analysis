Monday to Tuesday seems always to go up by 5 to 10 percent, then starts to offload the gains on Wednesday and Thursday. Usually Friday mostly flat or you get both combination of up and down then flat at close.\n\n Of course, this pattern sometimes flips backwards and for 1 to 2 weeks period adjust back to the original setup. I still think buying on January 1st is a good move if you have lump sum and set it up until beginning of December.",

If something goes down it is not \"due\" or necessarily weighted to go up more, & vice versa the randomness only continues to some degree along a macro trend line within a micro. \n\n\nMy point is he is largely betting on a random event,\n\n\n\n\n what do you mean by state in this aspect ?
