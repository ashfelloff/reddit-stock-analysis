  "selftext": "I would love to share my findings on the indication of a probable yet most likely not as soon as expected, crash. I have looked at historical data, interests rates globally, and the VIX.\n\nThroughout history, mostly in the U.S a high peak in interests rates, ultimately conspire to a massive drop which is followed by a recession. You can see that in the charts. Please note that those crashes were not mainly caused by the spike of the rates, but it was also coupled by a somewhat of a black swan event. E.x 2019 spike in interest rates followed up by Covid. Or 2007 peak of interest followed by the housing crash after a cut in 2008-2009.\n\nThat alone isn't going to justify a crash. Japan has raised rates which if you follow the Japanese market that DOES NOT happen often. Most memorable moments where Japan raises interest and the U.S cuts is back in 2008 (housing crash). In addition, England has also cut rates which has not happened since Covid 2020...\n\n2024's Black Swan could very much be the A.I \"bubble\" or a potential War, which I'll get to later on.\n\n10% of the U.S stock market engages in a technique called the \"carry trade\". Which is a form of arbitrage where you take a loan out of a country that offers extremely low rates, in this case it was Japan's yen BEFORE the raise. Then you take an equivalent to lets say $1000 of yen and put it in either a safe yield/bond or the stock market. People started doing that much more with speculations of a rate cut happening in September (U.S FEDS).... which did not happen.\n\nInstead, Japan raised it's rates and the stock market crashed due to poor labor U.S data, taking us away from a confident cut, to a not so confident one anymore. Please keep in mind the $1000 that was taken from Japan most likely was not just invested as the prime amount, but more of on average $2000 due to leverage trading. A standard 1:2 is common and therefore people who have lost the initial $1000 (50% loss) most likely are now in debt to the raising interest to Bank of Japan. Hence the outstanding bear charts of the top 2 banks in Japan. Accumulating to a total today of a 20% loss in the stock market.\n\nThis would lead to tons of people to declare bankruptcy and sell off massively causing a crash (which it did on Friday)\n\nAnd no Japan can't just start printing money because their GDP to Debt ratio is at 260%, 9 Trillion Dollars...\n\nEconomics aside, the pressure and uncertainty of a potential war with I.S and Iran is on the table increasing uncertainty.\n\nWith all this in hand, it is hard when to predict a global crash, even though almost $3 trillion dollars were wiped out...\n\n[U.S Interest to Recession Charts](https://preview.redd.it/etw16xsfotgd1.png?width=1050&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d4f18313b0117adb97aa0273524180a317a9da3)\n\nThere's more images I want to add but can't...",
