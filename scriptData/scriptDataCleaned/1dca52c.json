  "selftext": "Let me give you the lowdown on what’s going on with AMD and how I'm playing it.\n\n# Current Play:\n\nSo, AMD's been moving—up 0.8% on Friday, to be exact. It hit a high of $169.45 and settled at $168.16. But here’s the kicker: only 14.5 million shares traded hands, way below the usual 66.8 million. That’s a 78% drop in volume! Something’s brewing.\n\n# Analyst Chatter:\n\nThe street’s buzzing. Here’s the breakdown:\n\n* **Citigroup:** Slashed their target from $192 to $176, still says “buy.”\n* **Morgan Stanley:** Cut theirs from $193 to $177, also keeps an “overweight” rating.\n* **KeyCorp:** Dropped from $270 to $230, sticking with “overweight.”\n* **DZ Bank:** Upped to a “buy” with a $190 target.\n* **Wedbush:** Stays “outperform” with a $200 target.\n\nOverall, it’s a solid “Moderate Buy” from 28 out of 31 analysts, with an average target of $185.26. They’re mostly bullish, with a couple of cautious voices in the mix.\n\n# Financial Pulse:\n\nEarnings came in at $0.62 per share, just a hair above the consensus of $0.61. Revenue’s at $5.47 billion, a tiny miss against the $5.48 billion estimate but up 2.2% year-over-year. Not earth-shattering, but steady.\n\nKey ratios to watch:\n\n* **Debt-to-equity:** 0.03.\n* **Quick ratio:** 1.92.\n* **Current ratio:** 2.64. Market cap sits at $271.33 billion, with a P/E ratio of 246.87. The PEG ratio is 1.92, and it’s got a beta of 1.69, so it’s got some juice in a volatile market.\n\n# Insider Moves:\n\nNow, insiders are moving. **CEO Lisa Su** unloaded 125,000 shares for about $24.4 million, and **EVP Mark Papermaster** sold 16,200 shares for around $2.7 million. Total insider sales in the past three months hit about $30.1 million. They still hold 0.73% of the stock. Could be normal cashing out, but always worth noting.\n\n# Institutional Maneuvers:\n\nBig players are piling in:\n\n* **Norges Bank:** Dropped $3.4 billion into AMD.\n* **DZ BANK AG:** Boosted their stake by over 800%.\n* **International Assets Investment Management LLC** and **Capital World Investors:** Both made hefty buys, each around half a billion.\n* **Price T Rowe Associates Inc.:** Upped their game, now holding $4.08 billion worth.\n\n# My Strategy:\n\n**Technical Setup:**\n\n* **50-Day Moving Average:** $161.33.\n* **200-Day Moving Average:** $161.36. Key levels to watch: the previous close at $166.78 and the moving averages.\n\n**Entry Points:**\n\n* **Short-Term:** I’m eyeing a dip around $165. That’s close to the 50-day moving average and looks like a sweet spot for a bounce.\n* **Long-Term:** If it slides to the 200-day moving average ($161.36) or even below, it’s time to load up.\n\n**Exit Strategy:**\n\n* **Short-Term Gains:** I’m looking to cash out around $176 to $177, right in line with Citigroup and Morgan Stanley’s targets. Quick win.\n* **Long-Term Hold:** Eyeing around $200, where Wedbush’s target lies. That’s a juicy exit if it runs up there.\n\n# Market Conditions:\n\nKeep an ear to the ground for earnings and industry news. The semiconductor space can flip on a dime with supply chain issues or new tech breakthroughs.\n\n# The Bottom Line:\n\nAMD’s got some strong fundamentals and analyst support, despite some recent target cuts. It’s a play worth considering, with a potential sweet spot for entry at $165 and a target exit anywhere between $176 and $200. Stay sharp, and let’s see how this ride goes!\n\nCheers to smart trading! 🥂",

They don't have the money to bridge the moat, and their copycat tech has always been \"also-ran\".  Examples:  their monitor sync, upscaling and frame generation in the consumer market are always watered-down versions of tech that NVDA pioneered and mastered.\n\nReal competition will likely emerge from Amazon and possibly Qualcomm.  I'm not betting on either MS or Intel to get competitive enterprise-scale hardware to market in the next 3 years, but Intel's new CEO may surprise us.\n\nRemember, AI hardware isn't just the chip, it's a suite of several  components *and* the interconnect backbone.  AI is also software, and this is where NVDA has the *biggest* lead.  AMD just doesn't have the warchest to compete at that level - they will continue to disrupt the desktop CPU market (though x86/64 is a dying space) and will be the \"budget friendly\" consumer GPU.  There is zero chance they will be the next NVDA.",

In a few years the hardware will surpass what people need and AMD will be in perfect position to sell cheaper chips that are still way more advanced than what anyone has today, even if Nvidia will always maintain an edge.\n\nAt the same time, AMD is pretty expensive, the market has already priced a lot of this in.\n\nI dont see amazon starting up a chip subsidiary from scratch.

I wonder though, by the time that shift takes place if we're not in a landscape where the big dogs that have already fleshed out huge AI data centres are providing AI as a service^^1, meaning there may never be a \"cottage\" or low-cost AI hardware market.  As an example, there isn't really a cottage cloud service space - it's dominated by the companies that built out gigantic facilities over the last several years like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.\n\nNo one can predict the future - it's going to be an interesting ride, for sure.  \n\n^^1 *I like the name \"TaaS\", or Tokens as a Service for this kind of AI subscription offering.*",

This has been the only news techwise we've had for some time, as AMD *still* hasn't even released any MLPerf or other test results while Nvidia has. Also worth noting AMD has no TensorRT equivalent. They are kicking ass on the CPU front, and I have bought a couple dozen more shares in the last month, but it's worrying they haven't released any test results still on the AI front, and that's by design. \n\nWe'll see how they match up, but longterm, obviously AI will be where it's at and Lisa has confirmed that is their #1 priority right now, but considering Nvidia has openly stated gaming GPUs are not a priority, yet at the same time AMD has lost steam there since the 3090ti was released, I don't feel that bodes well since they have been unable to close the gap generation after generation. At least they're giving Intel a run for their money in the CPU space. But someone else in this thread mentioned AMD is positioning themselves for robotics which is great since that's next after AI in terms of where the real growth and new sources of revenue is from this point. I'm still gonna buy and hold, but as someone else mentioned, SMH is also a great pick that should be recommended more for those interested in this sector.

AMD still has software optimization work which they are doing by the way. Currently they are supply capped as they are still ramping. But MLPerf is coming. We'll probably get it this month or next.\n\n>  Also worth noting AMD has no TensorRT equivalent.\n\nvLLM is AMD's alternative. AMD is going the Open Source route.\n\nIn the consumer dGPU, AMD has actually closed the gap with RDNA2, but gaming PC is very Nvidia centric. This market is very price and margin sensitive, and Nvidia has a big economies of scale advantage. Also AMD supplies chips for Consoles. And so this is where their attention is.\n\nDatacenter has much more margins to work with, to where AMD is not constrained by the differences in economies of scale.\n\nWhen it comes to consumer mobile GPUs. I think AMD has a huge opening there as well. This is due to AI PC. AI PC is increasing the need for memory bandwith, which was what always held iGPU back. But now that AI PC requires more bandwidth this allows AMD to pack increasingly stronger iGPU in their APUs. This will give them an edge vs. Nvidia in premium/gaming laptops (see the upcoming Strix Halo).",

Equivalent and alternative is a distinction we will better determine when the MLPerf tests drop but I feel like Nvidia will have the upperhand, they've shown a lot of confidence compared to AMD which is what has me nervous as somebody invested more heavily in AMD\n\nAlso, AMD has kinda had a monopoly on chips used for consoles and handheld PCs like the Steam Deck, but NVIDIA is going to be getting in on that as well (for handheld PCs only AFAIK). With Nvidia being the golden child and wanting to continue with its momentum, this kind of worries me for AMD if Nvidia manages to scoop up even some of the competition AMD has had uncontested. \n\nI don't really understand AI PC and will need to learn more, but you have pointed out great info in both posts in this thread and that makes me feel more secure with my investments. I just don't share your confidence in AMDs ability to catch up/pass Nvidia on the GPU front, I still have that type of excitement just more on the CPU front. It's ironic since AMD and Nvidia employ roughly the same amount of people, it's just AMD has its fingers in so many more pies so that's where a lot of my trepidation comes in",

There is a rumor they will be partnering with Mediatek on this. But even that is just vanilla ARM cores anyone can license.\n\nOne of the biggest myths about ARM is that the chips are more efficient than x86. But this is not quite true. ARM chips are only more efficient at light workloads. At heavy workloads x86 has an edge, due to SMT. This is why AMD has a strong presence in high performance consoles. And this is why ARM hasn't been able to dethrone Epyc in datacenter.\n\nAMD's core competency is hardware for high performance computing. Nvidia is actually the one which does way more on the software side, like the recently announced in house Nim service cloud AI service. Nvidia does way more non-hardware things. They also have Mellanox, which is networking.\n\nAMD and Nvidia revealed their datacenter AI GPUs roadmaps at Computex last week. From the way I read those roadmaps. AMD will lose the hardware lead towards the end of the year (will remain competitive in VRAM capacity though), but in 2025 it should take the lead again, and potentially extend it in 2026.\n\nAMD's chiplets allow them to transition to the new cutting edge node sooner than Nvidia which relies on a brute force approach of building huge 814mm^2 dies.",

Although a major marco event could shift the overall market, i.e. CPI report being worst than expected or China took any more aggressive positioning.\n\n  \nIn the short term AMD should be tested again around 160ish so if people are eyeing that should be a good entry point, although I personally would be waiting to see the overall sentiment since I am suspecting a stagflation or even bearish market and some profit taking with the recent NVDA run ups.",
