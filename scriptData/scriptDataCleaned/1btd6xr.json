  "selftext": "With gold at an all time high and the miners lagging behind, I think even now is probably a good entry point into shares or calls of GDX or GDXJ. Copper prices are rising as well. \n\nI bought 100K of 38 strike September calls on GDX, and I plan to hold for around 35-40 days (so that we get a bunch of the miners earnings reports and guidance). I believe their guidance will be very bullish as every 100 rise in gold price is a noticeable profit boost for the miners. I expect material demand to continue to increase for things used in servers so you can consider this an AI play as well (since miners also do other materials). \n\nI wanted to know if anyone has any opinions about this and if they think there is more upside to other mining companies. I am aware the stocks have been running up a bit but are far from the highs. Downside I see is if rates stay higher, lower profits because of debt.",
