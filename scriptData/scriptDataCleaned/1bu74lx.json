We had only 1 hike left anticipated. stock and bond market still sold off until Powell cooled off on the hawkish speech.\n\nEconomy humming along doesn't mean it's bullish. The Fed staying high for too long can still tip it into a recession.\n\nSince market is forward looking, if it sniffs out that the Fed is too worried about inflation to cut rates when the labor market shows weakness, the Fed can still easily tip the economy into a recession even if it's strong now, and market will price the recession in ahead of time.\n\nThe correction in Fall 2023 only ended when Powell started showing signs of concern about the labor market by saying \"risk more balanced\". But with oil anticipated to hit $100 by summer (it only briefly touch $90 last year), not sure how long he can keep saying that.",
