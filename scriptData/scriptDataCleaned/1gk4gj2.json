  "selftext": "SIRI has done that split-off with Liberty Media and Berkshire Hathaway just increased their stake to 33%. SiriusXM has more users than Spotify when including Pandora and is sitting rather undervalued ie. Warren Buffet takes advantage. And he‚Äôs picky. Something appears to be cooking. Acquisition target? Cause the ER wasn‚Äôt that good and he‚Äôs not really the yolo‚Äôing kind is he?\n\nKeep in mind the recent reverse split. You don‚Äôt want to buy those cause that‚Äôs the pennystock playbook. However, in rare cases prior to an acquisition it may be a term for the acquisition itself to take place. They had no non-compliamce issues and the price was not below $2 pre-split. \n\nSo that is clearly unusual. When a reverse split, which is THE the most important tool for scamming predators, appears to NOT be used for the sole intent of diluting to get paid and live like kings, that sticks out to me. I know how pennystocks operate and this is not how.\n\nEx-date is today Nov 5 and I‚Äôve heard something about FTD‚Äôs outstanding. Can anyone confirm?\n\nI‚Äôm not saying it will go to the moon and not before a 30% drop. Maybe it‚Äôs too obvious to happen idk. Or maybe we‚Äôre supposed to think it‚Äôs too obvious to happen so we‚Äôre like ‚Äúnaah‚Äù and then when it happens we‚Äôre like ‚ÄúGod damn it I knew it!‚Äù. \n\nEither way I see it as a stamp of approval and I started a small position Friday in the PM. I hope it‚Äôll drop honestly. I‚Äôd like a larger position in this particular case. And Yesterday it did drop so I‚Äôve added a little bit more.\nNot easy to find a good management and Warren Buffet is known for his and Charlie Munger‚Äôs need to like a company‚Äôs management and the way they run the business.\n\nEDIT: The 200MA on the 1hr chart or 50MA on the 4hr chart MAY provide support. Placed a little extra buy order at 25 if/when it closes the gap.\n\nGOLD EDIT: My man just brought it to my attention that their new Sirius 360L and OEM radios transmit and receive on a decent bandwith. Perfect for telemetry, diagnostics, GPS - data that is valuable to first responders, insurance companies, law enforement etc.\nAnd they have a legal monopoly in satellite radio. \n\nTHAT‚Äôs what Berkshire Hathaway sees coming - the value of the data only SiriusXM can provide.

Remember, Buffett bought Oxy at a higher price than it was today, years ago. They also bought Paramount. They sometimes make poor decisions, however they are so big that even the poor decisions won't make a dent, because they don't allow themselves to go big on riskier plays. \n\nThey can also wait. And I don't mean wait 5-10 years, they can wait-wait... They can wait 50+ years if they want to, because they have multiple streams of income and huge diversification with many operating businesses. Buffett and Charlie basically built Berkshire to stand when everything else falls. \n\nJust my two cents about Berkshire moves.
