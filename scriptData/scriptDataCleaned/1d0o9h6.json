Or a 3rd solution would be to create new baskets *and* keep tracking the old ones, like my original comment suggested.\n\n\nThe current system is measuring the change in cost of living for a steadily declining standard of living. That's not useful. Nobody wants a steadily declining standard of living. If anything it's more useful to look at the basket changes themselves to get a sense of by how much the standard of living has declined.\n\n\nThose weren't really difficult solutions to think of, but don't feel bad, man.

I'm sure *no one* will complain about a measure that includes only water, bread, and housing. And yes, bread would be just about the only food item you could include in that basket, they didn't have McDonalds in 1802.\n\nYour second option is where your stupidity really just blows my mind... I asked you to improve on the current methodology. Implicit in that was that you would *read* the current methodology, you massive fucking regard. Saying that it measures relative to a declining standard of living is an opinion, not a fact; a factually incorrect opinion, as it happens.\n\nYour third suggestion is amazing as well. You want them to track hundreds of different baskets, going back decades, ~~so that you can cherrypick the one that suits your narrative~~ just for posterity?\n\nF-, stay in school.",
