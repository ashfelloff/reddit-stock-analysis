Our choices for leader just a few months ago were 2 aging, decrepit, spend-happy, deficit exploding, forgetful, and old AF white males. Neither of whom could get even half of the country to vote for them. \n\nSure we got Kamala now as an option, but she's 60 years \"young\" and not exactly going rock the boat as much as she promises. If anything she'll be continuing the Biden/Harris agenda with some slight changes. We're not going from a used 1988 Camry to a new electric super yacht or even a 2025 Rolls-Royce Spectre EV so much as a used 2008 Camry hybrid. Problem is half the country believes we should go with the 1992 Hummer H1 instead.\n\nWith that said, it's a good thing the value and trust of the US isn't ONLY dependent on our presidential options? \n\nWe have the largest pile of gold, the strongest military, the best economy, constant stream of migrants to prop our stable/growing population, land/resources, we generally have stability at home insulated from wars, our Fed is accommodative, our dollar is the reserve currency, there is generally rule of law along with checks & balances on political power, we are the leader in technology, our people are forward looking plus also harder working than most others, while the system is built to mostly not get in the way of that, and we're overall the best option given the alternatives. There's no better alternative be it Europe with their lower growth, higher inflation, EU regulations, war at the border, energy insecurity, and being an old people home. China with their deflation, downturn, demographics issues, lack of human rights or true capitalism, and Xi's random crackdowns isn't exactly a better option either. Japan has the demographics problems like China/Europe without the size, military/environmental threats, and while they are technologically advanced are also prone to be extremely backwards with their adherence to seniors/senority. Ditto that to Korea. Russia = LOL. Etcetcetc. Even if the US isn't #1 at everything, the US is basically one of the least smelly pieces of shit in a world full of even shitter shit.",
