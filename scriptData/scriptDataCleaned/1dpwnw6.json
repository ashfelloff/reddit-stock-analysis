I told her calls if you believe it goes up or puts if you believe it goes down. She looked through a few charts and decided to buy 126$ NVDA calls 07/19 at the bottom of the dip.\n\nWell, all I‚Äôm hearing now is that I‚Äôm an idiot as I lose on every option I touch (I‚Äôm majoring in finance at a renowned university in Germany) + I guess she‚Äôs addicted now.\n\nCheers",

I like to look at the break even price as well because sure it might get to the strike price, but with the break even price you can quickly see how high relatively people are placing the premium on different options for the same date when scrolling through.
