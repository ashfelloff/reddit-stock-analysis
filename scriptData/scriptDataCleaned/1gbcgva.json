The call expires tomorrow so yesterday it was worth very little as no one expected the stock price to go up that high all of a sudden (which is when OP bought the calls for cheap premium). An options price decays as time gets closer to the expiration date where the extrinsic value (the potential move of the stock) reduces to 0 and the option is fully based on the intrinsic value (the actual difference between strike price and current price).\n\nOP bought the 230 call which means every dollar it goes above 230 the option intrinsicically rises by 1 dollar as well. so at 260 right now it is worth 30 dollars per share or 3000 dollars per contract. Since its so close to expiry its worth 30 but if it was priced for next week for example it would be worth a bit more due to extrinsic value. You can check this by looking at the same strike price for future dates and see how it keeps going up.\n\nTomorrow OP can either sell these contracts to someone else, or actually exercise it hence buying 46 \\* 100 = 4600 shares of TSLA at a price of 230 dollars per share assuming they have enough capital to do so.",
