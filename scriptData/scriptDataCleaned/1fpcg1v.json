I just sold 40% to consolidate some profit.\n\nThe problem with Software as a Service (SAS) is that it requires a lot more staff than a normal software company. They have to be recruited, trained, then go out onsite with the customer, which means there will not be 10x gains.\n\nI don't particularly trust curly haired tech bro's, if you get soppy or even cult-like about a stock its bad for business.
