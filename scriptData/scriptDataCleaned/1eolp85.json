Since I knew her personally and intimately one of my female friends after I sent her screen shots of people's comments dared me to make a burner account and post pics cause I had stuff that had never been posted online. So I did and my DMs got overloaded with people messaging me and everyone was commenting on everything etc. Then my first account got banned lol. But I was having fun cause I'd been bored and was going through a really rough patch the last few months so as sad as it is the interactions were actually helping out, so I made another burner to replace that one and came back. And then I got bored of it and stopped posting, if you see my last posts was a few weeks ago. But I forgot to log out of this one and so commented on here on accident as opposed to my \"real\" reddit account lmao",

That’s means exactly what it means, the max loss you set up with a spread is only theoretical and can be broken. A few common was a spread is broken is pin risk and dividend risk. In pin risk you are at risk of the spread ending between the two points of your spread. Lets say you set a call debit spread you’ll be long the 10c and short the 15c. The stock ends at 12. Your long call would be exercised while your hedge the 15c expired worthless, pinning you with the 100 shares long at 10c. Now most options expire Friday so you’ll hold these shares into the weekend unhedged (most you of in this sub doesn’t even have enough to cover the 100 shares opening you to significant risk). Monday opens the stock for fun is trading at 7. You’ll now lose 300+ blowing your entire hedge. Now magnify this with 100+ contracts on underlying that trade at $500+ per share and suddenly your entire account is blown. This is the reason brokers won’t let you hold options spread into close if you don’t have the $ to cover exercise / assignments. The overall entire industry understands that you don’t hold options into expiration due to these risk and it’s 1000% better to close your option for 1$ than hold.\n\nThis was all on mobile so sorry for any errors",

Person A still has the $100 they owe to you, so you have no choice but to give Person B another $100 of your money. Now, your bank account/wallet is down $100, but you will have $100 coming back from Person A later which will bring you back to square.\n\nThat’s the basic concept of what’s happening here, except we’re looking at thousands of dollars and the figures aren’t perfectly even nor static.
