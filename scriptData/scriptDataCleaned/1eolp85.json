Since I knew her personally and intimately one of my female friends after I sent her screen shots of people's comments dared me to make a burner account and post pics cause I had stuff that had never been posted online. So I did and my DMs got overloaded with people messaging me and everyone was commenting on everything etc. Then my first account got banned lol. But I was having fun cause I'd been bored and was going through a really rough patch the last few months so as sad as it is the interactions were actually helping out, so I made another burner to replace that one and came back. And then I got bored of it and stopped posting, if you see my last posts was a few weeks ago. But I forgot to log out of this one and so commented on here on accident as opposed to my \"real\" reddit account lmao",
