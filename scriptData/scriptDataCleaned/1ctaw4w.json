  "selftext": "\nhttps://money.usnews.com/investing/articles/best-performing-etfs\n\nWhile some crazy pop and drop rallies happen - MSOS etf along with its underlying are steadily rising - and should continue into year end.  \n\nThe recent earnings reports from the top 10 cannabis stocks have exceeded expectations, signaling a strong fundamental improvement in the sector. All the top equities in the basket are free cash flow positive. \n\nThe lack of capital and banking has forced companies to be profitable and stopped competing on price. Significantly de-risking the sector. \n\nThis success is a blow to the short thesis, especially with $1.2 billion in short interest still present, which could create a significant tailwind as shorts cover.\n\nMJUS - another American Cannabis etf - has seen inflows recently, and has provided further buying pressure. \n\nhttps://x.com/boldux/status/1790721793608778054?s=46&t=_ix3z8VWbLz3cM3z110Q7A\n\nOhio legalization - and adult use sales start next month. \n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/recreational-marijuana-ohio-78739a979aff152168cdbf40241f994b\n\nTrulieve, Curaleaf, Greenthumb, Verano, Cresco Labs stand to benefit significantly. \n\n\n\n",
