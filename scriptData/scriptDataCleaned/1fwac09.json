Every Tesla owner I know won’t lend out their Tesla.  The percentage that will give up their cars to go full robotaxis are low.  I don’t want to pay $7 to take my kids to school and back, commute to work, quick trips to Home Depot, Starbucks, or mcdonalds.  All these little trips add up and it will be more costly than just owning a car.  Add up all your little trips and you be at $50-$80 a day= $1500-1600 a month.  \n\nThe best scenario is an Uber type service which doesn’t make much compared to their car business.
