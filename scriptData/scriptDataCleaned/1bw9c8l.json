  "selftext": "There’s a lawsuit alleging Goldmans and Morgan offerings and dumping it on pensions, the public\n\nhttps://money.usnews.com/investing/news/articles/2024-04-04/goldman-morgan-stanley-must-face-investors-lawsuit-over-archegos-collapse\n\nhttps://ir.paramount.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-announces-25-billion-debt-offering\n\nhttps://ipo-edge.com/exclusive-tiger-cub-archegos-liquidation-triggers-record-crash-in-discovery-viacomcbs-sources/\n\nTheir lastest offering \n\nhttps://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Pricing-of-Public-Offering-of-Common-Stock/default.aspx\n\nHaving worked on SMCI hardware for over 15 years there’s something extremely fishy about the price movement, offering considering their lack of AI tech, margins, history of accounting fraud.  \n\nYears ago I talked about AMD and NVDA\n\n 5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 would be the best datacenter play\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/\n\n2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/\n\nhttps://www.complianceweek.com/regulatory-enforcement/super-micro-computer-former-cfo-charged-with-accounting-violations/29367.article\n\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/shareholder-alert-pomerantz-law-firm-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-super-micro-computer-inc---smci-302093712.html\n\nI’m not saying to make a play because I don’t know how long this will take to play out but this company literally has no AI tech, weird offerings, dilutions, Goldmans running the market, a history of fraud, being delisted and one of the largest SEC fines.  So many red flags \n\nI’m more on the tech side but there’s so many alarms about this stock and the offering by Goldmans. Plus think of SMCI selling metal enclosures to house GPUs and CPUs.  We had many SMCI boxes that are 5+ years old.  Yes we’d upgrade the GPU/CPU every few years but the metal enclosure servers that were SMCI we rarely ever upgrade beyond 5+ years.  \n\nPSA Don’t be their exit liquidity.  Lots of red flags, maybe you take a chance when it was $90 but at $1000 up 1000%  in a year and with all these red flags it’s a terrible investment.",
