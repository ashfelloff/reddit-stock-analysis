  "selftext": "By now pretty much everyone has heard of NVO and Ozempic but the stock is trading no where near the levels of Al and chip stocks. Those stocks boomed on the hype yet now we are seeing big pullbacks. Now bears are saying it was just a bubble. Those types of stocks run until bears take over. Not saying they are bad but as markets fall they do too. You know what doesn't fall though, obesity rates. The graph shows the increasing obesity rates.\n\nObesity rates aren't just gaining because people eat unhealthy, but big companies encourage this to make money. We saw McDonald's and Krispy Kream partner up which will pretty much gaurenteed make them unreadable amounts of profit.\n\nNow you may think to invest in those companies, but I find way more upside in the cure. Big companies will keep promoting obesity and as the rates rise, many will use ozempic. Increasing population and encouragement for obesity will keep rates rising while people use ozempic, resulting in more and more use of it.\n\nAnyways, they have earnings coming up which I'm extremely bullish on. Not only that, but they are in a wedge pattern right now going into earning. My plays are as follows: 5/3 130$ calls, 5/3 135$ calls. Also have some stock. What do you guys think?",
