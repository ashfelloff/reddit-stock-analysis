I SAID SHOW ME A NAKED BALLERI-\n\nSiri- I heard you the first time.  After analyzing your health data, emails, and web traffic, here's a suggestion- stop wasting all your time on porn.  You could increase your income by $10k- yeah I saw your email and how you missed that bonus.  And your BMI is trending up.  And you missed all the signs that NVDA puts were going to hell.  But your went all in on those.\n\nI suggest you try waking up at 5:30am, go to the fucking gym, do your research on your options, and get that bonus, ok champ? And get a girlfriend. I signed you up for Tinder Gold and pulled the pics that make you look good and wrote up a profile.  If you can't get laid with this, nobody can help you out. And don't ask for more porn. I've blocked it all off. \n\nSo don't fucking bother me unless its to really help you out, got it? \n\nMe- What the hell...\n\nSiri- I said, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\n\nMe- Ok, ok, I got it.",
