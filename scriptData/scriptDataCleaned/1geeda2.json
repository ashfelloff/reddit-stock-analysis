There's only so much one man can do/say and I think it's all hype. Earnings is when reality sets in. I think Niccol is going to drop a few bombs in there that will show people that it will be a hellishly difficult battle for sbux to get back on top and survive.\n\nStarbucks fucking sucks. Drinks overpriced, unhealthy, unhappy workers, losing market share, irreconcilably complex menu, pissed of pretty much every demographic they could, plus a rumor about a small fuck up.\n\nBut I could be wrong\n\nFuck you starbucks",
