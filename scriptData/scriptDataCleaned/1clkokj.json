  "selftext": "I did a quick search: ‚Äúoklo NRC application 2024‚Äù. I wanted to see where Oklo was at in this application process. Here‚Äôs what I got back from AI. \n\nAlso: \n\n‚ÄúWhen is Oklo's application expected to go through the NRC review and approval process, and what are the key stages and target dates?\n\nOklo‚Äôs application for a license was initially denied by the NRC in January 2022 due to insufficient information on certain topics, including potential accidents and safety systems. After the denial, Oklo‚Äôs co-founders stated that they plan to re-submit a plan with the NRC, and they anticipate little time will be lost as they restart the application process. In September 2022, Oklo submitted a recharged licensing project plan (LPP) with the NRC, which builds on the pre-application lessons learned and NRC staff feedback from the initial submission.\n\nIt is unclear when Oklo‚Äôs next license application submittal will be made, but the new LPP aims to enable efficiency and reduce COLA review times in the future, supporting the company‚Äôs initial timeline for deployment of its reactor. Oklo has already checked off some key NRC requirements, including approval for its quality assurance program description in 2020. The company is working under the NRC‚Äôs existing licensing pathways, Part 50 and Part 52, and is seeking a combined license for construction and operation.‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôll leave it up to you to glean from this what you will.
