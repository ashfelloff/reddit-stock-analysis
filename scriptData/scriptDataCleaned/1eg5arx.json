  "selftext": "Intel Corp. plans to eliminate thousands of jobs to reduce costs and fund an ambitious effort to rebound from an earnings slump and market share losses.\n\nThe workforce reduction may be announced as early as this week, according to people familiar with the company’s plans, who asked not to be identified because the information isn’t public. \n\nIntel, which is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings Thursday, has about 110,000 employees, excluding workers at units that are being spun out.\n\n\n\n",

The more alfalfa he did not grow, the more money the government gave him, and he spent every penny he didn't earn on new land to increase the amount of alfalfa he did not produce. Major Major's father worked without rest at not growing alfalfa. On long winter evenings he remained indoors and did not mend harness, and he sprang out of bed at the crack of noon every day just to make certain that the chores would not be done. He invested in land wisely and soon was not growing more alfalfa than any other man in the county. Neighbours sought him out for advice on all subjects, for he had made much money and was therefore wise. “As ye sow, so shall ye reap,” he counselled one and all, and everyone said “Amen.”",

Paying for people to run the factory isn't as big a piece of the pie as other manufacturing. Also the people running the factory are generally highly skilled/educated and specialized. \n\nSo compared to other industries I don't think the semiconductor companies are well primed to go somewhere like Malaysia. It all went to Taiwan due to some very good investments and savvy business moves made in the 90s - cheap labor wasn't a big factor.",

Itanium was relegated to a few high-performance systems and software manufacturers saw no need to recode for Itanium. Intel had to play catch-up and while their x86 chips performed well (using AMDs architecture), they couldn't innovate as they blew their engineering talent on designs that no one bought. ",

Intel has failed FAR more often than they have succeeded.  Forever they were kept alive by being the leaders in process engineering.  The minute TSMC hit parity (and then moved ahead) Intel's goose was cooked.  Their products have never been the best (if you remove process tech) or the cheapest.  Their company has never been lean or overly visionary.  They just rode x86 and their IP protection thereof for a LONG time.  \n\nYes the ia432 was a cool concept but a case of being too visionary/out there.  The i860/i960's were good but Intel couldn't market it because it wasn't x86.  Itanic was a research paper gone wrong (and could EASILY have been salvaged if Intel didn't want to die on their hill of hubris).  I worked with AMD when then were designing x64.  Microsoft was the market maker their.  Intel was designing their own 64bit x86 that wasn't compatible, but AMD got to MS first, got the buy in and Ms told Intel to pound sand (\"we already gave you Itanium, we aren't doing your x8664 (whatever it was called, too long ago)\").\n\nWorked well for amd too, it put an end to the endless litigation of cross-licensing and fab restrictions.  If it wasn't for that AMD would have serious legal issues getting TSMC to fab for them and would never have been able to get rid of their fans so easily.  \n\nIntel is fundamentally broken, and as a result my guess is the best engineers just don't land there like they used to.  It's going to be a difficult recovery that won't be helped by morale shattering layoffs.",

Intel was the market leader and they knew it.  They also abused the fuck out of it.  They strong-armed (pardon any chip puns) their customers massively.  Many of them hated Intel but had no viable alternative.  Microsoft tried once to open the market up a bit more when they ported NT to Alpha, MIPS and PPC.  Alpha had a shot, but CPQ fucked that into the dirt when they bought DEC.  When Intel ate it on Itanium there were a LOT of happy people (even if they couldn't admit it publicly).\n\nThey have been corporate arrogant for as long as I can remember (which is longer than I can admit).  They peaked around the 486 days IMHO.  If it hadn't been for the design team in Haifa, Intel would have been in enormous trouble and may not be what we know as Intel today.  Intel has had really sjitty leadership for a long time now and I don't think Gelsinger is the guy to REALLY turn it around.  I definitely think he's talented but he doesn't seem the dynamic sort of leader that Intel needs to really get pointed in the right direction.  There's just so much corporate cultural baggage there...  anyway maybe I'm just old and grumpy, but tech is rather unforgiving and I don't think folks understand just what Intel is up against.  Every part of their business they are AT BEST second best right now.  They've killed some of their best technical products instead of figuring how to make a business case out of them.",

This included things like a $4,000 bonus to anyone that referred a minority candidate for a position, STEM scholarships, and diversity focused leadership programs.\n\nBefore that they were funding the \"Intel Science Talent Search\" which was a STEM competition for scholarship where the winners were often white and Asian. They ended the program in 2016 with their continued focus on diversity over pure merit.\n\nNow they are struggling even with the US government attempting to bail them out by flooding a publicly traded company with billions in cash to build fabs within the US to compete with TSMC. \n\nIt's not segment pressure either as Apple, Nvidia, AMD TSMC, Arm and others have all gone to the moon in the last ~5 years while INTC is down 40% in 5 years. \n\nIf their investments into racism over merit resulted in success the media would be bragging about it and their success story would be shoved in the face of people every year in the form of mandatory corporate training but that's not what happened and... *crickets*. \n\nThey get $8.5B in direct funds, $11B in low interest loans, and $100B in tax credits with Chips act and they have a market cap of only $128B. I am sure their US based fabs get lots of government contracts as well. That's one hell of a free ride to still be going down (in the middle of a chip boom no less).",
