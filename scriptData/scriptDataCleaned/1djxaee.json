As to other competitors, nay, they cannot even see NVDA’s tail lights yet. ",

Both will be reduced when rate cuts happen. In fact its likely that some funds will sell to raise capital and then go out and buy a bunch of other stocks that will benefit from the rate cuts. fomo will vanish when people are trying to make rent or figure out how to deal with losing a job. Safe haven premium will reduce as rate cuts make the other stuff become safer. \n\nHow much of a drop would that cause? Who knows. I wouldn't be surprised by a 10% pullback or a 50% pullback. I wouldn't be surprised if it did that AND then went to ATH all within a 12 month period. Remember that if you see a major drop in price there will be a huge impact to options and a lot of people will likely be margin called. \n\nLong term I fully expect NVDA will do quite well. Short to medium term I expect some incredible volatility. To be clear I think the issues will come from market rotation and from the fact that all those other stocks are on life support from the rates.",
