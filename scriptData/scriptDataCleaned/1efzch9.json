  "selftext": "Keep your chin up. The bears have gotten smarter in their relentless fight against all things AI. They are going to be this way until the Terminator spawns from another future time and tries to find John Connor.\n\nAt that point, when Arnold spawns naked in a factory backdrop with molten steel spraying sparks of fire on his glorious liquid metal exoskeleton, then and only then, will the bears realize what AI is and can be used for. Only then, will the insane articles that read blatant idiocracy stop printing. Check out a few of the wild headlines below.\n\n* Apple doesn't use Nvidia chips - Reuters\n   * Apple hasn't made shit with AI. It's like saying my local grocery store doesn't use Nvidia chips. Emojis' don't need H100's. Furthermore, which negates the entire argument, is that Apple had to concede to using ChatGPT which does use Nvidia. Just like they use Google search and Google maps and Outlook to make their phone actually viable based on some closed off crazy walled garden that nobody really appreciates.\n* Nvidia will fall 50% - The Motley Fool\n* AI has no ROI\n   * Yes it does\n* AI is only good for Emoji's\n   * Meanwhile people are automating workflows as their core job with AI. Keep thinking this.\n* Nobody is making money from AI\n   * Not true\n* Google is building their own chips\n   * And they buy hella Nvidia chips\n* AMD is competition\n   * Cuda\n* We are building our own chips\n   * Where?\n* We can't afford the chips because our car company isn't profitable so I'd rather invest in Dojo with Broadcom\n   * Ok - good for you\n* ChatGPT lost 5 billion (but made 5 billion itself)\n   * Do you think they are just going to be buying chips forever? At some point the ROI will fully kick in. It is going to take 1 or perhaps 2 more foundational models to enter into the system before that happens.\n* A Google search query uses 10x less energy than a GPT query\n   * Here is the thing. When I GPT something I don't need to browse 100 websites to get one answer. Has anyone thought of that? I bet if you redid the study and actually included the practicality of asking something and getting a direct answer they would tell you that is a large cost savings.\n* AI is a bubble - My personal favorite\n   * Terminator say no\n\nThe list goes on folks.\n\nWhat are we even doing here?\n\nIt's time to pack up and go home. We are defeated, there is nothing left.\n\nBut wait, are you telling me that on the call where Microsoft said their AI receipts were only 7% last q is because there was too much demand won't improve this quarter? I think not.\n\nYou can banbet me for a lifetime if that number has not significantly increased to the likes of 9% - 10% or more this quarter.\n\nWe are in the early innings folks. And all this ever was is a buying opportunity for the ages.\n\nPositions: MSFT, ARM, and a little Nvidia ",

I’m going to ask some beginner ones here (forgive me if stupid,) in case it might help others. \n\nHear you on naked options. Sold a put by accident and was a mess. Have no intention to do so going forward. So far, I’ve created ad hoc debit spread to limit risk a bit, on calls I’d bought. And now…questions:\n\nI’d like to put about 50k into shares to write CCs against for supplemental income. Test that out this year and then perhaps use it as such in 2025 - thoughts (and please be brutally honest?) For that, and laughter is expected, positions to obtain that I’ve considered:\n\n- increasing stake in the volatile MSTR, writing against a portion post split. \n\n- starting CMG, because IV has been so high, but Idk longterm.\n\n- increasing MSFT (especially if down still,) as a safe and consistent holding to write against abt half. Would be huge in my overall portfolio, though. (And the ability to do something like this is recent. But MSFT I believe in for a decade+?)\n\n- game store and writing when IV high bc shares are cheap and it’s sometimes volatile. \n\n- QQQ or SPY, though I don’t usually hold those … maybe it’s time now my portfolio has grown? Idk. Also to write CC against. \n\n- how viable is PMCC? If I set my LEAPS up as a debit spread, essentially? This confuses me, as I usually hold them bc I think there is huge upside. But also, would buy ATM or ITM as a capital efficient share proxy. \n\nLess appealing is screening IV each each week/month and acquiring to sell against…seems…\n\nLast question! Is there any reason, beyond an expected continued upswing, not to acquire shares by buying puts? I don’t see the negative, so know I’m missing something. \n\nI hope I’ve not overwhelmed you, and understand if it’s not comfortable to answer. But *thank you so much* for being open to the asking!",
