  "score": 138,
  "selftext": "In the past, the largest companies in the index were always replaced by newer companies. Due to this, it is reasonable to assume that the trend will be no different now. However, the tech companies of today are arguably different. They are growing at ridiculous speeds and have an unprecedented amount of cash flow giving them security and the ability to invest in the next big thing. Many of them also provide essential services that newer services will likely be built on top of.\n\nDo you think that this time is different for tech companies or that the pattern of newer companies replacing the old will continue?",

At least for the next decade or two. \n\nThe book I read that shaped my thinking the most on this was “The Master Switch” by Tim Wu.\n\nBasically, think about it this way: When Amazon came along and disrupted Barnes & Noble and Borders, it was using a technology that Barnes & Noble and Borders had no expertise in. They didn’t know how to build a website and run it. Fast forward 15 years: when Snapchat emerged, I’m sure the folks at Facebook took one look at it and said “oh that makes sense, why didn’t we think of that?” and proceeded to build it in several quarters.\n\nA lot of what we are seeing now in terms of general purpose technological development is still built on transistors, computers, and software. It’s very easy for the existing leaders to neutralize threats. The companies that have built this expertise will not be dislodged until a new technology comes along. \n\nThis happened, multiple times in our history, for example, with the radio, the telegraph, the telephone, the automobile, and so forth. For example, AT&T dominated for decades and so did the big three. I think the mag 7 are going to be dominant until the next *brand new* tech paradigm comes along.",

Exxon and Nvidia are still neck and neck in profits. But Nvidia is worth 7x in market cap. AAPL has been the most profitable company for 10+ years now and will most likely be the most profitable for a while. It has reduced its outstanding shares by 40% over that time and paid a dividend. If it retained all earnings like AMZN or TSLA does then AAPL would be worth probably $4T or $5T in market cap, but may not necessarily have been a better investment over that time. Same can be said for MSFT. Exxon reduced shares by almost 50% over the last 20 years and has paid quite the dividend for the last 50+ years. Exxon could easily be a $5T+ company if it just retained its earnings and invested them like Berkshire Hathaway does. So it's natural for the companies with the biggest market cap to get passed up eventually even if they are still doing great but the most profitable companies don't change nearly as often.",

They could seriously impact Apple's profits and value with a ruling against App Store fees or forcing them to allow side loading of apps (one of their most profitable businesses). They could hurt Microsoft or Amazon by making them spin off their Cloud businesses (they use these profitable businesses to subsidize other business - AWS subsidizes retail expansion, etc). They could make Meta spin off Instagram and WhatsApp. They could hurt Nvidia by making them open source or spin off all of their computing framework (CUDA) to level playing field in AI.
