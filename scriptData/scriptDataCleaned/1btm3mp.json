If you’re invested heavily into bonds or loans that were obtained back when rates were low their market value was destroyed when the Fed hiked rates by 5%. Even treasuries took huge haircuts, causing similarly huge paper losses on every bank’s books. Having to sell a large amount of those would be catastrophic for these bank portfolios which is why you saw so many failures in 2023 until they were bailed out by the BTFP.\n\nSo yes if you wait for the maturities of stuff on your books to roll off then yes you will earn more on your capital.
