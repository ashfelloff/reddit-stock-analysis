  "title": "July CPI data seals the deal for a fed cut in September",
  "score": 220,
  "selftext": "The July Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed U.S. inflation continued to moderate, with the headline CPI rising by 2.9% year-over-year (YoY), slightly below the 3.0% expected by economists, marking the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy, increased by 3.2% YoY and 0.2% month-over-month (MoM), both in line with expectations. The report is seen as a pivotal indicator for the Federal Reserve, likely sealing the case for an interest rate cut at its next meeting in September, as inflation continues to trend closer to the Fed's 2% target.\n\n\n\nShelter costs remained a significant contributor to inflation, with the shelter index rising by 0.4% MoM, accounting for nearly 90% of the monthly increase in the all-items index. Over the past year, shelter costs have increased by 5.1%, making up over 70% of the total increase in core inflation. Energy prices, on the other hand, were unchanged in July after declines in the previous two months, while the food index saw a modest 0.2% increase, consistent with June's figure.\n\n\n\nWithin the food category, notable increases were observed in the prices of meats, poultry, fish, and eggs, which rose by 0.7% in July, with the eggs index surging by 5.5%. In contrast, the cereals and bakery products index, along with the dairy and related products index, both declined by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively. Over the past year, food at home prices have risen by 1.1%, while food away from home saw a larger increase of 4.1%.\n\n\n\nEnergy prices remained stable in July, with the gasoline index unchanged after a 2.0% decrease in June. However, over the past 12 months, the energy index has risen by 1.1%, with electricity prices up 4.9% and natural gas prices increasing by 1.5%. The stabilization of energy prices in July, following months of volatility, provided some relief but continued to contribute to the overall inflation landscape.\n\n\n\nThe July CPI report's data on shelter, energy, and food prices will likely influence the Federal Reserve's upcoming decisions. The moderation in inflation, particularly in core categories, supports the case for a potential rate cut in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has previously indicated that favorable inflation data would be a key factor in determining the central bank's next steps, and this report aligns with those expectations.\n\n\n\n  \n",

(ie. If wage growth is driving inflation, it might actually be higher than inflation)  They are normally talking about it being a tax on net worth… but I would argue that framing isn’t valid for most working class people’s net worth.\n\nYou can break personal net worth down into two categories:\n- market valued\n- nominally valued (ie money in your bank account, or loans, or bonds)\n\nMarket valued assets are not impacted by inflation directly because their value goes up with inflation.  Nominally valued assets and liabilities are.\n\nThing is, if you have a mortgage or a car loan the component of your net worth that is nominally valued is quite possibly *negative*.  (The house itself is market valued)  If your nominally valued net worth competent is negative then you actually end *ahead* due to the direct effects of inflation.  Only if your nominally valued net worth component is positive does it hurt you.\n\nMy guess is for most working class people, their nominally valued net worth is negative or near zero, even if their overall net worth is positive.",

                                  "body": "I think the point you are missing is normally when the fed lowers interest rates, it’s a reaction to an economic condition that requires it in order to avoid a depression. This last rate HIKE cycle was the reaction to an economic event (a world wide pandemic, trillions of dollars printed so we could shut the economy down to slow the spread). Now we’re lowering rates back to “normal” levels for a controlled landing. Nothing like this has ever happened, there isn’t some big bad worldwide event that is necessitating a rate cut that we are reacting to. It’s a calculated and THE MOST HIGHLY TELEGRAPHED rate cut ever. There is nothing in the playbook about this scenario and how it will play out, because it’s never happened before. The economy is strong still and it’s a balancing act to keep it that way, not an economy in shambles that we’re trying to piece back together with an emergency rate cut. It takes months for the effects of rate cuts to take effect, so we can’t wait until inflation is at 2% and unemployment is at 6%, because then we would overshoot both and be out of the pot and into the fire. ",

That this is a suspected rate cut, it doesn’t mean the economy is in shambles.\n\nHowever, interest rates were extreme low since the 2008 crisis. We never really took the band aids of. Wall Street and banking system got used to easy money.\n\nWe were planning on raising rates before covid, but then could not because of the crisis.\n\nStocks go up. No argument there.

I get that people just want to bitch and moan about prices but fuck it's annoying.\n\nEvery time inflation data comes in that looks good people will flood in with \"but but but prices are higher than 3 years ago!!!\" YES everyone knows this but it's irrelevant to the metrics and plan of the Fed, and has no bearing on what to expect in the future. There is no plan to get things back to pre-covid pricing so bitching about it at every opportunity is just spam. It's literally not in the cards.\n\nSuck it up and accept that this is the new normal. You're crying over the price of spilled milk.",
