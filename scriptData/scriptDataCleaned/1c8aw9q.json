Idk how this is legal but if you're a fellow TSM bag holder just sell this is not going anywhere. Idk why I'm just now noticing the pattern but I will be selling my (worthless) calls at open and buying 120 puts for eom.",

Basically some poor souls who had limit orders in that haven’t been removed.\n\nThe TSM fade though is interesting and probably a hedge fund (not a market maker necessarily) that has downside exposure leveraged to the tits. So this makes sense.\n\nAs far as the TSM dip, the big miss was on their “legacy” product side. Everyone here is talking about the HPC chips and revenue but the majority of it still comes from regular wafers.  So that drop is a little concerning. They can only make so many HPC chips so it’s not like one can fully replace the other without retooling of manufacturing.\n\nNVDA got wtfpwned by SMCI not reporting a pre earnings so everyone is scared it will be a huge miss.\n\nMSFT is generally seen as a safe haven sure bet kind of play.",
