One: We’re returning to the pre-2021 reality where Huawei and Apple share the premium segment between themselves and Apple is stable at 15%. Second: This time is different. The gloves are off and Huawei’s focus on China (due to the difficulty of scaling Harmony OS globally), the government’s focus on security and industrial policy, Apple’s focus on India and other places (both for production and as a market) conspire to eventually drive Apple’s market share towards zero.\n\nI think the latter is more likely. The question is how fast this will happen.",
