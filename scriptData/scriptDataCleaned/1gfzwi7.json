Still, shares slipped 1% in after-hours trading.\n\nThe food delivery giant posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.38, surpassing analyst estimates of $0.20. Revenue rose 25% year-over-year to $2.71 billion, exceeding the consensus forecast of $2.66 billion.\n\nDoorDash achieved a significant milestone by generating positive GAAP net income of $162 million, compared to a net loss of $73 million in the same quarter last year. This marks the company's first profitable quarter since going public.\n\nTotal orders increased 18% YoY to 643 million, while Marketplace Gross Order Value (GOV) grew 19% to $20.0 billion. The company's net revenue margin improved to 13.5% from 12.9% in Q3 2023.‚Äù\n\nI don‚Äôt have any open position for them, but they have grown by a lot this year as well. ",

However having used it on both sides it's unsustainable. It's now just bonkers and eventually it will be exposed and Doodash for sure knows it's going on. There's probably tens to hundreds of thousands of illegal door dash drivers taking over the market and driving down costs. There are Instagram, Facebook, Craigslist and telegram groups renting out door dash identities. While door dash has millions of drivers, over 90% of them work ZERO to under 10hrs a week. The rest are power drivers and they are controlling the supply and demand. Over the past few years illegals have been taking over this power driver market and eventually this will blow up more.\n\nhttps://www.sanangelolive.com/news/crime/2024-08-29/report-driver-accounts-food-delivery-apps-being-illegally-rented-migrants\n\nThis is a shitty article but I'm in Texas, I'd say over half of these drivers that fulfill my orders are likely illegal as they are middle aged to younger and speak zero level of English. When you log into the driver side if the app they are literally accepting orders that pay you $2-$3. It wasn't like this in the past.",

The people getting hosed by it are the ones who are accepting every order chasing their stupid statuses and challenges, no shit you're losing money accepting an order for $2.50.
