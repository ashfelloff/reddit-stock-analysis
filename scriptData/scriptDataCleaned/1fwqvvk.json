So I bought a 4 Month call on defense ETF (ETF so I don’t gamble on a specific stock) which gained me a nice 50% return. 50% return on a 4 month expiration is my bread and butter. I already sold my Defense positions as I reached my profit goal but the sector is still bullish. To help prevent gambling you need an exit strategy established before you enter a trade.",
