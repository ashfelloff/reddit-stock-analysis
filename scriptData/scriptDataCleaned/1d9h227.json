From a brokerage standpoint: they transformed the clunky and expensive interfaces of Schwab and Fidelity into a developer-centric UI/UX, and eliminated most fees (of course there is PFOF, but that only really matters if you are a HF trader). From a crypto standpoint, they just bought one of the first major crypto exchanges (which is massive news), which will give them expansion worldwide and a major new source of revenue, especially going into the 2024 bull market.  From a traditionally money management standpoint, they have their Roths and 401Ks with matches. They have their debit / credit card offerings and round-ups into whatever stock/crypto you want. They recently started offering those advanced charts to take on competitors like WeBull. Itâ€™s honestly insane. I get the hate for the meme stock fiasco a few years back, but in terms of regular investors and traders - they are in an extremely good position for growth. \n\nOne thing important to note is that other US crypto exchange charge 0.4% minimum per transaction, and RH is 0.3% when including spread. Given the IP ban on other low-fee crypto exchanges in the US, there is no reason why a person who automates their crypto trading and trades in high frequencies - like me - would use Coinbase or Kraken. Once RH released their crypto API enabling automation I immediately bought calls. I donâ€™t think the market or investors are pricing in just how much growth is possible for the company.",
