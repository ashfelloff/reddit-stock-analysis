  "selftext": "Apple Inc. has teams investigating a push into personal robotics, a field with the potential to become one of the company‚Äôs ever-shifting ‚Äúnext big things,‚Äù according to people familiar with the situation.\n\nEngineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.\n\nThough the effort is still in the beginning stages ‚Äî and it‚Äôs unclear if the products will ultimately be released ‚Äî Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-03/apple-explores-home-robots-after-abandoning-car-efforts?embedded-checkout=true",
