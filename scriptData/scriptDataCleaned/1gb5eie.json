  "selftext": "**There is no way the Archer Aviation share price will not see a significant rise between now and Christmas :**\n\n\\- **Adam Goldstein is up to something**: he was away in LAS VEGAS when the FAA announced the SFAR, replaced by his FAA specialist, Captain Billy Nolen. He will also be absent in RIYADH during the FII 8th Edition 2024, replaced by his CCO Nikhil Goel who will intervene on October 30. [https://fii-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FII8-MASTER-PAG\\_10.24.2024.pdf](https://fii-institute.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/FII8-MASTER-PAG_10.24.2024.pdf)  Adam Goldstein seems very focused on his November 7 earnings conference call. He usually reserves his announcements for this event, and prepares well.\n\n\\- **Stellantis is doing much better**: it was announced that its problems in the US market were resolved as expected before Christmas with an increase in RAM sales. If Stellantis experiences an uptrend, ACHR should benefit.\n\n\\- **Present at the OSAKA World Expo**: this has not yet been announced by ACHR but the Japanese press is talking about it. What is interesting is that it is NIKKO, which owns 10 million shares, which is behind the deal. A partnership between ACHR and Japan Airlines is planned to provide flight demonstrations during the exhibition. Why hasn’t ACHR talked about it yet? probably because the partnership that is brewing seems more important than just flying ACHR at the show. [https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/expo2025/20240926-OYO1T50059/](https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/expo2025/20240926-OYO1T50059/)[https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC2696R0W4A920C2000000/](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC2696R0W4A920C2000000/)\n\n\\- **Technical analysis clearly shows that the price will not go any lower**: the price seems to be deliberately maintained between $3 and $3.30. Daily observation shows that the price is manipulated so that the stock does not rise too quickly or too early. We can clearly see that the bull run will take place when the market makers decide. Some want to take their time to buy, others to hedge. Hence the formation of a “rounding bottom”. \n\n\\- **ACHR has enough money for 6 quarters or a year and a half:** by then, the aircraft will be certified and production will have started. ACHR will of course need money but will be able to borrow very easily because its planes will be on the market, greatly reducing the risks of dilution. This is a huge advantage at this stage when we see Llium plummeting because it cannot raise funds.\n\n\\- **MIDNIGHT's design is copied by other competitors behind ACHR:** why is it good? This shows that the aircraft design is not something too original that would fail because it is too original. On the contrary, other engineers from other companies chose the same design. (Hyundai, Airbus, Wisk Aero...)\n\n\\- **Airlines have invested in ACHR and have significant orders:** who better than the airlines to judge the commercial viability of the airspace? It's 2024, you can drive a car in urban and extra-urban areas, you can fly in extra-urban airspace, but you can't move in urban airspace. Only because the helicopters are too noisy. (United Airline, Southwest Ailine, Indigo, Kakao mobility)\n\n\\- **ACHR has partnerships on all continents but above all, thanks to Stellantis, they will be able to access the European market very easily:** Stellantis has very important historical brands like Peugeot and Citroën for France, Fiat for Italy... It is politically impossible to prevent Stellantis from accessing the European Union. We all know that the European Union is very tough in terms of regulations. ACHR will compete at the same level as Airbus.\n\n\\- **The growth in the number of vertiports is exponential:** some vertiports are already under construction and development, sometimes even in international airports. A study predicts 1,044 operational vertiports in 2028. [https://www.unmannedairspace.info/uncategorized/the-world-is-planning-1044-vertiports-for-construction-by-2024-our-latest-report/](https://www.unmannedairspace.info/uncategorized/the-world-is-planning-1044-vertiports-for-construction-by-2024-our-latest-report/)\n\n\\- **Psychological analysis:** some individual investors are still in the capitulation, disbelief, anger, depression phase. While we are in reality in the Stealth Phase (Smart Money) or the Awareness Phase (Institutional investor).\n\n\\- **Market capitalization:** this could be a long debate, but in reality, looking at the current capitalization of 1 billion, nothing prevents ACHR from very soon being at 2 or 3 or 4 billion very easily. This well before final certification.\n\n\\- **The analysts' price target is significantly high at $9.08:** the lowest target is 50% higher than the current price. Other targets are 300% of the current price.\n\n**-** **Georgia manufacturing plant is nearing completion:** this plant will be able to produce 650 aircraft per year and is designed to be able to increase its capacity. The announcement of completion will be a positive catalyst. In addition, it is certain that in a second phase, ACHR will open other factories around the world, probably with the help of Stellantis which is an international company. It's a long way off, but the announcement could be made soon.\n\n\\- **“Powered-lift aircraft are the first new category of aircraft in nearly 80 years, and this historic rule will pave the way for accommodating wide-scale Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) operations in the future,” FAA Administrator Mike Whitaker said in a statement :** even the FAA is ahead of schedule. In fact, it had until December to publish this certification. The FAA is bullish for the sector. Adam Goldstein, founder and CEO of Archer said, “We applaud the FAA on the release of the SFAR ahead of schedule as it represents a tremendous milestone for our country and the eVTOL industry. Now, Archer has a clear roadmap to pioneer eVTOL here in the U.S. Our team is full speed ahead in our ongoing partnership with the FAA as we work towards commercialization as soon as possible.”\n\n\\- **Adam Goldstein mentioned a partnership with PALANTIR last May without further details :** Investors are hoping for more clarity during the November 7 earnings conference call. [https://x.com/adamgoldstein13/status/1785717867696304332](https://x.com/adamgoldstein13/status/1785717867696304332)\n\n**ACHR is definitely in a phase where everything can only get better. The current price and upcoming catalysts make it a great entry point. Price movements suggest that the first good news will have a powerful impact on the price. Imagine then that the good news followed one another and that ACHR had everything planned.**\n\nI am not a financial expert. This does not constitute financial advice.",

Supernal has moved away from that configuration to 8 tilting rotors, basically a larger Joby, though with rotors that get into body chopping position on the ground, which I think is a terrible idea. Wish has added blades to their rear lift props, which Archer also has seemed to do, and Vertical has 4 blades on the rear props as well. So 4 blade rear lift props + tilting front props does seem to be a common configuration, but it's higher drag and weight than the originally planned configuration. All tilt like Joby keeps all the rotors in effective use the entire time and reduces loads on the airframe. That's probably the better configuration.\n\nArcher is still a high risk play with extremely low chance of certification in 2025 since they really haven't started collecting flight data on a conforming aircraft and only recently even settled on a functional design. \n\nWhat does your thesis look like with a 2027 certification date?",
