Let's just say the people at google pixel reddit aren't too happy with this (some pretty funny comments). Thoughts?\n* Apple introducing new AI smart features into their phone\n* Samsung probably joining that bandwagon.\n\nPersonally, I have no use for these features at all. What do you all think? Can you think of use cases for these features? Who will use them the most?\n\nMost importantly how soon make stonk price go up?",

Today LLMs aren’t AI, we just changed the meaning of the term Artificial Intelligence to General Artificial Intelligence and started calling Large Language Models AI. Truth is that LLM are story tellers, they replace a profession that’s already extinct - the person who used to read and write stories for kings and queens. LLM in technical terms are nothing more than an approximation function that tries to predict the next word. That’s hardly an intelligence. We have tools like [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) that aren’t LLMs and can do 90% of the things people describe here in the comments. LLMs are not suited for automation tasks as they are very unpredictable. Imagine a Toyota production robot that manufactures a car 90% of the time and writes poetry on the side while occasionally killing someone. That robot would be scrapped faster than you can sell your shares. And for legal? With all the liabilities involved do you really trust an LLM with that? Would you hire a paralegal on shrooms because that’s what you have with a LLM lawyer. Not to say how cheap actual intelligence is. You can hire heaps of people in a cheaper country for fraction of the price of an LLM. That’s why the Amazon smart stores were actually a person in India marking your stuff remotely. We also know how to manufacture new humans for very little money, yes I know many people here are unaware of this process but it is quite easy actually. Until human labour becomes actually expensive AI won’t be able to compete - even if it actually existed. \n\nAI has amazing future, decades down the road.

Their predictions are that AI as we see it today will remain just a toy and the field will move to specialised agents. This is a type of AI that has specific, narrow focus task but is capable of handling it better than a human and most importantly is capable of handling unexpected situations related to those tasks. Take as an example the robots that are putting together most of the cars today. Currently those are very fragile and any deviation from their expected parameters has to be handled by a human. We can try to fix that with an agent or even a set of agents - one is focused on manufacturing and the other is supervising the process. This can be very useful in other fields like surveillance where an agent can monitor camera feeds and react based on hostile activity. Even in trading, we can have an automated trading system that doesn’t just sell when AVGO does a 10 to 1 split and their price suddenly falls from 1700 per share to 140 🤣\n\nSee I am not saying don’t invest in AI companies, quite the opposite.

You can make educated guesses and your opinions don't have to be very specific (e.g. you can say ”If we don't take care of the climate change, we may see some effects of our bad decision making in 5-10 years” instead of ”Climate change will make Earth so hot by 2028 that no life will be sustainable”)\n\n> Their predictions are that AI as we see it today will remain just a toy and the field will move to specialised agents. This is a type of AI that has specific, narrow focus task but is capable of handling it better than a human and most importantly is capable of handling unexpected situations related to those tasks.\n\nYeah that's reasonable. However your original comment is somewhat misleading now.\n\nBy saying ”today LLMs aren't even AI, they make up stuff, wait for the real AI in 10 years, as the experts predict” you make it sound like experts in the field are working on way better, sophisticated general AI, such that ChatGPT as we know it would be like a 5 year old child compared to it. (Those changes could imply actual logical reasoning, proper fact checking, heck maybe even some kind of consciousness, whatever it would be?)\n\nAlthough in reality you're speaking of narrowing down the use cases of specific AI models. So LLMs will likely be as usable as they are now, while some industries will benefit from additional help. It's definitely not a futuristic ”universal robot slave for everyone\" scenario.",

It's literally as simple as getting off all the social media bullshit and just having normal interactions with real people.

Nvidia gamer cards had no AI - everyone bought it, when it will have AI everyone will still buy it. Photoshop had no AI - everyone bough it, now it has AI and everyone still buys it. IMO AI won't affect B2C company prices much, so its really B2B where its at. But even at B2B size there is, for example $QBTS quantum computers that advertise business optimizations, and the stock is still in tatters, so its a question to be answered if AI will be any different.\n\nThe one area where I can see growth is AI companies selling AI tech as their business model, like $NVDA for example.",

                  "body": "> Bro. Your imagination is godawful.\n\n> “Siri whenever my boss emails summarize it and read it to me”\n\nYou have to assume it knows your boss's email address and your boss always uses the same address. Then you have to ensure its summarization is actually correct (say hi to hallucinations) and doesn't skip an important point.\n\nAlso, what if it ”reads it to you” when e.g. you're taking a nap/you're somewhere without the phone/your phone is muted? Well, you'll have to read the email yourself I guess. Basically you still have to check your inbox to make sure it didn't miss anything.\n\n> “Siri next time I’m running errands remind me to pick up ____”\n\nHow does it know you're running errands? Are you describing to it every action you're taking? If they're scheduled then just have a list of errands. I mean it's somewhat reasonable, but it's an once at week/month use case at most\n\n> “Siri whenever I pull into work pls remind me to grab my coffee cup”\n\nHow does it know when you pull into work? If it regards your fixed schedule, then this and the previous point are basically reminders?\n\n> “Siri open tinder and swipe right indefinitely” \n\nLol. Assuming it's even legal, I'm not sure if the AI is smart enough to know what you mean.\n\nThis is basically what RabbitOS is about, and there are concerns such as developers not getting revenue from ads being ”watched” by bots.\n\nBesides, I'm sure you, a male, swiping right on every woman, will be the tinder's algorithm's favorite and it'll match you with the best girls.\n\n> “Siri plan an entire vacation for under x”\n\nDo people really do that? Do you not read about specific places and choose where *you yourself* would like to go (God forbid reading a book), based on *your own* feelings, mood, expected experiences etc.?\n\nYou might as well open a random website and follow their every step for ”the best holidays experience”.\n\nUnless you have no personality and originality at all, it'll be boring as fuck. BUT you'll have saved a few hours of ”time wasting research”!\n\n> “Siri passively watch x development and update me asap”\n\nI suppose you're talking about following news for you? I guess it's reasonable if it offers such feature.\n\nStill, it's likely you'll miss out on some other important news if you don't read them by yourself. E.g. you tell it to follow the latest iPhone news and it doesn't alert you of apple AI chips failing. It boils down to proper prompt engineering — you never know what it's getting out of your request. If you want all Apple stock news then why not... follow a news channel/subscribe to a newsletter?\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, it all boils down to being a reminder + news watch I guess. Also you never really know if it'll work properly (network connection issues/bugs that e.g. wouldn't be present in highly tested reminder app, created specifically for that purpose).",
