In my opinion, 5 guys tastes much better and is more filling; like a 6/10 vs a 8/10, and 2 burgers from 5G fills me up vs 3 from Mcds\n\n2 double q w/chz from Mcdicks is like 15-16$ and the quality is all over the place and I'm usually hungry again in a few hours\n\n2 bacon cheese burgers from 5 guys is like $23 but tastes awesome and I'm full for the rest of the day",

They aren’t going to give you burgers for free. These places already have worked on penny profits on the items they sell because they sell so much quantity. I give it a a little bit before these companies alright leave California because no one can afford their food especially at the quality fast food is. Then where will all those fast food workers work? \n\nGovernment intervention is almost always bad for a country. A false bottom in a capitalist economy only inflates everything, causes job loss and business closures. Had the government not been able to intervene (as much) with our economy, we would have cheaper housing, food and labor. You have to realize that it’s not about how much you make but what it costs to live. The homeless will never be able to get back into the economy because businesses don’t want to take the risk of paying all the costs to higher someone for them to not be able to make it to work. Without the inflated cost the government adds to hire people and the huge risk companies take to hire people, companies would be much more willing to take that risk. All minimum wage does is inflate the economy and makes it worse for everyone, even those making that minimum wage because everything they buy is going up. These jobs should be left for teens going through college or unskilled workers trying to learn a skill. They are not permanent jobs. You work shitty jobs until you can prove to the world you’re worth a damn. The world doesn’t owe you anything. The problem the U.S. has is a great gap in education for the lower class vs the upper class. Without a proper education, your people are regarded and you get what we have. A lot of unskilled workers. \n\nThis system was designed by the elite to keep us slaves to them. The education system was designed by the Rockefellers for this sole purpose. We are really an illiterate country owned by an oligarchy serving the elites. This is why we go back and forth between two parties and it only gets worse. We are too dumb to vote and know what they are really doing. A government should never be trusted, no matter what party is up there. Ideally, we would be a country with no parties.",
