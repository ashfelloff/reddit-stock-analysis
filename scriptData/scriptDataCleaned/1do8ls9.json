A company I contracted with in the past replaced it's entire call center with a web-based AI. Reviews trended up after that and costs went down for the company. I know it's just subjective but I think we're still one crisis away from legislation clipping AI and I think we've still some legs until the dumb boomers realize the limits of AI and flee from it.\n\n\nRight now NVDA I expect to remain a good, safe bet. You're a fucking regard if you think it's hitting 1200 again after this split, but I think 165 in a year is more than possible and even 225 if China stays barking and we see growth continue to the 80% they're projecting in 2025.\n\n\nAs soon as China starts a force build up though, I'm hopping out and putting my money in blue chips. US isn't going to be able to stop a Chinese blockade.",
