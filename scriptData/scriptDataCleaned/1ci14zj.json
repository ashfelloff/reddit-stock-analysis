Makes me want to go puts on Nvidia but I’m sure now bad earnings is priced in, Nvidia will beat by 0.1% and the stock will go over $1000\n\nOver the weekend I came up with a plan to go puts on SMCI, CHGG , Fastly  and door Dash. \n\nI literally don’t know wtf happened with those ideas because the only 2 puts I bought was Pinterest and now Carvana.\n\nI really fucked up.",
