                      "body": "How would shorting a company cause its bankruptcy? The fundamentals of a company affect its stock price, but it doesn't the other way round. A low stock price doesn't affect the fundamentals of a company.\n\nYou can short the hell out of a healthy company and it doesn't do shit to the company if the actual profits are there.\n\nThe only situation where shorts can \"cause\" a bankruptcy is when the company is essentially already brankrupt, doesn't have profits and can't even find lenders. Only then, when they are desperate to issue new shares at a high price can shorts actually affect a company.\n\n  \nAlso I thought market makers were already doing the frontrunning with Hood? Why would they need a new exchange?\n\nIn theory it's possible to frontrun, but without specific knowledge of the US system there are two cases: 1. They would frontrun to the detriment of the trades. Then it would be obvious and would be regulated or nobody would use that exchange ... an exchange can't live off regarded RH users with 500 bucks.\n\n2. It's cheaper despite the shenanigans. Then it would still be beneficial to break down the monopoly of NYSE. (Hypothetical, I'm not saying that frontrunnig even happens.\n\n  \nAnyway, all this wouldn't affect \"the market\", which is international and far bigger than one market maker could change consistently. This theoretical practice could make cents or fractions on a trade, not cause major movements. Worth it for one company, but a blib overall.\n\n  \nAlso, get some regulation over there. Something like Robin Hood isn't even legal here and trade information can't be used. You also need an actual regulated bank license to handle the accounts. Small exchanges pay for the retail liquidity, making trades basically free.",
