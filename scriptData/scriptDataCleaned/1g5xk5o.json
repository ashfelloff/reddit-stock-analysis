  "selftext": "Yesterday I bought into NNE right before climbing the nearly 40% spike. OKLO as well. I bought more today during the dip. I'm convinced that small scale nuclear reactors and HALEU fuel will become the industry standard for all major tech giants in the near future. Amazon and Google have already announced funding for these projects and the US DOE has also been trying to encourage domestic production of HALEU, rather than from China and Russia. What do you guys think? Is it gonna print or will my kids live in a cardboard box?\n\nEdit: NNE is currently exposed to a potential class action lawsuit for misleading consumers and influencing stock prices through their statements. Not a dealbreaker IMO but something to keep in mind.\n\nEdit: OKLO is a nuclear power start up started by Sam Altman, intended to be the power supplier for both Data centers and AI. Due to Altman's influence in the AI sector it is a very big edge for OKLO to have in a market that is semi-emerging, such as microreactors.",

Centrus Energy(LEU) and Nano Nuclear(NNE) are two of the companies trying to pioneer High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium(HALEU) production in the US, where it has traditionally been produced in Russia and China. Additionally NNE is developing new reactors that are in my opinion very promising and may revolutionise the sector entirely. That said NNE is potentially the target of a class action lawsuit for improperly impacting the market with unofficial statements, however I believe its upside far outweighs any damage from the lawsuit. I think that of these options NNE and OKLO are the better buys, however there are a few more players in the market I haven't mentioned here.",
