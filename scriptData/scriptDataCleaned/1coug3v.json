  "selftext": "Corporate insiders know more about the company than anyone in the professional and retail community can ever know. There is conflicting research about the value of tracking and mimicking the trades of insiders, as is usual with all academic research.\n\nHowever, thus far no public paper has synthesized market conditions and corporate insider trading which are quantifiable into a multi-factor quantitative model. In addition, and this it not unexpected, no paper has attempted to formulate opportunistic trades when such model offers a signal to buy or sell a stock.\n\nThe idea is to use several combined market conditions and insider trading information and create a weekly scan or stocks which are poised for mean reversion over the 30-45 days or so, and to trade the signals with options, but in a way that if the move does not happen in the time frame, the loss should be minimal.\n\nSo the question is what are these market conditions and how do we formulate the trades?\n\nI start with [Lakonishok](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2696757) who finds that insiders trade in a contrarian way, and buy stock, rather than sell, on asymmetric information, and the firms they trade and work in are small. This makes sense to me and these factors are easily quantifiable. Next, I agree with [Kacperczyk and Pagnotta](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2695197) that informed trading happens in periods of high volume, high volatility and high liquidity, so that informed traders can disguise their trading more easily. One key metric in their paper is OTM option volume versus total volume, tracked as ratio, but since this requires a lot of modeling, I will manually examine the OTM volume and open interest as a final qualification of the trade. Finally, I will not blindly chase the trade with OTM call options, but I will create spreads which will benefit from price increases, but will limit the downside risk, e.g. call ratio spreads. Each trade will be different, and it will match not only the implied move in the underlying, but also it will depend on the option prices for the stock and the liquidity as very few small firms have liquid options.\n\nA simple search for companies which have experienced a large decline in their stock and an immediate insider buying results in a few stocks:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0udk3go3rmzc1.png?width=712&format=png&auto=webp&s=d97aaea66c39d87cdcbb30fff42d48c81e7cb0ce\n\nSo far, I have traded VSTS because it has declined on an earnings miss, but immediately, two directors and a hedge fund that owns more than 10% invested in the company stock. \n\n**EDIT:** another insider [bought over 100K worth of stock above $11.5 yesterday](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1171341/000121390024041801/xslF345X01/marketforms-65826.xml). He is an EVP and chief attorney for the company. This is reinforcing news.\n\nAlso, there was new open interest in the 12.5 call, which may or may not be a confirmation of the thesis, because it might be a covered call trade, or any other sort of spread trade. Regardless, my trade in this stock is a 1x6 call ratio spread, albeit a short term one, and I will probably need to reload for the next expiration. Here is the spread for illustration only, but these are my actual entry prices:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o45fldg8rmzc1.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&s=807f3f342448267e0c82941eea80bbddb1a0eb0b\n\nIf the stock remains between 10.7 and 12.5 next week, I will lose money. If the stock goes above 12.5 then the thesis will be right an the ratio spread will work. If the stock tanks back to below 10.7 then I will make money on the spread because of the single short call at 10.\n\nI will look into trading longer duration spreads on the other stocks. These are speculative trades so keep the exposure small, and always finance the trade with other options so if the trade reverses, the loss is minimized.\n\nHope you enjoyed the trade idea, and the rationale behind it.\n\nCheers!",

I am just honestly trying to understand the strategy itself, and what the benefit would be over a simpler Condor.\n\nIt seems like you are just combining an ITM credit spread which would be a Bearish play (usually bearish/neutral but your short call is 10% down from current price taking alot of neutrality out) and using the credit to buy OTM calls which would be a massively bullish play.  Anything less than a 10% movement in either direction and you lose money... Even with that big of a movement you still face assignment risk to the topside and needing to manage the position.\n\nJust looking at the profit calculator your breakeven on Monday is already 12.60 to the topside and just grows toward 13 through the week.\n\nAnd since you are dealing with the ITM short call which can and will most likely be assigned if we were to open up that high on Monday, it doesn't leave alot of breathing room to manage the position being that you will be forced to cover the assignment with the remaining calls before they are able to run further...\n\nOn top of that early assignment risk could still fuck you and make you manage the position anywhere from the 10-12.50 range throughout the week.\n\nAgain, I'm not trying to argue, just have never seen this strategy before and would like to know if there is something I am missing here?",

Yes, I am that old.\n\nWhat you are missing is that this can be deconstructed as a single short 10/12.5 spread, which makes money from a downturn, and 5 single 12.5 calls. All done for a net credit. Think of it that way, if it helps you.\n\nJust because you have not seen the spread being traded, it does not mean that the P/L is not valid. Hint: most funds trading long 0DTE on SPY hoping for a big move trade a variation of this spread that if it moves against you, you don't lose the entire premium you paid.\n\nI am writing this as a sort of a diary so that my one year old can read it and learn from it when he grows up, both the good and the bad.\n\nFollow if you wish to learn some more, or if you want to get updates.
