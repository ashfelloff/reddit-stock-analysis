We're the only successful bipeds and that's entirely by intelligence. There are quadrupeds above and below our weight class that are faster and stronger than us, and birds have flight.\n\nWe are self healing and still slip/fall accidents are a huge risk and that's among the lowest risk activity we can undertake. When that face dome takes a 6 ft tumble on the ground, how much are you going to pay to fix it? Why risk it when wheels, tracks or quadruped movement exist and are much more stable, And those will also scale well for most weight/size. \n\nIn conclusion.

I believe most of its profits come from its subsidiary, Starlink. But that's a whole other issue. There's little transparency and with everything lumped under Tesla (which I personally find an insult to the man's name) he can use profits from elsewhere to bolster failures.\n\nHe's not a complete screw-up. But he's past the realm of creating things himself. He is neither an innovator nor inventor. He simply has ideas. And it's all still very much about dollars. But people have had enough and his empty promises aren't enough to manipulate his stock prices anymore.\n\nHe once promised in all seriousness that he was going to start a candy company. The one thing he could assuredly not screw up, but he just didn't do it. Unsure if that promise was before or after a ketamine dose 🤷\n\nI think the worst part of it all now, is that even if he does succeed, the real innovators and inventors won't be credited.",

I am surrounded by conservatives.\n\nWhat you're witnessing isn't an actual problem with Tesla, even though there are many.\n\nNo, this is Elon's decision coming to haunt him because you're seeing a liberal person despise an EV because Elon has changed to red.\n\nIt's expected.\n\nAnd again, I'm southern, so I have some perspective others don't. That perspective is that southern conservatives can't fucking stand Tesla vehicles.\n\nIt won't go in the mud. It doesn't even look like it's tough. It screams feminism. \n\nI'm not saying those things are true, I'm saying that's how the average conservative man views Tesla products.\n\nRivian, on the other hand, is a car I see on the road often.\n\nThe one cybertruck on town gets mocked constantly on Facebook. There's even a county group for memes of it. Not a single one for the Rivians.\n\nSo if you're a guy like me.. somewhat southern but a software engineer and a nerd, are you gonna buy a Tesla? You wouldn't catch me dead in one now that Elon has shown his cards. He has no loyalty to his customers or the group who lifted his green initiative, and he's now made a terrible business decision by aligning himself with a group of people who denounce EVs and green energy, as well as his original customer base.\n\nImagine being a pretty staunch liberal nerdy dude and owning a Tesla only to see Elon do what he's done. That person is trading for a Rivian this year, more than likely. And again, I'm in Podunk and I'm aware of a 4:1 Rivian to Tesla ratio right now.\n\nElon has quite literally made the worst business decision in recent history by moving to Texas and dancing at Trump rallies.\n\nThe only way out is to get conservatives to buy EVs. Time will tell if that works or not, but I doubt it, knowing my peers.",

The thing is, there is some USA hubris over the entire EV market right now, but the US is not even the center of the world in automobiles in general. The only US car makers competing in the global market are Ford and Tesla; everything else is being saved by US import tariffs. \n\nElon tried to get more US backing from the democratic government during his growth but received pushback. Personally, I blame GMC and car dealer lobbyists more than liberals vs. conservatives values. I believe this led to most of the anti EV propaganda. Also, the \"Green Initiative\" is what Biden tried to push to save face for poor renewable energy effort, in which he snubbed Tesla in favor of GMC and their stupid \"Hummer Ev\" plus trying to push Electrify America as the charging standard when Tesla chargers were far superior. The only support Tesla had was Trump, which is sad to say because Trump didn't really help, but he also wasn't going against Elon. \n\nOverall, the US needs Tesla more than Tesla needs the US, and they both need to work together before China completely dominates the EV market as they are close.",

What other US company is as vertically integrated as Tesla?
