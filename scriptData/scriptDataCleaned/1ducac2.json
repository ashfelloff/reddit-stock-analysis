  "selftext": "Red Sea shipping is still an issue and only getting worse/more expensive . Now shipping will be done by air.\n\n*China to North America air freight spot rates increased 43%, to $4.88 per kilogram, year-on-year in May. Global air cargo spot rates were up 9% year-on-year in May, to $2.58 per kg.*\n\n*Increased demand is a factor in the air freight market. In a recent note to clients, Xeneta wrote that the global air cargo market is \"on a pathway to double-digit growth in volumes in 2024, after a +12% year-on-year jump in demand in May.*\n\nInflationary pressure continues. Insurance rates will continue to climb. As shipping costs continue to go up...\n\nPrices will be keep getting passed to cash strapped consumers or companies will lose money as money as their pricing powers are gone, and have to eat the extra costs.\n\nEither way, until this gets resolved I don't see how Powell can cut rates. He screwed himself over. ",
