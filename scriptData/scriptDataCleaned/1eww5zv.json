Significantly undervalued according to analysts, not to big of a bite, newly developed assets and they announced a shareholder value program with buybacks and significant dividend increase. For me that smells like they try to look less tasty for a takeover. They diversified, but their assets are till in a risky region though, so there are downsides.",
