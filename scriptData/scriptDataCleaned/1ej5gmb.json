We ditched fund analysis years ago at this point. We're just printing (but with Al.) People can say \"CPI this GDP that\" but at the end of the day next week everyone's gonna wake up, take a sip of coffee, get on their laptops and start pumping again like nothing happened. We're just exit liquidity at this point.\n\nThe market makers decided the path it seems like you can either get on board or get rolled over trying to fight the hand.\n\nNever fight the hand",

Maybe the regional banks again, maybe consumer credit delinquencies, maybe something else.\n\nNot sure the \"real\" downturn (as opposed to whatever the last two weeks have been) lasts that long since the Fed has so much ammo, and maybe some of the IRA/CHIPS investments pay off in the jobs data. And small cap investment has been so suppressed from the inflation-fighting.\n\nBut it does feel like real softening is kicking in, and a couple 25bp cuts won't make much of a dent. Given Goolsbee's commemts I don't expect much more than that. Maybe one 50bp cut if we're lucky. But it really feels like the Fed rate needs to get back into the 3% range to extend the growth.\n\nWho knows though. Maybe we get that, and the consumers actually overleverage out their asses.

Biden pumped a lot of (much-needed) manufacturing $$ into the economy. Which usually leads to a glut of orders from businesses, since you need stuff to build out manufacturing capacity. But that's basically kicked into gear and is priced in. So a lot depends on when those investments become operational and start hiring. In the meantime, the small and midsized companies need support to bridge the gap. Keeping rates too restrictive makes that bridge hard to \"build.\"",

Though I was honestly thinking in a longer time frame than the last six months, which I think is obvious from my comments.)\n\nI was talking about inventory levels and CHIPS/IRA spend winding down - which matches the sub-indicators to the ISM PMI survey (the actual report [is here](https://acrobat.adobe.com/id/urn:aaid:sc:VA6C2:ba4fa02e-f7cd-4e0f-b939-cc05c4f76536), as opposed to just the headline - and the details often matter more, imo). Inventories and order backlogs are quite low, as is employment, but delivery lags are rising, indicating orders outpacing production. Exports are stable, despite how strong the dollar has been, which bodes well for additional exports as the dollar comes off a bit vs. Euro, Yen, etc. \n\nOn top of that, you have to go back a bit and look at the baselines from COVID and the WFH pressure - wage inflation is \"sticky\" - it's harder to push back down than commodity inflation - even moreso now with China's economy being so weak and unattractive for offshoring. Consumer spending has been quite resilient largely because of that, while inflation in other sectors (excluding housing, which is an interest rates & zoning laws story) have come back down. \n\nAll of that still points to a garden-variety correction, sector rebalancing, and soft landing. But, as I said, the softness does depend on how aggressively the Fed cuts.",

Not only is wage growth stagnent, but there are less jobs, and the excess cash generated by these companies is sitting in treasuries and cash on balance sheet.\n\nThere used to be a more tightly coupled relationship between GDP growth and wage growth, that relationship has been broken due to the fact that companies over the past decade have significantly increased efficiency and productivity.",

Well, as we've seen from the last round, printing is effective for asset price inflation, not so much for jobs on main street. \n\nMy betting is if it gets real bad before the election, no printing.
