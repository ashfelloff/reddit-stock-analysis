      "body": "Now calculate the share price adjusted for inflation. GUH\n\nNo but in all seriousness, Amazon is a company with massive revenue but small margins outside of AWS, the arm that arguably faces the most - and stiffening - competition. It also began as a logistics company and got where it is today through lots of reasonably aggressive and maybe even shady business practices. This no doubt cost it some bottom line in the long term.\n\nIt's a jack of all trades that excels at volume but isn't surgical in any aspect of its revenue stream. Good at a lot but not the best at anything.\n\nRealistically though, it's stuck because every time it begins to grow, it spends a lot to do so. It's also pretty far behind in \"the AI race\" right now, at least in investor's eyes it would seem.\n\nIn short, they've grown slowly and steadily and in a market that seems to expect 500% annual ROI, it isn't getting the attention it might deserve.",

          "body": "One of my favorite early stories of amazon being shady was that before they had warehouses to store books, they basically were just an intermediary between publishers and customers. But publishers would set minimum orders of 10, because they could lose money shipping out a single book. But amazon had nowhere to store excess, so every time someone ordered a book, they would round out the order to 10 books by adding copies of an old science book that was out of print but still listed. That meant that the publisher could not fulfil the full order and would send them just the books on the customer order, because it was viewed as a problem on their end. \n\n\nSo even from the start they were scamming other businesses.",

You neither create nor destroy your total value of your position and a +10% will still be the same gain in total numbers no matter if you have 1 stock for full price or 20 stocks for 1/20th of full price.",
