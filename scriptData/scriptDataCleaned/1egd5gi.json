  "selftext": "Why Carvana is dropping 15+% tomorrow\n\nLast quarter, Carvana reported insane numbers, including a GPU of $6,432, which was a 50% increase year over year. We have since learned that Carvana bought a large number of Teslas from Hertz when they went bankrupt at steep discounts. This egregiously elevated their numbers to a severely unsustainable level. \n\n  \n**BEAR THESIS:** \n\n* The co-founder and CEO sold 1,590,000 shares in July alone. This does not include the millions of shares he sold in 2024. \n* Carvana has $3,000,000,000 (yes, 3 billion) in debt that it pays 10.25% to service every year. \n\n  \nI can't say I didn't tell you so. \n\n  \n1 last quality bit of information: the CEO and co-founder is a con man and a criminal. He pleaded guilty to felony bank fraud in 1990. I 100% guarantee he is cooking this company's books. \n\n  \nPosition: 1/17/2025 $80 puts\n\n",
