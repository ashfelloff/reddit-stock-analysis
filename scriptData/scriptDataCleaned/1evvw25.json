      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

RKLB threads tend to be filled with monkes performing their part in a typical pump and dump while the ASTS threads come with explanation.\n\nI can't see a world where RKLB can compete with SpaceX as long as the latter is able to keep up launch rates, except as an alternative choice propped up by government. Space is hard, and the market for small sat launches that RKLB has been doing is miniscule. The Neutron rocket is also unproven and as I said, space is hard. They've been operating a lot more like traditional space than the rapid iteration that SpaceX pioneered, just with more efficiency. It's a much bigger risk than ASTS is/was and the payoff is much less obvious. I'm willing to wait for Neutron to prove itself before jumping in, as there would still be a lot more room for growth from there.",

My previous statement proves their track record and how they can compete with Spacex (which was one of your arguments). Argument that Starship will ride share Neutron out of the market is a bullshit argument. That’s not how space works and you need to look into how orbits work. They have 71% YoY growth with space systems and launch, a 100m quarter (ASTS had 0.9m quarter with an unproven track record really, but I do see the upside with them, but same way with RKLB because they are capable of doing the same things and much much more) they manufacture their own reaction wheels, own solar cells, own battery pump motors, own carbon fiber machines, a whole production line and assets. They dabble with both government and commercial contracts. Which one do you think is cheaper for commercial companies? A company that manufactures and launches their satellites or a company that relies on falcon 9 to launch? (no schedule slips no miscommunication, no added fees for launch). They will be ebitda positive once their Neutron goes into market which is mid 2026. They are an already profitable company that re-invests it’s money back. I could go on and on and on",

Either way I'm sure there will be a market if Neutron succeeds, it's more a matter of how much it will succeed then. However I am skeptical at whether they will be able to pull it off on the first try next year, and this has a big impact on the stock price.\n\nI agree with you that Starship and ridesharing is bullshit against Neutron, and new markets for bespoke launches in the F9-tier will open if launch prices come down as a result of increased competition, just like it did when F9 hit the market. However, many of the small sats RKLB currently launches would also be happy launching to a shared orbit on Starship at lower cost similar to Transporter missions on F9.\n\nAnyway, thank you for your input and I have learnt more about the company. I believe RKLB has massive potential, but for me it's still too early to get in especially now with all the hype.",
