Assuming a share price of $31, that's a price/ffo of 12.5, or a FFO yield of 8%.\n\nThis does make it substantially cheaper than much of the overall market, but REITs are cheap in general.",

Since REITs predominantly use debt to grow, the usual scenario is they refinance / get more debt for new property acquisitions. So still, higher rates = bad for REITs, lower = good for REITs",

You need to look at the annual reports of the individual REITs to see how much of an effect this would have.  VICI happens to already have most of their debt locked in for a long time at low rates, so it wouldn't be a big deal for them.\n\n2. REITs are often used as 'bond replacements' for investors looking for a stream of income.  This means that the future stream of expected dividends from the REITs will be considered more valuable as rates decrease, so investors will tend to bid the REIT prices up as they are willing to accept a lower current dividend rate.\n\n3. Lower interest rates tend to increase real estate values in general, as buyers can borrow money more cheaply to buy properties.  This could allow REITs to opportunistically sell properties at a profit, possibly buying back stock and boosting their distribution rates.",

So a single macro event send them straight down the toilet especially once they pile debt... which they mostly have been doing recently.\n\nRecall most of them went bankrupt in the financial crisis including Caesars & MGM which is how VICI came about to begin with. Many more went bankrupt through time. Trump himself bankrupt like 4 casinos on his own and the Tropicana has been bankrupted more times than I can count. More recently, COVID forced many of them to dilute and increase debt. Risk is building up (again).\n\nYou think they are doing well today? Well they make less than half what they did 20 years ago despite much higher rev. MGM alone used to net like $3b-$4b easily back in the early 2000s. In 2005 they net $6.5b. Now they celebrate when they break $1b.\n\nIf memory serves me, I think the only major brand that didnt go bankrupt was the Sands and check their chart... no gains in 20 years. Wynn might have been another but again look at their charts... practically no gains in 20 years and the Wynn hotels are supposed to be some of the nicest places to go in any city they exist.\n\nCasinos are just not good businesses. Not since their early days and even then, public shareholders were not the beneficiaries. Im sure insiders pay themselves very well so they are happy but shareholders just get to hold bags. What happened? Industry dilution and terrible management. Too many casinos. Too many clubs. Too many fancy restaurants. The need to be extravagant or not attract customers. And now you have compete with online as well.\n\nNow in terms of VICI specifically, they lease to casinos so at least you get some cash in your pocket every quarter but do you trust the divs to keep going for 20 years so you can break even? Right now things look calm... just like they did for MGM, Caesars and everyone else back in 2005. We all know what happened by 2008. Very high risk... but is the reward high? Not really. You are better off gambling on tech honestly which many have already figure out. Also online hurts VICI the most. Even if MGM get online themselves, it doesnt help VICI with their brick and mortar assets.\n\nRule of thumb is avoid REITs that hold risky assets unless yield is far above what you can get with no risk (treasuries). Only then should you start considering them. I can tell you that for the last 6 months or so, I have been piling on agency mREITs because I expect rates to stay flat or even decline.",

The time that no one could go outside and a bunch of REITs were losing rent collection because of it?\n\nAnd VICI is the landlord, not the owner of the casino business that is on their land. If the casino company goes bankrupt there will be another rich guy to substitute them, since casinos will always be big in Vegas.\n\nI don't invest in REITs, but if I would it would definitely be VICI.",

A sinking casino with no prospect toward profit, will simply stop paying rent and given how specialized and big these businesses are, bankruptcy will take years and odds are no one will step in to buy them prior. VICI was birthed from the carcass of a dead business. But you think they are immune to the same thing? They are not. They are trying to diversify but in general, they are still heavily specialized.\n\nLook at all the REITs struggling today and you will see a similar story to VICI.
