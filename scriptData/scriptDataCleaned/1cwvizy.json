No, the Saud family isn’t the better of multiple options and no the country wouldn’t demodernize from its astounding 18th century state it’s managed to get to socially. \n\nMost likely Saleh bin Abdul-Aziz Al ash-Sheikh or someone from a member of the Al ash-Sheikh family. It’s kind of weird that they were claiming it would be somewhere between Iran and ISIS when the grand mufti is on an ISIS kill list and the family is actually to the left of the Saud family when it comes to terrorism and violent extremism.\n\nEverything else in terms of geopolitical consensus in the region and relations with the US would pretty much fall where they are. It’s really just swapping out one retrograde family for another while actually undermining sunni extremism in the region.\n\nand I’ll add that this is explicitly not the fundamentalist faction in Saudi Arabia. Compared to the other religious scholars and tribal leaders in the country they actually pull the religious bullshittery in the country to the left while still placating the zealots. It’s just that this family’s only function currently is Islamic affairs. They are the ones rubber stamping the Saud family’s modernizations while keeping home grown fundamentalists from spazzing out.",

It’s really just swapping out one retrograde family for another while actually undermining sunni extremism in the region.\n\nEdit: and I’ll add that this is explicitly not the fundamentalist faction in Saudi Arabia. Compared to the other religious scholars and tribal leaders in the country they actually pull the religious bullshittery in the country to the left while still placating the zealots. It’s just that this family’s only function currently is Islamic affairs. They are the ones rubber stamping the Saud family’s modernizations while keeping home grown fundamentalists from spazzing out.",
