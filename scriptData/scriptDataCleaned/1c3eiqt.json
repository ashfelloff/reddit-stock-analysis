Based on the inputs so far, this is more of a response to Israel's bombing of the Iranian consulate in Syria. However, its measured in hope that it does not escalate. The pressure on Iran had been to give some kind of response. No country can just sit while its embassy or consulate gets bombed by a foe, if not the leaders the people will demand a response.\n\nWith the measured response (and hoping there have been no casualties) Israel might let it slide and they should if it does not warrant a response. The focus should be getting the hostages and eradication of terrorists.\n\nPS: Totally agree with the guy who commented \" Seriously, if it's actually important, it will make it to WSB. \". ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)",
