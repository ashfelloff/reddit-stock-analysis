  "selftext": "After 3 years of trading, 3 months ago I was at my lowest point, down 10k. I then had a good run where I got all the way back to +2k in the green. A 12k run in 3 months trading mainly weekly puts/calls on spy and tech. I also got in on the game squeeze with shares and sold before it tanked.\n\nThe past two days though I went full tilt and kept doubling down on spy puts and was trading completely emotionally, basically what gamblers have always called 'chasing'.\n\nI'm now down -4k. I lost 6k in 2 days. I'm still up significantly from my lowest point but it still feels like a huge blow. I know I should take a break from the market for a bit but it's hard to make yourself walk away. You want to get back what you've lost as quick as possible, which obviously can lead to wrecking your port.\n\nWhat's your irrational trading or revenge trading story ?\n",

No amount of sold call options fixed that. \n\nDid it again simultaneous selling weekly puts in NIO, $45 strike, got assigned, sold the $45 calls expiring that next week. \n\nStill hold that NIO at $45 cost basis.

As part of his training, we agreed to sit down over zoom and hear their pitch on what was best for us. The flashy guy training my brother in law, this was in my wife’s families hometown so she knew him from growing up, was of course trying to sell us on whole term and mutual funds.  His recommendation was that we spend roughly 4k a month on insurance products (whole-life, term, and disability plus life for our children). We told him we were not interested in all that, but to throw brother in law a bone would sign my wife(breadwinner MD) up for 2M 10yr term and we agreed to put our back door Roth IRA money for that year into one of their mutual funds GWPAX…. Mostly to see how I do against them vs my self managed brokerage and Roth’s. The guy kept going on about how we were making a mistake and asked that we take some more time to think about it. Fast forward a week and brother in law’s trainer reaches out to my wife via zoom to try his pitch again. Unbeknownst to him I’m listening from the room over, and she tells him that I make the financial decisions in our household and had made up my mind. He goes off on a speech trying to seed doubt into my wife’s mind, questioning my education etc. This caused my blood to boil so I went into the room and told the guy to fuck off and not call again. The next morning I decided to start another brokerage account with $1000 to day trade with the goal to end the year ahead of the 12k we put into mutual funds with NWM. Needless to say I crushed it and ran that 1k all the way up to 48k within a year. Screenshots were sent to the jackass asking him if he still had doubts as to whether I knew what I was doing or not. Fuck that felt good! Sometime later I put that 48k into SPY puts and took a big loss selling them for like 28k because I was scared I was going to lose it all. The next day SPY fell 6% and the options would’ve been worth 250k. I ended up cashing out 20k for a bathroom remodel and vacation for the family to Mexico and still fool around on the same account trading options with the gains from the initial 1k deposit. If I ever blow up the account that will be the end of options trading for me.",
