So today when it boomed, I just wanted to make back some of my losses, then profit.\n\nUnfortunately, I missed out on even double what I sold on lol . But I did it while hoping it comes down like it has been recently and I can rebuy an option. Also 2 weeks ago, it shot up but fell by the end of the day so I missed out on that one.\n\nIm a rookie and just started investing 3 weeks ago lol. Up 8% or so. Thanks to today's surge, I made a nice gain that offset my minor losses up to now, then added 8%. I also liquidated my diversity and went all in on NVDIA finally getting a long overdue shares, looking forward to splits and long term. Maybe I'll consider longterm instead. After today, honestly, I can see 120 realistically in 12-24 months.",
