That's why people can make money in the markets. The market operates to a degree of efficiency and something as big as rate cuts has already been priced in. If new information is received it is immediately reflected. That is the basis of the efficient market hypothesis. The more people who are aware of something and then act on it in a rational manner the more efficient the market is. Known information is priced in as quickly as possible and therefore knowledge is the key to gaining an advantage in the market. To say the efficient market hypothesis is incorrect is wrong.",
