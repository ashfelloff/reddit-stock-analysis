However, in options you have something called as “put\" and “call\" where in if you are expecting that the price of a stock is gonna fall, you can buy the put options by paying an amount called as premium. And what seperates futures and option is this and the maximum loss that you can have is the premium you paid for the options.(Thats if the price goes up instead). If the price moved to your favour, the market value of the put option(which is the premium itself) goes up and you can sell the option contracts and take profit.
