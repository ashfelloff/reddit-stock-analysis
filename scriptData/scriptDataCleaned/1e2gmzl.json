  "selftext": "In their latest report, Alibaba announced that they repurchased another $5.8B worth of shares in Q2. Over a period of 3 years, $BABA has been able to reduce its shares outstanding by close to 14%.\n\nThere are a **few points** to consider when investing in Alibaba:\n\n* Despite revenue growth slowing, Alibaba remains a cash flow machine with strong fundamentals and is trading close to all-time lows in multiple metrics.\n* Alibaba's focus on share buybacks, dividend issuance, and expansion into AI and cloud computing make it a strong long-term investment with the potential for significant returns.\n* Alibaba provides a large margin of safety for long-term investors looking for exposure in China.\n* They have plenty of cash to spend as they have a load of money on their balance sheet. They are using this to buy back even more shares or to issue a special dividend like they did recently.\n\nI believe Alibaba is suffering significantly from the sentiment that is completely in the gutter regarding China. As such, Chinese equities with Alibaba being one of my personal favorites, are currently giving investors an enticing value proposition with a relatively high margin of safety.\n\nWhile the thesis might take a while to play out, an improvement in sentiment could quickly launch the stock price higher.\n\nWhat do you personally think of Alibaba? \n\nFull disclosure: I'm currently net long on Alibaba through a multitude of options, but my position might evolve rapidly. Nevertheless, I don't think $100+ relatively soon is out of the question.",

It’s nothing new and I think the peak of delisting possibility has already passed. The valuation and potential cloud growth are worth it. I’m greedy when others are fearful.

Since Xi it has steadily retrenched. that has accelerated with Covid and Biden administration which is basically on warpath with China. Now everyone is gtfo china that’s only gonna get worse no matter who wins the next presidency.   China of today is nothing like the golden 2010s when BABA had decent prices and it will almost certainly never go back to that state again as disengagement/china derisk/reshooting continue.   oh btw do you think threats of ADR delisting has passed?  remember that before putting any real money in any chinese stock.  look at what happened to those russian stocks. Trump or the dems can easily saber rattle with that any day and it may actually happen. No body saw the russian swift removal or delisting happen. maybe a trade here or there with BABA is fine but any large scale investment is foolish.  better to buy btc honestly if you want some risk on exposure",

Do you think the Chinese government will continue to punish large businesses in the years to come? \n\nI've also read [this article](https://open.substack.com/pub/stockinfo/p/alibaba-the-unloved-treasure?r=19pqks&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true), which discusses the geopolitical and the more specific CCP risk in some manner. Any thoughts?",
