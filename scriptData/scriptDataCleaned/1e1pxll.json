  "score": 250,
  "selftext": "\n\nHello fellow regards, your local area degen here with another great short idea in a raging bull market! Interested? Listen on. Lets talk about Netflix. Netflix touched an ATH of \\~695 then double-topped off. This is where I actually opened my position for a 650/610 put spread for 7/19. So, why am I shorting it?\n\n\\* It's valued at \\~300B and a PE of 45 and forward PE of 37. This is how growing raging tech companies are priced. Maybe Netflix could be considered a tech company 10 years ago, but today streaming tech is a commodity. There is no technology moat here.\n\n\\* So what is Netflix then? It's a content company! Which brings me to my next point:\n\n\\* Netflix content has been raw dogshit for the last few years. What's the last good original content they released? They've just been trying to push Stranger things for the last 6 years.\n\n\\* The only screws they have left to turn are milking the existing user base either with price hikes or pushing ad-supported plans.\n\n\\* This strategy has given the stock a boost for the last few quarters, but I think the jig is up. There's a reason why they stopped reporting subscriber numbers... because new users aren't signing up anymore. And given where we are with inflation, I think the consumer's tolerance for price hikes has been reached. Who the fuck wants to pay $25/month for some C-level content and Korean soap operas?\n\n\\* Another ominous sign is that today, on one of the greenest days for the whole market, it's about the only red dot on my screen. People know a reckoning is coming.\n\n\\* My position is as stated above... it's up about 100% already but I'm definitely holding through earnings... either max pain or max gain baby!\n\nThat's all for this episode of how to lose money and make friends!\n\nEdit: About 80% of the responses to this post are telling me that I’m fully regarded and that Netflix is the greatest thing since sliced bread for 10 different reasons. This is a strong signal for me, combined with a lot of downvotes on the original post. Thank you everyone who contributed for boosting my confidence! I was thinking of trimming my puts by half to lock some profit in but now I might even double down with another put leg day before ER.",

Prices are increasing... quality is decreasing... streaming products are oversaturating the market... piracy on the rise... yet there's just this big Dwayne Johnson sized elephant in the room here: WWE.\n\nThey've locked up live RAW for 10 years (on top of all other WWE shows and live ppv/ple for outside US). Yeah, 5 billion might be expensive, but consider this : \n\n- Wrestling has consistently been at the top of the Neilson cable ratings, with exception of NFL, NBA, political and other special events. For a weekly, year-long episodic show, this is fantastic.\n- Wrestling fans are fucking loyal. And crazy. Go check /SC but they make you guys look tame. They will follow WWE from Peacock/cable guaranteed. You can see the show getting deals with different partners over the years, and fans kept flocking. One of the only shows on cable that actually maintains and even adds viewership YoY.\n- Perhaps more importantly, this WWE deal opens the door wide open to other live sporting events. If this is successful, I could see other live events/sports being pushed hard. If they ever land NFL, MLB, NBA in the US, NHL in Canada, Soccer in Europe... bears are going to get ass-fucked so hard cum's going to foam out of their mouths.\n\nMaybe this won't be reflected in this ER, though, as the deal only starts in Jan - maybe it's also priced in. But man, are these facts scaring the fuck outta me from opening puts near earnings with NFLX.\n\nAlso, I realize this sounds like a bull TKO post rather than a NFLX one, but I don't know enough about UFC side of it to make an accurate assessment there (but I was bullish on it March when it was 85, and now it's sitting at 111 even though I was too much of a cuck to buy long calls).",
