I expect TKO to keep slowly creep up leading to the weekend, with a possible dip before absolutely insane earnings in May.\n\nMeltzer also tweeted the following yesterday: ‚ÄúWWE sent out a release regarding first quarter 18-49 numbers which are way up.  WWE has been drawing a younger audience and has had great increases in the key demo at a time when the rest of television is dropping greatly.‚Äù \n",
