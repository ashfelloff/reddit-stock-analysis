Hoping me sharing my loss helps with this pain in my chest.\n\nGains started off with a single SMCI call option in the end of January when they had their first ~$100 jump which made $12k in profit.\n\nBought some some more after which went up about $25k but didn't sell, so it dropped before NVDA earnings and went back up after. Still didn't sell, dropped again.\n\nDuring all this bought NVDA, AVGO, AMD, and COST options. Struck gold first week of March. Sold quite a bit and made about $50k. Should've been happy and put the money aside but being the regard I am, starting putting some back in slowly and proceeded to lost almost all of those gains.\n\nEnded with this week where I tried SPC 0DTEs because the first day I made like $10k. Beginners luck but too dumb to get that though my thick skull.\n\nSo here I am, almost no gains after two months of trading (*cough* gambling). Lucky that my hard stop was my own money.\n\nI can't believe this all started with me wanting to make like $30k slowly over the year to offset mortgage payments and essentially have some discretionary spending money. Made a lot more, a lot faster. Regarded at heart, so lost all of it.\n\nI don't think I should be doing this anymore but my heart is hurting either way. Woke up with this pounding in my check and hope sharing it here relieves some of that pain. 😥\n\nTL;DR\nMade lots of money. Lost lots of money. Pain in my chest. Should be happy didn't lost my actual hard money but paaaaiiiiiin. 😓",
