It's sucks that I didn't buy puts before I lost 100k on bullshit monthly nvda calls, coulda been a millionaire maybe lol\n\nCoulda woulda shoulda ... sigh\n\nWomen rarely ever make the first move, even if they do it's with guys that are so out of their f-ing league it's like trying to pair up a f-ing hobbit with Shaquille O'Neal. They just get pumped and dumped and then curse at the worlds average looking average height average earning men for being average and not being exceptional enough for them to swipe right on lol\n\nNot only that but dating apps in general are extremelyyyyyyy difficult to monetize. If she wants to F she'll just give you her number and you'll be off to the races on the third or 4th date none of this wait till 6 months horsesh\n\nSo how does a company like Bumble make money off of its lonely average men not getting any attention on Bumble? THEY DONT. Or at least it's getting harder for them to do so given its abysmal year outlook",

My sentiment and understanding is the RESULT of those now well understood habits. I did not drive women away on Bumble cuz I wrote a mini rant in fact i often wrote very little\n\nIt has to do with very very basic reality. If a woman likes u, she will give you her number/email/snapchat/instagram or other contact info within the first few messages that are sent. If she is mostly uninterested, she won’t. It’s as simple as that \n\nThere are certain websites that have monetized the first message. Those sites are doing very well I would say \n\nUnless the first few interactions or messages are monetized it is extremely difficult to build a consistent stream of revenue for a dating app. Why would average looking men PAY to send messages knowing that women are still likely to read those messages and remain uninterested in them? Tell me, why on earth would they do that?",

Bumble is possibly the worst dating app for retaining straight men which are the highest monetizable population in the dating market imo. I used Bumble for a year, barely got any dates or likes. When I switched to Hinge I met so many women that I couldn’t keep up with convos and dates. The reason? I used the prompt response (DM slide feature on Hinge) to break the ice and start convos. Bumble is very restrictive in comparison and doesn’t serve straight men at all. I tell all single men to boycott Bumble. Congrats on a 6 bagger OP. Oh and FUUUUUCK YOU.",
