Just like the DJIA doesn’t mean anything to anyone who knows much, but it’ll be a big deal when NVIDIA replaces Intel in the DJ. And that’ll be a nice 4-5% bump. The split allows the Dow to include NVIDIA. They wouldn’t have a $1000 per share stock in there. Thats the point of the split. Other than they don’t know what else to do with their money. So they’re giving a good amount back to their share holders. Dividend yield up to .10 a share. Share holders love this shit.",
