That's not to say the pain is over; it's likely not and \"weekends\" tend to add to panic at times like these.\n\nBut we're 60% through the trading calendar in a year that's statistically done very well--i.e., both the S&P and NASDAQ are still up 12% YTD. The market could go nowhere from here to the New Year and we should all be very happy with the double-digit gains.\n\nThat said, we are just entering some seasonally difficult months and the VIX spiked 26% today. My best guess is that we will see some meaningful daily drawdowns, at least through the election, and then things will turn around. You know what they say: markets take the stairs up and the elevator down.\n\nI also know there's talk of a recession (when has there not been talk of one?) and maybe this time it's the real deal, but even then it's just part of a routine cycle. My favorite investment advice, especially at times like these, is to \"do nothing.\" \n\nYou're likely to be well-rewarded in 6-12 months.",
