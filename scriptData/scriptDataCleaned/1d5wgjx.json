  "selftext": "Cava has been on an absolute tear this past year. After seeing Cava meet earnings and the share price fall I bought into a position. I've been an avid Cava eating and have a few reason why this company will be a wall street gem.\n\nRoom for geographic expansion: Cavas still not nearly as large as chipotle in terms of location. Almost every Cava in an urban setting is located near a chipotle. Additionally, bought Zoes Kitchen and expanded it into more Cavas  \n\nMarket for healthy fast service restaurants: Us consumers, especially young workforce have shown an increase in healthier alternatives, and the Mediterranean diet is one of the best diets for longevity \n\nIdk thats just my two cents. Could be working at Cava soon! YOLO ",

(4) I think this might be added to the BECKY index due to its \"healthiness\".\n\nAlso we can consider to have LLY / NOVO in your and hedge with CAVA.
