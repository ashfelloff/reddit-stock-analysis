You have a really nice time and hey, one thing leads to another, you guys ending up losing your virginity together. \n\nOne day, you talk together and decide to have a child. A few months later, you guys are married, and later on a child is born. \n\nA beautiful baby boy. Several years pass, he grows up and is now in high school. Around 2021, he finds out there is a new kit that can provide your dna history for one about $100. He does the dna test, and he gets the results. \n\nYou, your wife, and your son open the results together. As you hold up the results from the father, you notice a close resemblance to the results of the mother. In fact, the dna fingerprint from the paternal side and the maternal side are 50% identical. Every nucleotide sequence, every chromosome, every telomere. \n\nYou look at your wife, your wife looks at you. You are now looking at each other. Your son looks at you both and he says, “papa, mama, what does it mean, what does it mean!!” \n\nAt this point it is clear… you fucked your mother and have a child with her. You decide to stay in the past, and live happily ever after. \n\nThe end… at least you didn’t lose all your crypto.",
