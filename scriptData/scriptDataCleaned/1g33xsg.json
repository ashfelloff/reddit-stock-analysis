So more money in at once means more money which can compound and grow earlier. \n\nI’m no expert but I also feel like people get wrapped up in thinking an investment is a “lump sum” just because it’s a larger amount of money (to them). Unless you come into some huge windfall and plan to invest it and never put another dollar in, then you’re not really lump summing. If someone invests $15k now and then a two years later invests another $5k, that’s still DCAing. Sure two years has passed but you’re still DCAing just over a longer timeframe than someone who’s maybe investing a fixed dollar amount each month",

Um, kind of a strange question, not sure what the total end game is, but quick math shows about personally 2:75 cash-stock (assuming we're talking about not just individual stocks, but rather anything invested in the stock market - index funds, etc.)\n\nSo roughly $40k cash vs $1.5M in the market. 36M, 2 kids (4,1)\n\n> (Not including 401k or ira etc)\n\nWhy wouldnt you include that? \n\n100k is far too much imo. Personally, I try and keep as little as possible in cash. I get downvoted to shreds when I say this - but pure cash 'emergency funds', if you're not living paycheck to paycheck and good with money, are unnecessary. My fall back is a credit card, to hold my over while I optimized liquidation of other assets. \n\nThe argument is always 'well the market could be down' blah blah blah....but there is an opportunity cost with being in the market that is hard to beat. Realistically, if the market is down so badly that my 1.5M goes to near nothing, and it 'hurts' to liquidate some of it, then there are bigger problems.",
