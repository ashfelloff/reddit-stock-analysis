  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "We also see a rotation of wealth known as the great rotation which means the S&P 500 which has continued to climb is now starting to fall in price while the Russel 2000 Index which is comprised of all the small cap stocks which have a total valuation of 3 trillion (less than apple and Microsoft). This is because ever since 2020 the S&P 500 has become evermore increasingly expensive compared to the net revenue per share. it currently has a PE ratio=30 and we are seeing that small cap stocks are more valuable and bang for buck then industry leaders. (this has been commonly brought up on CNBC and Bloomberg)\n\nMore than half the return of the S&P 500 came from Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet with these stocks being down in some bit during 2024 has dragged S&P 500 down at least 1%.\n\nSo then since the Russel 2000 is 1/15 the size of the S&P500 with even a little bit of money circulating into the index there could be a big change in price. Also with the June consumer price index being in favor of small cap companies as we saw on day of release a 3.6% gain then also this is in favor for small cap companies as with inflation going towards healthy range and there being 2 fed rate cuts in 2024 could alleviate the high debts that these small cap companies take on, With these debt levels being relieved then we can see a surge in revenue from these companies thus driving the Russel 2000.\n\nThis isnt crazy right?",

Yes i am aware that the rate cuts will revive the Russel 2000, but that you mean a mere 8.4% per year, as is usualy for the russel 2000. And it already overshot this by 2%.

On the other hand it is unreasonable to assume fed rates will drop to 0.5% again within 12 months. \n\nTL;DR: The Russel 2000 was undervalued, now is slightly overvalued, will continue to grow 8.4% each year, as it did before the rate hikes and pandemic.",
