So today, u/TheJusticeDept is taking the next step to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under federal law,\" Biden said in a post on X.\n\nIn a video message accompanying his post, Biden said Thursday's announcement \"builds on the work we've already done to pardon a record number of federal offenses for simple possession of marijuana.\"\n\nAt Scheduled III category, marijuana's classification was the same as heroin.\n\nIn a statement,The Department of Justicesaid it has submitted a notice of proposed rulemaking to theFederal Registerto initiate a formal rulemaking process for the cannabis reclassification. The procedure also requires notice to the public and an opportunity for comment and an administrative hearing, it said.\n\n  \n#Cannibas Stocks are going to RUN.  T L R Y ",

For starters multiple layers of taxes - multi state operators are playing with paper thin margins and very fragile companies. Also more payment delinquencies are inbound across the industry (commercial RE defaults/businesses not getting paid for services rendered and product sold). Oh and the continuous black market pressure. Most of these guys also flood the black market with flower (See Glass House Lawsuit).  \nHow about them canadian Lps?

By that I mean that you can't get a prescription from a doctor, take it to a pharmacy, and have them give you medical cannabis and bill your insurance.  There are currently \"licensed providers\" but they are just dispensaries that operate under a state's medical umbrella. That is basically still retail, but with more steps.\n\nActual medical cannabis, once S3 is approved, will be similar to getting Tylenol with Codine. You go to a doctor, get a prescription, and fulfill it at any of a number of local pharmacies.\n\nAdditional, current medical cannabis isn't well regulated. Some states let almost anyone grow and buy it from them and sell it for cash to someone with a \"medical recommendation.\" That all goes away under S3. Once it's rescheduled, the FDA steps in and sets regulations that growers and distributors must meet or they are ineligible to provide for medical purposes. This is what allows pharmacies to carry those products and insurance to cover them (basic quality control used for every pharmaceutical product).\n\nRetail and \"retail with extra steps\" is what the US has now.",
