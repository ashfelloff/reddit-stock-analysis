  "selftext": "Hello fellow regards. I have come to the observation that we are so ungodly regarded we are missing the easiest play in front of us. \n\nLLY has been fucking pumping for good reason in the past few months. \n\n1. They have insane revenue. They beat last earnings expectations from exp: 8.97 billion to act: 9.35 billion. Thats a whole lot of money to be bringing in constantly. And they have an expected revenue for next quarter at 8.98 billion. LIKE WHAT TF. \n\n2. They legit cannot make enough products to meet demand. Obesity and diabetes have swept the country and health related problems that LLY capitalize on have spiked and almost half of Americans are over weight and will soon need these drugs. Idk if you may have read that correctly. ALMOST HALF OF AMERICANS ARE OVERWEIGHT, many also have diabetes which is also another area for lly to make money. \n\n3. Weight loss drugs are the temporary solution to this shitty problem. People will take the temporary solution any day of the week. And in this case the temporary solution is LLY weight loss drugs. \n\nThis is a powerhouse of a company with great financials and calls are definitely the play since earnings are later in April. You wouldn’t even need to hold through earnings to get profits. Since people will wake up and pump LLY since people see the earnings are close. \n\nLLY gives the fat people the easy way out of the situation they ate themselves in!",
