Problem is their replacements have similar thinking, so the only way for the mold to break is for the replacements to get sick of what they were handed AND the bulk of the society sharing the same opinion.\n\nThe real shift started thanks to covid forcing Japanese's backwards work culture to accept remote work \"for the greater good\", then it eventually led to work hours discussion to minimize interaction, then it led to discussing how backwards Japanese work hours are compared to rest of the world(aka the west), then it became socially acceptable to just discuss and demand changes for work as a whole. Japan's niceties-based society really benefited from using pandemic as the ultimate card to demand work place changes, mainly thanks to the extremely old management relenting as it put the fear of mortality into them, while any pushbacks would be met with society hitting them with the \"HOW DARE YOU ENDANGER THE SOCIETY WHEN THERE'S A VIRUS AROUND\"",
