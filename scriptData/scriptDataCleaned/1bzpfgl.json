There is an annual cybersecurity conference called RSA which will be held in San Francisco May 6-9th and BB attends every year. \n\nI looked up the dates for the past 5 years of RSA conferences and BB stonks have made some of their biggest jumps a week or so after the conference, including their highest peak of $14 on June 4, 2021. The 2021 RSA was May 17-20, and it climbed from $8.50 on May 14th to $14 within two weeks. \n\nThe other RSA years saw increases as well, but not as much as that. I can’t confirm the conference itself made the prices jump, but the dates correlate for the last 5 years with stock price jumps.\n\nEdit: correction, for 4 out of the 5 years. There was one year where it dipped afterwards. Still 80% chance, I’ll take it!\n\nEdit 2: looks like they unveiled AI powered zero trust network security at the RSA in 2021 right before their stock price climbed.",

The leading players in automation and robotics have utilized a multitude of both off-the-shelf and proprietary RTOS with their hardware for decades.  The following statement is meaningless:\n\n\"an integrated software-hardware foundation offering real-time performance, low latency and determinism, to ensure that critical robotic tasks are executed with the same level of precision and responsiveness every single time.\"\n\nIts what every single PLC and robotics OEM has provided their customers for the last 20 years. If you can't offer deterministic execution, you don't have a solution. The only relevant question is what does a QNX/AMD reference design bring to the market that is superior to the solutions that have been built in-house and tailormade for the automation/robotics industry?\n\n If you don't have an answer to that question, you shouldn't be investing on this news because its just meaningless marketing jargon. Rockwell, Siemens, ABB, Yaskawa, Omron  and many other automation specialists have deep domain experience developed over decades, so why will BB be successful in this vertical?",
