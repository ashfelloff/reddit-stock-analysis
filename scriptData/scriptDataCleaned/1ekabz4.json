  "selftext": "Asia-Pacific markets continued Friday’s sell-off as investors look toward key trade data from China and Taiwan this week, as well as central bank decisions from Australia and India.\n\nJapan’s markets led losses in the region as the Nikkei 225 and Topix dropped 7% in volatile trading.\n\nMonday’s decline follows Friday’s sell-off, when markets in the region tanked, led by Japan’s Nikkei 225 and Topix falling more than 5% and 6% respectively.\n\nThe broader Topix marked its worst day in eight years, while the Nikkei marked its worst day since March 2020.\n\nAustralia’s S&P/ASX 200 fell 2.3%.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia kicks off its two-day monetary policy meeting Monday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the central bank to hold rates steady at 4.35%, but markets will monitor the monetary policy statement for clarity on whether the RBA is still considering a rate hike.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/05/asia-markets.html",

Once it is clear that there is no gold, the shovel selling business will be out of business.\n\nWhat I mean is - Nvidia's current financials are great. But their stock prices assumes continued growth based on AI chips. If AI hype reduces, suddenly the future is far less certain. Atleast for companies like google AI made up only a fraction of their business, while for Nvidia it is probably close to 90% of their business. Am I wrong?",

The Japanese also have a nontrivial stake in U.S. treasuries and U.S. stocks. When yields go down and stocks go down, they may unwind their trades to convert back to Yen. To unwind the trade, they have to convert to Yen from dollars, increasing demand for the Yen and driving things up. Potentially, that could contribute to problems at Japanese banks, but I don't know the details about their crash, other than the fact that they have a shrinking population and aging and calcified economy and have never been fans of immigration. \n\nI'm shaving several positions to reduce risk and for dry powder in case there is a bargain basement rummage sale. But, at the end, I want more shares. \n\nI think a pertinent historical example could be the [Asian Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis) of 97 and 98, which had a lot of people really worried back then. But, I don't see this one being that big (because the currency of a country the size of Thailand hasn't collapsed) and even in 98, it was a great time to buy U.S. stocks (which had sold off) or hold through the big swings.
