Of course their $200 (inflation adjusted) pre-split price was also in reach for more investors to begin with and they didn't have as much speculative enthusiasm going into the split so :shrugs:  \n  \n But hey, I'm still right there with you hoping for the hype to feed a rally like no other on Monday.
