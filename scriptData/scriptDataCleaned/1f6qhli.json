Knowing skews and advanced option techniques, if the position goes in the wrong direction you can still make money. This doesn't work for every stock so its important to understand how gamma plays a role in this strangle strategy.\n\nOther times I may buy leaps and sell a 6 month contract to counteract the theta burn. I will not hold a leap during its last 6 months.\n\nOther times I may just do a naked leap if its \"essential\". Or pair it with a 1-2 month protection if its \"risker\" or if there is a major event like FOMC or CPI report coming up but the stock is at a bargain.\n\nRatio backspreads, I can sell 1 call and use that premium to buy 2 calls. Zero capital outlay.\n\nMajority of my strategy is sell puts and buying leaps, maybe 20% is doing other advanced techniques.",
