  "selftext": "Since their IPO was launched back in 2006 CMG traded over 100$ the first year. \nCava went public to the market LAST YEAR, Since their IPO $CAVA has been up 60$ or 277.00% \n\nWhy I‚Äôm comparing CAVA TO CMG? \n\nBecause both sell the idea of giving the people healthy food, and people fall for it, since 2016 the restaurant chain had successfully opened around 330 and continues to expand the 2024 with another 50 stores‚Ä¶ and in the long run 1000 by 2032, that‚Äôs huge if u pay attention what CMG did. \n\nLet‚Äôs talk about numbers. (2023)  \n\nFull Year CAVA Revenue Growth of 59.8%\n\nDriven by CAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth of 17.9%\n\n72 Net New CAVA Restaurant Openings During Fiscal 2023\n\nFull Year CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin of 24.8%\n\nWhat CAVA has for us this 2024 ? \n\nCAVA Group anticipates the following for fiscal 2024:\n\nNet New CAVA Restaurant Openings: 48 to 52\n\nCAVA Same Restaurant Sales Growth 3.0% to 5.0%\n\nCAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin: 22.7% to 23.3%\n\nPre-opening costs: $11.5 to $12.5 million\n\nAdjusted EBITDA: 86.0 to 92.0million\n\n\nGrowth Trajectory: CMG experienced rapid growth post-IPO, maintaining strong performance over the years. CAVA's current growth rate and expansion plans suggest a similar trajectory, with significant revenue growth and a robust plan for increasing their store count.\n\n2. Market Position: Both companies capitalize on the trend towards healthier eating. This positioning has proven successful for CMG and appears promising for CAVA.\n\n3. Financial Metrics: CAVA's current restaurant-level profit margins and projected adjusted\nEBITDA indicate strong operational performance.\nWhile the margins are slightly lower than CMG's historical figures, they are indicative of a healthy and scalable business model. \n\nFuture Outlook for CAVA\n\nFor 2024, CAVA anticipates moderate same-restaurant sales growth and maintains a healthy restaurant-level profit margin despite high pre-opening costs. The projected adjusted EBITDA indicates continued profitability and operational efficiency, crucial for sustaining investor confidence and funding further expansion.",

All these are getting highly primed for a flash dump when reality hits that no actually Americans can't spend $1000 a day on CMG, SG, CAVA, WING simultaneously and that their growth is rapidly slowing because all the good markets have been expanded to (and it's increasingly more expensive to expand).  Tesla math is right lol\n\nIt's amusing because there's actually been corrections in the more fashion-consumer discretionary income base like $LULU and $TGT after reality hit. LULU went from like a 75 P/E to a 25 P/E in the span of a quarter.  It's only a matter of time before it hits the food-consumer discretionary income base.",

Rents, despite being high, are as low relative to cost of ownership as they've been in 20 years.
