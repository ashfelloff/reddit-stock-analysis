      "body": "About 5 years ago someone on the software engineering team I managed had previous jobs at Nvidia and Tesla and he still had a lot of stock in both. He worked at Tesla in the early-2010s when the stock price was hovering in the teens, then spent 5 years or so at Nvidia in the late 2010s when the stock price was in the single digits and then ran up into the 60s.\n\nI haven't talked to him in a while but he must be absolutely fucking loaded at this point. I remember him saying that his financial advisor kept begging him to sell the TSLA and NVDA stock because that was pretty much his entire net worth. He told him he'll take his chances.\n\nThe dude is probably worth close to $10M now and he was always just a low-level engineer with no ambition for promotions or management. He was just happy pounding out code all day.",
