The thing about having so many people barely scraping by is that they literally can't spend less and with inflation now easing, especially gas prices they will even have a few extra bucks to spend on stuff.  So as a previous post pointed out, unless there's massive layoffs, there's not going to be a recession.",

It makes sense that ~ SPY 575 would be near the top approached by the last run with the rate cut that just occurred in mind. “priced in” right?\nChina news is a new cog but unless sentiment rallies enough I don’t see anything that could compare to the AI craze and add further value.",
