Otherwise I can't see a proper landing without hurting yourself if it doesn't have wheels.\nBecause the hoverboard, is anti-grav, therefore it's speed is only subject to friction. \n\nDue to my limited understanding of gravity, if it's anti-gravity, it would be parallel anti-gravity to the Earths gravity. So if you try to stop by bringing the board upwards I don't see how you would stop. Because your auntie gravity waves would be perpendicular to the Earth's gravity waves therefore you're slicing through them and you're not using them to bounce your anti-gravity off of. \n\nI have to admit it was a great idea.

You profit based on how much the stock goes down, and lose money if the stock goes up in that time.\nWhen you sell the stock, the price goes down. If a company is on the threshold of the S&P 500, short-selling it will cause the price to fall, which would cause it to become delisted from the S&P 500, which would cause all the S&P 500 index funds to sell the company, further decreasing the stock price so you make money. Or at least, that's what would happen if companies in the S&P 500 were automatically delisted once their market cap decreased to the point where they're no longer in the top 500.",

It is also recognized as GOLD standard benchmark, outperforming >85% of funds in the past 10 years. This means that in the long run, the S&P 500 is more likely to beat your active investment strategy. \n\nEach index provider has their own “recipe” or methodology, on how they select stocks and put them on their indexes. This is what separates s&P from MSCI/FTSE/Contigo and others. Although there are considerable overlaps between these providers, it’s safe to assume the methodologies work. These index providers have HUNDREDS of different strategies or indexes that cover many different parts of the market. If you think of a specific strategy, it’s very likely there already exists an index that will passively track it. \n\nS&P is also a publicly traded company, and assuming that you can “pay” to enter the index is completely incorrect. Doing this would tarnish their reputation and the trust their clients have. How could a reputable asset manager buy the index knowing that the companies selected are solely based on paying to enter. Investors would quickly loose trust and would not want their names associated with S&P. \n\nIt’s good that you are trying to educate yourself , but please do proper research before posting information that you yourself do not fully understand.",
