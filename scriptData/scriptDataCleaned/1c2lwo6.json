So stop asking for people losing their jobs. \n\nAnd war... War never changes. \n\nIran doesn't have the resource to engage in any real war with Israel, it will be just fireworks over the Lebanese/Sirian boarder near some Israeli troops. \n\nEarnings season will about to start again in a couple of weeks for big tech minus Nvidia. That is all that matters. Great, well manage companies with good products. \n",

However, the things that drove the market upwards when everyone was excited are also the things that can drive it downwards.\n\n\\* AI hype - It's great that NVDA and other companies are selling so well, but is this hoarding of talent and chips by large tech companies? If so, and they start selling back excess talent and capacity into the market once their models are done \"training\", it might be an indication downwards.\n\n\\* A strong robust economy that's been unaffected by high interest rates could also be an overextended economy that has foolishly ignored interest rates.\n\n\\* Strong immigration that has been keeping housing valuations high could also lead to more unrest inside America, or perhaps it's just strong competition for low priced homes, and top of the line valuations fall. \n\n\\* War is initially bearish, but tends to be bullish once production kicks in.\n\n\\* A rotation into commodities is very much a possibility as China begins to manufacture its way out of deflation and flood global markets with cheap goods. Could be bullish in the beginning when stocks and commodities are both rising as they are now.\n\nThe key insight is that the federal reserve doesn't want to be blamed for causing a recession. It would rather wait and hold, and let the market break, and then J Powell can swoop in and say we're cutting interest rates because of xy and z. Another key fact: since the yield curve has inverted, it takes on average 13 months or even up to 2 years for a recession to begin.\n\nTL;DR Things are good so I can find all sorts of reasons to explain why things will continue to be good. Once things get bad everyone will think of all the things they ignored previously and justify why it will get worse.",
