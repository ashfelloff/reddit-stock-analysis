It has no reason to not to keep trending up. \n\nThis pic isn’t really any concrete news, but to me it reads as the CEO unofficially announcing that there are additional govt/DOD contracts and projects in the works.\n\nAdditionally, they’re incentivized to keep bringing good news to increase their chance of getting listed on the S&P this sept.\n\nI’m up over 100% on calls rn, and plan to keep adding more ATM calls as it continues to trend up.\n\nObviously this is not financial advice.",
