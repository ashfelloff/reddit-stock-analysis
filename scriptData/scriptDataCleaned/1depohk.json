But the reason it does so is because it has a lower level of risk for each $1 invested.\n\nQQQ outperforms the S&P on a $1 to $1 basis historically and on an expected basis, so is it strictly superior to the S&P 500? Of course not. It outperforms because it has a higher level of dollar weighted risk.\n\nYou get to decide how much beta you want in a portfolio, and you can do so by combining levered assets of basically any type you want. There are definitely micro and macro reasons why in certain market conditions you‚Äôd expect SCHD to outperform a broad market fund on a risk weighted basis, and even if the expectation is that it would underperform on a dollar weighted basis, portfolios can be delevered and levered to the heart‚Äôs content. \n\nNone of this is about SCHD, though. The comment was about the silliness of picking between diversified funds based on historical or expected performance on a dollar weighted basis, when the delta between the performance of those funds is mostly a function of how much market risk those funds are bearing at any given moment.\n\nIndividual investors aren‚Äôt limited to picking how much market risk they want to bear based on what the underlying funds are bearing.\n\nThe choice isn‚Äôt between $1 of growth stocks and $1 of SCHD. It can be between $1 of growth stocks and $1.4 dollars of levered SCHD (or whatever the appropriate ratio is to get to an equivalent degree of risk), and there are plenty of good reasons (even if circumstance limited and not applicable in all weather) where an investor would consider that appropriate.\n\nTreasuries obviously have a lower expected return than the S&P 500. Why do they still get inflows? How can a competitive market bear this sort of divergence in expected return if the thing we care about is unlevered expected returns on $1 invested? It‚Äôs because that isn‚Äôt the relevant metric we care about. It‚Äôs not about finding the thing with the highest expected return. It‚Äôs about risk-weighted return, because any asset or combination of assets can then be levered up to whatever level of risk the investor wants.",
