That is the biggest sign ever you should raise your prices - when people want your product so much that they can't get it, and you can't make it fast enough, it's time to raise your fucking prices. It was a smart move, and stocks don't go up just because people raise prices, otherwise everyone would triple their prices tomorrow. It just doesn't work that way.

The EU is the supplier (ASML) : *They* dictate the conditions of this relationship. Not the US.

      "body": "While concerns about ASML and geopolitical tensions are valid, they don't fully capture the bigger picture of the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical due to rapid technological advancements, fluctuating demand, and supply chain dynamics. Historically, periods of high demand, driven by innovations and consumer electronics growth, led to increased production and investment. However, overcapacity and inventory build-ups can result in sharp downturns. Economic conditions, shifts in consumer preferences, and geopolitical factors also contribute to this cyclicality. Boom cycles often see rising prices and profits, while bust cycles involve price declines, reduced profits, and sometimes industry consolidation.\n\nNVDA isn't immune to any of these industry realities. However, NVDA has some characteristics that most semiconductor companies can't claim.\n\n* **Nvidia's Unique Position:** Nvidia is uniquely positioned with its dominance in the GPU market, which is essential for AI, gaming, and data centers. The demand for AI and machine learning applications is surging, providing a strong growth catalyst for Nvidia that isn't as impacted by the specific issues facing ASML.\n* **Strong Financial Performance:** Nvidia has consistently posted strong earnings, often exceeding expectations. Their latest earnings report highlighted a significant growth trajectory, driven by robust demand in their core markets. This positions Nvidia differently compared to companies like ASML, which face distinct challenges.\n* **TSMC's price hike strategy:** Price increase isn't what propels NVDA's stock.  Nvidia's growth is fueled by technological advancements and increasing adoption of AI across various industries, rather than just price adjustments.\n* **Diversification and Innovation:** Nvidia's diverse product portfolio and continuous innovation provide multiple revenue streams and mitigate risks associated with geopolitical issues affecting specific markets or products.\n* **Market Sentiment and Momentum:** Market sentiment around Nvidia remains positive, supported by strong institutional backing and analyst upgrades. This momentum can help sustain its stock performance even amid broader market volatility.",

The AI story is getting hard push back now with no examples of novel discoveries or practical leaps in efficiency. Most stories I read are negative.

Look what happened with Q1, they reported earnings on 17th of April and net income fell to €1.22 billion from €2.0 billion.  \nThe stock tanked 5% back then, this time more because of Biden's administration comments (like you said) and yet, when NVDA reported their earnings a month later (22nd of May), we got an insane rally to new ATH.
