  "selftext": "Netflix is overvalued and has failed to break 700. Again. Netflix is spending a bunch of money to try and add value to their already overpriced service. The addition of add based cheaper services will be fruitless when their entire base is ad free. Netflix will have to make equal investments in different culturally relevant titles for each market it attempts to break into. Netflix wants investors to keep thinking about growth but will stop reporting subscriber numbers soon. (Because it is going flat) Anyone who wants Netflix here has it already. Nobody wants a historical shit movie catalog with one or two new series or half ass hits a month, for 29.99 a month. \n\nI‚Äôm in on a $500 Strike by 10/18. Tell me I‚Äôm stupid. I‚Äôm realistically targeting $350 with a solid enough correction.\n\n July 19th is going to show flat or missed target profits. A lot of money was spent this quarter to obtain streaming contracts and exclusive deals. The ad based streaming will be a dumpster fire. \n\nFight me \n\nEdit: will post my technical analysis tonight after work. I just hate the stock ",

We‚Äôve seen with absolute certainty that the average consumer is going to keep paying for Netflix no matter how much they charge. They‚Äôre literally just reinventing cable at this point, and consumers are willing to let it happen.\n\nI genuinely think it‚Äôs a real possibility Netflix can keep jacking their prices over the next decade until the base subscription is $80+. Hell, it wouldn‚Äôt shock me to see them start splitting off their Netflix originals as ‚Äúpremium‚Äù content that needed additional subscriptions to unlock. \n\nThis is a company that‚Äôs still in the early stages of completely replacing legacy TV/media and I see a not-too-distant future where they‚Äôll be worth well over $1000 a share. People are always going to need an outlet for televised media/entertainment. It‚Äôs clear that legacy cable isn‚Äôt adapting and streaming platforms are the future.

Not a big deal. And whatever percentage of them ends up getting their own account, that's a net win.\n\nThe only potential downside was account holders getting pissed but if you looked at how the mechanism was described the impact on them was minimal. A lot of people misunderstood how password crackdown practically worked and thought it would be a burden on people paying for their own account. In the end, not really.\n\nAnd finally, we knew that Netflix had tested it in a limited number of locations. They always do that. If the data had shown a negative impact compared to their control group, they wouldn't have gone through with it",

The problem with Netflix (in my humble opinion) is they don't have the monopoly anymore. There's so many streaming services now, it seems like every channel is trying to start their own.\nOn top of that, the reason everyone dropped cable and went to streaming was a combination of cost, having to watch ads after already paying for cable, and having to wait for weekly shows to come out. \nNow most services are creeping right back to where they pulled from. They're raising prices, cracking down on password sharing, implementing ads, and instead of dropping a season up binge, going back to weekly shows. \nI don't know if it will be Netflix, but I see a clear winner coming out in the streaming service and combining services. Disney is kind of doing it with hulu and espn.  Imagine if HBO Max never became profitable so they sold the rights to Disney. Then they pick up \"cult\" channel like AMC+ when Walking Dead was popular. Instead of paying for 5 different services, It will all be on one platform, likely Disney. Disney just got the NBA deal. They have a huge history of kids shows, now you have espn, hbo with game of thrones franchise, maybe something like walking dead hype with amc. Etc.  \nIf it's not Netflix that wins, then yes I agree with you. I feel like the competition will start to eat away at market share.",

Not to mention that ad revenue can be huge for highly-valuable live content (think international soccer, cricket, rugby matches)\n\nI don‚Äôt know this for sure, but I would imagine breaking into India at $3 per month could be profitable if the number of subs is significant enough (100M would equal $300M per month to pay for content and advertising and platform costs) and then ads on top of that and raising prices as time goes on - the formula is there for success.

Instead, these companies all compete for the average person‚Äôs budget of 1-2 streaming services/month, to provide them with TV and Movies that are increasingly expensive to make. \n\nFrankly, it‚Äôs unsustainable, and imo I think that significant acquisition and centralization will come at some point in the future until only 2 or 3 competitors are left. This will lead to something similar to the music streaming market, which has 2 dominant companies, each sharing nearly identical libraries. \n\nThe streaming business is expensive, and I don‚Äôt see how the current model of 20-something companies fighting over scraps pans out in the future.",

Not just in those countries, but in the US, Canada, and UK (and other countries), where they tend to be wealthier and are paying for the premium subscription.  \n\nThey‚Äôve also entered a deal with HBO to stream some of their catalog of higher quality programming, which brings lots of value to the platform.\n\nI think Netflix is struggling a bit to still deliver quality programming, which is what drew many people to Netflix, but they are still ahead of Paramount and Peacock who seem to have pretty bottom-of-the-barrel programming.  I do think they‚Äôll see some churn if they can‚Äôt get back to making actually good programming, but they are in a much. Ether position than other platforms.",
