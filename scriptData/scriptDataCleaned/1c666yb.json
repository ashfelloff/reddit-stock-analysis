As in, it doesn't take much buying and selling to move the SP by the figures we have been seeing. When Arm IPO'd I warned about that issue on here. The other problem with SB owning that much stock still then relates to the aforementioned point; when they come to sell down, which one assumes they will do at some point, it won't take much to massively move the needle. Even if they do it gradually we would still then see a gradual move down in the SP.\n\nI get the point in how much Arm architecture is in mobile phones etc. but I'm not seeing the next catalyst to push the SP on from here. Not saying it is a bad company, far from it, just it is very overvalued right now. I think it was worth something like 20 billion when listed on LSE and it was on a higher rating back then. Remember SB wanted to sell it to Nvidia for what, 60-70 billion? It's 110 billion now. Even after its 25% price drop.",

I’m sure I’ll keep tracking it, incidentally to others in the sector. But it’s not worth more anxiety at this juncture. If it somehow turns around and earns its value, and Sofbank loses its grip, then it might be a solid hold for the longterm. But that will all take time to play out, and isn’t worth what I view as the very likely losses in the near term. Apologies if I stressed you, I appreciated the frank discussion.",
