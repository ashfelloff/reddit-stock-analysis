  "selftext": "Already up 6%\n\nI thought the market overexaggerted his departure\n\nHe's a solid CEO, but they developed a deep bench of talent & processes to scale up to +7,000 restaurants without him\n\nNext earnings call will show strong results just like they did this quarter. Investors will learn Chipotle will still be the same and get back into the stock.\n\nI'm going to Chipotle for dinner in a few minutes. Not much is going to change.",
