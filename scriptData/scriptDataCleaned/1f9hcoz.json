There is convexity. These are not stocks and they are not linear. OP missed the relative term discount on duration trying to catch a bull steepener after the move. You could easily get 300bps of policy rate change and 0 in the 10+ over the next 16-18 months.

                      "body": "I love tlt and edv for asset allocation and hedging. I do not think the bullshit direxon or equity option on bond funds are good ideas when there is a flat to normal sloping curve and the fed has already broadcast the direction of future policy. It takes very little $$$ to hedge equities with long duration as a pure play and that is EXACTLY why stips and zeros exist--institutional money managers use them the same way. Derivatives on these sold to retail investors should not even be legal. You're getting taken advantage of. You cannot time exogenous shocks and that's what it takes to get large moves in long duration, you just want to own some unless it's an obviously bad idea to be a buyer like when rates are near 0. It's a perfectly reasonable time to have the security in your portfolio, not the derivatives hoping for moon shots. \n\nEDV is actually a purer duration play and you can see there are really two historic events when you would have benefited  greatly from the hedge: GFC, COVID. These are not things you can time. Duration is a powerful, but boring tool. \n\nWhen to own it is a real yield question. People shouldn't expect a large move over the next year without an exogenous shock. The $6T in money market funds and excess risk assets does not flow into long duration, it flows into the front end of the curve for safety. Long rates broadcast genuine sentiment and they will move before the fed, and before a flight to safety. It was an exciting time to add the position at +5%. 3.75% is 'normal'. You really need to be at the extremes to time an aggressive rate bet as a retail investor and a flat curve is pretty much the worst time to do that, especially an otm call after a 125 basis point bullish move before the fed even blinked. The policy moves are going to change the front of the curve much more than TLT/EDV, and there is limited upside in short duration.",
