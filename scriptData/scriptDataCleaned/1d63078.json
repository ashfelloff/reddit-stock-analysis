Every time we thought that a re-rate was in the cards, the markets fucked us.\n\nAt this point the only thing I believe will take us up and keep us up is proper revenue from commercial services.\n\nIt might look like sunshine and rainbows but we‚Äôve been asking the company about their lights-out situation at site 2 for years now. \n\nTruth be told, there‚Äôs likely to be a lot of difficulty scaling up the manufacturing of the satellites and it‚Äôs likely going to cause delays for commercial operations.\n\nWhat I‚Äôll specifically point out is this, in July/August they expect to deliver BB block 1, give them a month to integrate and launch them and then 3-4 months for deployment, testing and operations. From there you have some genuine revenue but these won‚Äôt be blockbusters, what they will do is give us a $ figure for the amount of broadband we can supply which can be leveraged for commercial loans.\n\nThe next point of importance is Bluebird 6, bluebird 6 is unique because it doesn‚Äôt fit in block 1 or block 2 perfectly. It will use an FPGA (more flexible, less broadband) and it will be launched standalone. We don‚Äôt have any further clear guidance for BB2.\n\nAt this point we‚Äôre looking at substantial revenue and forward guidance in Q1 2025 so that automatically puts 2025s in some danger. There is a strategy for it that I‚Äôll mention soon.\n2026s could be in for the big bucks but they are so expensive right now, not worth it tbh.\nIn 2026 we‚Äôll probably be making the big bucks and from there it‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess, the market may decide that our insane CAGR means we deserve a premium or it might be stupid and keep us at book value, no one knows.\n\nI‚Äôve amended my strategy. I no longer hold my OTM leaps with diamond hands, I sell them after a pump while the price is still high and move into shares to keep my upside exposure. From there I wait until IV crush reduces the price before I jump back in and wait for the next multi bagger.\n\nI know it‚Äôs tempting to go all in on options, just don‚Äôt expect a smooth ride is all I‚Äôm saying.",

My account is at $53,000, and here‚Äôs how I do it\n\n1. Use indicators and backtesting to gauge risk:reward. ChatGPT helps determine the probability of favorable stock movements (only for long positions) and its better if you give it as much data as possible regarding the stocks prior performance and bearish/bullish movements.\n2. Buy 90% stock and 10% options when a stock hits a sure-fire reversal level. Always buy long-term options (200+ DTE) and go out of the money based on expected upside.\n3. Buy puts out of the money, with expiration 1-2 months beyond your expected hold time. This covers most losses in a flash crash. For example I am aiming to only hold my position for one month, so I buy puts expiring 3-4 months out.\n4. Use stop losses on stock while letting options run due to their higher potential. The stock is a lower delta than the options but also has a much higher capital allotment. It‚Äôs not beneficial to you to diamond hand the stock position when your long dated calls can survive a (hopefully) temporary downturn. And in the worst case you end up selling it for a loss, or you just tough it out and hope the underlying recovers. The put will also have the opportunity to cover the losses on your leaps.\n\nExample, my McDonald's position is\n\n* 164 shares worth $42,000\n* 10 contracts 300c June 2025 exp worth $5,800\n* 15 contracts 200p Aug 16 exp worth $500\n\nStop loss for stock is set at $247. If it drops below the 100 monthly moving average, it usually falls to $200/share quickly. This setup can limit stock losses to $600 while the puts cover leap costs, and potential upside is over $30,000 if the stock reaches $300.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/spjfk4yd334d1.jpeg?width=2084&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd3dfe0bc93e6fa93d14525731c9e17e68747cc8\n\nAlso, as a bonus, if the stock runs up 10-15% and you want to hold your long position, just roll your puts. Sell for a slight loss and buy more. If you‚Äôre up $20,000 on a long position and you‚Äôre aiming for another $10,000, you shouldn‚Äôt be stingy about spending another $500 on puts.",

I‚Äôll use DELL as an example the day of their earnings call I bought 1 put. I knew that generally when earnings are announced after closing the stock tanks. But had it not tanked I had 30 days to recoup my money. Anyhow it tanked and I sold the next morning for 1,700 bucks profit. A rule to myself if I‚Äôm up 15% I sell and take the profit. If I‚Äôm down 10% I sell. The old saying is absolutely true , greed will kill an account quick! I take all the small wins and they add up. Last month I‚Äôm up 10k doing it like that. Sure I could have bought 20 puts and could‚Äôve made a killing. But if it had gone wrong it would have imploded my account. Take all the small wins , profit is profit and over time it adds up quicker than you think. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so much loss porn. People are buying way way to many calls/puts way out of the money and in most cases with and expiration 7 days or less. That‚Äôs a total setup for failure.

For a trading account, which is high risk and high reward, you don't just take the opposite position to hedge. Instead, manage the risk by adjusting how much you invest in YOLO trades based on how close you are to reaching your financial goals. Reduce risk as you get closer to your 'getting out of the rat race' target to protect your accumulated capital. In other words, the trading account is there to be used; there is no point in risking 10% of a 100k account. If that's the case, then just take out the 90k, put it in an index fund, and YOLO the 10k",
