  "score": 435,
  "selftext": "Intel shares plunged the most in 50 years on Friday, reaching a price not seen since 2013, after the chipmaker reported a big earnings miss and announced a massive restructuring.\n\nThe stock plummeted 27% to $21.22 as of late morning trading. It would be the second worst day ever for the shares, behind only a 31% drop in July 1974, which was three years after Intel’s IPO. The company’s market cap is now below $100 billion.\n\nThe dramatic selloff contributed to a 2.4% drop in the Nasdaq and pulled down global semiconductor stocks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — known as TSMC — closed 4.6% lower in Taiwan, and Samsung was down more than 4% at the end of the session in South Korea. TSMC is the world’s biggest manufacturer of chips, while Samsung is the largest memory semiconductor firm globally.\n\nIntel’s numbers were bad across the board.\n\nThe company swung to a $1.61 billion net loss after reporting net income of $1.48 billion in the year-earlier period. Adjusted earnings per share of 2 cents fell way short of the average analyst estimate of 10 cents, according to LSEG. Revenue also missed expectations.\n\nIntel said it won’t pay its dividend in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024 and lowered its forecast for full-year capital expenditures by over 20%. The company said it would lay off more than 15% of its employees as part of a $10 billion cost-reduction plan.\n\n“This is the most substantial restructuring of Intel since the memory microprocessor transition four decades ago,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told CNBC’s Jon Fortt in an interview that aired on Friday. “We have laid out an audacious journey of rebuilding this company, and we’re going to get that done.”\n\nA decision to more rapidly produce Core Ultra PC chips that can handle artificial intelligence workloads contributed to the loss, Gelsinger said on a conference call with analysts. The company said pricing was more competitive than planned during the quarter, as AMD, Qualcomm and other companies have been working to take market share from Intel, which has fallen way behind its rivals in the AI battle.\n\nThe job cuts will mainly take place this year, Gelsinger wrote in a memo. It’s the largest of any single job cut listed on Layoffs.fyi, an industry tracker that’s been operating since March 2020.\n\nCompeting on merit\n\nAdding pressure to the chip sector is a report from The Information that AI chipmaker Nvidia is the subject of a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust investigation.\n\nThe DOJ is looking at complaints that the company allegedly abused its market dominance in AI, The Information reported.\n\nIn response, a spokesperson for Nvidia said that the company “wins on merit.”\n\n“We compete based on decades of investment and innovation, scrupulously adhering to all laws, making NVIDIA openly available in every cloud and on-prem for every enterprise, and ensuring that customers can choose whatever solution is best for them,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that Nvidia is “happy to provide any information regulators need.”\n\nCNBC has also reached out to the DOJ on the report.\n\nSamsung rival SK Hynix, which supplies U.S. giant Nvidia, also fell sharply to close more than 10% lower. The sell-off continued in Europe. Shares of ASML, which sells key tools required to make cutting-edge chips, declined along with STMicroelectronics and Infineon.\n\nThe VanEck Semiconductor ETF, which includes major names in the sector, fell more than 4% on Friday after plummeting 6.5% a day earlier.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/02/intel-share-plunge-drags-down-global-chip-stocks-from-tsmc-to-samsung.html",

Their fabs are behind TSMC, and will require substantial investment.\n\nI think the 80% EPS miss just made everyone look at the rest of the conditions for Intel stock more. I'll likely pick up a bit of shares, but wouldn't be surprised to see it drop more next week.\n\nAMD also dropped about 8% while MEETING EPS targets. It rebounded about 3% today, but if a semi company meets targets and drops 8%, then it makes sense that Intel would drop so hard. Even Nvidia is down 5% the last week.",

But Gelsinger is really working off of mistakes made by leadership ~8-10 years ago. \n\nFoundry leadership in particular is not simply won or lost in a quarter, or even a couple of years. \n\nFor example, when Intel first released its 14nm CPUs in Q3 2014 TSMC was on a 20nm process (and TSMC vs Intel processes are not 1:1. Eg Intel’s 10nm is akin to TSMC’s 7nm). \n\nIntel didn’t move away from a 14nm process on desktop consumer chips until Alder Lake in November of 2021. In that time TSMC went from a 20nm process to a 4nm one (albeit not in full production). \n\nSo in 7 years Intel went from leading TSMC by several generations to being behind by between 1-2 generations. By the time Gelsinger joined in 2021 the most extensive damage had been done. \n\nThis isn’t even going into the design side- Intel missed mobile, GPUs, ARM, etc. They were slow to adopt chiplets, have confusing NUMA configs due to P and E cores vs AMD, and they aren’t where AMD is with 3D caches. They are in the DPU game with their IPUs but their only customer is Google, AWS is ahead with Nitros and Azure has their own play with Azure Boost.\n\n-Work in Cloud on Compute/AI infra and platforms, used to work for Gelsinger.",
