  "selftext": "Coca-Cola Co. said Friday it will pay $6 billion in back taxes and interest to the Internal Revenue Service while it appeals a final federal tax court decision in a case dating back 17 years.\n\nU.S. Tax Court Judge Albert Lauber on Friday issued a two-sentence decision and order ending his look at the case. The dispute reached court in December 2015, shortly after the company said it notified the IRS thatÂ [it owed $3.3 billion](https://apnews.com/coca-cola-irs-says-we-owe-3-3-billion-in-back-taxes-e44670af83504925a1e3693667764d0a)Â more in federal taxes and interest for those three years.\n\nHow will this KO stock trade on this news? KO holds roughly $19B in cash, but they hold $45 billion in debt.\n\nsource: [Coca-Cola to pay $6 billion in IRS taxes](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coca-cola-pay-6-billion-001528356.html)",
