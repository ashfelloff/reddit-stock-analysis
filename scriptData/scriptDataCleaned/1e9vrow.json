On days I can actually day trade (days off) I'm making some fucking money. If you actually have time to day trade lmk if you want to talk some basic strategy. Too many people losing on here playing certain cons for no fucking reason, or buying calls \"at the top/HOD\" or swapping to puts at the bottom/LOD. Otherwise good luck rich sir.\n\nEdit:  for those interested in the strat, well its nothing new or breaking. Just trade support and resistance levels. Keep in mind what direction the market is moving on certain time frames (learn time frames). Buy calls at support in an uptrend and learn to be satisfied with less profit. That means sell those calls at resistance and same for puts at support. It's easier said than done, but so many people buy calls at strong resistance and puts at support and if they're 0dte they lose big and complain the loss cause the market kept flipping on them.
