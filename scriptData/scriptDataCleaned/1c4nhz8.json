The most common complaint I see about new cars (both ICE and hybrids) is that they're a pain to repair due to all the computers and electrical components that go into the modern car. And an EV is certainly going to have a lot of electronics built into it. But is it really impossible to make these cars reparable for the handy consumer? Or will we always risk sending 20,000V into our nipples?",
