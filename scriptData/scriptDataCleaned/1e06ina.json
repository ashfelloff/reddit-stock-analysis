The broker will pair them and say \"as long as you hold the puts, we know we can exercise them if your shorts get exercised, so just keep $200 in cash for the difference and np\" so you hold the pair til aug expiration, watch both the short and long puts go to near 0, but since you sold a more expensive put, covering with cheaper insurance, when they both go worthless, you keep the $300xqty and thats it. From the very start you knew exactly how much youd get, and you were just betting that nvda wouldnt fall to 80 by the aug exp. thats why you only get $300 - barely any risk, but dont you want $300? selling calendar put spreads when youre bullish is like shopping on temu.",
