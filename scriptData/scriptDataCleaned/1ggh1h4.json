I didn’t login to that account under after trading day, and found it had executed late that afternoon, but with NVDA gaining just before close, it expired ITM. Have you ever exercised a call? I sure haven’t.  But NVDA was up over $4/sh in after-hours *and* it was announced that they are replacing INTC on the DJIA, and their earnings on 11/20 are going to eclipse (IMO of course!) the other Mag7, you bet I bought the shares @135.",
