There is also the gamble that it even gets anywhere near 140 before 7/19 to make a profit. Although I said gamble for a reason. Op made a gamble and is now stuck instead of investing so either they lose by pulling out early or take the risk of make or break. If you are very risky then you hold and see if it works for you.
