My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peek and he was browsing Zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.\n\nThat is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
