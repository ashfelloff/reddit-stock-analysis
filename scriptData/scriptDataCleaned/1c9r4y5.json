Or Toyota? Nothing. There’s no innovation, the technology sucks, they obviously don’t want to or can’t make a half assed electric vehicle. Rivian is Tesla’s main competitor.\n\nIf we rewound the clock and you were asked to buy shares in Ford at the very start knowing what you know today what would you say? Would you be jumping ship at the first sign of struggle?\n\nI hate the whole compare to other car companies thing they’re basically another Apple, Microsoft, etc because they’re building computers and gathering data on people.
