I'm only a junior in college as a math major and I don't really have any use for the money, nor do I have any debt (I'm very fortunate that my parents are paying for my education). I always heard about people losing their inheritance by spending it on garbage instead of investing. So I told my parents I'm not going to spend a cent of this money and I'm going to invest all of it and they were proud of me. I put 100k into a high yield savings account and bought 700k worth of Intel stock at market open. I plan on holding this for a decade depending on how it performs. \n\nHere's why I like Intel: \n\n- 2024 Q1 up 9% YOY \n\n- Intel has been heavily investing and restructuring by building out the domestic foundry business to manufacture semiconductor chips for third party companies. \n\n- With Intel 3 in production, leading-edge semiconductors are being manufactured in the US for the first time in a decade. Intel will regain process leadership as the Intel Foundry continues to grow. \n\n- I think the fact that Intel is positioning itself to be the largest semiconductor manufacturer in the US is massive. The US Gov is heavily prioritizing domestic semiconductor production and thus is heavily supporting Intel as a company with R&D funding. \n\n- If NVIDIA or AMD are ever forced to change manufacturers due to rising tensions/war between China & Taiwan, Intel will likely be a sole or largest manufacturer for NVIDIA and AMD \n\n- Intel has been heavily investing in R&D. 5.9B out of 12.7B of Q124 revenue was invested in R&D. \n\n- Intel is on track to exceed its forecast of 40 million AI PCs shipped by the end of 2024\n\n- The Intel Gaudi 3AI accelerator is projected to deliver 50% faster inference and 40% greater inference power efficiency than NVIDIA H100 on leading AI models. \n\n- Trading at Forward PE of 17.05 \n\n- Geopolitical tensions will ultimately work in Intel's favor more than any other company in this industry \n\n- I like the stock and I think its really cheap rn :) \n\n\n\n  \n",

You could be in and out of the workforce by 50, hell, 40 - If you keep that shit in the bank, collect some low-risk money with it, and you're golden. Assuming a 2% rate (which is assuming you're not very good at picking dividends) on 800k that's 16k/yr. After your four years in college you are looking at a decent down payment on a home. After that you've got your mortgage paid for, vehicles paid for, and quite a bit of wiggle room on top of that to do whatever the fuck you want. Reinvest some into risky shit like this, maybe you'll strike it big with that and now you have more money to play with without your world crashing down around you.
