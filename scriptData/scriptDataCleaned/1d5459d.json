This is another AI and computer-based company that was doing well Y/Y UNTIL AI blew up earlier this year.\n\nWeird right? You'd expect them to explode and reflect the same AI hype we have observed with NVDA, ARM, MU, and so many more. But no.\n\n\n\nYes they beat earnings but look at these quartley stats:\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/13ursaqd4t3d1.png?width=1337&format=png&auto=webp&s=240cdb3af0ab993121930db62f2c3c518ed8679e\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/52nxu5df4t3d1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8a437442b97cac59025cb4be81c6df6026717fc\n\nokay, down on income, dEPS, and profit margin in febuary, who gives a shit?\n\n\n\nwell...\n\nTheir Co-Founder does\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/853wlz3y4t3d1.png?width=3599&format=png&auto=webp&s=1742d3d65566b29b1d2fb9b16e2c0e85614e6557\n\noh, and their CEO\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/luqhii135t3d1.png?width=3599&format=png&auto=webp&s=d92a5ee22167744df784b98caf2b1a7cd634d992\n\nFor those asking themselves the question of who gives a shit, allow me to give you a recent example of what executives dumping shares before earnings usually indicates\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6utsfund5t3d1.png?width=3600&format=png&auto=webp&s=d171fa4c27490f721f2beddb9cae77479c750128\n\nremeber, Salesforce?\n\nCEO dumped, shares the 24th of May and remember what happened on the 30th?\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/472xolcs5t3d1.png?width=1362&format=png&auto=webp&s=120380d33796cf4b68ed979d724022841a881158\n\nI sense blood in the water for IOT and I find it quite likely it will plummet following earnings.\n\nMy positons:\n\n50 $25 put exp 06/14\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e11x0x3ddt3d1.jpg?width=2307&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e47703b5d1a050d7a3bdfae441c02b355e3625a\n\nTL;DR\n\nIOT, Samsara, CEO and Co-Founder are shitting the bed and dumpings shares.

The classic is:\n\n> You set up a 10b5-1 plan to automatically sell some stock in chunks over time, say at the end of each quarter.\nEach quarter, you review your companyâ€™s results before you make them public. If theyâ€™re bad, you just nod silently and let the 10b5-1 plan dump stock. If theyâ€™re great, you cancel your 10b5-1 plan. Itâ€™s not insider trading because youâ€™re not trading! And then later you start a new one.\n\n> This is not legal advice, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission has in recent years written rules to crack down on the obvious 10b5-1 abuses. \n\nSo there is still good opportunity for insiders to game the system, is it? \n\ni.e. Set advance schedule for 'Sell' tx to happen before every Q result, and only in those quarters where results are gonna be great,  opportunistically, (tell the broker to) cancel those transactions just before the schedule date.
