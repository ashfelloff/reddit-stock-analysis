  "selftext": "Last week, I bought 50 $18/$19 bullish call debit spreads on $HOOD expiring 5/24 [proof](https://i.imgur.com/dlolNBU.png). This means I:\n\n- Bought 50 of the $18 calls\n- Sold 50 of the $19 calls\n\nThis transaction cost me $0.90, and I get a maximum profit (Value goes to $1) if Robinhood closes above $19 and lose it all if robinhood goes below $18 on the strike day (value goes to 0) with a sliding scale in between.\n\nThe strike expiration day comes and robinhood closes at $20.50, which is good news for me because that should be maximum profit. What should happen at this point is robinhood exercises all 50 of the $18 calls (causing me to buy 5000 shares of robinhood) and then assigns the $19 calls (causing me to sell 5000 shares of robinhood) and I end up with $5000 in the bank.\n\nInstead, what happened was Robinhood did exercise 50 of the $18 calls, but only assigned 49 of the $19 calls. This means instead what happened was I bought 5000 shares of HOOD at $18 [proof](https://i.imgur.com/StHW7p3.png), was forced to sell 4900 shares of HOOD at $19 due to assignment [proof](https://i.imgur.com/QKdkNHt.png), and am left with 100 shares of hood and $3100 cash.\n\nBecause HOOD trades above $19, the 100 shares of HOOD are worth more as shares than as cash. As of close friday, the total net of my trade is $3100 + 100*(20.50)= $5150 which is more than the theoretical maximum profit\n\nBasically robinhood gave me free money or something. Can someone confirm\n\nUpdate: I was able to sell the 100 shares at 20.58 in the 24 hour market and claim my free money. Gg 150 extra bucks secured",

This is rare, but out of 50 options, you got “lucky” on one. But it may not be as glorious as it may seem. You planned to walk away on Friday with $5K and zero market risk.
