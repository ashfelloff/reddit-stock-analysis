  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\n**News:** [BOJ’s Lack of Detail on Bond Buying Cuts Leaves Yen Vulnerable](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-14/boj-to-cut-bond-buying-in-normalization-step-as-rate-held-steady)\n\n**ADBE-** Beat on both top and bottom line earnings, revenue of 5.31B vs 5.29B expected, and digital media revenue of $3.91B vs $3.89Be. Earnings of $4.48 vs $4.38e EPS. raised revenue forecast for 2024, stating that more consumers are using AI editing tools.\n\n**TSLA-** Elon Musk’s $56 B pay package is officially backed. **This does not override the court’s ruling.**.  \n\n**BITF-** RIOT platforms raises BITF stake to 14%, (they were trying to acquire this company in the past), BITF tried to do a poison pill earlier this week to prevent acquisition. They also announced a large-scale mining site by 2025.\n\n**RH-** Reported earnings miss, revenue of $727M vs $725.2M. -$0.40 vs -$0.09 expected. Future guidance is far below expected, 3-4% vs 7%.  \n\n**NVDA-** We hit ATH premarket, also read this [interesting article on CNBC about a SPDR fund rebalancing based on market cap.](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/fridays-trading-could-trigger-a-10-billion-rush-of-demand-for-nvidia-shares-heres-how.html) Worth watching at the open.\n\nIPOs today: **TEM, OSTX (Particularly interested in TEM).**\n\n ",

Chat GPT-esque services will have found their niche amongst academia and professionals, and the consumer market will subside dramatically once the novelty wears off and the DAU diminish.\n\nNVIDIA won’t blow out earnings by 500% each quarter. Linear increases in model performance require exponential increases in compute power and at some point the economics for GenAI products stop working due to diminishing returns (4o uses a half million GPUs, are they really going to procure 2 million GPUs for GPT 5? 4 million for GPT 6?)\n\nThe companies I listed have near if not total monopolies on design, manufacture, and key IP of semiconductors. General trends in this market will push them up and down.\n\nI expect a correction at some point, especially as (AFAIK) most of the genAI applications aren’t profitable endeavors.\n\nMy recommendation is to throw it into SOXX if you believe in the premise. This ETF has outperformed VOO many times over, though there’s no guarantee that’ll continue in the future.

He studied finance and became a self-made multimillionaire with his investments and the financial planning business he started (and is now retired from). He did tell me a couple years ago that he invested heavily in Amazon when it was only 73 (or 77?) cents per share, and that's where he made most of his millions. And then same with Apple. So his only advice when I asked him a couple years ago was to follow the tech advancements.",
