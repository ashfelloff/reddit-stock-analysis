  "title": "Bullish or Bearish Powell Interview?",
  "score": 110,
  "selftext": "I have seen a pretty equal amount of people making the case that Powell's recent interview was bullish or bearish. I have decided to lay out the cases for both.\n\nFurthermore, it is worth noting that PCE numbers were released a few hours before the interview. The numbers were in line with what was expected, with MoM PCE below expectations.\n\nDisclaimer: I saw Powell's comments as more dovish than hawkish, but I will try to lay out both cases as unbiasedly as possible.\n\n**Bullish perspective:**\n\nThe PCE numbers were a positive, in spite of a slight uptick, because they were what economists were expecting. Powell even alluded to that in the beginning of the interview, saying \"It is good to see something coming in line with expectations\" and \"It's definitely more along the lines of what we want to see\". He also mentioned a few times how inflation has been coming down and there has been real progress made.\n\nAt one point during the interview, the interviewer (who, by the way, was extremely brash) asked why would it be terrible to initially lower the rates before data provides confidence and react appropriately if the data changes. To which Powell said \"you're right, we always have to be humble,..The outlook is always much more uncertain than most people think\". He went on to say they (the Fed) are in a good place to react to a range of scenarios, with the bear case being holding rates where they are and the base case of lowering rates.\n\nMoreover, after the PCE release and interview, interest rate traders increased the odds of a June rate cut to ~60% from ~50% on Thursday.\n\n\n**Bearish:**\n\nPowell brought up the high inflation readings from January and alluded to them being concerning. He mentioned how they expect to see inflation coming down on bumpy path \n\nPowell also addressed the elephant in the room about when it is appropriate to begin lowering rates. He said \"we don't see it as likely to be appropriate to begin reducing interest rate until we are confident that inflation is moving down to 2% on a sustained basis\". He reiterated multiple times that they are not in a hurry to lower rates. The reasoning behind this is that the economy is strong and unemployment is near historic lows. The case being made from bears is that this is a bad thing because it gives justification to the Fed to just keep rates where they are.\n\nLastly, Powell said that he does not see rates going back to their pre-pandemic low.\n\n\n**Why I am leaning bullish:**\n\nI don't think the markets expected Powell to cut rates in May anyways. So there was no expectation to rush into a rate cut. Also, I don't believe markets expected rates to go back to those below 1% pre pandemic lows.\n\nMy takeaway was that the worst case scenario is rates stay where they are for longer than expected, where best case scenario is they come down significantly. But even in that worst case scenario, it only happens because the economy is booming and unemployment stays low, so is it really worst case? Even in this worst case scenario, Powell alluded that eventually they would lower rates when inflation does come down. So there is no case where rates remain where they are indefinitely.\n\nTLDR: Bulls have a point, bears have a point, and I identify as a heterosexual bull (he/him pronouns).\n\n",

But that signal is an extremely powerful one to the market.\n\n2) Bostic and the other more hawkish members are concerned starting cuts will just reintroduce a new inflationary cycle destroying all the work the tightening did.  I think he’s trying to at least show he “cares” about that but in the end, I think it’s mostly to keep the hawks engaged at the table.\n\n3) Williams is hawkish BUT has started to make more comments related to labor market health.  This is probably going to become the more major focus - while the economy is still strong, it won’t mean nothing if unemployment spikes.  I think this is where the Fed’s dual mandate gets interesting.  If unemployment spikes they’ll need to eat the inflationary risks to prevent further labor market damage. The last thing Powell wants to do is get grilled at his next hearing on how they were late to the party and how everyone is out of a job.  This is not the hill he wants to die on.  So he can now at least say “hey we made it known about the inflationary risks BUT we also can’t have 5% of the labor force working behind the Wendys”\n\n4) While Trump has his own campaign fund in DJT, the Fed will want to stay apolitical as much as possible. If they don’t cut in June, it’s going to put them in an awkward position to do a rate cut in Sept or Nov.  If June goes out, there’s a chance of no rate cuts - which is what Morgan Stanley just came out with the other day.  Powell won’t want to have to explain that at the next hearing either.  Blackrock described it best which is “maintenance cuts”. If they keep them to 25bp it gives them the ability to make minor but symbolic impact and still reserve the right to increase them if needed.\n\n5) Rents are trending in the right direction. Out of all the components that provide the Fed the most hesitation - it’s finally making progress. He says they aren’t targeting it specifically but it’s one of the most sticky points and lower rates can help that further once they are comfortable with everything else.\n\nThe consolidated dot plot at least shows overall consensus forming which is great. I think he just needs to do a little more pleading with the hawks so he won’t get raw dogged without lube by Warren at the next hearing over shit she knows nothing about.  He can go into the next hearing to take a victory lap and say they defeated inflation.",
