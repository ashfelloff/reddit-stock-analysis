I told him I didn't want a single penny, but I would make sure  he is setup for the future.\n\nWhen I woke up the next morning he was still gambling. He had $60K left.\n\nHe finally cashed that out, then blew it all within 2 months. He doesn't have a dime to his name now. He's unemployed and broke AF. If you give me $250K right now, I will still have some in 20 years.",
