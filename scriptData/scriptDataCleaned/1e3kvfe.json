      "body": "Good self-reflection. Everyone probably has their own sweet spot. My main stuff is just in an overall index fund.\n\nBut for my ‚Äúcan afford to lose speculative fund‚Äù I invest (gamble) with options. My sweet spot is a mix of 1-3 months out plus some leaps. I intentionally only look at monthly expiration options as there is more open interest and volume therefore better liquidity.\n\nIt‚Äôs tempting to go shorter especially when one of your picks jumps up significantly and you could have gained so much more. But with options, time is your friend. You could be right about a company and direction but off on time and lose everything.",

I do buy some a few months out and also a couple of weekly lottos, but most of the equity is in the leaps.

Either from mistimed, or mis-estimated trades.\n\nMy advice--  Find a good company, with good fundamentals. and add it to your portfolio. then once you have enough shares, find another and another.   Build the wealth first by a buy and hold strategy.  Then play later with options, when you can afford to lose money.",

Doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt need to stay on the companies and watch their fundamentals (financial strength, industry position and competitive advantages, price).  This is why I still take some swing positions.  Meaning I usually retain a stake when I take profits while remaining open to going back in later on a dip.  The reasoning is I put a lot into my dd to find gems and so as long as the fundamentals are still reasonably good, a decent price bump is a good time to harvest some gains. Ultimately though the goal is building the fortress.  I also stick to only about a dozen positions while actively following 20-30x that amount of companies spread over 15-20 sectors.  Also, I hold equities only; no puts, calls, and no margin buys.  That works for me but I can understand how these devices work for others.",
