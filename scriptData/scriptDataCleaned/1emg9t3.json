We've also developed a ton of internal tools around it. \n\nAt the very least, just about every team is using it to generate scripts that save time and has allowed them to run very lean.

Rather, it facilities various ancillary effects that generate income: Touism, business travelers, transportation, ease of access, etc.\n\nBuilding AI infrastructure will take far more than $600 billion. It will take trillions. But in 20 years, the benefit will be exponential. \n\nthis argument is just as dumb as someone saying we shouldn't build out the internet, because the only thing on it is myspace and chatrooms.\n\nI fk'n hate people that are dumb.",
