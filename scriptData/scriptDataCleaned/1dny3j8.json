I put a 30% down on my home and still had major repairs/surprises come off after doing full inspections prior to closing. Likewise, many lenders won’t approve or lend to you at all if you’re asking for a certain percentage of the total cost and can’t meet a minimum downpayment, which is almost certainly considerably higher than 5%. \n\nTo get approved for a mortgage on a 1M home, you need an incredibly solid financial foundation, and with such a foundation I struggle to see why anyone would bother putting *only* 5% if a larger downpayment means lower mortgage and potentially better interest.\n\nOnly caveat being if you can get an FHA loan with a good interest rate. ",

To mortgage a 1M dollar home you’re going to need a rock solid financial foundation and no lender is going to approve a 5% downpayment unless they’re positive you’re not a risky client.\n\nA single cursory google search says that for a 1M dollar home you’d need to make $330k annually, accounting for debts and liabilities, if you’re not intending to be house poor and paying 40-50% of your income solely to your house. \n\nI don’t find it surprising that people on fucking WSB would see having less outstanding debt as a poor financial decision because it forfeits investment opportunity, presumably in TSLA calls, but by all means if you think OP falls into the 300k income range then yeah he forfeited a precious 5% downpayment for his 1M dollar house.",
