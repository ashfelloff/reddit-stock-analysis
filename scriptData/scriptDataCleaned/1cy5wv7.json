That's why I think FX is kind of silly since it's just trading between one devaluing fiat for another. Is it because your algo would only work on FX? Or is it because FX works for you due to your underlying fundamentals that your algo works?",

          "body": "Look forex always has luck involved but , if you learn to identify some patterns you can get more lucky. After that it is just a good risk management strategy that takes you high. People get effed when they win little or risk too much.  Most of the time people who blow their accounts have poor risk management strategy for example will take profits early and let losses go hoping they will reverse. You need to set your stop losses at the point where you give your trade the chance to grow meaning like an adequate stop loss. something like 20 10 points is too little.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xt2fafxsj12d1.png?width=1628&format=png&auto=webp&s=a58004ac4de69a9fe651cb0f2b1103cb46e7c03a\n\nJust the change in spread by the broker will take you out. You got to know brokers can manipulate spreads to their liking so you have to set it in a way that it does not get hit easily. The bigger the stop loss the higher percentage wins. Its direct   correlation, but at the same time don't make it too high cause then the loss will wipe out all the wins. Think of a strategy with a good stop loss that you know 7 out of 10 times will give you a win. You can scale on that.\n\nThen always backtest it and live test it on demo before going live. This will give you confidence and keep your emotions out of it. like look this trade i have on right now . I can take profit right away but I wont because if i keep getting greedy i would have been out of this trade at 2k but now its at 5k, because i backtested my strategy, I know it will be better to keep trailing it at a distance that spread doesnt hit my stop loss easily and will give me good chances at bigger profits. So this is just some beginner advice of course there is much more to it but practive will get you there.\n\nAlso always have a bot to lock in profit some times when volatility is high you cant be quick enough manually to adjust stop losses to capture profits need a bot for that 100 percent.",
