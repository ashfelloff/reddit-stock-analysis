Have been watching from the sidelines but curious to understand and explain if I am wrong:\n\nThere’s short interest, people buy up shares to make shorts out of the money so they have to buy shares to close their positions before getting burned worse which drives up the price because retail whales aren’t selling. \n\nCompany experiencing the short squeeze is in actual financial trouble and so they decide to allegedly collude with the funds that were shorting them by issuing new shares at prices at trading value so that shorts can exit their position cheaper and the struggling company can profit off the money of the issued shares, more shares flood the market, and anyone without a stop loss who bought near top will hold bag as the shorts and retail whales exit their positions?",
