  "selftext": "NASDAQ just approved SNDL’s acquisition of U.S. Assets in multiple states through its Sunstream USA Partnership. Parallel and Skymint acquisitions were approved by NASDAQ this morning. \n\nThe White House will most likely approve marijuana as a Schedule III and could open the flood gates for institutional buying without these potential regulatory overhang worries. \n\nSNDL trades well below book value, has no debt, and is cash flow positive. I also own some Cresco and Greenthumb but if you just look at valuation SNDL seems to be trading at 1/3rd ish valuation to some of those U.S. multi state operators when you look at comparable stats. SNDL currently trades at .66 of tangible book value compared to 1.83 for greenthumb.\n\nFrom a valuation standpoint SNDL looks like clear winner but seems like holdings in\nCresco or Charlotte’s Web or something like that could be fruitful. Don’t have stupid suggestions like growgen or msos. What individual marijuana companies do you guys like and what valuation metric draws you there?\n",
