  "selftext": "**I did not have a position going into Carvana’s earnings yesterday, and have never touched the stock. However, after looking deeper into the stock I am convinced this company is going to zero and will be full-porting into the longest dated put options I can buy for the lowest strike price available.** \n\nAs of writing -- Carvana is up 18% today after beating every estimate Wall Street had for this glorified used-car dealership. It currently trades at 60x P/E and has pumped back to deep-covid numbers around hype that the business has finally turned around and tendy-town awaits. \n\nTheir [investor letter](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q2-2024.pdf) echoes the sentiment. The profit turn-around looks like what my portfolio would look like if I took two extra shifts and Wendys before convincing my brother to do the same. \n\n[up bigly](https://preview.redd.it/csr3g6x53zfd1.png?width=427&format=png&auto=webp&s=9053a925cfdd932115cd3b0dd179f382ba05eb69)\n\nAlongside this legendary turnaround have come slews of articles bashing the stock and the fraudster family behind it. I think the bearish thesis is simpler than that – [Carvana is essentially the new WeWork](https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a60257928/carvana-recovery-progresss/) – Marrying “massive back-­office tech with all the old-school logistics and expensive inventory complications of selling used cars on a grand scale” ensuring no real innovation while also sleep-walking into similar macro headwinds that obliterated WeWork. \n\nThere are a couple of reasons why this shit-stock is a ticking timebomb. \n\n1 – Their books are cooked.\n\nOk I know I said I wasn't gonna talk about the fraud but it's pretty bad.\n\nExplained in the daily thread by u/c0de76 they add up the profit from ALL of their types of car sales and report it as their profit per sale, overreporting by about 5-6x\n\nEven after their net income margin is still down .2% QoQ – which is getting gobbled up by a post-restructuring interesting interest maintenance fee that is still ridiculous – [155m$ in interest expenses](https://investors.carvana.com/news-releases/2024/07-31-2024-211018276#:~:text=In%20Q2%202024%2C%20Carvana%20sold,Adjusted%20EBITDA%20of%20%24355%20million) (half of their income this quarter).\n\n2 – Their strategy is built around the linear continuation of horribly unsustainable macro conditions.\n\nA – Inventory \n\nTheir investor letter claims: “we expect to grow retail units sequentially in Q3” motivating increasing spend on new inventory (to “scale”) which is [beginning](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/CVNA/carvana/inventory) to rebound. \n\nProblematically, this means Carvana is operating like the average WSB user – they are buying high into a used car market with numerous headwinds. \n\nNew cars are flooding the market as automakers overreacted to a demand explosion after covid causing a [race-to-the-bottom of incentives and financing](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/25/us-auto-sales-are-expected-to-slow-during-the-second-half-of-2024.html) (this is the same trend that killed almost every automaker’s earnings this quarter).\n\nUsed cars are following – with many consumers finding that NEW CARS are [cheaper ](https://money.com/used-car-prices-driving-down-inflation/)than used cars.\n\nAnd, as the fed cuts rates, Carvana will also get squeezed as they will be able to charge far less for the auto-loans that make up a high percentage of their profit (their inventory is also priced assuming they will continue to charge ridiculous rates).\n\nB – Consumer Stability   \nIt's bad, [demand is cooling](https://www.bernstein.com/our-insights/insights/2024/articles/the-us-consumer-conservatism-not-collapse.html) as savings are cooked and consumers become wary.\n\nCarvana will (almost) literally lend to anyone. The requirements on their website are laughable – [anyone who is 18 and makes $5,100 PER YEAR qualifies ](https://www.carvana.com/help/payment-and-financing/can-i-finance-with-carvana-if-i-have-bad-credit)for a carvana auto loan. This is after they cracked down on their loaning in March. For reference, [The industry standard is 1.5-2.5K PER MONTH, or 5x the annual income on average](https://www.autocreditexpress.com/blog/what-is-the-minimum-income-to-buy-a-car/#:~:text=Minimum%20Income%20for%20a%20Car%20Loan&text=In%20our%20experience%2C%20the%20minimum,programs%20with%20lower%20income%20requirements). \n\nThis comes at a time where [auto delinquencies are high – and only increasing](https://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20240719-us-economic-housing-and-mortgage-market-outlook-july-2024-spotlight#:~:text=The%20largest%20increase%20in%20delinquencies,for%20auto%20loans%20was%207.2%25) (notably higher for those without a mortgage, ie lower income, more likely to buy carvana car).\n\nSimilarly, [Repos are spiking ](https://qz.com/car-repossessions-inflation-interest-rates-1851597051)as post-covid aid is drying up and the job market slows.\n\n3 – Random Other Shady Shit.\n\nCarvana is facing a class-action lawsuit for failing to provide certification for sold vehicles in PA.\n\nGlorious leader GARCIA ERNEST C. II has been dumping shares almost daily.\n\nThey are diluting shares through increasing stock-compensation to employees.\n\nThere are numerous reports of stolen cars being sold drawing questions about their inspections.\n\nTLDR – Carvana is getting fucked on both ends – old buyers cant pay up, new ones dont wanna pay cuz they can get a new car for cheaper, the trend is accelerating now and thus isn’t accounted for by this month’s earnings and is a ticking timebomb for their $10B debt load, which they have to pay $150m+ just to service every quarter. Meanwhile, the owner is dumping millions of dollars of shares on the open market daily.\n\nI think it could take a while, but eventually every fraud collapses and I think car prices and demand falling is the perfect catalyst for that. At the very least, this company is grossly overvalued ATM.\n\nNFA I have no financial or accounting certifications and obviously everything in this post is speculation. ",

Next day, I go to the site and it’s back on the market, so I call them and they say “someone else beat you to it and got it first” I frustrated and feeling insane told them and referenced the confirmation email I already got saying the car is mine! They basically didn’t know what to say, other than “sorry, we sold it to someone else”. Now mind you, this is after they’ve already taken my bank details for the wire, so I’m freaking out thinking this company is a massive scam, and that they took my money and I got nothing. They “reassured” me that the money would not be withdrawn from my account, so at this point I’m like ok, lesson learned, they suck, and unless they try some fraud shit like taking my money, I can move on and look elsewhere for a car. Literally 2 days laters, I kid you not, I get an email saying “congratulations! Your new car is ready for pickup!”….. as if none of that shit had happened. They already told me I wasn’t getting the car, that they sold it to someone else. So I call them 1 final time absolutely furious, and tell them what is going on, and that under no circumstances will I EVER be buying any car from them, and to never email me again, and if they withdraw any money from the wire info I sent them, I would be file a lawsuit.
