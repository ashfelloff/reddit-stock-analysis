US might require AI chips be built in the US. They design and manufacture AI chips. Buy low sell high.\n* Cons**,** Its Intel, they do Intel things. They missed the Mobile boat and sat on their hands for the last decade blowing their CPU lead over AMD. They are over-exposed to x86 an archaic boomer technology. \n\n\\*I know nothing, this is just what I think it's not advice. I own 300 shares in Intel.",
