  "selftext": "Hello fellow regards\n\nTo see my previous post about my TSM YOLO, check the following link: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/0t9kViIxQo\n\nGiven TSM's monthly earnings next week and their quarterly earnings on the 18th, I expect the stock to go higher and print me some tendies. TSM has been consolidating for a month now and it would have prolly scared a lot of paper hands but me, I have üíé hands all over hereüëê. I did roll over some 200/220c into lower SP calls as they were bleeding everyday, but apart from that I have only added to my position so far. Hoping for the stock to end the week on 150, with a good rise next week due to great monthly ER following an uptrend onto the quarterly ER on 18th, from where I hope it will skyrocket into the 180s. What are your thoughts? Will these calls print? Will it be lambo or wendy's?",
