  "selftext": "“A Paramount special committee and the buying consortium — David Ellison’s Skydance, backed by private equity firms RedBird Capital and KKR — agreed to the terms. The deal is awaiting signoff from Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, who owns National Amusements, which owns 77% of class A Paramount shares, Faber said Monday.\n\nWe received the financial terms of the proposed Paramount/Skydance transaction over the weekend and we are reviewing them,” said a National Amusements spokesperson.\n\nThe deal currently calls for Redstone to receive $2 billion for National Amusements, Faber reported Monday. Skydance would buy out nearly 50% of class B Paramount shares at $15 apiece, or $4.5 billion, leaving the holders with equity in the new company.\n\nSkydance and RedBird would also contribute $1.5 billion in cash to Paramount’s balance sheet to help reduce debt.\n\nThe deal will not require a vote from the shareholders, which was part of the negotiations, Faber reported. Paramount’s annual shareholder meeting will take place on Tuesday”\n\nOverall I think this is a good thing for the survival of Paramount as a company but other shareholders are going to be pissed.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/03/paramount-skydance-merger-deal-update.html",

Skydance offers $2B for Shari’s 5% economic and 77% voting stake ($65 per A share) in National amusements, and $4.5B ($15 per share) to the B class.  Shari says yes. These classes have equivalent economic rights. \n\nThat’s straight robbery. Remind me to never invest in a company with multiple share classes.",
