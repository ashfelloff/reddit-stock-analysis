Had all 900 called away from me as it closed a few dollars over that. Instead of waiting for a dip I immediately went 30k deep on puts that expired in Feb of 2020 and watched it bleed to zero...and still had to pay taxes on the \"gains\" of 2019.\n\nTalk about a lesson learned. That said, its almost made me too conservative in my conviction bets now because I don't throw 10's of thousands on options unless they're leaps and even then it's a much smaller position. That has now bit me in the ass because most of my picks are right but I don't take large positions anymore.",
