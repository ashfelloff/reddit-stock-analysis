Here's some DD I posted a couple months ago here, I'll just copypasta it so you don't have to go to the post itself:\n\nFor the 2nd halving, which occurred on July 16th, 2016, it was approximately 284 days before BTC began its bull run. For the 3rd halving, which occurred on May 11th, 2020, it was approximately 161 days before BTC started its bull run (I keep saying \"approximately\" because it's subjective, I picked a date to mark the beginning of the bull run that looked right to *me*, others will have different opinions). This is a reduction in time between halvings and the beginning of a genuine bull run of 43.3%. If we were to see this occur again in 2024, that would mean that there will be 69.7 days between the halving and the beginning of a bull run, placing it around **June 29th, 2024** (presuming the halving occurs on the estimated date of April 20th). Make of this what you will.\n\nNote: we didn't have ETFs, MSTR, and some of the other shit that we do now, when the previous halvings occurred. I don't know what that means, precisely. I would guess that it will reduce the space in between the halving and the next bull run even more, but I don't know that, obviously.\n\nEdit: I didn't bother with the 1st halving because that was so early on that almost nobody knew what bitcoin was, let alone bothered with it.",

What's more is that the decision to approve it was a complete last minute 180 pivot from the SEC caused entirely because the Dems know they can't win an election if they keep suppressing the crypto industry. This is evidenced by the FIT21 vote in the house last week.\n\nAll in all, you've got a massive change in messaging from the government and a market that hasn't had time to price any of it in yet. America is going from one of the most hostile countries to crypto, to full support, and id argue Coinbase is the only company with the expertise, products and (most of all) trust to capitalise on it.\n\nCoinbase will be THE global crypto company imo, and the regulatory landscape just got a lot more friendly",
