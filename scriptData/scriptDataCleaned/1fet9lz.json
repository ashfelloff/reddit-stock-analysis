NVDA was pumping right up until the minute I bought my calls and then immediately went south.   Bought the SPY calls when the pump was slowing down at 548 and I had little confidence that it wasn't setting up to be a bull trap so I stupidly switched sides.   Those SPY calls would have ended the day up 500% +8000 instead I am nursing a -75% 549P and needing World War 3 to start in the next 7 hours to save them.",
