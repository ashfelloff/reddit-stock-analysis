Chart technicals play a big part. What the quote means is generally there is no great sense of urgency in any position or trade. The best trades will simply come to you if you stay patient and focused. Not being emotional and chasing highs. And accepting stop loss if it doesn’t work out fully. There is always another day. \n\nLeverage (margin) is a mans best friend. Money makes money it’s that simple. But I keep 10-20% cap per position (cash value) as a general rule of thumb. Conviction can be higher or lower 5%, or 25%",
