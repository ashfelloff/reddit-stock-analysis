  "selftext": "Disclaimer: i don‚Äôt know anything and am bad at both gambling and investing.\n\nBuuuut there was a pretty good sell off of $HPE around noon EST today, right around the start of the HP Discover trade show keynote feat. Mr. Nvidia himself. I fully planned to sell the news myself, but alas I forgot. Last week Apple stock did the same thing during/after the keynote at wwdc, then raged the next two days.\n\nI get that enterprise AI servers are not as sexy as Ai iPhones, but as someone who knows nothing about IT infrastructure, it still sounds like kind of a big deal. Not to mention that any news that puts your ticker in the same article as Nvda is probably a good thing.\n\nSo. Do we think HP could gain on Thursday/Friday after everyone has had a full day to read the headlines?",
