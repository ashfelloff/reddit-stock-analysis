  "selftext": "Great time to buy SPY. It has strong indicators of being oversold in the short term. It has hit the Bollinger low and the short/mid term channel lows that I drew.\n\nI predict it will be bullish for the next two weeks and break over $525, unless some extreme bearish news comes out.\n\nPositions: $525 SPY Calls 5/17, will sell once in the money",
