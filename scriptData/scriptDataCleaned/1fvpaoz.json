You absolutely could argue its a pyramid scheme. 20 people work to push numbers up to one person, who then pushes them up to another and so on.\n\nBut after that first manager, it becomes a manager, managed by a manager, who is managed by a manager, who is managed by a manager. Each of these managers, manages at most 4 people. And this shit STARTS at L4 level. Once you hit L5 the number of people actually working with others drops to almost nothing.\n\nMost managers in my department sit in meetings half the day.\n\nThey seem to actively refuse to fix problems or even listen to ideas to fix problems. Instead they are hyper focused on bad ideas, that cause more issues.\n\nThe real goal of the managers here for the last 4 years has been to undermine the US, in the hopes to be able to hire everyone in HYD, and then they can sit in the US and remote manage a team of people thats not even in their country. \n\nBut they only have themselves to blame, since there was NO oversight for like 5 years, and they already admitted to bloated hiring under Covid. The managers just kept nepo hiring outside friends that were morons looking to bolster their resume.\n\nMost managers last just a couple years, enough time for the little circle jerk of the management pool to get some resume building and then jump to another team or company.\n\nBut thats cause all these HR people are connected and just moving from one spot to the next bringing their loser friends with them.",

We worked 29 out of the 31 days that we were there and we had to work double shifts equaling 12 hours. They moved us around to different facilities that would swap between day shifts and night shifts so your sleep schedule was completely trash. \n\nI came back and quit 3 months later as soon as I had another job lined up and never looked back. I respect anyone that can put up with that BS as a full time job.",

Only two of those managers are capable of doing the work. The other managers just walk around, harass customers for credit cards when corporate is near, tell other associates what to do especially when they are already doing it for some reason, and abuse the associates. They don't do any real work and never bring anything substantial to the table. The only time we approach those managers is when we have clerical or informational problems. In other words, their jobs could be done by replacing them with an electronic kiosk in each department that is capable of submitting scheduling changes and answering technical questions about the job.

In my experience, leaders generally operate on their own perceived \"good judgment\". As a c suite leader, if you already have a goal in mind, and are dead set on proving it out, it's actually pretty easy to do so when you have teams of consultants you can hire and cherry pick how the data is analyzed and presented and your conclusions from the data. Just because someone's done their homework doesn't necessarily always mean what they want is irrefutable good. It's not so black and white when it comes to \"data\", especially when there is no transparency.",

L5's are the next ones who actually run things and they are slaves, constantly connected and basically do not have actual time off. They are who you go to as a grunt if you actually need something done. But hard to get a hold of as you're usually in the trenches. I do not know what L6's and 7's do other than get reports from L5's and tell them they need to lower headcount and increase volume moved.\n\nTo make it a thousand times more complicated, this is just at my current facility. Others can be run completely differently. There is very little in the way of hard set corporate standards for how things are done beyond the normal rules like conduct in the workplace (ie: respect, harassment, discrimination).\n\nI'm certain somebody who makes a great deal of money should know where cuts should be made, but I have no idea how they could possibly figure it out.",

Now you have…unguided junior graduates…and 50 year old VP’s. Happy now you’re never getting promoted? Happy now that the only way for the average person to rise through the ranks and get paid more has been removed? \n\nHonestly…I have to remind myself that the average Redditor doesn’t even work in a proper company when I read these comments sometimes.",
