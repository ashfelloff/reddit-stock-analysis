Until we have quantum computers proper that can simulate problems with more than an infinite number of bits like the human brain can (cardinality of the continuum, as proven by the Lucas-Penrose theorem), computers will always be intractible at things we can do with intuition like finding whole number solutions to Diophantine equations which is NP-hard, and conjecturally all NP-hard problems are equivalent to Diophantine equations.\n\nMeanwhile we humans are always solving Lagrangians and path integrals that would cripple a computer everytime we take the shortest path to our car or plan our day.  Traveling Salesman Problem is a good example of this.  Ordinary computers are just faster with a narrow class of problems based on arithmetic.",
