                      "body": "The S&P may pull back a bit in the near-ish term before heading higher, but there is something like a 70% chance it finishes the year at an ATH.\n\nATHs are most likely on the way between October and January. Just based on historical data, same for BTC. \n\nIf you are looking for a near-term gain of hundreds of percent, nobody has a crystal ball.\n\nDo some research on what kind of stocks should perform best during this part of the cycle, narrow down some stocks and look at their financial performance (check out stockanalysis.com and you can pull up most stocks recent years financial statements for free) , look at analyst forecasts, and go from there as a starting point.\n\nRates cuts are coming which favours cyclical and small-medium value stocks with low forward P/Es, but S&P and even tech stocks should do well IMO.\n\nWhen companies release earnings, remember what was going on in the period they are reporting. If a company is going to report strong Christmas sales numbers, those won‚Äôt show up until the spring reports.\n\nEdit : I just realized I wrote spring. It‚Äôs really more like a few weeks into January or early Feb depending on the company. Not quite spring lol. But what I meant was, don‚Äôt buy 2024 options hoping for a Christmas sales boost.\n\nJust my 2 cents. If you can get a sense of the macro environment, and feel out which way things are probably headed in the short term, you can buy calls for 6-9 months down the road at a discount right now, compared to what they will cost closer to those companies reporting awesome earnings. \n\nThey also decay slower.\n\nIf you want to buy daily options, particularly on earnings days, sure you can make bank, but you can also go broke real quick. For the most part doing that is just gambling.\n\nIf anything was a guarantee, you would never find contracts for $0.20. Wise investors don‚Äôt dump a lot of money into something so risky.\n\nAll of this is my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. But just trying to help.",

Again for the same reason.\n\nMake sure to look at the volume and open interest. I won‚Äôt touch an option with less than 1000 for open interest, or with very little volume (unless I‚Äôm willing to exercise the option at some point, or it‚Äôs for a heavily traded stock and it‚Äôs just a very far away date, so not many people are trading it yet).\n\nHigher volume and open interest will allow you to get in and out easier if you change your mind or want to exit the position. \n\nYou don‚Äôt want to be stuck in a losing position and nobody is trading those options so you can‚Äôt get out of it. Which isn‚Äôt a big deal on major stocks and index ETFs. But something like a tiny company can be more difficult to trade in and out of without paying a big spread.",

Think like a more drawn out \"2020 covid crash\", maybe into next spring.  I wouldn't be at all surprised at a 30% drop into next year before the inevitable pile of save-the-market Fed money sends the S&P (and inflation) back up again for another year or two, like 2020-2021.  Just my opinion here too, from much study. \n\nI personally wouldn't touch any index long options the rest of this year, just way too much risk potential at present. I would consider a small index short if the setup presents itself though, expecially small cap like IWM, but keyword being small. \n\nI do think precious metals and miners are the next sector to see rotation into a big run quite shortly, the setup is certainly there, and I'm positioned for it with LEAPS (long dated call options).",

It was an outlier event, which makes me lean to this being an outlier cutting cycle.\n\nYou can find arguments for all kinds of scenarios, and nobody can know with any certainty what will happen, you just have to make your best judgement.\n\nI lean bullish. That‚Äôs my bias though.\n\nBut as far as the S&P goes‚Ä¶\n\nAnytime the S&P has risen 15% in the first half of the year, about 70-75% of the time it finishes the year up 20%+ (though it usually does have 1 or 2 pull backs along the way, we‚Äôve already had one so far, we may get another).\n\nEither way, it‚Äôs not a bad idea to hedge if you could be wrong with whatever you believe.
