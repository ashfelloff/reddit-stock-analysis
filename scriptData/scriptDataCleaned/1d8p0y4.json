The issue of culture is very interesting, if I may add some of my own thoughts on culture being subjective, to what extent does a culture develop to the point of being meaningful? Europe obviously has history, still standing history that one can experience and touch and visit, but is in and of itself culture?  Do the unique social constructs of the American south, northeast, Midwest or west not have a distinct cultural DNA that make them just as unique as any from Europe? even if they they are only 200 years old? the people of Stonehenge were marvelous and their buildings a re cool and are a part of British history, but one could hardly make the argument that they are related to their current culture, in so far as they are not more meaningful than a pre-packaged export sold to tourists.",

                                          "body": "Again, I would prefer to not further discuss \"culture\" as brought up by OP since I consider it a highly subjective and contentious topic where - ultimately - any form of discussion would probably prove a fruitless endeavour. What is even \"culture\"? Are those correct that claim that the US has no \"culture\"? Are people correct who say modern \"culture\" is mainly driven by the US? Is modern \"pop culture\" to be considered \"culture\"? I think answers to those questions are all highly contentious and ultimately (probably?) subjective: to give an example, I think that music after Mozart (in general) went downhill. Yes, that includes Beethoven. But is this a generally applicable concept? (Probably?) hardly so.\n\nBut if you use descriptions of culture that are generally agreed on, I think it is trivial that Europe has more to offer in terms of \"culture\" than the US (the same applies to China and other countries of the Old World). These countries simply had way (!) more time in history with some sort of civilization. Unless you think the US is exceptional at the rate it can generate \"culture\", it simply did not have the time to generate the similar amount of culture that other countries did. There hundreds and even thousands of years that separate modern US from these other regions. The US just did not have the time to generate figures like Plato, Aristotle, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Dürer, Händel, Mozart, etc. etc. etc.  \nAnd if you want some direct examples (except for obvious contributions like the \"tons\" of music and art produced in those past days - without even mentioning the respective architecture) think about Roman Law. Even (!) today it is still the (direct or indirect) base of most legal systems around the globe outside of the Anglo-Saxon world (even in modern China!). That is something the US - given its age - could simply not achieve. Time will tell, whether it will so in the next few thousand years. But at the moment that is simply not the case. And we did not even begin to speak of the influence of enlightenment on modern thinking...\n\nSo no, I think the answer is trivial if you accept certain assumptions (which are also shared by most people around the world). If you do not, the exercise is subjective and futile.  \nThat is not to denigrate the local culture of the US - but simply the available time makes it impossible for the US to compete in this field. And, if I may say so - it does not need to, the US has other qualities, some of them probably gained exactly by that \"lack\" of culture and history.",
