      "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nr/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.\n\nPolitics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.\n\nStill, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Rantings and rambling of a man who woke up too early below. \n\nAs someone who has worked a variety of schedules, with 2-3 jobs and throwing post secondary into the mix, the position the other user described is significantly more optimal than having multiple jobs. 9 am to 11 is 14 hour days. And they are getting a morning on Sunday in. Taking trades jobs as a comparison, you might work 7-7 as a tradesman, and you’d do so for up to three weeks a time. You’re making good money, but it isn’t 250+ and it also doesn’t wind down. The work is the same as time goes on.\n\nThe equivalent to that with multiple jobs would be needing to finesse a daily schedule to accommodate multiple jobs. You wouldn’t have Sunday off, or reduced at all. And the types of jobs you’d have wouldn’t be good either. \n\nYou’re also not getting anything for future investment doing that. People work a lot harder to come out with a lot less when they start their own companies up. To say 1/4 mil a year grinding isn’t impressive is……. Extremely naive. Considering that time pays in dividends- literally. Those people go on to have extremely minimal shifts, or outright retire before 30. \n\nYou actually can’t compare it to having multiple jobs unless you’re talking about guys who manage to juggle a couple full time remote positions that actually do pay 100+, and while those do exist, it’s not as common as over employed forums would suggest.\n\nThe numbers literally don’t even add up either. All those jobs are doing are trading time scrolling reddit in the toilet and couch with doing more research and work and getting paid instead of gambling here. \n\nThats all not even touching the fact these positions are paying over 100 right out the gate. His comment was a 250 + compensation two years in. A position one would have fresh out of school when they are 21-23. That absolutely is impressive and only someone on wsb could think it weren’t. \n\nLike, that’s in 4 years what the average American makes in 15 to 20 lol. That’s also not touching on the point that he’s referencing numbers from a decade ago. \n\nYou look at some of these positions now, and you’re at half a mil compensations after a few years. I remember seeing some discourse with companies needing to provide salary ranges on job ads, and the guy was talking about having to put wild ranges like 30-300k starting because the job compensation isn’t just straight dollar per hour. Theres so much commission and performance bonus available. They can’t use what most people will make, they have to use what the worst, least motivated worker could possibly make, by doing the absolute bare minimum, and they can’t put 0 because they have to pay minimum wage or the companies lowest scale pay for 3 hours a day. \n\nSo no, no one’s just making equivalent money by having multiple jobs. If they were, there’d effectively be no more slums in America.",
