The move was driven by heavy investments in A.I. infrastructure, including data centers, chip designs and research and development costs.”\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/24/technology/metas-profits-nearly-double-while-spending-on-ai-rises.html\n\n",

I’m not faulting Meta for inventing the metaverse. \n\nThe key is knowing when to walk away and divert funds to new projects though. Everyone loves their recent push into the AI space. That should become RealityLab’s main focus tbh. AI chatbots, advertising algorithms, etc that can be deployed across all their social apps. Instead they’re choosing to spend more time, money, and talent on building out a Roblox rip-off looking world with personal avatars than they are on all their other pipeline projects combined.  The VR metaverse is their windows phone or google glass moment, but Zuck isn’t getting the hint, and as a long time Meta shareholder, it sucks watching dollars being frivolously wasted. $50B could’ve bought OpenAI 10 times over. It could’ve bought a cloud business like Snowflake or Palantir if they wanted to compete on that front. It’s an insane amount of money they’ve sunk into a project (and continue to sink into said project) and they have nothing to show for it.",
