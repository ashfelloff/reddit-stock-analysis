  "selftext": "So let me get this straight. After a bombastic quarterly report that may contain a faint hint towards a slight slow down the stock crashes and loses 12%. But when the CEO makes a side comment that they are actually doing great it goes back up 8%?\n\nIs this a meme stock now? Are we back into the Elon Musk market manipulation territory again or what the heck is going on? I, genuinely, don't get it.",

If the price is too high the puts they sold will be OTM and they would keep all the oremium but the calls they sold will make them lose money,  maybe even more than the premium they made on the puts.\n\nIf the market would absorb the same ammount of calls and puts at all strike prices then, yes, the MM would have no interest in which direction the price goes. But for very popular stocks like Nvidia there is a huge imbalance in how many calls and how many puts are sold and at what prices, making the sweet spot go one way or the other. \n\nIf the price of the stock is 100$ but there are more puts at strikes 105, 115, 120 then calls and more calls at 130, 135, 140 then puts,  then it is beneficial for the MM to have the price go up above 120 and wipe out all of them. Yes they will lose money on the calls that they sold at 105, 110, 115 but if the imbalance is big enough it is worth it for them to do it.",
