Then and even now Burry has a strong foundation in value investing based on Graham/Dodd/Buffett styles of analysis. Even now he runs a long biased hedge fund in *Scion Asset Management*. He's best known for his big bet against the US housing market bubble but almost lost it all because he was too early (multiple years. Ahh yes, now I see why OP feels they are like Burry. Those 0DTE trades on SPY $600 calls weren't WRONG. Just a few year early.). \n\nAnd here we have a OP who somehow made the frontpage (makes me question the state of the sub) by saying he's a regard while incorrectly comparing himself to MB.
