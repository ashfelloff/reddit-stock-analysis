Major decisions have been made in very short timelines with motivations that are both not clearly visible to the public and against apparently apparently go against conventional wisdom given the available public information (I e.

Additionally, hastily made decisions seem to sometimes be reversed and sometimes not.\n\nEffectively, I think the \"average course\" of what they will do is predictable but you should anticipate major unexpected deviations from that on this and every other issue",

It doesn’t just stop at semiconductors for CPUs/AI but lithium and other minerals for EVs, etc. \n\nNows a good time to bet on US dollar and businesses (Kroger, Costco, McDonalds…). I would also consider shorting war stocks in the near future. These are all guesses based on the sentiment of the next administrations policies… whether they achieve their stated priorities is the gamble us as investors take.

You find someone to shape it the way you need.  You find a glass manufacturer.  You find a source for finishing nails, right here in the USA.\n\nBut the last thing you need is an adhesive of some sort.  And they don't make the one you need in the United States, it literally doesn't exist, there's nothing suitable for the cost.\n\nHow does a tariff on that adhesive encourage you to buy local if it isn't even made locally?  How does a tariff help you if it's just increasing the price of a product that you literally can't source in the United States because nobody manufactures it here?\n\nA lot of the things that Trump wants to put tariffs on *are not manufactured here.*  Even if a company decided they wanted to take up those mantles...it takes years, maybe even a decade to fully build out an industry and integrate it with existing supply chains.  How many companies can afford to take a 20 or 30% hit to their bottom line for half a decade while they hope that suppliers decide to make things here?",

Meaning prices will inflate.  \n\nI don't think anyone understands how quickly the standard of living in the US will drop when you look at all of Trump's plans.\n\n1) Deport a boat load of illegals - who play a HUGE part of the construction and food sectors - Higher prices for food and housing.  \n2) Tariff Chinese imports - Higher prices  \n3) Eliminate over time - Lower income  \n4) Eliminate major government programs - Higher costs for consumers to replace privately\n\nTell me what in there is good for the people that voted for Trump.  \n\nThe REAL solution to all these problems isn't taxing Chinese imports.  It's increasing taxes on the folks who are extracting the money from their current situation.  That's how you help the people who actually voted for Trump.  The only people that benefit from these policies are the ones that ALREADY have more money than they need.  \n\nI find it ironic that no one really caught onto the fact that corporate profits were at all time highs during the inflationary period we had.  Infact profits rose even faster than inflation.  I did see a study that showed something like 60% of the 'inflation' we saw when right to corporate profits.

They are part of something called a 'platform' which is a series of promises a candidate makes to get elected.  If you want to look at ONE policy in isolation, fine, get lost in a myopic and misguided analysis.  When you do due diligence on an investment you don't just look at ONE number, you look at the whole picture.  If you can't see why that's important and relevant here...",

You don't want to argue about Trump you claim yet you sit there and try to justify his platform wrt tariffs and completely miss the picture.  I'm not going to short TSMC.  The only people getting hurt by these tariffs will be consumers.  Companies will just put their data centers in other countries that don't have the tariffs.  TSMC will be just fine.  Anyone outside the states will be just fine.  Americans will be the only ones to see the actual impacts of this... but I'm sure your book covered that.",
