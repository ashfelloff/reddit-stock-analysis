Not sure how those plays were “going against the crowd” but that seems like a bad idea unless going against WSB crowd.\n\nAsk yourself this while you still have the 150k, how much better would your life be not worrying about all this (if you don’t need it right now, stick it in 4% bond or an ETF) \n\nThen think how your life would be if that goes to 0 trying to make back that 100k you lost. If your life won’t change losing that 150k then go ahead and try to SLOWLY make back the 100k",

For Ex: I bought TSLA $180 CALL 12/20/24 when Tesla was at $175, but guess what Tesla tanked to $138 in a week or so, I didn't touch the position as I had time till 12/20. Now, Today my position was in the money, I booked the $1500 profit. Had I panicked and sold I would've lost $2k. This is just an example how patience, TA and Long time frames works. I don't take positions everyday, I am a swing trader and look for 2-3 weeks to close the position.\n\nIf you put $250K with this strategy you can make $6-10K a month on a consistent basis. When you don't have positions you get 5% interest on parked money. Let the snowball roll.",

Options knowledge is going to make up about 3% of your trading success. The other 97% is made up of a combination of risk management, knowledge of the market, mental fortitude and luck,\n\nAt the end of the day, options trading is about finding mispriced options and then designing a strategy around that. Since all of the inputs of the options pricing models are known (let's just assume we use the BSM), the only unknown is volatility. If the options chain shows one IV but our forecasted volatility is different, then we have a plan.\n\nHere's the catch...forecasting volatility is extremely difficult because you need to know something that the rest of us don't. You also need a longer timeframe for your thesis to play out. You pick short DTE's and play earnings. These are essentially binary events except your probability of profit is not even 50/50 despite what most ray getards in this room think, Theta fucks you every single time.\n\nSo no, just because you can make a spread doesn't mean you are smart or will be rich. If that were the case, every dickslapper in r/wsb would be making money.\n\n  \nSource: Been trading for 20 years and been lucky enough to still be in the game.",
