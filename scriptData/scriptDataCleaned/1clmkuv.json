          "body": "Ages ago, on the Nightly Business Report with Paul Kangus, on PBS, I recall Paul Kangus saying something like \"And the stock market was down a little over a percent today in reaction to increased prices for orange juice futures as weather is forecast to reduce this year's harvest of oranges in Brazil,\" and I thought to myself that even if the world's supply of orange juice was reduced to a third of what it was the previous year would that really cause an entire percent decrease in the world's economic production and economy?  Less BOGO deals and coupon for OJ, okay, I get that, but percent, an entire percent decrease in the world economy?  So, since then, here is how I figure it goes:  IF there is no significant news for a day, Powell says nothing, nobody reports surprise earnings or losses, nobody starts a war or anything like that, then it all comes down to a bunch of guys on Wall Street having an early morning breakfast together before hitting their offices, and if the one thing they talked about was how they heard it's going to be bad surfing weather in California today, then they start the day with \"Surf's down, SELL, SELL, SELL!\" and that day the entire market ends up going down half a percent, BUT if there is no other news and everybody likes Elon Musk's brand new fancy hairdo, then it's \"Elon is looking sharp, BUY, BUY, BUY!\" and the entire market goes up a percent or so for the day.  So, if you could just get in on having breakfast with the right group of young financial punks on Wall Street, maybe you could make a fortune trading on the otherwise no-news days just by gauging their mood for the day based on what in the world it is that they are up or down about each morning.  That's why it's always going to be the Wall Street guys in the breakfast club who get to make the money on that tiny wobble in the stock market from day-to-day, constantly.  But if you are just a tiny investor at home, like in Florida where I am, I can strike any idea of making money day trading off of my list and am better off just investing long on what I think are the best values and best bets for future growth.  Other than what is actually really big news, which you don't get to know before everybody else anyway, you just can't win on timing because that day-to-day wobble thing is all gauged by the Wall Street breakfast club, and no matter whether they realize it or not, so that's who gets to profit from the wobble.  But if you could just have breakfast with just the right group of young Wall Street trading punks, and each day just figure out if they are going to be in more of a \"BUY, BUY, BUY\" or \"SELL  SELL SELL\" mood when the markets open, well then you could make a fortune off of that day trading and that wobble, but that's never going to happen, so just aim to be a good DD long investor, and not a stock \"trader.\"",
