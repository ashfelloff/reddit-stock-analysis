  "score": 54,
  "selftext": "I have had some LUNR calls and was shocked when I saw LUNR start rising unexpectedly, especially during this red day. My initial assumption was that some insiders got the news that LUNR was given the NSNS contract from NASA and artificially lowered the price of the stock so they could buy at a low and then sell when the news was released. However, my assumptions were false and the spike today was due to a collaboration with Imagine Dragons and Bethesda.\n\n\"Imagine Dragons will also team up with¬†Bethesda Games Studio, for a live debut of their track, ‚ÄúChildren of the Sky (A Starfield Song).‚Äù Additionally, the track ‚Äúwill be transmitted back to Earth from the surface of the Moon as part of Lonestar‚Äôs Freedom Mission flying with Intuitive Machines to the South Lunar Pole in early 2025,‚Äù per a release\"\n\nSource: [https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/imagine-dragons-live-debut-starfield-160000275.html](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/imagine-dragons-live-debut-starfield-160000275.html)\n\nThis with NSNS contract news that can drop any day now will most likely increase LUNR stock to unseen heights. In addition, I think space stocks are going to be the new A.I. stock in the coming years because both political candidates support space travel and expansion. Furthermore, when the Artemis II goes off it will generate public awareness (Manned flyby missions) which could mean more investments into space.  Artemis II is expected to launch in September 2025 so a lot of time to start investing. Lastly, Artemis III will launch in September 2026 and it will be the first crewed landing since Apollo 17. Apollo 11 had 650 million viewers so imagine how much viewership Artemis III will bring especially when more people will have access to watch it and the fact we have not stepped on the moon like 50 years. As always, this is not financial advice, and go LUNR!!!!",
