This is a longer time span then tesla's march 2020 to january 2021, but that 10x move is still there. we're sitting just slightly higher then a 10x at current prices from $130.\n\nAlso, NVDA JUST ran nearly 45% in a singular month, 80% in 2 months, all on the back of a stellar earnings report, raised guidance, and a stock split.\n\nOn the one hand, NVDA's run is significantly more believable then teslas, since NVDA's products will touch almost all industries on the planet and clearly electric cars didnt.\n\nOn the other, NVDA is a much higher market cap then tesla was at the peak, so it will take more and more capital to move the stock up meaningfully.\n\nThat hype could very well fade at any moment, and I could easily see the stock pulling back at a minimum of 10% just because it ran so hard so fast.\n\nI think we fall back to $120 within the next month, at the very least to $125.\n\nAll it will take for this fall is the first bearish news for tech or all of the market. NVDA imho is like a hyper-leveraged SPX, it moves very quick to the downside when the market pulls back, but moves higher faster when it goes up.\n\nAnd if you think that's not at all possible, the stock fell from 975 to 760 before the stock split back in march. It can easily retrace even more at these levels, imho as much as 25% but no less then at a minimum like 7%. More realistically like 15% though.",
