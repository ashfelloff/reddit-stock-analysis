The joke is, there's no US bases that Taiwan could even pay for like Korea or Japan do for the bases in their countries, and Taiwan already buys a ton of weapon systems from the USA, 19 billion dollars is a lot for such a small nation. The whole rhetoric shows Trump has no clue on the topic.\n\nThe only good thing here, that's  why I am not overly worried holding TSMC, is that China's current and near future military capabilities really won't allow for any invasion. China could probably take Kinmen just off their coast, maybe Penghu archipelago in the middle of the strait, which are all islands that belong to Taiwan and are strategically important and would need to be taken first.  But the island Taiwan is a tough call for China militarily, and any sanctions on energy and material imports would be crippling the Chinese economy, think coal from Australia or an imposed oil embargo from middle east. The Chinese have been good in playing a very long game (like they did in Hong Kong), it's much easier to do hybrid warfare and wait for a China friendly party to come to power.",
