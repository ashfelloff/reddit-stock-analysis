You've got Jun 21 puts (not even 60 days) priced at -40% or more just to break even. So your max profit is, at most, 1.5x, and that's assuming the stock *completely evaporates* in 50 days, which ain't happening.\n\nHell, right now a $47.50 Jun 21 put is $22.30. That's a breakeven at $25.20, - 53%. In order for that to *break even* day-to-day, you'd need a 1.26% drop every single day (recognizing that the $ drop slows down as the price goes down). Any day that doesn't drop 1.26% is a loss, *and* makes the rest of the trip require bigger drops to keep up.\n\nMan, if I had the cash to cover those puts, I'd probably be doing what you're doing. The main risk is that the money only lasts while DJT himself stays in. Soon as he has to cash out (say, to pay a very large court fine), it's all joever.",

This is not about an election. It's a straight up financial scam that was suggested to him by a couple of \"Apprentice\" contestants from the past and they gave him a majority position so that he would use it as his platform. The additional awards were contractual based on the stock staying above some level for some period of time. Trump himself hasn't put in any money as far as I know but has a controlling interest, a hand picked board and a pet CEO.\n\nWhoever is buying this ill-liquid POS stock can drive up the price pretty easily because of the relatively small float and lack of institutional holdings. The only difficult part of the scam is to time the sales of the stock so that it doesn't adversely impact the sale price. In the end it's probably next to worthless, but trump and his cronies will want to phase in the \"dump\" part of this pump-and-dump to maximize their gains. Expect a dog fight among them as they all try to game the selling strategy.",
