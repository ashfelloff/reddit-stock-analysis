  "selftext": "Look im not going to give you some boring DD, y'all can find it yourself, but in a nutshell they have the same business model as SpaceX (only other company) They make satellites/spacecraft, make the components, launch them, sell everything together or separately.\n\nThis DD is the real reason why you should be invested in RKLB\n\nTheir fucking CEO is a REAL Autist.\n\nPeter Beck, born in New Zealand was not your typical high school student. He started building weird fucking shit like bicycles with rockets on them and jetpacks\n\n[https://x.com/jawwwn\\_/status/1784627639657087474](https://x.com/jawwwn_/status/1784627639657087474)\n\nThen he started working at a tool shop for a year.\n\nNo daddy money, no university, nothing, then said fuck it and dropped out to create one of the biggest rocket companies in the world RocketLab\n\nWith abouseltely 0 money, unlike Elon musk, and other billionaires like Jeff Bezos (who's blue origin is currently failing massively) and Richard Branson (who's company recently went bankrupt)\n\nNow Peter Becks Rocketlab company is about 6 months-1year away from launching its biggest rocket yet to compete in a bigger market, with their other Space businesses booming (70% YOY growth for their satellite businesss, in which they make satellites and sell components to other comanies)\n\nTLDR\n\nMy money is on Peter Beck, a die hard rocket fan who against all odds, 0 money, 0 schooling, is whooping the billionaire competition and going against spacex, with there company growing exponentially the last couple years\n\nCheers and here's some of my favourite Peter Beck Clips\n\n[Peter Becks First Launch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlMFit6nd6I)\n\n[Peter Beck as a young man with 0 experience convincing venture capitalists to invest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE9wrNAoynA)\n\n[Peter Beck eating a physical hat lol](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sQ9xLufD4ls)",
