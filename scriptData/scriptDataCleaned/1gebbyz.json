Here's the basic rundown of my strategy:\n\n1. stocks only go up\\*\n\n2. when stocks go up calls go up more\\*\\*\n\n3. hold calls for at least 1 year (LEAPS) to pay less on capital gains tax\n\n  \\* usually\n\n  \\*\\* sometimes\n\nNow that we have the best strategy to maximize our gains we should also take a few steps to minimize our  losses. No matter how many gains you get it's all over if you multiply by 0 a single time. The best way to avoid that is with diversification.\n\nfour-step diversification process:\n\n1. buy calls on etfs instead of stocks so any one company can't bankrupt you\n\n2. buy different etfs WITH LOW CORRELATION. I considered hedging QQQ with SPY but...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi0kdnskpjxd1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e4283533b12dc738964d3e619aa7ef37593bd1\n\nit wouldn't be much of a hedge at all at .84 correlation. Instead I went with XLP:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4xsm39ppjxd1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f977779a87e372d3f2668c2f393b1274e204e1d\n\n3. buy calls at different expiration dates so you don't get blown up by one freak event (like March 2020)\n\n4. leave some money \"on the sidelines\" (in QQQ shares) so you can still buy the dip if stocks go down or sideways for 2 or more years\n\nWith those rules in mind the two etfs I picked were QQQ and XLP as the LEAPS offerings were pretty limited on Robinhood 6 years ago and these two backtested the best given my strategy.  \n\n\n\"Show all time\"\n\nRobinhood's all time chart sucks and makes it look like I started with 160k in 2018. I actually started with 3k and made steady deposits every few months since then.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fimq74iqjxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=866eadc4b89dbfa6040c708247a0db8f83ef600d\n\nIf you wanted to see the real %return of my strategy over the past 6 years you would have to track every buy, sell, deposit, and withdrawal so you could adjust the % gains based on my total cost basis at the time... which I attempted here: [Supplemental Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/lightStoleMyName/comments/1geawok/an_attempt_at_adjusting_total_return_for_deposits/)\n\nIn the end it was more like +350% all time for a 27% average annual return. Compared to QQQ shares in the same timeframe (+160% for 15% annual) it's not half bad. Compare it to TQQQ on the other hand (+390%) and yeah maybe I'm just massively over-complicating the process of getting leverage. As expected QQQ calls outperformed by a lot accounting for 180k of my gains but my underperforming XLP calls (just 78k of gains) are the price I pay for being a wuss.\n\nBelow is the screenshot after selling everything that was up for long term gains cuz I know you're supposed to sell for a gain post. The QQQ calls are staying a litter longer because technically I bought them on Oct 27 but the dividend event makes robinhood mark them as Dec 28th so I wanna be real sure they won't miss-categorize them as short term capital gains before I sell. I reached out to customer support at 10:00AM and they'll \"check with the back office team and email me within the hour\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo2x3mq4tjxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0563852d35c888d7b4a7557a2bc411ab98b99f04\n\nTLDR: everyone is a genius in a bull market and this is just one way of getting leverage, but it's my way and I like it.",
