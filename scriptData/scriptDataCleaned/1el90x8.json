  "selftext": "For ages, the rates from the Bank of Japan have sat at -0.1%.  That is, until March, when they finally decided to raise by 0.2%. Shocking absolutely no one, life went on. SPY even had an amazing bull run.\n\nYet last week, the bank of Japan raised the rates by 0.15%, and the market began its sudden downward march. And Monday morning, we woke up to an event so remarkable that the media has collectively settled on the name Black Monday. \n\nMany wallstreetbets users found their favorite brokers, such as Schwab, Fidelity, Wells Fargo, RobinHood, and Vanguard glitching and stopping them from panic selling. Looks like everyone woke up, tried to log in, and these brokers could not deal with the spike in traffic. Just want to point out: Interactive Broker worked fine through this mess.\n\nThe lay explanation for the panic goes like this: A bunch of people borrowed cheap money from Japan, converted borrowed Yen to USD, and used that money to buy US equities. When the bank of Japan raised the rates, these people received a margin call and were forced to sell their equities to pay back some of the money. \n\nSo if I were to assume this is what's happening right now, it makes me wonder just how much of Japan's free money has made its way overseas, and how deep of an effect it has had on our markets.\n\nBut why now? Why did a 0.15% interest rate hike cause a massive selloff, but a 0.2% rate hike back in March did not?\n\nI am still skeptical about this narrative. The media tends to pick up random narratives that the analysts put out. Then all the media outlets copy each other and the narrative gets repeated until the sources are lost, and any information of value gets lost. But it also shows how easy it could be for hedge funds to manipulate the market by putting out statements and having the media distort and amplify their message.\n\nUSD relative to YEN had begun losing value since July 11. And by the time of the interest rate decision, USD/YEN lost 5% of its value. Since the rate decision USD/YEN has lost another 5% in value. So it supports the narrative that people are buying up YEN and selling USD. However, the selloff began several weeks before the rate hike.\n\nIt's hard to believe that this event alone is triggering such a deep market selloff.\n\nI have a suspicion that something else is happening in the market that we are not aware of. I don't mean to fearmonger, but there is a very real possibility that some smart people have realized that there is deeper trouble brewing, and have started a selloff.\n\nOf course, it could be hivemind hysteria not based in reality. Or given how hard the Japanese stock market has been hit, maybe things really are that bad, and we'll see some banks in Japan go under.",

The AI rally caused some kind of delayed fuse with the guaranteed recession after so many rate hikes. The widening rally narrative collapsed after trump odds to win went down and small caps simultaneously got decked by recession fears. IMO the bubble already popped, the carry trade happened at the same time, looks like Japan is a much bigger rate hike risk than America, now both are at risk. The geopolitical hype the last few days may have been related but turned out to be a hoax, maybe there’s some real fear that any large event will be the next archduke ferdinand moment. \n\nI strongly encourage people to park your money in 7 year US treasuries, all of your money for the next 6 months. If you are a degenerate gambler, roll the dice on duration risk. Cash is a bad idea, rates are going down fast. Stay out of corporates the next 6 months and then consider BB to juice up your portfolio. ",

The BoJ has not set a target, it might be 140, it might be 130, it might be 120. 140 kills a lot of this years carry positions and is a dickslap to everyone else. 130 wipes out a ton of gains. 120 probably kills the economy.

      "body": "Mid 50’s guy here with 30 years in the market, lending my two cents:\n\nThe tiny Japanese rate increase itself is meaningless as OP points out.  What I believe is really going on is that everyone wants to keep dancing at the party right until the police show up.  I remember the dotcom bubble of 2000.  I ran a profitless dotcom company (at age 28) and the 40 and 50 year olds who worked for me acted like everything was great.  Even our main investor (a VC) went along for the ride.  No one had incentive to rock the boat…we were all getting paid nicely.  But outside our bubble, there were lots of articles about how stock prices (and not just for profitless dotcoms) had become detached from reality.  When the floor started to break beneath us, it happened in waves…slowly at first, then all at once.  And it didn’t just wipe out the Pets.com companies; it cut the entire S&P 500 in half.  And each downturn was met with a chorus of pumpers screaming “buy the dip!”  The real bottom coincided with no one wanting to talk about stocks anymore.  If you went to a party in 2002 and discussed stocks (a very common topic two years prior) people would quietly walk away.  They were embarrassed how their bets had gone wrong and how they’d eventually lost jobs.  THAT OVERWHELMING PESSIMISM, PLUS THE FACT THAT STOCKS HAD ALREADY FALLEN 50%, WAS THE CLUE THAT THE BOTTOM WAS IN.  While the VIX is way up (probably indicating a nice short term bounce), I don’t think we are anywhere near the real pessimism that marks long term buying opportunities.  Almost no one has lost their job yet.  That’s when euphoria meets reality.\n\nFast forward to today.  A whole new generation has never experienced a painful, massive correction firsthand.  We have warnings galore:  Yield curve severely inverted for a very long time.  (That indicator has NEVER failed to precede recession.)  CAPE very elevated for a long time.  (Does not help with timing, but does indicate high pricing.)  SAHM indicator shows unemployment (a lagging indicator) going up pretty fast.  Anecdotal stories galore of ordinary people struggling with grocery and gas prices. And a few guys who’ve been around the block are giving warnings.  Jeremy Grantham calls this a “super” bubble.  Jeff Gundlach says we are in recession.  Warren Buffett did his biggest equity sale ever.  In investing, a little gray hair isn’t a bad thing. \n\nAnd strange things are afoot at the Circle K.  (Line from Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.)  Wars rage on several continents which could easily get worse.  We have a presidential election between two candidates who seem more like reality show stars than serious thinkers.   Google is declared a monopoly by a judge.  (Microsoft’s antitrust case pretty much marked the top of the 2000 bubble.)\n \nOn the plus side, there’s an AI mania which supposedly will change the world.  I bet it will.  But I doubt it’ll happen as quickly and profitably as what’s been priced into the market.   Just as tech companies competed for office space and workers a few years back, and then dumped both quickly, it could be that companies are allocating large budgets to feed Nvidia’s revenues but are not themselves benefiting from the expense.  If that’s true, then that spending could collapse quickly. \n\nNow compare investors today to 30 years ago.  Back then, we didn’t have WSB loss porn (or bragging rights for great trades.)  You basically gained or lost in private.  We didn’t have gamified Robbin Hood giving us dopamine hits for options trading.  We had commercials with a monkey riding a bicycle promoting Etrade.  Not exactly the same, addictive casino like atmosphere.\n\nBut at core, investors of 30 years ago were subject to the same emotions as investors today.  Basically:  I wanna play the game, but can’t afford to lose the farm.  \n\nIt’s always hard to figure out a specific catalyst for a stock correction.  But those corrections usually occur when a certain set of conditions are in place such as high multiples, lots of leverage, and economic trends that are changing from unambiguously positive to slightly negative.  At first, people take some profits and others rush in to buy the dip.  But then the dip buying fails to produce a new market high, so more profit taking leads to more panic.  The dip buyers stay brave until they get margin calls.  Then reality sets in.\n\nI don’t know if we are at a peak or not.  But I think we are close.  I think the euphoria is breaking and that the upside potential does not justify the downside risk on a long strategy.",
