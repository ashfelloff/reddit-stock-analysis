  "title": "Is it time to give up on under armour?",
  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "Today, I had plans to hit the gym right after work, but I forgot to bring a workout shirt. Wanting to support brands I invest in, I decided to buy a new shirt at Kohl's, aiming for an Under Armour one. However, the selection was disappointing. Although the prices were reasonable, the designs were outdated and uninspiring, with lots of graphic tees featuring huge logos that seemed more suited for middle schoolers. In the end, I bought a basic white Eddie Bauer t-shirt instead. I do understand Kohls might have old lines of clothing but I see some of the same shirts on the website. \n\nThis isn't the first time I've been let down by Under Armour's offerings. I've browsed their website before and found nothing that made me want to buy even with 25% off coupons. Given their poor stock performance, I expected they'd make an effort to keep up with competitors, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAs a Baltimore native, it pains me to ask, but is it time to sell my Under Armour shares? What are your thoughts?",

My store no longer carries 3XL and overall the quality of their t-shirts and other stuff dropped. I don’t even bother going in anymore because I know I’ll just leave frustrated. Was actually on my phone last night looking for work polos from any company that provides decent quality at a reasonable cost.
