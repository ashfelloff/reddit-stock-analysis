It gained some recognition as a meme stock a couple years back and is now being propped up by buzz word association but its use cases are still misunderstood. Once PLTR gets household recognition and people understand its true potential, it will soar. For those that don't know, the best way to put it in layman's terms would be PLTR is a data aggregator that uses AI to help decision makers make mission critical decisions. That might not sound impressive these days but think about it like this: PLTR's core programs operate similar to how Zapier does app integrations but instead of apps PLTR can integrate any data source and marry it into a much larger data mainframe that is ready for analysis and dashboard creation. Factor in its AI capabilities and it's now the premiere end solution for businesses when it comes to utilizing their data effectively to enhance business operations. If data is the new currency of tomorrow's economy, then PLTR has the potential to become the world's central banking system. \n\nA far better nuanced description of its competitive advantage can be read here: https://www.reddit.com/r/PLTR/s/Wu1uOrOSCp\n\nMainstream adoption is still far from complete and when it reaches even 25% of its potential, it's going to fly off the rails.",

Pltr is one that has been riding a positive trend, the sales though, they don't really support the valuation but that's not to say they won't in the future it's just to say that you kind of have to take a gamble and trade the technicals with stocks like this. You're also subject to massive drops when something goes wrong but eventually if the story works out it's probably going to do pretty well and that's the same with all these stories.
