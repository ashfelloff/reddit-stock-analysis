They literally got a 2 billion dollar loan and the collateral was Blackwell GPUS. But oh wait, guess who invested 100 million dollars into coreweave? I’ll let you guess. Sounds like a pretty nice way to control the market for your product. It’s all fun and games with no competition. But I’m hearing way too much GPUS are the next oil talk. This shit stinks. \n\nThis is some 1929 levels of idiocy. Using fucking GPUS as collateral for a 2 bjillion dollar loan. They’ve gotten almost 13 billion dollars in financing in 18 months for data centers. They were supposed to build 28 by the end of 2024. I would love to know where they are. I tried to find them. \n\n I think there is way too much hidden in the way Nvidia accounts for their sales and lack of transparency in who gets what. Nvidia is controlling supply just like they did in the GPU craze to make people pay as much as possible while they have a monopoly on the market. One could say fair. But the way they are doing it I believe is unfair, bordering on illegal.",

      "body": "Subject: Clarification on NVIDIA's Financial Position\n\nDear \\[Recipient's Name\\],\n\nThank you for your inquiry regarding NVIDIA's recent financial performance. I appreciate the opportunity to provide clarity on the matters you've raised.\n\n**Accounts Receivable (AR) Growth:**\n\nAs of July 31, 2024, NVIDIA's AR stood at $14.132 billion, reflecting a 100% increase year-over-year. This growth corresponds with a significant rise in revenue, which reached $30.0 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, up 122% from the same period last year. The increase in AR is primarily due to extended payment terms offered to strategic customers, a common practice in our industry to foster strong, long-term partnerships.\n\n**Cash Flow Stability:**\n\nDespite the rise in AR, NVIDIA's cash flow from operations remains robust. This stability is achieved through effective cash management strategies, including the securitization of receivables and structured payment arrangements. These measures ensure that we maintain liquidity while supporting our customers' needs.\n\n**Inventory Levels:**\n\nOur inventory levels have increased to $6.675 billion as of July 31, 2024, a 54.55% rise year-over-year. This growth aligns with our strategy to meet the escalating demand for NVIDIA products, particularly in the data center and AI sectors. We are committed to managing our inventory efficiently to balance supply with customer demand.\n\n**Client Payment Reliability:**\n\nWe conduct thorough credit assessments and maintain close relationships with our clients to mitigate payment risks. Our diverse customer base and stringent credit policies have resulted in a strong track record of timely payments.\n\nIn summary, the increases in AR and inventory are aligned with our strategic growth and customer engagement initiatives. We remain committed to transparent financial practices and prudent management to sustain our growth trajectory.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out with any further questions.\n\nWarm regards,  \nJH  \nCEO, NVIDIA",
