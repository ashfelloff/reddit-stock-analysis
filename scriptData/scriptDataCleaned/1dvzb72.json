I could be up 400 bucks on a trade I had for 2 hours, but the 400 isn‚Äôt good enough for me, I always hope that the $400 profit will turn to $1000, then before u know it all the profit is gone. I need to focus on the small gains and stop trying to hit a home run ..I mostly trade spy, I have the most success trading that . I like using the ORB strategy, buying in around 10am, but u just need to have patience and take what the market will give u",

The main thing you should be striving for, since it sounds like you're daytrading, is not blowing your account, live to fight another day. I'll give it a few more months to see how this turns out but I was at -1k, currently at -300. while I feel I have learned what I need to do to be profitable, it is unlikely to keep working beyond the point that I breakeven. Since you're sinking further into the hole currently, I would recommend that you put your money into VOO and papertrade on your own and write down each of your trades until you are consistently profitable , do not use your broker papertrade feature. Once you have done all that try to gamble again, you might find that small break from stressing yourself really helped.  \n  \nP.S as soon as you break even quit gambling",
