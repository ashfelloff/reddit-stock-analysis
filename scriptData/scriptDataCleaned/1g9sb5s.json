What they are doing isn't magic, and can be done with less vendor lock-in by a number of other cloud technologies. Palantir is just good at selling a pipe dream to the C-suite. \n\nAs Scott Galloway mentioned, this company is more similar to Microstrategy (excluding their Bitcoin stuff ) than other companies. \n\nI'm just going to drop this link to a thread of opinions from people who have actually used or implemented it in their businesses and let that help you form an opinion on the stock:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/15r6k9i/is_palantir_as_good_as_they_say_is_it_worth_our/",

Could be a supply chain problem, could be a data science problem, could be a security problem, who gives a fuck, Palantir apparently can solve it all! What most companies do is fill out the required excel form on how they line up technically and viability wise.\n\nPalantir writes a fucking book. Not kidding. Like they have a team dedicated to putting together the flashiest looking proposal ever made—for every large customer. \n\nThe customer receives it and goes what the fuck, doesn’t even look at how Palantir lines up capability wise, just starts talking some bullshit about watering the Ontology and boom that company now pays Palantir 50M a year.

I'm going to quote one of their engineers ( Chad Wahlquist) explaining why you need an Ontology (core moat) to scale LLMs within your business context:\n\n>As we scale stochastic (unpredictable) LLMs to power more dynamic and useful workflows, we enter a new domain of decisions and actions. You now need humans and AI to work together as a team, with more controls over who/what/when/where/why actions can be taken. It is no longer a clear line between humans or systems.\n\n>The Ontology acts as the substrate for simulating, orchestrating, controlling, and reviewing decisions in a world where Humans+AI work together. LLMs bring new reasoning capabilities, which is amazing but also dangerous (see all the public \"oops\" moments already from just \"deploying an LLM\").\n\n>True value is created when the loop is closed, the action is taken, and the Ontology provides the scalable framework to do so. Your business is a system of systems that is getting more complex by the day. You cannot merely shoehorn an LLM into the mix and expect your existing end-to-end architecture to support quality decision-making with Humans+AI.\n\n>The Ontology acts as the fabric across your business, orchestrating the data, logic, actions (and security) of your operations, systems, and people to power entirely new capabilities that Human+AI teaming can bring.\n\n**Visual:** https://imgur.com/a/WmEWsvd\n\nThe Ontology allows you to move past the window dressing that is Copilot and others like it because it enables the LLM to both understand your business logic and **write back** to your core applications.\n\nWhat does this look like in the real world? Shyam Sankar CTO recently went on CNBC and talked about how one of their large US insurance clients automated all of their underwriting using 78 AI agents. A process that use to take 2 weeks now takes 3 hours.\n\n>“If all of your competitors take 2 weeks to price risk, and you take 3 hours, it’s going to be a fundamental dislocation of the market.”\n\nI have many more examples if you are interested with sources.\n\nDisclosure: Palantir is ~20% of my holdings",

But the fact is LLMs are marketed as some AI that can reason while it can’t (doesn’t help that _reasoning_ has a very specific meaning in the field, which obviously gets lost in marketing talk).\n\nNow we’re well into the second year of everybody trying to fit LLMs into any business application while struggling to solve the hallucination problem, which is not a problem to be solved but rather a technological feature that won’t go away. You dump a load of data and expect that a statistical model with a random seed will generate consistent output. Then you waste more time applying optimization techniques that will never solve that problem fully. LLMs are great for controlled translation (original propose) and text reformulation and summarization (which is tangential to translation). They might be good at software code conversion too (also a translation application), but not so much at generating new code reliably though. They can’t generate text about subject matters that weren’t incorporated into their training. They can’t “talk” about anything that hasn’t been spoken yet. Essentially a parrot as far as new content generation is concerned. Nobody has come up any killer application for LLMs so far.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, I think LLM tech is great and proven to be here to stay, but it is currently at the center of a speculative bubble. It will be interesting to see what happens once the bubble bursts.",

[Here's Shyam Sankar talking about the K-LLM approach](https://x.com/DailyPalantir/status/1702744092243845503). As I understand it you send the same prompt to multiple models and ask them to come to a consensus. Chad called it an \"LLM multiplexer\". I know Palantir has integrated LLMs within the military and I have a hard time believing that they would accept hallucinations when it comes to national security.

As I said, LLMs are great, but it’s not the killer tech the Sam Altmans out there want us to believe it is. I don’t think it will replace call center people, for example, or software devs, or writers and artists. It might replace Google Search and other web search engines. Maybe it will be good for fraud detection, and in subjective data analysis, like in flagging content for human review. Thing is, when this bubble bursts, we’ll come to know which players managed to get some usable products out there, but even then, it’s possible that everyone will get burned.",

Classical ML models are also stochastic (duh) so this isn’t some revolutionary technology they’ve invented, they’re just using marketing speak. I interned at Palantir ~10 years ago and their tech was an absolute shit show, with an amazing marketing/sales team and well connected execs. From what I’ve heard from friends that is still the case and they are selling vapor ware that they dress up with an aura of mystery and over engineered UX.\n\nI’m not here to argue with anyone, I’m glad a lot of you have made money on this stock, just giving my 2 cents in case it helps someone.\n\nEdit: fucking lol at the visual you linked",

Palantir is bringing that same capability to military, healthcare, insurance, manufacturing etc. \n\nThings have changed notably as of q3 2023 with the introduction of AIP, something that didn't exist 10 years ago. [AIP Inflection Chart](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GUPvckUWMAALO6q?format=jpg&name=large). They have an entirely different go-to-market strategy (AIP Bootcamps and Conferences) where their own clients are talking to prospective clients about how great their products are. Here's Duane Massie, EVP IT, Associated Materials telling ERP resellers in the crowd that [they are obsolete](https://x.com/i/status/1838633340401861057). \nI have more clips of representatives from Lennar, Tampa General Hospital, Lear, BP, Tyson, many others all talking about how Palantir's product saves time, money, and lives. \n\nDon't take my word for it though. Check out build.palantir.com, think you'll be surprised how easy it is to start building. Some great tutorials out there on youtube too",

And yes, AIP certainly didn’t exist 10 years ago, in fact engineering leadership at Palantir was notoriously anti-ML back then although they’re doing a great job chasing the trend now.\n\nI don’t find build.palantir.com to be very technologically impressive, it’s a set of very simple tools that already exist in OSS today and has been integrated in by major cloud providers. What have you built using this that wouldn’t be more scalable, robust and cost effective than using Sagemaker, DBX or even the flaming garbage pile that is GCP? What is a specific problem or domain where Palantir is best in class? \n\nRelying on a companies marketing material as your source of truth is a dangerous way to reaffirm preexisting beliefs. As is following influencers who unapologetically shill stocks and cherry-pick data to fit their narrative and boost engagement from their target audience by telling you what you want to hear. OP is correct that most technical users of Palantir software think it’s overpriced and lacking differentiating features. That doesn’t mean the stock won’t go up further, or that the product won’t improve, but it’s something you should try to be objective about when researching.",
