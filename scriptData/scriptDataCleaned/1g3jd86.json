This is less than Robinhood (nearly 25 million members). I think this is the most important thing to keep an eye on.\n- Price to book ratio is not bad at 1.6 and revenue growth is strong at over 40% CAGR.\n- They spend a lot on product development ($130MM) and seem to be focusing on building out their technology platform service contracts business. It accounted for $120MM in non interest revenue last quarter. This would also explain their high employee count (4k at SOFI vs 2k at Robinhood).\n\nCons:\n- Membership growth is coming from big expenditures in sales & marketing. They spent $180MM on this segment in Q2. For context, Charles Schwab (established competitor that’s 10x bigger than SOFI) spent $100MM in marketing last quarter.\n- Earnings are weaker than competition due to expenses for building out products and client base. Margins and EPS are also weaker.\n- Most interest revenue is coming from personal loans and student loans. I’m not a financial advisor but my hunch is personal loans will be harder to scale safely than more traditional interest revenue streams (mortgages, business loans) and we already know student loans market has peaked.\n\nYou should have invested 2 months ago. This is a long term hold. Unfortunately, the stock is primarily held by retail investors so the price movement is very choppy. Hopefully more institutional investors buy in.",
