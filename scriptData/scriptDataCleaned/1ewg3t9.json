Don’t think I could have held out if I wasn’t truly insane.\n\nAt 120k TDA called me to ask if I wanted a financial advisor because I was 100% in this one stock and I told them to fuck off. Lost 60% essentially overnight and probably got laughed at by all of thinkorswim support.\n\nCried in the shower and hid the account log ins around 18k after realizing I threw the IRA and HSA away. But now we’re back with risk off, costs covered, and the wife talking to me again.",
