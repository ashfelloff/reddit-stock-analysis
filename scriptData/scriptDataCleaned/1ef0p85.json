  "selftext": "AMD earnings are coming up and I think it has a good chance to beat expectations and the future of amd looks good and just wanted to know what everyone thinks about it\n\nIntel has some heavy backlash right now, their 13th and 14th gen chips stability issues have made people go to amd instead of intel. In the PCMR subreddit the first comment people type when someone has a build with a intel chip 13th or 14th gen is something like \"stability issue, bla bla, be careful, go 7800x3D\"\n\nUnlike nvidia amd still has a significant portion of their revenue stream come from gaming, so people complaining about intel is good for amd\n\nTheir gpu's are better value than nvidia and I see allot more people pick them now in my opinion. (for example the 7900GRE, 7800XT or 7900XT)",
