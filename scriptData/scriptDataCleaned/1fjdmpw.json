Microsoft and MGX, the Abu Dhabi-backed investment company, are general partners in the fund. Nvidia, the fast-growing chipmaker, will advise on factory design and integration. \n\nThe investment vehicle is aimed at addressing the staggering power and digital infrastructure demands of building AI products that are expected to face severe capacity bottlenecks in coming years. The computing power of AI requires far more energy than previous technological innovations and has strained existing energy infrastructure. \n\nDubbed the Global AI Investment Partnership, the effort seeks to raise up to $30bn in equity investments and leverage that to support up to an additional $70bn in debt financing. \n\nThe fund would mark GIP‚Äôs first big fund since the private infrastructure investment group agreed to be acquired by BlackRock for $12.5bn earlier this year. That deal is due to close in October.\n\nBlackRock, the world‚Äôs largest money manager, has highlighted the energy sector as one of its top opportunities for growth. ‚ÄúMobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure like data centres and power will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity,‚Äù Larry Fink, BlackRock chief executive, said in a statement. Larry Fink: ‚ÄòMobilising private capital to build AI infrastructure will unlock a multitrillion-dollar long-term investment opportunity‚Äô ¬© Bloomberg \n\nThe soon-to-be launched fund is the latest vehicle created by a large asset manager to meet the ever-growing demand for energy to power generative AI and cloud computing. Earlier this year Microsoft agreed to back $10bn in renewable electricity projects built by Canada‚Äôs Brookfield Asset Management. Microsoft has made a commitment to ensure 100 per cent of its energy consumption is matched by zero carbon energy purchases by 2030.¬† \n\n‚ÄúThe country and the world are going to need more capital investment to accelerate the development of the AI infrastructure needed. This kind of effort is an important step,‚Äù said Brad Smith, Microsoft‚Äôs president. \n\nMGX was created earlier this year with the backing of Abu Dhabi‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund Mubadala to advance the country‚Äôs progress in AI. It has been in talks to invest in Open AI‚Äôs next funding round. \n\nIn 2017, Blackstone announced plans for a $40bn infrastructure vehicle with backing from Saudi Arabia, and Brookfield last year raised $28bn for what was described as the largest ever infrastructure fund. \n\nThe International Energy Agency estimates that global electricity consumption by data centres could surpass 1,000 terawatt-hours by 2026, more than twice the amount used in 2022.¬† Recommended LexBig Tech Data centres have turned Big Tech into big spenders Premium¬†content \n\n‚ÄúAccelerated computing and generative AI are driving a growing need for AI infrastructure for the next industrial revolution,‚Äù Jensen Huang, Nvidia‚Äôs founder, said in a statement. \n\nIn the US, which hosts one-third of the world‚Äôs data centres, electricity demand is rising rapidly for the first time in two decades, driven partly by these energy-intensive facilities. A report from Grid Strategies indicates that five-year projections for electricity demand growth in the US have nearly doubled over the past year, increasing from 2.6 per cent to 4.7 per cent. \n\n‚ÄúThere is a clear need to mobilise significant amounts of private capital to fund investments in essential infrastructure,‚Äù Bayo Ogunlesi, GIP‚Äôs chief executive, said in a statement.",

The buildouts were motivated by demand as they can only sell more by building more.\n\nThe compute power needed for AI is magnitudes of order more than the traditional compute use that's been going on for the past 2 decades.  So there is much more infrastructure requirements and costs.  But here the difference is there is no substantial monetized model defined for AI yet.  Much of today's commerical AI usage is in niche areas.  Main point is AI requires so much compute you can't really scale it up by bits and pieces.",
