  "selftext": "**JPM, WF, and C Report - All Beating Numbers, Only C Up - Good Buying Opportunity for JPM**\n\nThe market continues to be a bit skittish, down about 3/4% at the time of writing.  I had positioned for this trade yesterday by NVDA puts that I closed out to open calls that I will cash Monday. Sometimes you can just print money.\n\nThe earnings reports show what I've been saying - good earnings will be rewarded and the market will continue to grind higher. Yes, it's a little lower right now, but we'll be higher coming out of this earnings season as companies keep reporting strong results.\n\nThe key points:\n\n* JPM, WF, and C all beat earnings expectations\n* Only Citigroup (C) stock is up on the reports\n* I think JPMorgan (JPM) is a good buying opportunity here\n\nLooking ahead, I expect the \"rate cuts\" narrative to return once the next inflation print comes around.\n\nThe bottom line is to keep buying the dips. This market is giving a great opportunity to make money, so take advantage of it.\n\nPS - yet again some folks reaching out to ask where to put money to work.  So here we go:\n\n* Cybersecurity: this is a growth segment that is very cash rich due to high margin business the large businesses operate in. ZS and PANW are good names to buy before their earnings (expect some volatility)\n* Large caps will continue to perform better this quarter, but will give way to small caps at some point this year as the interest rate story comes.\n* Utilities/ energy are no longer looking attractive, but look for natural gas exposure (EQT is a good name).\n* Banks: higher interest rates will benefit larger banks.  Buy JPM!\n\nLay off of NVDA for a few weeks.  Get out of AMD and stay out.",
