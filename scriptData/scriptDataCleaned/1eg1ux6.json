  "selftext": "Costco has always been that stock that's too expensive but keeps going up, burning many people including myself. It's now down 10% from its ATH at $896, but with still a TTM P/E of 50 and forward P/E of 46.\n\nI'll definitely be having my eyes on as there are many uncertainties in the market as a whole, but what are your thoughts on COST at this price?",

The membership increase won’t directly drive any stock price growth anymore.\n\nI would be careful with those calls, especially since we’re in the middle of what seems to be a market correction. Costco’s market expansion combined with its excellent balance sheet make it attractive long term but its price is very high right now. Stick to your thesis but be careful!",
