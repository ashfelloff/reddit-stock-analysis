Will Intel shareholders (sadly me too) recover atleast some losses?",

Every few months someone would say INTC is a value play and is getting gov assistance (depending on gov assistance means your business actually sucks, like saying Boeing depends on gov money is a good investment).  I’d warn everyone again again and again.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/  \n\nEven a schlub like me working in a datacenter knew this 6 years ago that INTC were the worse in the performance/watt and all they did was just keep pushing more watts to keep up with AMD.  So yeah INTC CEOs knew their design was faulty and lied about it every quarter until they couldn’t, they are still lying because their cpus are taking too many watts and literally dying.  Google it.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBSe0bOuNKQ\n\nhttps://www.pcmag.com/explainers/intels-raptor-lake-desktop-cpu-bug-what-to-know-what-to-do-now\n\nActual 12th gen cpus are dying too so it’s been 3 years or over 12 quarterly reports they haven’t mentioned their cpus are defective.  \n\nThey again didn’t disclose this in their last earning report, omission is not an excuse. They’ll get sued by shareholders for this different reason again over this\n\nSo this month or next month once or twice a month so 24 times a year over the last 8+ years you’ll see some scam post about INTC being under valued, needing/getting gov assistance as if that’s a plus.  The tech performance/watt is garbage so it’s going to be a money loser for a long long time until they redesign it.  Don’t think being down 45% makes this a bargain, the opportunity cost of holding this semi stock vs another semi/cloud computing stock is too much.",
