Also, in Dec, it re bought a bunch of the treasuries that it sold in the fall.  It will probably unload some again in order to keep the yen afloat, since the rate hike isn't doing it.  These things will strengthen the dollar and take yields up.\n\nTomorrow is a big day.  We'll see if the SnP breaks down through the corridor it's been in for the last couple of months.  If it does, I think the drop will start.  If it doesn't, I'm guessing that the drop gets postponed until at least CPI.",
