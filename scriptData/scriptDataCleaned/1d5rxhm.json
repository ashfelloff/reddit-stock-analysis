But for college graduates you'll be lucky to get $1200 USD/month. As for housing, I'm not really sure why it's been allowed to go so high. Most people speculate it's because of wealth disparity between incomes of those in tech compared to other sectors. Many others say it's because of the meteoric rise of TSMC (Whose stock for our market is akin to NVDA in the US). TSMC built a lot of new fabs all over Taiwan in the last couple of years.

Where a good well prepped meal is $100-500 a person. For $150 in asian countries I can get 8-10 dishes that equates to something that would cost $50-100 per dish in value if in the u.s. They make sure good food is at least affordable. If you think about it he just spent about a week's pay per table for the minimum wage worker in his country. Rough estimates guys. So let's say you make 18-20 per hour in an Asian country the cost of a meal at say their equivalent of kfc or Popeyes is about 5-10 or 15 max a meal. Or for a whole chicken bucket that feeds 2-3 people 26. Take out dish for one? 10. Now in compare that to minimum wage u.s. which is $7.95-$16nyc McDonald's is charging 18 for a big Mac meal. Popeyes $40+. So youre spending a hour+ of your pay on a big Mac meal that's not factoring in the tax deducted from your check. Eat at a fact restaurant?
