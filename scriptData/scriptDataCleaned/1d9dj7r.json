Afaik companies have individual stocks listed at different exchanges all over the world. Some stocks in Frankfurt, some in London, Paris etc. But usually there won't be a big price difference between these exchanges. Until the US (pre) market opens, it's mainly Europeans who are 'in control' of the stock market.\n\nBut when the stock market opens at the NYSE, it basically dictates the movement for stocks on all other stock exchanges around the world (especially for US-based companies). And because of the time difference Europeans can sometimes react to certain news which have been published in the US pre-market or over night. But that has more to do with daytrading imo. Being European has some other downsides though, for example we don't have 'real' options here, so there are pros and cons.\n\nAt least that's what I observed.",
