  "selftext": "NVDA is down 6% from yesterday’s pre-market highs over 0 new news. Total co-incidence that XLK has to buy $11B worth of shares today, right? \n\nAnyway, I’m not one to go down conspiracy theory roads too much but I will say — this seems very similar to the 22% drop in March (from $960-$740 in the same day), but about halfway smaller, so let’s keep things in context. \n\nA couple red days after weeks of green dildos and all the gheys come crawling out the dumpster to gloat. \n\nZoom out and don’t buy regarded weeklies. It’s likely going to keep dropping today too, and yet I still feel disingenuous calling this “diamond handing”, when in reality, this feels like the easiest hold among all my previous regarded decisions. \n\nBtw, in case any of you regards still feel like shorting that leather-jacket-wearing, titty-signing motherfucker — here’s a summary of all my past NVDA news / DD discussion posts on why you should stop being ghey:\n\n- [Dell is Building a Monstrous AI Factory Powered by NVDA for xAI](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dk063k/dell_is_building_a_monstrous_ai_factory_powered/)\n\n- [Here’s Why NVDA Will Reach $10T Market Cap by 2030](https://io-fund.com/artificial-intelligence/semiconductors/prediction-nvidia-stock-will-reach-10-trillion-mar)\n\n- [NVDA’s Sovereign AI Thrust Accelerates Global Govt AI Investments](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1dhwgzi/nvdas_sovereign_ai_thrust_accelerates_global_govt/)\n\n- [First DD post starting from $38k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d228lp/nvda_yolo_dd/)\n\n\n_Positions: $140k worth of leaps that went as high as $172k yesterday, and will probably be below $120k today — stonks still only go up_",
