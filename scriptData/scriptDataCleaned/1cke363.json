  "score": 2007,
  "selftext": "After Andrew Dudum, CEO of the hair loss treatment company Hims & Hers tweeted on May 1st applauding the “moral courage” of the Pro-Palestine protesters, his company’s stock dropped drastically. Opening on May 3rd at $12.24, the stock price dropped a total of 8% ending the day at $11.26.\n\nThe CEO’s tweet stated “Moral Courage > College degrees” among other things encouraging protesters. He then went to end the tweet with a link to his company, telling the pro-Palestinian audience to apply. Leaving a message that protesters are hirable “regardless of university discipline.”\n\nThis situation highlights the consequences of Free Speech on business owners and investors.\nEven free speech that is against what many call a genocide.\n\nIn response to this, many TikTokers in support of Palestine have created videos accentuating this event and calling for the support of the company; amassing hundreds of thousands of views & comments claiming to purchase stocks in $HIMS.\n",

There have been numerous examples where price action went the opposite of the report and people will point to a single reason mentioned in an article and say THAT’S WHY ITS DROPPING/RISING.\n\nWill HIMS rise like their medication does with men and ED or will drop even further? Only time will tell and I don’t think their ER has relevance there. Once the algos start cooking it doesn’t matter what a retail trader like you or I do.",
