Credit card default rates are something like 7% currently... so no one with a brain is going to issue credit cards to most people at a 10% rate.\n\nWhat you are saying is the laws of economics no longer apply... that you can decrease the price of something (credit card interest rates) and the supply(available consumer credit) will be the same. That's impossible... The first thing they will do is start canceling credit cards and reducing credit limits.\n\nLook at the national debt clock... the whole system is designed to prop up the American standard of living to artificial unsustainable levels.",

I just think the system could use a bit of balance. 24% APR is wild. They will still make money. The default rate is 7% is because they make it impossible to pay off the debt. I don’t see your argument here. \n\nTheir risk to reward (credit limit:interest rate) is skewed.\n\nMaking credit available and setting a low barrier for entry for people who need it badly does not do them any good if they don’t have the means to pay it back. That’s a bandaid. \n\nYou talk about how the national debt props USA living style. Yes, we should probably start taxing the 1% more to pay for all that. They benefited vastly from the society they profited from. Corporate tax should be 30%. Close the loop holes.",

Christians simply aren't held to those rules.\n\nThe Catholic church had some \"rulings\" in medieval times that charging interest to other Christians was sinful, but they backtracked on that, and Protestants consider that entire institution to be null and void too.",

All in all the bible does not seem to have a problem with a reasonable interest rate when loaning to non Hebrews. \n\nAlso it does caution against borrowing money. \"The borrower is slave to the lender\" says the book of Proverbs.",
