I'm not looking to really add a position until after the elections and until after we see how their cost cutting measures are going. The R2 and R3 are going to be great. But if they can't hit 45k and need to sell for 55k to be profitable, I don't think they'll hit the market they're trying to hit and it will flop. If they're able to hit 45k, then after tax credits (again, waiting to see how election shakes up), then it is well within the range of ICE SUV's that are hot in the middle class right now.",
