  "selftext": "As seller can no longer post commission on MLS. If I can sell on Redfin for 1% fee, why would I hire a traditional agent for 2.5% fee? Isn't that more than twice as expensive?\n\nSaving 1.5% on a $1,000,000 house is $15k saving!!!! (Now imagine a $5M, $10M, $20M houses ü§Ø)\n\nMy friend and family realtor is no longer \"free\". Suddendly I will be way more cost conscious in choosing a buyer agent.\n\nRedfin has $1B in revenue in the worst real estate market in 40 years at a $925M valuation\n\nRedfin Next program seems to well, and its financials seems to do better and better every quarter, Fed lower rate next month and into next year will be the meat on the bone\n\nAny thought?\n\nEdit: Redfin is up 11% next day ü§Øü§Øü§Ø\n\nEdit: NM, it is up 18% already ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞",
