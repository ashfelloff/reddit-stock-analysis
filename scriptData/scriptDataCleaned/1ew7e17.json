But they are a privately held company operating both the only low-earth-orbit commercial communications network \\*and\\* the only way to launch a new one.  This position has afforded overpowered control over world affairs, which far outweigh the economic upside/downside.  I think there's basically no chance they'd intentionally botch a launch, so it's not weighing on my investment decisions.  But there's always a very remote possibility that things go wrong.",
