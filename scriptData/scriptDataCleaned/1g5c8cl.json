  "selftext": "This got removed in options for being too noob so here I am with you fellow regards.\n\nI started trading options in March and smashed my previous ATH this week üéâ \nI‚Äôll summarize the last 6-12 months:\nFor most of 2022-2023 across three accounts, both taxable and IRAs, I had been middling around 15k and not doing very well trading. In the last 6 months since I started options, I‚Äôm up over 125% with only about $200 a month deposited. I‚Äôm also up 250% YTD and 340% the past 12 months, but those include a max Roth IRA $6500 contribution. It was a pretty good time to start playing semi/AI tech, and then space startups, but of course I wish I got in sooner! \n\nMy biggest successes have been with AAPL, TSM, and NVDA of course, then ASTS, RKLB, LUNR. \nLost on SOFI and DKNG while getting my feet wet, then played a series of TSM calls for big wins. I needed those wins to afford any NVDA options üòÇ \nHad another big loss with MU, some on HIMS (I hate the stock). Have a little in OKLO shares but super pissed I didn‚Äôt grab some calls in the last few months.\n\n*I‚Äôll post more in comments if people ask.* I did not have a disciplined strategy, just some loose principles putting guardrails on my emotional gambling mindset (vibe check sigma grindset). I think I got slightly past the ‚Äúfirst run is free‚Äù phase and now I can clearly see I am the next Buffett. ",

These ideas are mostly for people who are going to gamble anyway - maybe these can be basic guardrails if you don‚Äôt have the time/discipline to take a more professional approach and stick to a very exact plan. If you‚Äôve achieved that, ignore me. I know I have had a (lot) bit of luck but the things that have helped increase and multiply my luck are:\n\n- Buy long calls on stocks you have researched and are confident in their long-term growth\n(if you don‚Äôt feel super skilled doing deep DD, at least read other people‚Äôs thorough DD, then look up some of the stuff they talk about - it helps if you don‚Äôt have great research skills)\n- Cut losers and let winners ride\n- Repeat your winners since you‚Äôre gaining experience on the company and sector \n- Buy in- or near-the-money with at least 2-3 months expiry, preferably more or even LEAPS if you can afford them\n- Only buy if you have enough for 2-5 contracts, then take profit on a big jump, cover cost and let house money ride - 20%, 30%, 50%, 100%, you have to assess in the moment based on DTE, earnings schedule, lots of other factors. If theta is growing fast, take your 20%.  If you have time, monitor and decide. (Of course this year has been a once in a lifetime opportunity with semis - until next year üòâ - but that‚Äôs partly the point, take advantage of leverage while you can.)\n- When you take profit, don‚Äôt look back.\n- Taking profit removes risk and also prepares you for:\n- Keep some powder dry (cash on hand) and wait for dips. This was hard to learn with intense fomo that can come up during crazy bull runs this year. But when the dip comes, you rejoice. (Could finally afford NVDA LEAPS during that August dip üéâ)\n- If you‚Äôre in a taxable account, consider exercising an option for the shares (not a taxable event, and another reason to play companies you research and believe in long-term)\n\nYes of course this is some guesswork but if you‚Äôve been following great companies for awhile, you may start to discern which moves are likely due to the vagaries of market opinion vs actual changes to company tech, fundamentals and revenue. (I work in tech and have more confidence in AI than the average investor, some of whom are tech-illiterate yet control vast sums of money. When they get scared, take advantage.)\n\nFinal note:\nI plan to sell at least half of my current option positions before the election, then re-asses. Take profit on that IV of political instability, and buy back in later!",

              "body": "Yes all ASTS. I made a bit of profit on short dated options like $3k (+20k realized but then lost $15K later being greedy with it). I also own 6k shares so over $100k unrealized there too. In total over $300k unrealized for like $60k investment back in june. No other stock in the portfolio. I know I should take some profits but I am willing to take the risk for even bigger returns",
