  "score": 197,
  "selftext": "If you’ve been keeping an eye on Apple (AAPL), you know it’s been a wild ride lately. The stock took a beating in the first four months of 2024, dropping 8% while the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index climbed 6%. Why? Stagnant growth and a DOJ lawsuit knocked investor confidence. But then May came along, and Apple bounced back with a 12% surge thanks to strong Q2 results for fiscal 2024, announced on May 2.\n\n**Quick Stats**\n\n* **Current Price:** $196.89 (+1.24%)\n* **Market Cap:** $3,019B\n* **52-Week Range:** $164.07 - $199.62\n* **Volume:** 53M (Avg: 60M)\n\n**What's Driving the Turnaround?**\n\nApple’s revenue for Q2 2024 dipped 4% year-over-year to $90.8 billion, mainly because iPhone sales fell to $46 billion from $51.3 billion last year. But here’s the kicker: Apple’s earnings per share nudged up to $1.53, beating the $1.50 expectation. The services sector is where Apple shone, raking in a record $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This area is a goldmine for Apple, bolstering its bottom line even when hardware sales lag.\n\nLooking ahead, Apple expects revenue to pick up in the current quarter, driven by services and a bounce back in iPad sales. Given that iPhones contribute to half of Apple’s revenue, any uptick in smartphone sales will be a big win. The global smartphone market is on a comeback, with 7.8% growth in Q1 2024, according to IDC, and AI-enabled smartphones could be a game changer this year.\n\n**AI: The Next Big Catalyst**\n\nApple’s rumored to be diving into the AI smartphone market with iOS 18. Features like AI-powered transcripts, message summaries, and even a smarter Siri could debut soon. AI enhancements are expected to drive another upgrade cycle, and with Apple holding a 17% share in the smartphone market, this could be huge.\n\n**Should You Buy In?**\n\nAnalysts are bullish. Wedbush Securities sees Apple’s AI-enabled iPhones kicking off a major upgrade cycle, upping their price target to $275 from $250—a potential 45% gain from current levels. The median 12-month price target is $202, suggesting a 6% upside.\n\nHere’s the play: Apple’s trading at 29 times trailing earnings, which is a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100’s 31 times. With analysts revising their earnings expectations upwards and AI developments on the horizon, this might be the moment to get in before Apple starts another run.\n\n**Action Plan:**\n\n1. **Buy Zone:** Under $195, if you’re looking for a solid entry.\n2. **Sell Targets:** Short-term around $202; long-term riding the wave towards $275.\n3. **Watch List:** Keep an eye on AI updates and quarterly earnings for quick reaction opportunities.\n\n",

Mostly accruing and taking some profits when it gets close to ATHs again.\n\nNow is usually the time I'd take some profits, but I'm holding for now. Don't have any great research, but do think AAPL will have some sort of AI announcement that will pump it. Not buying any more though, not so much that I don't like the stock, but I really need to diversify more.",

          "body": "AI features are supposed to be released today for the iOS after an unusually long period of mild innovation with iOS (outside of the impressive Vision Pro). Many are expecting groundbreaking features. I personally think it will be underwhelming and features already present in other phones. I hope I'm wrong. That said Apple fans get excited over features other phones have had for years (features like asking Android to make a reservation for you and it does via AI phone call, deleting unwanted features in photos, searching the web for something you circled in a photo, googling what you are looking at, etc) so there is no telling what the response will be on their stock price.\n\nI wanted to buy the dip going into this Apple conference today and sell before the conference finished but I just can't accurately gauge the response of cult-like fans of Apple so I held out to gain more research. I am a Mac OS user too just don't use their mobile devices, so definitely not a hater.",

                      "body": "I think it's in trouble long term as the cost of living rises and squeezes more people out of the middle class and the budget for discretionary spending drops. I would expect to see growth in this segment slowing down or leveling off in the coming years. That being said it's really hard to predict this for a company like Apple since it's so decentralized and outside of their control. It's really dependent on some other company making a \"killer app\" that rakes in revenue, or an artist making an album that everyone buys on iTunes, so that Apple can take their cut. If anything comes along to jeopardize that 30% cut (like the current war with EU regulators) Apple could be in very serious trouble. While unlikely, if the US regulators decided to step in here as well Apple could easily lose half of their value overnight.",

Nevermind the fact that they have to come down in price...and even then people almost need to buy 2+ of them to make them continuously be useful where the product will catch on and people will buy more than 1 generation. \n\nI think a dark horse thing for Tim Apple would be to use the AI stuff to develop their own search engine.
