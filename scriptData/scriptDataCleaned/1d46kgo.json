By “averaging down”, you are dumping more money into a failing position. In this opinions position, you did everything wrong.\n\n1.) You entered an INSANELY speculative position by buying so far out of the money. Even if CLSK reaches $30, which it is not, you would still lose a shit ton of money from the theta decay. There was no way this was ever going to be profitable. If you thought CLSK was going to go up, you should have bought ATM or even ITM.\n\n2.) You put way too much money into one trade. Do you think stocks only go one direction? Did you not think that it was possible that you could be wrong on your bet? Why the hell would you bet that much? With every trade, always assume that the worst case scenario is possible. Everyone gets it wrong. If you bet your entire account on each position, there is a 100% chance you will lose it all. No one is always right.\n\n3.) You borrowed money to do options and you don’t know anything about options. You didn’t use even the slightest bit of risk management. I honestly can’t begin to put myself in the mindset that would have lead you to this place.",

For the life of me I can't wrap my head around why OP thought it was a good idea to borrow tens of thousands of dollars to gamble with.  Not only do you owe your dad a shit ton of money, you placed yourself in debt for absolutely no reason. \n\nOP, it's good to know that your dad is well off enough to loan you this amount of money but it's sad that he didn't show you the ropes of financial literacy.  \n\nThis is hands down one of the most stupid decisions I've heard of someone making in a while.   🤣 But I appreciate this post because your dumbassery gave me the best laugh I've had all day.

              "body": "The price of an option is intrinsic value + extrinsic value.  \n- Intrinsic value is based on how \"in the money\" it is. So... if the stock is currently at $30 and you own a $20 call option, that call has $10 in intrinsic value. If the stock is at $30 and you own a $40 call option, that option has 0 intrinsic value because it is \"out of the money\".  \n- Extrinsic value is the other part of the price of the option. How this is calculated is a bit more complicated... it is a combination of things... but a lot of it is time value (theta). So... to keep things simple, we'll just say that extrinsic value is mostly based on time. (I recommend reading about the greeks to get the full picture)\n\nSo, every day an option is open, it loses a little value because there is less time remaining. This is called \"theta decay\". Now, as the stock goes up, it can gain some of that extrinsic value back because of other factors like gamma and implied volatility, but overall, it's losing value. So, I'll give you an example of how this would play out. (I'm using Robinhood's simulated returns feature)\n\nLet's say I buy the CLSK $30 call with an expiration date of 7/19. (CLSK is currently at 16.29) I'll pay $45 for this call.   \n- If the price does nothing, the worth of that contract will $8 after a month. So, I'll be at a $37 loss due to theta decay.  \n- If the price goes up to $20.55 after a month, it will be at break even. The contract will still be worth $45.  \n- If the price actually reaches $30 by expiration, you'll be at about break even.\n\nBasically, the price has to rise quick enough to account for the theta decay. If the price is slowly moving up the entire time you have the contract open, you could still be losing money. To make money off the contract I listed, the price has to be shooting up like 10% a week.\n\nSo, what is the better option? The better option is to buy a call option with a price that is already ITM. (Lower than the current price.) I'll show you why -\n\nLet's say I buy the CLSK $16 call with an expiration date of 7/19. (CLSK is currently at 16.29) I'll pay $270 for this call. (Yes, it is more expensive because now it has intrinsic value.)  \n- If the price does nothing, the worth of the contract will be $198 after a month. Yes, you'd still be at a loss, but you'll notice it has decayed far less.  \n- If the prices goes up to $20.55 after a month, the contract is now worth $506. You have a $236 profit.  \n- If the price somehow reaches your $30 goal by expiration... the contract will be worth $1400. That is a profit of $1,130. You paid $270.",
