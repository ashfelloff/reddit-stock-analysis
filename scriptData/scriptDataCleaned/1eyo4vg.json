  "selftext": "Peloton on Thursday said it will start charging new subscribers a one-time $95 activation fee if they bought their hardware on the secondary market as more consumers snag lightly used equipment for a fraction of the typical retail price.\n\nThe used equipment activation fee for subscribers in the U.S. and Canada comes as Peloton starts to see a meaningful increase in new members who bought used Bikes or Treads from peer-to-peer markets such as Facebook Marketplace. \n\nDuring its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, Peloton said it saw a “steady stream of paid connected fitness subscribers” who bought hardware on the secondary market. The company said the segment grew 16% year over year.\n\n“We believe a meaningful share of these subscribers are incremental, and they exhibit lower net churn rates than rental subscribers,” the company said in a letter to shareholders. \n\n“It’s also worth highlighting that this activation fee will be a source of incremental revenue and gross profit for us, helping to support our investments in improving the fitness experience for our members,” interim co-CEO Christopher Bruzzo later added on a call with analysts. \n\nWhile plenty of Peloton subscribers are avid users of the home workout machines, some have likened them to glorified clothes racks because so many people stop using the equipment. Those people paid Peloton for that hardware originally, but importantly, many of them have canceled their monthly subscription, which is how Peloton makes the bulk of its money. \n\nThe ability to attract new, budget-conscious members from the secondary market who are willing to pay for a monthly subscription is a unique opportunity for Peloton to grow revenue without any upfront cost, on top of the revenue from the original sale. \n\nAri Kimmelfeld — whose startup Trade My Stuff, formerly known as Trade My Spin, sells used Peloton equipment — estimates there are around a million Bikes collecting dust in homes around the world that could be a source of new revenue for the company. \n\nHe told CNBC he previously met with Peloton executives to discuss ways to collaborate, because every time he sells a used piece of equipment, it could lead to more than $500 in new revenue per year for Peloton. With the new used equipment activation fee, that number could grow to more than $600 for the first year. \n\n“We save the customer a lot more than $95,” Kimmelfeld told CNBC on Thursday after the new activation fee was announced. “I don’t think it’ll stop or slow down people from buying secondary equipment … because you can get a bike delivered faster and cheaper on the secondary market, even with the $95, let’s call it a tax, from Peloton.” \n\nTrade My Stuff sells first-generation Bikes for $499, compared with $1,445 new. It offers the Bike+ for $1,199, compared with $2,495 new. It also sells used Treads for $1,999, compared with $2,995 new. \n\nSince launching his business, Kimmelfeld has worked with people looking to sell their used Peloton equipment and has since sold a “few thousand” Bikes. In 14 cities around the country, including Los Angeles, Denver and New York City, the company offers same- or next-day delivery. Outside of those locales, it provides delivery within three to five days. That compares with a new Peloton purchase, which can take significantly longer to deliver. \n\nThe used equipment activation fee is designed to ensure that new members “receive the same high-quality onboarding experience Peloton is known for,” the company said. Bruzzo said that those who buy a used Bike or Bike+ have access to a virtual custom fitting ahead of their first ride, as well as a history summary that shows how many rides those bikes had before they were resold. \n\n“We’re also offering these new members discounts on accessories such as bike shoes, bike mats and spare parts,” said Bruzzo. “We’ll continue to lean into this important channel and find additional ways to improve the new member experience, for example, providing early education about the broad range of fitness modalities that we offer and the many series and programs our instructors provide to new members.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/22/peloton-to-charge-95-activation-fee-for-used-bikes-.html",

My wife and I have subscription fatigue, and have begun cutting out every subscription to every app, every premium channel, every magazine, literally everything that we do not feel that we truly need or get adequate enjoyment from. So many channels used to be available with a Prime and Netflix subscription. Now nearly every channel wants its own subscription fee, when there is very little original content these days. It seems like there is a business race on to see who can price their customers out of returning. Starbucks did me in the last time I drove through, when the price for a medium cup of coffee was $6.15, plus an expected tip. 3 pounds of really good coffee beans is $19 at Costco. I'll make my own coffee, thank you. The movie theatre did us in when 1 small Diet Coke, 1 small popcorn, and 1 bottle of water was $24.50, just for the concessions. Done with buying concessions. It isn't really about the money for us. It's the principle of absurd prices. McDonald's was $17 for 1 Big Mac, 2 small fries, and a Diet Coke. It was awful. Not going back. Tipping is totally out of control, when every place now uses an app to guilt you into tipping. I don't mind tipping an excellent server, but tip grabbing when I walk in and pick up take-out is a no go. We are cutting every unnecessary service, and it feels very refreshing to do so.",

                          "body": ">they have money to spare.\n\nThat is the problem. It's a luxury that has a very niche target audience. Not a lot of people have the money to spend money on equipment and a subcription for online classes. I mean they could get a separate exercise eq and use Peloton's sub for the classes, but more likely they are going to not use it due to budget constraints or just not have equipment and jog/bike around their neighborhood. \n\nYou are also dealing with an audience that is very trendy as well and will be more apt to move on to the next trend that pops up. In the fitness realm, that is big and there's always something new pops up. I had similar arguments when $PTON was going for $80-100. People thought it was going higher than that. Now it's sub-$5. Though, I assume you can make some money on it during Dec-Jan during the whole \"New Year's Resolution\" bump in fitness.\n\nYes, it is useful for a number of people, like yourself. But that doesn't mean it makes for a great or even good thing to invest in. As an investment, I wouldn't want to touch it. As a device, it's too much for my taste and I get enough exercise at work. \n\nAs far as Fitbit goes, it is related as it's in the fitness realm. I can see Google buying it and throwing it into their fitness portfolio like Fitbit. They have thrown a lot of Fitbit into their own smartwatch. Not saying they will, but I could see it especially with their recent content sharing partneship. **source:** https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-fitbit-peloton-announce-fitness-content-partnership-2024-08-13/\n\nI really don't view $PTON as something I'd consider investing in, especially when they are trying hard to limit their own small niche target audience. Not only does this $95 activation fee hurt those looking at buying a cheaper used device to use, they are hurting current users by reducing their resale value down by about $100 if not more. IMO, This is only going to limit their possible subscriber base when they should really be doing anything and everything to try to increase it whether it be with new Peloton device or used ones or even equipment that isn't even Peloton. I could really see Fitbit tying in very nicely with that last option with non-Peleton devices which makes a Google buy-out a bit more plausible if they wanted to go down that route. \n\nI'm not knocking Peloton as a device, but only as a stock investment. It's great that you love yours as I'm sure others do as well.",
