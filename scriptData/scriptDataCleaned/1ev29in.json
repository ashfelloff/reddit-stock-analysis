  "selftext": "**Introduction:**  \nBicycle Therapeutics is a UK-based pharma company working on precision-guided therapeutics that penetrate deep into tissues and target cancer cells. The company is currently valued at $1.55 billion and has a few drugs in the pipeline, that said we will only focus on \"BT8009\" also known as \"Zelenectide pevedotin\" because this is the crucial one.  \nPipeline: [https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/](https://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/pipeline/pipeline/)  \nThe company has a strong balance sheet with $918m net cash if we subtract the debt.\n\n**Zelenectide Pevedotin formerly known as BT8009:**  \nThe drug is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) currently in phase 2/3. It targets the nektin-4 molecule that is overexpressed in cancer cells. The drug enters the cancer cell, binds to nektin-4 and releases the toxin that then kills the cell.\n\nThe company Seagen (now owned by Pfizer) developed the first ADC that made it to market called  \"Padcev\". Padcev made them almost $400m last quarter, this means this one drug will make them about $1.2 billion a year, which translates to $900m in net profits assuming a 75% profit margin.  \nIn a press release posted in May 2024 ( [https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety](https://investors.bicycletherapeutics.com/news-releases/news-release-details/bicycle-therapeutics-present-pharmacokinetic-and-safety) ) Bicycle Therapeutics releases some study results that show that BT8009 is better than Padcev in many ways. This means that if this drug gets to market it will be able to directly compete with Padcev and any other cancer drug of this type.\n\n**The risk/reward:**  \nThe obvious risk is that there are some unknown sideeffects that come to light and the drug does not get approved and the stock tanks -60% in one day. The current failure rate of phase 3 cancer drugs is around 50%.  \nIf the drug gets approved the company is probably worth $15 billion or more, that translates to a $200+ share price.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nEssentially its a coinflip: 50% chance i lose 60% of my investment or 50% chance i make 10 times my money. Thats a bet I take all day.\n\n*Disclosure: I am personally long the stock, my cost basis is around $22 per share.*",

                  "body": "There are several obstacles in the radioconjugate space that could hinder bicycle therapeutics ability to break into the market. \n\n One potential stumbling block in the  radioconjugate field is having access to the radionuclides. Most RICs are using Lutecium which is a beta emitter, but there seems to be a slow push in the field towards alpha particles of which actinium is one of the preferred isotopes.  \n\nActinium is extremely scare and considered one of the most expensive elements to buy or create. Getting and maintaining a supply line of actinium could prove challenging for them and or small biotech startups. \n\nAnother challenge is that the field is extremely new and a lot of the science is still up for debate. Some of the most basic questions like what is the max dose that normal tissue and organs can handle is still being based off of external beam therapy guidelines that can be helpful, but are a completely different modality. Another basic question that’s up for debate is whether or not dosimetry to determine absorbed is even needed. \n\nAll said, personally, I think these are some major issues for a small startup to deal with and probably the big pharma companies are probably better suited to handle these problems as they have more resources to throw at them.",
