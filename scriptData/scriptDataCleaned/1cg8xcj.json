      "body": "For context: Here's my first posting last Thursday: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cd7u69/1m\\_yolo\\_into\\_sofi\\_earnings\\_are\\_on\\_monday\\_in\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cd7u69/1m_yolo_into_sofi_earnings_are_on_monday_in_the/) and here's my DD [https://twitter.com/EmeraldWizzard/status/1783848359658151966](https://twitter.com/EmeraldWizzard/status/1783848359658151966) (it's also in the other posting for those who don't have Twitter). My position is 10,000 call options with expiry in January 2026 and a strike price of $20. 99% of my portfolio is in this.\n\nObviously not happy with the stock action after a 10% drop (in the pre-market I was also above $1M and after looking at the numbers I was happy). But then the stock price fell because of a) guidance, b) because Galileo (the fintech part of SoFi) is just growing alright and not superb (21% year on year) and c) the earnings call was uninspiring.\n\nFor a) guidance I don't mind. We all know that they are sandbagging their Q2 expectations. They do this every quarter and then triple beat like today.\n\nFor b) Galileo growing \"only\" 21% I think it's above good. Galileo will grow all of the sudden when they onboard a large new client such as some people suggest Citibank. Then you can expect large growth all of the sudden. Galileo is B2B, so it's not like it's growing every quarter a few more % as analysts and us would like it. Spikes in growth happen when they get a new large customer.\n\nFor c) the earnings call being unspiring I'd say of course Musk and Karp (with banging the table) are more fun to listen to, but SoFi is a bank and to be taken seriously, Noto and his team need to be taken seriously. I like their conservative outlook and sandbagging.\n\nIn conclusion, lucky all of you who are not yet in SoFi and just discovered the stock so cheap. Even hardcore value investors like it now ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrV0KCcLZoc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrV0KCcLZoc) ). This time the shorts won. But if SoFi continues to outperform and triple beat all expectations like they do quarter after quarter and once Galileo lands 1-2 big fish like Citibank, this will get interesting.\n\nPS I can make more updates in the future if you are interested. I know this is just a (very) bad day today when it comes to stock action. But the company is doing great and their conservative outlook is what I like! Here's Noto on Schwab being conservative but also giving a great interview today: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4X85cSaOc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi4X85cSaOc)",

My thesis is that sooner or later we will flip the narrative and that everyone will believe that there's no recession this year so that Trump can be avoided (if there's a recession, Biden cannot win no matter what). Even old-school Republicans hate him or in other words the establishment, those who are in power, those who can prevent a recession (e.g. FED). I am not sure how it will play out (maybe more bank failures) and how Powell will argue for rate cuts, but I believe it will happen sooner than expected and most likely more than the market has priced in.",

You can then use the money you make off the premiums to buy more shares. With the size of your portfolio, you could be adding a few thousand shares to your position every week. I probably made a 4-5% return selling calls in the last month and was happy to be able to add to my position today",
