      "body": "Good analysis but I am bearish on all lithium stocks. The reason, as you mentioned, is the oversupply. And the reason of oversupply is because the Chinese miners managed to keep the cost to mine lithiums to below rmb5000/T. Current future is rmb94000 and you can get rmb88000 at most ports. The Chinese miners are still making profit!! The only hope is for president Biden to ban LCM from Chinese owned mines. It’s technically hard though.",

The cost to mine lithium produced a product called Spodumene, the futures price you’re talking about is potentially the Lithium Carbonate price (this is a refined version of the ore, which is Spodumene)\n\nWhile, it is true that some lithium miners are profitable (mostly the ones that produce Spodumene and are not investing downstream, which is the Australians who have large mines), most of the miners aren’t as profitable as you say in your comment",

They won't even have to profit from it, just have a net cost less than what they currently spend. The unfortunate fact for the lithium market is that the stuff is far from rare, and the only complexity is figuring out which specific process industry might eventually want at the right time.",
