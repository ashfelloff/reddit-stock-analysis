NEVER play what you are not immediately ready to lose. As soon as you buy an option contract, you lost that money. The exit strategy is, \"how much will I get back\"\n\nYou're not cutting losses.\nYou're not letting it run.\nYou gave your money to someone else on the gamble that when you come back to them, they will have to at minimum give you back some percentage of what you gave them.\n\nWhen you frame it that way, your P/L becomes a lot less exciting, but your strategy can finally improve because just like a casino, once your bet is placed, it belongs to the house unless you win it back, even though it's still sitting in front of you.",
