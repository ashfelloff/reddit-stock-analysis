  "selftext": "So I had $70k sitting in cash on Friday and I bought long-term (1+ year) call options on INTC, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, MU, and MSFT. Am I screwed because the market is in mid-crash or is this a good play? I figured we might’ve overcorrected and will see a rebound next week followed by a steady bull market climb for rest of year as Fed lowers interest rates but maybe I’m wrong. What do you guys think? Am I about to lose my entire savings?",
