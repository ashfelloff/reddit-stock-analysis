  "selftext": "Hello regards,\nAnother clothing retail going to shit the bed on Wednesday: Levis. We have Levi's earnings AH on Wednesday.\nRetail has been absolutely shitting the bed with their forecasted guidance- LULU, NKE, PVH to just name a few. OFC there will be some outliers. BUT LEVI'S WILL NOT BE ONE OF THEM!!!\n\nLEVI's FY 2024 forecast they gave in Q4 2023 was: \n- Revenue growth of 1-3% (I backed these numbers out and not given in the report $6.24B-$6.36B)\n- EPS of $1.15-$1.25 (in actual report)\n\nLEVI's Q1 2024 Street expectations: \n- $1.53B in Revenue (YoY decline of 9.5%)\n- $0.20 in EPS (YoY decline of 41.2%)\nIn PYs with revenue around $1.5Bish, their EPS was higher with around $0.3-$0.4.\n\nSo, let me get this straight, for FY 2023, Levi's had revenue of $6.18B and adjusted EPS was $1.10. And for FY 2024, they expect higher revenue of $6.24B-$6.36B and higher EPS of $1.15-$1.25, but their Q1 (which includes holiday sales) go down massively YoY?? Is it just me or is the math not mathing? \n\nOne UBS analyst wrote \"We anticipate the company delivers a small 1Q 2024 beat and maintains its $1.15 to $1.25 fiscal 2024 EPS guidance. We expect this will have a slightly positive impact on sentiment, which skews moderately bearish.\" I agree that they will deliver a Q1 beat, BUTTTTTTTTTT I think they will lower guidance. \n\nAlso, the risk/ reward is much better in favor of puts compared to calls. The stock is up 25% YTD, 50% the past 6 months.\n\nTwo risks to consider\n1. Beyonce mentioned Levi's in her new album- articles indicating this will lead to an increase in sales, however, IDK if it will be reflected in their guidance, OFC, this is a risk\n2. I did check the short interest % float is a bit high at 11%ish, the stock could be squeezed higher with better than expected earnings or increased guidance.\n\nTLDR; Levi's going to give shit guidance, buying puts tmrw, IV is around 40-60%, so not too bad. Will post positions tmrw, but going to buy LEVI $20P, 5/17 and 7/19.",

By virtue of it paying a dividend, no institutions or funds will dump it on a seemingly bad quarter or weaker guidance because they would lose their qualified divies. Why do you think the options are so cheap? Again, this stock moves with the macro market. However, I can be wrong and you can have a move either way but I can assure you that based on all available data, that is an extremely low probability outcome.",
