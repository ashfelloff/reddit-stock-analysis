  "selftext": "As stated by numerous medias, Chinese stocks have reached new heights, leaping 8-10% daily, a wonderful change from it's long bearish market (By the way, they are also enjoying their national holiday). Likewise, foreign IPO's in the NYSE have also performed well compared to the rest of the market.  According to data from previous decades, I find this surge is similar to the 519 event in 1999 and the 2016 bull market.\n\nIn 9/24 of 2024, the central bank of China held a press conference, which specifically discussed it's future plans for the stock market. As an example, a cut in interest rates. It also wanted to stop the policy of the central bank taking a portion of the regional banks for each saving. Furthermore, policies regarding real estate have also deregulated.\n\nAny thoughts? How long do you expect this trend to last?\n\nNote: I am not a communist. I am a student from Taiwan participating in the 2024 Wharton stock investment competition. Even if opinions differ, we can still analyze the market like civilized people. There is no need to downvote because a post talks about China.",

Post-2008, stocks recovered way, way, way before the economy did. US Real estate prices only bottomed in 2011, when stocks were almost back to all time highs.

The problem with China monetary policy is they literally can't stimulate if the interest rate differential is high between an exporting country and importing countries. If they attempt to stimulate through lower interest rates, it hits their exports from currency depreciation, so doing anything with interest rates is a losing proposition. Since the PBOC is basically subordinate to global interest rates, primarily influenced by the Fed, it makes sense that as soon as the Fed lowered interest rates, PBOC comes out with large stimulus literally 1 day later, precisely because they now have flexibility to stimulate without hurting exports or risk further depreciation.",

That’s just media lies. Some are closing while others are growing.\n\nNow, it's true that many factories are shutting down, but that's part of the deleveraging system. You need to eliminate zombie companies that consume credit without generating good returns, so that credit can start flowing again into sectors that truly deserve it.\n\nA major sector that was consuming credit and starting to form an excessively large bubble was real estate. It didn’t just collapse on its own; the government decided to burst the bubble.\n\nThe stimulus China has provided in recent times is not a \"bazooka\" as people are claiming. In fact, if they leave it as is, I doubt it will do much to restore the economy. What they are aiming for is to restore confidence in the system. To restore consumer confidence, which was lost for a reason: people close to them losing their jobs due to industry closures (which weren’t performing) or because they lost value in their only form of investment, which was real estate.\n\nThis isn’t necessarily a bad thing if the country manages to do it right (as Ray Dalio says, a beautifully deleveraging cycle). It can be a difficult process but China, being an authoritarian country, is well positioned to handle it. They have all their debt in their local currency, they have large reserves to back up a possible currency collapse, and they control the banks and companies across the country.\n\nAlso, while the drop in real estate value seems chaotic, it’s really not. Maybe in the short term, it looks bad, but in the long run, it's a redistribution of wealth. Now investors will be able to invest in new projects with cheaper land.\n\nAnyways im interest in where part of China you live.

Spending to build the railways will cause GDP to go up, but no real sustainable growth is occurring because the people don’t need 100 railways. This happens a lot in China with infrastructure spending.\n\nAnother example is all of the ghost cities in China.
