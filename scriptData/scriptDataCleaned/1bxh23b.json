If you look into NVO, they're experiencing a massive shortage of Ozempic, they can't keep up with the supply. Good problem to have, nonetheless. Meanwhile they've been acquiring companies and production sites to address lack of product. Also, to respond to this lack of production theyre only making it available for diabetec patients.\n\nIMO they are a good long hold but I wouldn't get too excited about their upcoming earnings. I'm looking into buying calls but I'm selling before earnings for sure",

But the demand is still waaaaaaay larger than novo supply chain can deliver. And that would not change for the coming years. \n\nAbout the new higher Rybelsus doses, (25mg and 50mg) novo has only applied FDA for T2D indication and not obesity. \n\nSo novo will not be able to market an obesity pill for the coming years. \n\nBut the 50mg dose tested in pure obesity trial gave the same weight loss as 2,4mg Wegovy. So there would probably come a lot of off label sales of Rybelsus ",
