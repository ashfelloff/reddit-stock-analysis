Man, seems crazy to me to only make 50% on your bet when you had such a strong rally. \n\nI guess I'm not really one for options, but you could have lost everything on any bad news, and if you just bought the stock, youd still have made just south of 30k with much less downside in the case of no/slow growth or a dip. \n\n\nJust seems like a crazy bet to me! But happy for you that it worked out. \n\n\nGood luck on the next one!",
