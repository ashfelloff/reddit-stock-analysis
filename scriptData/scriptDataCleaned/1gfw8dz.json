The exception of course would be for apps from Meta-owned developers where they could net more after development costs.\n\nI don't have a public source, but from a friend involved in manufacturing at the time I heard that the unit loss was around $100 for the q1 and a bit lower for the q2.  \n\nI don't know anything concrete for the quest 3, but third party analysts say the parts and manufacturing costs are about the same as the sale price so after marketing and other overheads (ignoring R&D of course) it's likely still a non-trivial loss.",
