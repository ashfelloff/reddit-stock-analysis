  "title": "AAPL vs. NVDA Comps",
  "score": 53,
  "selftext": "I consider AAPL a good reference point for NVDA considering there aren’t many companies with market caps so high.\n\nFor the last quarter, AAPL’s revenue was **85.78B** compared to **30.04B** for NVDA. But of course their margins are different - AAPL’s is close to **25%**, while NVDA’s is close to **50%**. That’s how we get net income in the last quarter of **21.45B** for AAPL and **16.6B** for NVDA. All else equal then, NVDA’s value should be about 77.39% of AAPL’s. Looking at today’s market caps we have AAPL at **3.383T** and NVDA at **2.649T**, which puts NVDA’s value at 78.30% of AAPL’s, or roughly 1.3% overvalued based on net income alone. \n\nBut of course all else is not equal. As you know, a company’s valuation is based upon future earnings, not past. When we look at the past quarter, we see that AAPL’s net income **declined 9.26%** from the previous quarter, while NVDA’s **increased by 11.56**%. Even if Apr-Jun is typically a low quarter for AAPL, looking at year over year change in net income, shows us **7.88%** growth for AAPL compared to **168.24%** for NVDA.\n\nWhy then does NVDA have only a one percent premium over AAPL based upon net income, when NVDA’s net income grew 46.7% more in the past quarter than AAPL’s did in the past year?\n\nOne more thing: I haven’t accounted for after-hours action, so NVDA’s slight premium over AAPL based upon net income alone is probably gone now.\n\nPositions: Long NVDA, NVDU, NVDA Dec calls.\n\nThis is not financial advice.",
