Just sticking with facts here.\n\nThe fed cut interest rates to basically 0 when trump was still in office - FED data indicates that around April 2020 rates were essentially 0 (look up FED funds effective dates and on the fed website you will see this). Biden won election in 2020 and took office 2021.\n\nTrump was calling for negative rates when the fed rates were already 0.\n\nInflation happens from an increase in money supply compared to available goods.  Both Trump and Biden sent thousand dollar checks in the mail - biden ran on the ticket that people would get checks, and I think trump said the same thing and wanted to give more $$ then what biden gave. But Biden took office and the ports were extremely backed up, which further limited supply.  So we had a significant increase in cash and a significant decrease in supply, hence the inflationary pressure.\n\nAlso, at no point should the president control interest rates.  That would be an economic disaster. I would also say the FED has no business controlling rates either, and the free market should dictate interest rates, however, that ship sailed when the fed was created.",

Tax adjustments influence economic activity, yes, but the interest rates are really what drives expansion. \n\nThe free market should decide rates.  If the free market doesn’t (like the US isn’t really a free market) then data should drive decisions.
