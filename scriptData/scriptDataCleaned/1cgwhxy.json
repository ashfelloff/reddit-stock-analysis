  "title": "Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings",
  "score": 270,
  "selftext": "Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. \n\nLet's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years—it's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.\n\nLooking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.\n\nThe takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing—other big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.\n\n# Revenue Beat\n\nAmazon’s revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year – online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon’s revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.\n\n# EPS Beat \n\nAmazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.\n\n# Possible Dividend Announcement\n\nMeta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon—when are they joining the dividend party?\n\nBy the numbers, it seems like it’s about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.\n\nIn comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year—though most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.\n\nFor Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.\n\nBut what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.\n\nThis 2.4% isn't just dividends—it includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon’s hefty cash flow, it’s looking more and more like they’re due to start sharing the wealth.\n\nJust for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft’s sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft’s expected to hit sales around $260 billion.\n\nAmazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft’s stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they’d need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends—totally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.\n\nBottom line: Amazon doesn’t need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys.",

Tesla has obviously a product..\n\nYour point: Tesla has no product\n\nAmazon has a product..\n\n\nFirst one is false..\n\nsecomd one in partly false, because the cash cow is the Service+delivering. They sell everything from every company and deliver it in a short period of time to your doorstep, with amazing customer SERVICE.. its a SERVICE with a little extra bucks on the side, with things like prime, (what is a service) and Alexa, etc.\n\n\nCash cow is the SERVICE..\n\njust because mercedes sells me a extended  warranty, its not a warranty dealership.\n\nJust because my Massage practitioner sells me a Cream, its not a Cream company..",
