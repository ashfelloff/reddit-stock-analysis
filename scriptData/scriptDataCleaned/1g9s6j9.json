The USDA has been on a massive recruiting spree for the last 4 years, but you're not talking about hiring fry cooks at McDonalds.  When you lose 50% of your staff, most of whom were the ones with enough seniority and expertise to go get jobs elsewhere, it creates chaos.  Which was the entire point of moving it.\n\n>it’s Trump’s fault that McDonald’s beef is contaminated with a fecal-oral bacterium\n\nHey look, a trumper arguing in bad faith despite me specifically addressing that point in my last paragraph.\n\n>because he relocated the USDA to meatpacking hub of the United States?\n\nYou say this as if it wasn't a direct response to congress refusing to cut their budget in half, or that the expertise needed to run the agency and set policy has any bearing on being located near meat packing centers.  It doesn't.\n\nHow do you not see this?  When you gut regulations and inspections, you're going to get more food contamination.  It's a direct one to one relationship.  We implemented these things specifically because industry cannot police itself as was demonstrated many times over the last few times we went through this lunacy.",
