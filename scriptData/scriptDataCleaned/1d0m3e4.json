Think of a calendar year like the regular school year, starting in January and ending in December. It’s the same for everyone.\n\nNow, imagine your friend’s family has a special tradition that starts in the middle of the school year, like July, and goes until the next July. They celebrate their own special events and keep track of things from July to July instead of January to December. \n\nA company’s fiscal year is like that special family tradition. Instead of following the regular calendar year, the company picks a different starting month and counts 12 months from there. This helps the company plan and manage its money better based on its own schedule.",
