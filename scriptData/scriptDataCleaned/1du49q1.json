I think it’ll move sideways this month until closer to earnings. On the bright side, support is keeping it from dropping below $120 and if it does, double down, because that will only be for a moment. 3rd week of July may be when some price action will take place pre earnings though, so good luck. I’m in a similar boat but, Blackwell is being released in fall…. So that may encourage some buying prior.",
