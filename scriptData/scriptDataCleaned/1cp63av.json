First is the low profit margin making them unattractive to dealers and manufacturers. They don't get advertised nearly as much. Also, people who buy new cars are significantly wealthier as a group. People who buy new cars dictate what used cars are available. The used market then competes with the new market. Cars are also status symbols and people will stretch to buy something that's beyond their price range.\n\nSpecifically with the Mirage, that cars sucks comapred to other offerings. Looking online, a Mirage starts around $16,000 whereas you can get a Kia Rio, Kia Soul, or Nissan Versa for $18-20k. I see 2020-2023 Corollas with under 50k miles for $18-20k which will probably outlast the Mitsubishi.\n\nThe Mirage thrives in poor countries where ownership of any car is considered a status symbol and a significant quality of life improvement over scooters/motorcycles.\n\nTo make the Mirage competetive in America, it should be a $10,000-$12,000 car. Then it would truly compete against the other new and used offerings.",

Its over subsidizing as a geopolitical strategy to make the world dependent on China for the green energy transition by crushing international competition. With the exception of BYD, EV producers are selling below cost (upwards of 5 figure losses per car sold). The same goes for solar panels and others. There was a very interesting snippet in First Solars earnings call:\n\n> China ended 2023 with more than twice the solar manufacturing capacity that was deployed worldwide last year, had record-low factory capacity utilization rates in the first quarter of 2024 and despite these market-distorting factors, is still expected to add 500 to 600 gigawatts of new capacity this year with China expected to exit 2024 with sufficient capacity to meet global demand through 2032. It appears that the overcapacity is not a miscalculation but an intentional feature of the Chinese government strategy to dominate clean energy supply chains.",

And could even have higher specs compared to US EVs within the same price range, such as having a giant ultra-wide 8K dashboard, newest battery tech that can fully charge a car in 30 minutes, etc. If you look up chinese EV showcase on youtube they're kinda insane for their price.

This has nothing to do with the environment.\n\nI also want to add that chinese people are enjoying cheap and powerful smartphone and EV, and their manufacturers don't seem to be in any hurry to export these high-tech goods to any other market.
