  "title": "This Soda is About to Pop / $PEP Pepsico",
  "score": 71,
  "selftext": "A bunch of household defensive names are at 52-week lows. This includes things like Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers and Pepsico.\n\nThe AI hype has relegated defensive stocks to the dustbin, but this is about to change in a big way.\n\nJuly is historically the strongest month in the summer for tech and it also has the highest statistical odds for the NASDAQ to form a multi-month market top.\n\nToday's big sell-off in tech, in reaction to better than expected inflation report, may seem illogical but it actually was predictable. This AI led tech rally flew too close to the sun and it's getting a little crispy here.\n\nThis is by no means the end of the tech rally, but it's a clear signal that big money is rotating money out of tech and into these beaten down defensives. Especially as we enter the seasonally bearish time of the year in any year, but particularly bearish in election years. The fall.\n\nThis is no secret, hedge funds have been [dumping tech stocks at a record rate](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-27/hedge-funds-are-selling-tech-stocks-aggressively-goldman-says) in recent weeks ahead of this CPI read, and who's been buying? Retail.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/n3v4d0u9zzbd1.png?width=1562&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe83c62d4f343f2f6d5d5dd3a4a6fcac8718b083\n\nSo what's the deal with $PEP, why is it a good deal here?  \n1- The stock is at 52-week lows, but fundamentally the company is still growing and beating estimates.  \n2- There's a defensive rotation starting right now, that happens every year but is especially pronounced in election years and if you catch it early you can make so much money.  \n3- The stock has flashed a couple of very strong technical buy signals. It is now at a major supporting trendline, where the stock bottomed twice before. In the late 2018 market correction and in the COVID crash.  \nIt's at this support trendline again right now.\n\nJust trading at a trendline is not enough on its own to trigger a buy signal. This is where you have to look for other clues that big money is buying and we have plenty of those here.  Sector rotation trackers have been showing that big money has been selling tech and buying staples in anticipation of bearish end of summer into fall seasonality. The stock also formed a double bottom with a bullish divergence. A historically powerful bottoming signal. That indicates stronger conviction by investors at these levels.\n\nA simple mean reversion, to the middle of $PEP's historical uptrend would mean a rally to $190+ before the end of the year. And because $PEP is a low volatility name, options are cheap. Meaning the stock doesn't have to move up much for you to make money hand over first with calls.\n\nPosition :  \n$180 January 2025 call x 120 contracts",

Fast food companies are getting destroyed on margins, because of rising prices not because there is less demand for junk food.  \nTheir customer base is losing spending power due to rising credit card debt and the strain of inflation.\n\nThe \"junk food\" part of the equation can and is being addressed by a lot of food companies, by pivoting toward healthier options. It's a lot of marketing, but some changes are actually substantive. Pepsi's new formula for example has 30% fewer calories, but most people didn't even notice.\n\nThey have a bunch of \"premium\" snack options and many marketed toward the health-conscious consumer as well through many of their branding arms.
