  "selftext": "Kind of a deep thought question here. Why is losing the norm for something that is random at worst (should be 50/50 win/lose) or trending (just go with the flow)? \nThey say (and statistics show) that 85% to 95% of all traders lose money.\n\nWhy isn't that closer to 50%?  \nThis is kind of digging into that issue I know a lot of traders deal with where it seems like if they had just placed the opposite trade, they'd be trillionaires.  A coin flip.  Which should be 50/50, but we know is skewed more toward losing. \nI don't know. I need excedrin. ",

(Can’t remember the name of the study but it looked at 43 million trades among these 10k traders.) \n\nThe study found that traders were cutting their winners early, and holding their losers deep into the red. Fear is the reason you cut your winners early, fear that you’ll lose your profits. Hope is the reason you hold losers too long, hope that it will come back. \n\nIf you can you can retrain your brain to literally do the opposite of human nature (inverse yourself,) you may have a chance at profitability.",

But you're worried that in the next 6 months, the price will drop significantly before your plan to start selling the stock for retirement money. Instead of selling the stock now, you could instead buy something like 14 put contracts with a strike price at or around the current price of the stock, and an expiration date 6 months out.\n\nThis way if the stock price goes up, you're happy because now your investment is worth more. And if the stock price drops massively, no worries because your put contract allows you to sell the stock at the strike price, even if it dropped lower in reality. And the only cost of this safety hedge is the premium that you paid at the outset. That premium is a near guaranteed loss in most situations, but it allows you to smooth out bad situations. This should sound familiar because that's how traditional insurance works. You lose a small amount of money to guarantee avoiding a bad situation later.\n\nSo with that in mind, buying short-dated options contracts just means you are paying high premiums on repeat. Insurance policies are DESIGNED to lose you small amounts of money, so obviously those people who spend lots of money buying loads of insurance policies are going to drain their money away quite quickly.",

Because in the long run the stock market has trended higher, therefore logic dictates that the average participant has to make money over time from being in the stock market. Instead, you may be confused with the observation that most people underperform the market as a whole, which in case the market is down, can also mean you've simply lost less money than the average participant (but you've still outperformed your peers). This underperformance of market gains or losses is a real thing, and can be explained by two things. First, transaction costs eat into your return (logically, the more you trade the higher the transaction costs and the wider the underperformance on average). Second, a lot of people who actively trade do worse not only because of transaction costs, but also because active trading feeds an important psychological bias, namely loss aversion (most people will be heavily inclined to sell when the market is down and avoid further downside, and to buy when the market is at its highs, when optimism reigns supreme and everybody else is making money). Of course this is the exact opposite of what is rational, which is to buy more when the market is down.",
