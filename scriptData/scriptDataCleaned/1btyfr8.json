They then get sold off as scrap to third world countries where nobody gives a shit about safety.\n\nThe write off leads to massive payments by insurers and they pass it on to consumers as higher premiums.",

Bruh I don’t want to be seen in a Tesla now. I’ll just wait for one of the old car companies to release one, at least that way I don’t have to worry about of Elons baggage.",
