My thinking was if 50 is already priced in then it will either be:   \n  \n1) Surprise 25 cut ->TLT tanked   \n2) J Pow has to be perfect in his statement to dangle some hope into the market for a blow off top rally or we get a sell the news situation. \n\n  \nI was hoping for a rally in equities and bonds after Jpow statement. He didn't deliver. Anyways, the hedge worked out but I am not happy making money on my hedge lmao.",

Sell UVXY calls was not a celebration (got out of SPX bc of a limit call at a local top, so not complaining. Just, this is hard.)",

But Powell's words and the current spike in long term yields have me a bit unsure on whether we can expect yields on the 20 and 30 year treasuries to lower. I hold TMF and am up about 10% even after the downturn today. Though, I may exit my position if I feel long term yields will hold steady at 4%.",
