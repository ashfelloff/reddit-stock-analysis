I worked for nvidia from 2008-2013, upon joining I got 1000 nvidia shares, then recession hit and nvidia stock was around $2.50, company did a stock buyback on unvested stocks for $2 per and I sold all for $2000. I worked there for 5 years and accumulated another 1200 shares by 2012 by various bonuses and such, while exiting company I sold all the stock for $23k. \n\nI still hate myself for it.
