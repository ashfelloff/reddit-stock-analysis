  "selftext": "Intel reports its earnings today after the bell, and I'm confident they'll beat expectations. Intel's CEO, Patrick P. Gelsinger, has been dropping a lotta bible quotes on his X account recently:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rpyl0yt9v4yd1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=39fa6cd2dc6edb07364e7143421ed040c086f95f\n\nI believe these have meaning. He is hinting that things are going south at Intel; it‚Äôs just plain ol fearmongering. Then tonight, he publishes his big D energy earnings report and this stock will skyrocket 20%\n\nThis dinosaur company hasn't even recovered from the dot-com bubble crash, which is why expectations are so low now. I see this as an excellent buying opportunity; this company won't shit the bed today, as there's literally no expectation for them to win.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/in0rv030x4yd1.png?width=646&format=png&auto=webp&s=08e5ae2998aa805689608cca3b50038a72128b44\n\nPositions:\n\n[$16k in shares using 5x leveraged CFD's since im eurotrash](https://preview.redd.it/2brffp25y4yd1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c3f1325e27b2ec6a33ecf819d8c6d1c8c2b523)\n\nFor nanaü§ûü§ûüïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏èüïäÔ∏è\n\n*Not financial advice*",
