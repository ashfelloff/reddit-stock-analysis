I think they screwed up by pulling a McDonald's and jacking up overall prices to a point that resulted in a net loss. We have data that shows the consumer isn't weakening, they are being more selective/making value judgements as to where they spend $$$\n\n-They have to create a steaming product that results in mass adoption. They'll never beat Netflix. But no one will. They need to create a product that is a strong second though. Think AMD to NVDA. Which is going to be tough bc they have a fairly specific brand and can't really venture into realms that are easy money(sex and violence).\n\nBut they do have bookoo money to throw at these problems. They were smart being back Bob Iger. It'll be interesting to see what he does in the next five years.\n\nSo far it has been a cost cutting exercise, which I think was needed, but the next phase has to be reimagining the product to some extent.",

For the most part the big comic book story arcs grew organically, driven by people who liked the characters and had ideas for cool stuff they could do.
