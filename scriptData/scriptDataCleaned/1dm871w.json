Wouldn't that happen, you know, *during or before all that* ?\n\nThe second whistleblower *died after fighting pneumonia in a hospital over the period of 2 weeks.*\n\nI quote this article: [https://globalnews.ca/news/10465319/boeing-whistleblower-joshua-dean-dead-737-max/](https://globalnews.ca/news/10465319/boeing-whistleblower-joshua-dean-dead-737-max/)\n\n>**He tested positive for influenza B and an MRSA staph infection and later developed pneumonia**, according to a Facebook post from Dean’s mother.\n\nCare to tell me how Boeing off'd these two guys since all evidence and motive (this being **the fact they had already gone public with everything**) point to the contrary?
