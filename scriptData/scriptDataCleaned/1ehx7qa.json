It narrowed its net loss to $157 million, or a loss of 38 cents per share, from $170 million, or a loss of 44 cents per share, during the same period last year.\n\nThe delivery service company said it received 635 million total orders in the quarter, up 19% year over year. DoorDash said its Marketplace GOV, which it defines as the total value of orders, was $19.71 billion, marking an increase of 20% from the year prior.\n\nFor its third quarter, DoorDash said it expects to report Marketplace GOV between $19.4 billion and $19.8 billion. Analysts were expecting $19.51 billion, according to StreetAccount estimates.\n\n“We are very pleased with our financial performance in Q2 2024, as it reflects years of investment and product-level focus that drove strong growth and improved unit economics in several major areas of our business,” the company wrote in a release Thursday.",
