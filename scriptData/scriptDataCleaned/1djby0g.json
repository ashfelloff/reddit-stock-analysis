  "selftext": "This upcoming Thursday, June 20th, and Friday, June 21st, have the WORST 5-day average returns of any day outside of three days in late September.  This is based on over 70 years of stock market data.   The week including June 20-27 is the 2nd worst period of the year, down over 70% of the time.  The QQQ has a gap to fill at $269.  Many people will be caught on the wrong side of the market shortly.  Since history sometimes repeats, I need some luck. I went almost all in on short-term QQQ and \"the seven\" PUTS over the next two weeks.  Looking for 20X and rubbing that lucky rabbit's foot. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bu7kktopxg7d1.jpg?width=936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=783e6d999c6851530023d75583f53b4ba9b0f74a\n\nsometimes repeats,",
