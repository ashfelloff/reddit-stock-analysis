There is a very good chance that YouTube might soon be inserting ads directly in the video stream rather than pulling them from an external server and pausing the Stream and playing the video on top of the stream that is paused. I'm not sure if that makes sense but basically they found a way to beat the ad blockers but they have not implemented it yet because they think it might drive away users. It's possible it might happen though",
