                  "body": "Its just an interesting data point that reveals a potential crack in the foundation of equities. Corporate buybacks support rising share prices and without cash to do these buy backs, thats one less buyer in the market when equities are at ath. (Most would prefer not to buy at ath)\n\n\nThe level of cash alone is not enough information to make any thesis, but if coupled with debt levels one could conclude a narrative to falling cash levels and determine the risk for markets. If debt levels simultaneously fell, during this cash reduction cycle, than we can assume the cash drain was to pay down debt. Nothing to worry about...however if debt is still high, or rising, than what you end up with is high and dangerous leverage that CAN not necessarily will, cause blow ups in the event of a recession. ",

My read is the opposite, cash is being pushed into the markets, it’s a zero sum game, and the cash is getting turned into receivables and inventory. \n\nAlso cash can go negative, most companies use some kind of revolving line of credit for unexpected expenses / delayed receivables, but I’m not seeing cash going to 0 it’s at 8.8%.",

                              "body": "You’re not really arguing against what I said just that the level is above 0 and can go lower. You’re trying to focus on the absolute level rather than the relative level - liquidity is “relatively low” compared to the other periods. In other words there’s less liquidity than most of the periods in the chart. Therefore liquidity is “low” in the market.\n\nMy example of $0 was also a personal finance example, which obviously isn’t 100% identical to a business or the general market. So again the absolute level isn’t the important part it’s that it is a historically low figure.\n\nNow navigating back to the main point - if liquidity was in the market…..that would show up somewhere as…..liquidity.\n\nLike - if I had $20 and gave you $20 in cash - there would be $20 in cash across the two of us.\n\nBut the S&P 500 chart is showing that….cash isn’t staying in cash. So it either went to buy something illiquid, it was used to pay for something that was already accounted for, or it was removed from the market.\n\nSo for the first one - if you took cash and bought an office building - the accounting equation holds but you’ve traded liquidity for an illiquid asset. So overall cash balances would decline, and I’d argue office real estate probably isn’t a great investment so they may not get their cash back.\n\nSecond one - what if the company already had a high payables balance and they…..paid it? Cash would go away and payables would go away….leaving the company with less cash. Sure they can run the payable up again, but not if their creditor thinks cash flow is going to be a problem.\n\nThe last one - it definitely isn’t a zero sum game. Because central banks can change the math. They can take liquidity out of the market. If banks are paying higher interest rates, then that money is being extracted from the market. If the Federal Reserve is forcing repayment of previously issued liquidity (such as the Bank Term Funding Program or the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility) or the Fed sells bonds (taking cash out of the market)….liquidity will go down and “disappear” from the market",

The periods from 08 all the way to 21 saw a pretty steady climb in cash levels that coincided with ZIRP along with the attempt at rate increases then back to ZIRP.  The ZIRP pushed cash holdings up after that with a massive decline again as rates started to rocket up.   \n\nOn the other hand, that climb out on cash holdings in 20-21 was likely due to covid and the massive spike in profits the companies were making through price increases.  Also, all that cash holding fueled record buyback levels over the last 10 years.  Basically, posting the graph by itself might just be more 🌈🐻 wishcasting.",

And now you extrapolate that expertise to be pretty-close-to-valid across different fields and competencies. You feel you are quite smart, and your understanding and insights can be valuable more broadly than just your area of expertise from research/industry.\n\n\nWhen you get a little more experienced, you'll learn by yourself the fallacies of that approach, hopefully without too many painful consequences. Stay humble, don't take too many big risks based on your own 'expertise'.",
