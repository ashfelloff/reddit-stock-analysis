  "selftext": "I bought some futures last tuesday and am currently up 290% since.\nIs this going to be the next cacao? \nOr is the increasing price of coffee just fueled by exaggerated concern over the weather in Brazil and Vietnam? Will the situation in the red sea continue to drive up the prices for coffee roasters?\n\n”Coffee prices on Tuesday closed moderately higher, with Arabica climbing to a 1-1/2 year high and robusta coffee posting a new all-time high.  Coffee crop concerns in Brazil and Vietnam are fueling fund buying of coffee futures.  Somar Meteorologia reported Monday that Brazil's Minas Gerais region received 15.8 mm of rainfall in the past week, or 74% of the historical average.  Minas Gerais accounts for about 30% of Brazil's arabica crop.  Robusta coffee is surging to new record highs on fears that excessive dryness in Vietnam will limit the country's robusta coffee production.” \nRead more here: https://www.barchart.com/story/news/25522213/coffee-prices-settle-higher-on-global-crop-concerns",
