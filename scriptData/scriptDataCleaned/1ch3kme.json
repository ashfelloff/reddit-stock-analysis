  "selftext": "This is fundamentally revolutionary news that could mean a new bull market for cannabis stocks. **13.91%**Â of Canopy Growth's shares are currently sold short. Huge news.\n\n\n\n**Justice Department will move to reclassify marijuana in a historic shift, AP sources say**\n\n  \nWASHINGTON (AP) â€”Â [The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration](https://apnews.com/hub/us-drug-enforcement-administration)Â will move to reclassifyÂ [marijuana](https://apnews.com/hub/marijuana)Â as a less dangerous drug, The Associated Press has learned, a historic shift to generations of American drug policy that could have wide ripple effects across the country.\n\nThe proposal, which still must be reviewed by the White House Office of Management and Budget, would recognizeÂ [the medical uses of cannabis](https://apnews.com/article/marijuana-health-schumer-becerra-dea-c00db5dabbeb9efd94cf17baff241e85)Â and acknowledge it has less potential for abuse than some of the nationâ€™s most dangerous drugs. However, it would not legalize marijuana outright for recreational use.\n\nThe agencyâ€™s move, confirmed to the AP on Tuesday by five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive regulatory review, clears the last significant regulatory hurdle before the agencyâ€™s biggest policy change in more than 50 years can take effect.\n\n",

Saw it up 30% earlier today with an RSI above 90 and was like this is going to sell off. Then it ripped up 5% more so I bought more puts. Then it went up another 7% so I bought even more puts. It kept rising and I kept doubling down on my position and here I am now ðŸ˜‚",
