How much further does he let it fall before attempting to liquidate? If he holds all the way down to the bottom, he would look like a fool but loyal to his followers. But still a fool. If this thing falls to say $10/share, his value would be around $788M, down from the $6.3B. \n\nIf this continues to fall on average 5% per trading day, this thing could hit a $10/pps by May 10th. That is assuming the earnings report on May 3 doesn't rock this thing further as we will find out more on its inability to cover its own debt. Essentially bleeding cash at a more accelerated rate, then prior to the merger, with no viable ability to push income in time of the cash running out.",
