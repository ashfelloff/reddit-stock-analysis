The companies operating on the internet embraced the same model: the service costs nothing, they generate revenue from advertisements and selling user data. This shaped today's conglomerates, where people get their information from facebook for free, but most of it is useless clickbait. \n\nIn the old days people were actually paying for their daily information dose, you had to buy your newspaper to read it. In exchange journalists went out of ther way to inform you impartially, simply because you paid them to do it. \n\nWithout actually lamenting on the pros and cons of these business models, X tries to combine their worst aspects: you get the same user-generated clickbait but from now on you have to pay for it?
