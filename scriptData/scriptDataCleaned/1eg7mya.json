In AMD's case, the metric is unreliable so you look deeper and figure out there is a clear reason it's distorted in this case, which means gaap P/E for AMD is irrelevant because of that circumstance. \n\nP/E is not a great reason to make investment decisions anyway. But discounting amd, which is performing very well financially on a per share, cash flow, and rev growth perspective because of a a gaap accounting practice that will quickly become irrelevant is foolish. \n\nI'm just saying, if your argument for not investing in AMD is \"PE is 300\" you're an idiot that doesn't understand these metrics, what they show, etc. PE is not enough detail. You need to actually read earnings reports and interpret those numbers in the broader context of the business.",

Maybe in a niche  case if you bought leaps for like .05 per contract and got extremely lucky.. however a contract like this, even if it hits $200 by December this year, you’ll still only be up 100%. \n\nHell even if AMD hit $300 today, you’d be up ~869%. Which is obviously extremely unrealistic. So not sure where you got that idea of turning $2500 into a million from leaps",

Was kinda happy my limit order fulfilled when it dropped to $175.\n\nI'm terrible at playing the market and I never trust I can time things right so I mostly just hodl for long-term retirement investments.  Overall I think AMD is positioned pretty decently and Intel keeps shitting the bed, so we'll see what their delayed but soon-to-be-released next generation of CPUs bring.

Now, let's consider what would have happened if you had bought 125 calls for August 30th during the dip today and paid 15.76 per option. The delta on that option was 0.89, and you would have been able to buy 38 contracts at that price. Based on the after-hours closing price of 149.11, you would have made 40.6k on the trade for a profit of about 66%.. If it had dropped to 127, you would have lost 20k, just about as much as you would have lost on the option you bought.\n\nIf you had bought the 125 call for August 16th during the dip today, it would have only been 13.45 per contract. At that price, you could have purchased 45 contracts and made a net profit of 54.7k based on the after-hours closing price. Like the August 30th option, if it had dropped to 127 a share, you would have lost 20k.\n\nYou risked losing 20k to make 15k. In my opinion, the risk here wasn't worth the reward. Personally, I would have chosen one of the more rewarding options above.",
