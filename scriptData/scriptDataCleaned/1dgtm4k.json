However, there are tiers of automakers, and the German big 3 of BMW, Audi, and Mercedes are like a step or two below actual luxury vehicles like Bentleys, Ferraris, rolls Royce, etc.. the German big 3 brands are expensive but still reasonably attainable, and history has shown from the introduction of Lexus and Genesis that those customers can be swayed and won and that pricing does impact their sales.",

While some of them have so far made good progress at this, the process is still going to be long and expensive, and despite how expensive it'll be it's unlikely to make these automakers anymore profitable in the future.

Now China is flooding the market as well. Too little too late.\n\nMercedes also stated that they will stop further development of their E and S class concept EVs, because sales have been bad, the models they got on the market are unpopular and frankly not very aesthetic either.\n\nSo it's a number of issues, but pro ICE lobbying and being asleep at the wheel when it comes to EVs are the most important factors.
