I don‚Äôt see it falling lower than 142 as it‚Äôs in an upward trend line right now and it‚Äôs the bottom of that line right now. So I‚Äôm gonna sell the weekly near the top of the line. I might even sell the monthly too because my goal isn‚Äôt to play on earnings. I got a bad feeling about earnings with all the Open Interest on calls. I like how my calls don‚Äôt have alot of IV though. So with good movement and IV naturally moving up I think i got a pretty safe play. As long as I exit before earnings that is.",

It reflects the increase in contract premiums, which is a result of changes in demand which is a reflection of sentiment. It's the supply and demand aspect of options, except it's mostly just demand.
