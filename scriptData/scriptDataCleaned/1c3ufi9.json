  "score": 125,
  "selftext": "IV is around 70% for calls and puts alike. What is strange to me is that usually with earnings the strike prices exceed well beyond 100% and upwards of 300%….to me this is sus and I expect TSM to be back to $150 by EOW but also this feels trappy and I don’t know why lol.\n\nThoughts?",

                  "body": "I bought 2 calls friday 1 weekly and 1 monthly I plan to get out of the weekly as soon as TSM moves 4 - 5%. I don’t see it falling lower than 142 as it’s in an upward trend line right now and it’s the bottom of that line right now. So I’m gonna sell the weekly near the top of the line. I might even sell the monthly too because my goal isn’t to play on earnings. I got a bad feeling about earnings with all the Open Interest on calls. I like how my calls don’t have alot of IV though. So with good movement and IV naturally moving up I think i got a pretty safe play. As long as I exit before earnings that is.",

And actually, we see today, let's say that the component total value in the the whole AI data center is a very small percentage amount. If we narrow down the AI's component or the semiconductors' value in the whole system, yes, it's a small percentage. But for TSMC, we look at ourself, **the AI's a CAGR, that's the growth rate every year, it's about 50%.** And we are confident that we can capture more opportunities in the future. So that's what we said **that up to 2027, we are going to have high teens of the revenue from a very narrowly defined the AI application**\n\n\n^ this is from the Q&A  from the last earnings call btw \n\n2027 is less than three years away....they project to have high teens of revenue from their AI applications. if not by earnings, but by June (a keynote of sorts is happening) , they're probably gonna unveil exactly how they came up with that projection. \n\nadding the earnings from monthly net revenue, and all the contracts they gobbled up this quarter —my superficial understanding gained from snooping the sentiment on the semi wiki community—, I see plenty of reasons why the IV would jump.\n\n\nbut it could all be priced-in 😪",

But TSM does not act like other tech stocks, it is much more of a slow burn.  I expect TSM to be in the 200s some time n 2025.  It's one of the few sure things out there in the market. \n\nIf TSM were a normal tech stock then its market cap would be pushing 2T.  I don't think it's necessarily worth this.

It reflects the increase in contract premiums, which is a result of changes in demand which is a reflection of sentiment. It's the supply and demand aspect of options, except it's mostly just demand.
