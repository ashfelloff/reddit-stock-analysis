We will be above current ATH and the sharp pull back at first will just seem like a cool down/profit taking but as it always seems to do, turn into something stronger as momentum picks up, couple days to a couple weeks later.\n\nPersonally, i'm waiting until probably Thursday and playing the Friday econ data drop 1DTE YOLO and follow trend from there -- but in all honesty, I'm leaning towards positive movement as the recovery off recent sell off and overall move has just been too strong.  Broadening market PLUS chip sector possibly catching a bid off that fake NVDA sell off is all it will take for SPY to keep running up.  BTW, play of week is IWM calls 1DTE Thursday right before close and then roll up gains into IWM calls 2 weeks out 4-5 strikes OTM.",
