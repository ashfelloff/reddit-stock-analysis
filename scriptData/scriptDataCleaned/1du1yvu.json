I call and explain the situation to them and have the final approver in accounting look at my report before it is submitted again. \n5) I submit the report a third time, and it doesn’t even make it to level four before being rejected for some silly error. \n6) I call the accounting person, and we share a laugh at how absurd our system is. \n7) I vow to never submit another report again but inevitably do.\n\nInstead of someone just fixing a minor problem on a paper form and sending it on, expense reports become a fucking bolder for us to push up the corporate hill like Sisyphus.
