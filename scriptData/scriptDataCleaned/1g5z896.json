  "selftext": "\nTL;DR - Dad got cancer - so I went ham on investing \n\nI've been a long time lurker of this sub (and I never really post on reddit in general), but I didn't know where else to post this. I don't do options so maybe this is the wrong place lmao.\n\nI moved back home to my parents place when my dad was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. Truthfully this has been the worst year of my life (and his obviously) in a lot of ways, but I've been investing since I was 16 (I'm 25 now). My dad worked in equities, so when he lost his ability to communicate effectively with me (and since I had significantly more income because I'm not paying rent) - I truthfully went ballistic on investing.\n\nPretty much said fuck it, I'm living at home I don't need a 6 month emergency fund till I move out and went all-in. Granted 40% of my portfolio not listed here is in a 401k account entirely in the S&P 500 (set & forget just in case my equities went to hell as with the rest of my life lol).\n\nI believe in the margin of safety when investing. I like to invest in high-quality companies that generate lots of cash as the backbone of my portfolio. Since 2021 (before my dad got this cancer shit), I spoke with him and he basically said just look at the fundamentals of a company and invest in growth companies that you think will be around in 5-10 years. I look for value within growth stocks (i know paradoxical). Some of my icons in investing are David Tepper & Michael Burry. Again below is all my own experience and reflects **only** my own views and are not a recommendation of my company (corporate. disclaimer).\n\n* My portfolio is heavily weighted (85%) between several stocks: AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL (So fucking cheap r u kidding me sorry), NVDA, AMZN, AMD, CRM, COST, RIVN (RIP), AVGO, VOO (ik not a stock) <-- I know semi(s) are very cyclical but i believe in holding all of these companies for 5-10 years, so I don't have to worry about temp. earnings beats/misses etc. Much easier to pick a stock and hold it for a while then it is to get the timing right. Roughly at 175% return in the past 3 years. (hammered META at $100's, NVDA at $200 both in 2022)\n* Roughly 15% of my bets are moonshots (note the word bet hehe) with promise but objectively could be overvalued/bad investments: CCL/RCL (both are crushing it and between them own 75% of the cruise line market), LCID/RIVN (going to 0 bc they can't scale profitably or will make u a very happy person 3 years down the line bc R2/Atlas at 45k/50k should capture a significant portion of model y demand), TTD, DKNG/FLUT - gambling hasn't even been legalized in Cali/Texas (the biggest markets in the U.S. come on), RBLX (feels like betting against youtube in the early innings w/o realizing how much rev. they're actually recognizing), PYPL (value - cheap af (bought at $60) should turn around in a couple years)\n\nI joke I allocate like google's budget where it's 90% bread&butter and the rest are moonshots.\n\nWas very depressed (still reasonably depressed) because I'm not sure how much time my dad has. I hope in a way I can pass some of these stocks to my kid in a better place than I found it. I don't know I'm crying as I write this. Fuck my life. It is what it is. Gonna smoke a joint and drink a gin and tonic.\n\nCheers\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/j8ym4lkamdvd1.png?width=1198&format=png&auto=webp&s=70c707919d6301944c8ff8cbbcb33ed03c9e6837",
