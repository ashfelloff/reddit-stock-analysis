  "selftext": "They have a shareholder meeting on June 6. It's a great opportunity to discuss their plans to introduce weight loss pills and injectables: [https://investors.hims.com/governance/Proxy-Materials/default.aspx](https://investors.hims.com/governance/Proxy-Materials/default.aspx).\n\nThat meeting might potentially have a positive impact on their stock so buy until it isn't too late. What do you think?\n\nHere the boring stats:\n\nHIMS has surpassed guidance for the 13th consecutive quarter and raised it again. Here's a quick summary: they have an 82% gross margin, a 12% adjusted EBITDA, 41% subscriber growth, and repurchased $28 million worth of stock in Q1. Most impressively, they boast an 85% long-term retention rate.",

In my state, other compounding pharmacies do offer those at a much lower cost than what you would get commercially - a loophole for people who want those injectables without paying $1000+ without insurance (which only covers diabetes right now). There are suppliers that offer semiglutide/tirzepatide for sterile pharmacies to compound at a fraction of a cost. It's a little bit of a gray market right now, so I'm unsure if it would be worth the risk for HIMS to do so since they operate in the whole US and not just the states that have loopholes for it right now.",
