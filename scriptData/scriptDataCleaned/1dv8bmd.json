The last purchase price was around 108$!\n\nAverage price before split is $184 which has given me Million rs gain now.\n\nI still believe nvda would be the number one company in the world in terms of market capitalisation.\nTotal shares now:107\nAvg price:$18.43\nInvested amount:$1973\nCurrent value:$14520\nMultiplier:x7.35\n\nThe only regret is I should have prepared well for my nvda interview in 2017!",
