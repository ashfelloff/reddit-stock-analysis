  "selftext": "It seems that Reddit is heading towards disaster, and it’s only a matter of time. The decline will likely start when they roll out paid subreddits: ttps://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215505/reddit-paid-subreddits-steve-huffman-q2-2024-earnings\n\nReddit seems to have forgotten that its rise to prominence only happened because users fled Digg after it botched its redesign and introduced paid groups. Digg was actually superior to Reddit in my opinion, but Reddit is now making the same fatal mistakes that brought Digg down.\n\nBack in the Digg era, bots weren’t an issue. Today, Reddit is overrun with them, and the company does little to address the problem. On paper, bots may seem beneficial—lots of posts, high engagement—but it’s a false sense of user activities growth. Take this example: https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/s/Rx85k2sh3T a post on r/DIY had significant engagement until I pointed out it was just a meme. I am sure that someone got upset about helping a stupid bot.\nThe decision to shut down Reddit’s API was another blunder. \n\nDisclosure: I’ve never owned Reddit stock, have never placed any bets on it, and don’t plan to in the future.\n\nReddit alternatives: https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditAlternatives/top/",
