  "selftext": "It's time boys and girls. Earnings season is back and there is one sharp knife in the collection. TSLA. Yep, the price action on this is insane towards the $150 April 26th puts.\n\nWho here has leveraged their house on a third HELOC at 9.66% to buy into the downside of this fantastic firesale? I know I have.\n\nNothing can stop this train wreck to coming to a completion after tomorrow's earnings.\n\nWhat wild and crazy thing will Elon say that can save this ship from an impending port side collapse?\n\nLook no further than previous earnings calls to get a load of what might be in store.\n\n>If interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good and if they don't come down quickly they won't be that good,\" he said. \"We have lots of people who want to buy our car, but simply can't afford it.\n\nI don't know Mr. Musk, Ford motor company is offering the Mach E for 0.00 apr financing for 72 months. Interest rates aren't coming down anytime soon so the notion that Musk can call out to full year guidance isn't even a realistic thing. Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye.\n\nWhat's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot.\n\nWhat about this doozy of a foresight\n\n>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,\" Musk said. \"Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff.\n\nI don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the \"chips\".\n\n[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)\n\nNvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture.\n\nThe point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players.\n\nThis is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.\n\nAnd all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.\n\nBut there's more\n\nTesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.\n\nIn a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.\n\nSo the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.\n\n>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping \"some number of Optimus units next year.\" \n\nSo what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.\n\nIf Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.\n\nMatter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.\n\nIn the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.\n\nI do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.\n\nI don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.\n\nCathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.\n\nhere's the price action and it's a sight to behold\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o17ais3kw4wc1.png?width=1416&format=png&auto=webp&s=57797003a6594ecdd0b09ecc540254a8be63ceec\n\nPositions - Small Short about to be a LARGE short.",

It is pure incompetence, it is a billionaire out of touch with how normal people spend.\n\nIt is not understanding that lower price isn't all great for consumers as it means lower residual values for the vehicles. Keeping the list price higher and offering 0% finance, and even cashback, will cost him the same amount and is better overall for customers.\n\nPeople are pissed when something they buy is suddenly $3000 cheaper, they feel that has devalued what they have just bought, but would only shrug if they missed out of a 0% deal.",
