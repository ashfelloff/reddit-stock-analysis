  "score": 604,
  "selftext": "Amazon said Wednesday it's cutting hundreds of jobs in its cloud computing unit AWS as part of a strategic shift.\n\nThe company will trim ‚Äúa few hundred roles‚Äù in the team that overlooks technology for physical stores, a move that comes just a day after Amazon said it was ditching Just Walk Out technology in its U.S. grocery stores.\n\nIn addition to the physical stores technology team, Amazon said it‚Äôs cutting ‚Äúseveral hundred roles‚Äù in the AWS sales, marketing and global service organization. Most of those cuts are related to business changes in AWS training and certification programs as well as sales operations. The tech giant said it was also making cuts elsewhere so it can invest in other business priorities.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-cutting-hundreds-jobs-cloud-152552547.html",
