You design a chip and have tsm make it.\n\nAnd TSM became really good at manufacturing chips. \n\nNow this didn't happen overnight, while tsm was setting up and plowing huge amount to R&D and investing in its manufacturing, Intel was sleeping and thought they were so far ahead.\n\nIt used most of its money to pay dividends or buy back stock.
