                  "body": "That is the effect of an increasing IV. If the IV has not increased it will lose value at the rate of Theta which gets more negative as the expiration date approaches. By the expiration theta becomes 0, IV becomes mostly irrelevant (unless there is a huge swing right before expiration), and the value of the contract is almost exactly the price of the asset minus the strike for the contract.   \n  \nYour break even takes into account the cost of acquiring the contract in the first place so your take home value at expiration is price of the asset minus the strike + your buy in for the contract.  \n  \nIV is a trailing indicator that in a way gives leading yields, if it moves a lot either up or down the price will increase or decrease in proportion to the movement giving a profit opportunity that is OFTEN more than the actual underlying value of the contract assuming you had a good buy in and sold during the volatility.   \n  \nWhen IV is high \"IV Crush\" is the IV dropping back to a more normal baseline and your contract becoming less inflated. If you purchase at the top of a volatile spike your call gets fucked with no relation to the value of the strike. ie you buy a $12 strike at 300% IV at a 13.20 underlying price where the contract is valued at like 1.55 or so, and it then goes sideways for 2 days... even if the value is still 12.50 (.50 over strike) you may lose an additional 20-30% of the value of the contract because the IV dropped. So that -0.70 drop in reality could be -1.00 per contract. Even though the call is still in the money the scale of the value has lowered giving you a larger loss than you may have been expecting. \n\nAll of the greeks have impact on options prices",
