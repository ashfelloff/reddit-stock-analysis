That was their way of doing business so far and not likely to change. Their operating margins are nice, between 30-50% over the last two decades, but they're not going to set their prices sky high and wait for money to rain on them. \n* They operate multiple facilities in Taiwan and elsewhere but only part of that capacity is high end processes that are required to produce AI accelerators.\n* Even if they wanted to ramp up high end processes, building and staffing new facilities is expensive and time consuming. So is replacing existing older process lines. In regard terms - they cannot scale up very fast.\n* The actual demand for AI chips might be cooling down a bit in the near future. High cost of capital combined with lack of effective monetization will start killing AI startups.\n* There's a lot of research going on around making models more efficient, alternative accelerator chip architectures, etc. Current LLMs are kind of a brute force solution. On the other hand, there's still a lot of potential niches that this iteration of AI technologies has not expanded into. If and how this all translates into chip demand is anyone's guess.",

Even without AI boom they were doing great, with only Samsung to worry about. Chip demand is somewhat cyclical, depending on the segment, but they were maintaining heealthy margins regardless.\n\nThey are the beloved child of Taiwanese government, getting all the support they need. They are the company all Taiwanese parents would like their children to work at, top dog in their most important industry. Meaning they have infrastructural, legal and financial support, steady inflow of well educated and motivated workforce.\n\nThey won't likely find that much success in the USA where the wages are higher, especially in areas where they do have some problems recruiting (software & AI), enviromental issues may get in the way more, and the government might decide to help Intel become the leader in the end (provided Intel can finally get it's shit together). But they are expanding into Japan as well, and this seems to go smoothly and both wages and culture there are more in their favor.\n\nThe main risk to their dominance is China. If Xi decides to blockade, invade or burn Taiwan to the ground before they successfully expand globally they are fucked. If China has the change of heart, renounces the mistakes of the last decade and sanctions get lifted SMIC will try to eat TSM's lunch. They enjoy similar levels of government support and mainland has much much deeper pockets. They've been stealing what they can, poaching top talent from TSM & Samsung, and had some limited success with going forward, despite being cut off from the high end machinery.\n\nRe: valuation.\n\nNVDA: p/e 70.93, forward p/e 27.81  \nTSM: p/e 25.18, forward p/e 17.50  \nASML: p/e 45.45, forward p/e 28.09\n\nAt face value this seems true, they are less overvalued. But that's ignoring the specifics. While all 3 are part of the same food chain and undisputed (for now) leaders in their respective niches, they are in different places, have different risks associated, different problems with growth. TSM is the most \"manufacturing\" and least \"tech\" of the three so it makes sense that it would have lower multiples.\n\n I'd have to write another essay (and probably do some research first as I didn't look into them lately) to back it up so I leave it at that.",

This is my subjective take and without doing any research lately so I may be wrong.\n\nASML is an equipment  producer. They do a lot of research, maintain their own large network of suppliers and subcontractors (they even buy the ones that they deem of critical importance). The end product is a bunch of insanely complex and expensive machines that are tailored to each customer's needs, and come with a long term maintenance contract and a team of maintenance engineers working on-site with the customer.\n\nTSM is a mass-producer. Due to the nature of their product they also do a lot of research, maintain a network of suppliers (ASML being one of the more important ones), but the core of their bussiness is putting together and optimizing production lines. Don't get me wrong, this is still insanely complex and research intensive process, so maybe the only difference is my own perception, but at first glance they are more towards the manufacturing end of spectrum than ASML. They have more manufacturing type overhead (look up how many various toxic chemicals they need to operate, or how do they have to pre-process water before they can use it, or how they handle seismic risks) than ASML in my opinion.",

A lot of people will want access to these models to produce whatever content their mind can think of.\n\nWhile Intel and Samsung may overtake TSMC given continually updating manufacturing processes, currently TSMC is best positioned given market share and their dominance in lower nm chips.",

It makes you more productive but human is still required for guidance and reasoning. With Copilot it's even more important than with a forklift - the domain is more complex and forklifts don't hallucinate stuff.\n\nThere's been some preliminary studies done for other white collar professions and, as far as I remember, the conclusions were similar. AI assistants speed up work by significant percentage. The effect is greater for inexperienced  professionals than for veterans. They tend to make stupid mistakes though because they aren't really smart, just very good at pattern matching and extrapolation.\n\nThis might change in the future but for the near term it doesn't look like mass unemployment and the end of civilization as we know it.",

Where they sit in the value chain they arent profiting as much as say nvidia for the h100s bring fabbed. And they dont have a lot of room for upside surprise - they have their plants running 24/7 already. A longer backorder of brands basically renting their plants wont increase profits next quarter. Pretty sure every high-memory nvidia card and ASML machine shipped from now til 2025 has already been pre-purchased. That kinda only leaves room for cancellations which would not help margins. Nvidia is creating wholly new revenue streams moving into cloud and supercomputing. TSMC amortizes the most expensive machinery on earth next to the LHC. Their margins and growth potential are not similar. (MSFT Azure has the highest margins per card because they amortize them with value added software and copilot subscriptions.)",
