It‚Äôs simpler than you think. \n\nCovered call is like a limit sell order with the strike price being the price you are willing to sell your shares at.\n\nA cash secured put is like a limit buy order with the strike being the price per share you are willing to buy.\n\nThis is a good way to see how quickly an options contract gains or loses value. You get to keep the premium you sold it for no matter how that premium changes going forward. As the seller you usually like to see the premium fall because you can close out the contract by buying it back at a cheaper price than you sold it if you change your mind about your CC or CSP. Or, if it falls to zero, not only did you already pocket that premium but no buying or selling of shares takes place.\n\nThe expiration date is when the contract will either go to 0 value or get assigned if in the interest of the buyer of your options contract.\n\nBeing assigned is basically the execution of your limit order as outlined above.\n\nMaybe you know all this already.
