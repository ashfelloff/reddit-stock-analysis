  "selftext": "Tribute to the guy that said Boeing was toast and bought weekly puts. I felt it was under appreciated as a YOLO so I stepped it up with a position that‚Äôs smaller than his losses - to see who wins ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è \nBullish:\n\nChina news.. seems more bullish IMO than all the major setbacks pricing BA stock in at -32.78% YTD for those that will point to that.. https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/08/40571260/boeing-sees-strong-demand-for-planes-in-china-expects-fleet-to-double-by-2043 \nFeel better about demand for their planes - sure just wait a few extra decades with Airbus if you want to make a statement.. Moving on..\n\nOh and it‚Äôs the most undervalued defense contractor right now.. period.\n\nThey have basically max order on a patriot air defense component too.. blank check on production https://www.asahi.com/sp/ajw/articles/15354795\n\nAlso don‚Äôt forget the Iron Dome is going to be deployed forever on battlefields & NATO countries, etc on buffer zones.. https://www.businessinsider.com/how-boeing-helped-develop-israels-missile-defense-system-2024-4?amp\nAll the old bombs being dropped - yep they make shit for that.. Think Ukraine/ Russia - they inked a $7.5 Billion deal for those with üá∫üá∏ Gov recently. https://www.defensenews.com/air/2024/05/28/boeing-wins-75-billion-contract-from-us-air-force-for-guided-bombs/\nGet to Da Choppa!!\nApache‚Äôs?!? Yup multiple countries just ordered in the last week - Australia last 24 hours.. Poland signed LOI for like $12B per S Korea article below üëá for almost 10% of the amount of equivalent Apache‚Äôs in TOTAL operating world wide essentially (article below about S Korea $3.5B  - there https://verticalmag.com/press-releases/poland-signs-loa-for-96-boeing-ah-64e-apache-helicopters/\nLike Apache‚Äôs some more? So does USA üá∫üá∏ like S Korea having some more $3.5B - just dropped.. https://theaviationist.com/2024/08/22/us-approves-sale-of-apache-helicopters-to-south-korea/\nAlso restocking Israel from old supplies.. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-10/boeing-sped-1-000-smart-bombs-to-israel-after-the-hamas-attacks?embedded-checkout=true\n\nConclusion: Let‚Äôs not forget the current skirmish to WW3 (hopefully avoided..) just runs through rotation of old stock to new stock of Boeing defense related stuff highlighted above - they are on max order to catch up the arsenal for üá∫üá∏ & NATO for a long long time.. \n\nCherry on top: An activist steps in.. long overdue - will send it 20% just on gap fills and still be red on the year 10%! ü§î \n\n",
