The line increasing means that either the yield for 1 year bonds is going up, the yield for 2 year bonds is going down, or usually both to some degree. Yield is influenced by a lot of things like investor demand, interest rates and interest rate expectations, economic outlook, inflation and inflation expectation, and risk aversion, but it means that money is flowing towards long term assets.\n\nThe expectation is that the economy will be weaker in the short term than it will be in the long run.",
