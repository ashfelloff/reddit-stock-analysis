So, it's very likely you will never get a clear picture on how the company is doing until it blows up.\n\nThe olympus scandal of 2011 revealed the company hid losses for decades. It was only discovered because the first non-Japanese ceo almost immediately blew the whistle after his appointment.\n\nWe saw similar events with Nissan and even Toshiba, where the government actively intervenes to help their local enterprise cover/manage fraud to the detriment of foreign investors. The operating principle seems to be along the lines of \"its OK to be scammed by our people, so long as we don't get scammed by outsiders.\" \n\nBelow is an article I remember when the Toshiba issue popped up.\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/independent-probe-says-toshiba-agm-last-year-was-not-fairly-managed-2021-06-10/",

          "body": "These scandals were bad but the comparison to China is ludicrous. In general, accounting gets strange with companies that are national champions and/or more government-facing due to larger geostrategic objectives. This is true in all countries. A wide swath of Chinese companies fit into this mold whereas in Japan there are only a handful. And if you look at the [biggest accounting scandals](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_scandals) in history and sort by country, US companies make up >70% the list.\n\nIn my experience, the IR materials for small to mid-cap Japanese companies tend to be really straightforward. If anything they tend to make lowball revenue and earnings targets and then over perform. Their main flaw is too much assets (cash, land, shares in other companies) on their balance sheets and not enough good debt leading to P/Bs <1. But the recent wave of shareholder reforms is unlocking a lot of that dead capital and making Japan a great place for value investors (if you can handle currency fluctuations).\n\nE: Regarding reforms, imagine if the NYSE told all listed companies that they have to increase their P/B or be downgraded or even delisted. This is what the Tokyo Stock Exchange is doing right now. It’s brutal but has been great for shareholders via larger dividends and repeated stock buybacks. The low P/B is largely due to a phenomenon called a balance sheet recession (described by Richard Koo), which led to companies being way too overcapitalized.",
