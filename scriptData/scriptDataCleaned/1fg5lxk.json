Analysts were modeling earnings of $4.67 a share on sales of $5.6 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter. Adobe's guidance would translate to year-over-year growth of 9% in earnings and 10% in sales.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-forecasts-downbeat-quarterly-earnings-cautious-tech-spending-2024-09-12/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-forecasts-downbeat-quarterly-earnings-cautious-tech-spending-2024-09-12/)",
