The applicant was then required to fill out the piece of paper. The information that was asked of the applicant on the piece of paper was minimal and in a lot of cases ‚Äúnot factual.‚Äù Your bank then took the completed piece of paper and a really happy person who called them selves a lender or mortgage broker found a way to take whatever information the piece of paper had on it and qualify the applicant for a loan, or in some cases, multiple loans.\n\nLike this.\nApplicant: I just got a job as 2nd shift manager at Wendy‚Äôs and would like to buy a $800,000 home. \nBank: okay here‚Äôs a form\nApplicant: fills out said form and says they make $130,000 a year and has qualified accounts holding $300,000 in them.\nBank: thanks for completing the form, we arnt actually going to require that you prove any of the information you wrote down is correct because we have a team of mortgage brokers who are really interested in making $1,600 by approving this application.\nApplicant: Really?\nBank: Yes, your approved. Enjoy your 9% ARM loan in your new $800,000 home!\nApplicant: sweet! \n\nDipshits everywhere were approved for loans they never should have been. To boot, these dipshits were okay with Adjustable Rate Mortgages. With no money down! What was the worst that could happen? The new homeowner may one day realize they will get foreclosed on by the bank when the obvious $14/hr they were making at Wendy‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt pay the $6,000/month mortgage? Why yes, that‚Äôs exactly the worse that could happen. New happy Wendy‚Äôs employee homeowner got foreclosed on. Didn‚Äôt give two shits either cuz guess what, they didn‚Äôt have a house before and could just go back to renting. And because they didn‚Äôt have to put money down on the home up front, they didn‚Äôt lose anything. In fact, they gained a cool place to live for 18 months. The banks lost though. Now they had a boat load of foreclosures and no one wanting to buy them.\n\nWhile all this is taking place, dipshits on WallStreet were bundling these bad loans as ‚Äúgood loans‚Äù and selling them to dipshits like you and I who\nThink the stock market is real.\n\nUh oh, these loans that are bundled as ‚Äúgood debt‚Äù but were really caca now sat in our portfolios, among some very big companies portfolios. They were now worthless though. BECAUSE NO ONE WAS EVER GOING TO PAY THEM BACK.\n\nNow we are here and have been here since Covid fucked shit up. SLABS or Student Loan Asset Based Security. Sold as a ‚Äúgood debt‚Äù security. Because cmon, who won‚Äôt pay their student loans back?",

He claimed he made $100k a year (like $180k now) working in a Mariachi band. His only documentation? A picture of him wearing a Mariachi suit. And remember, those NINJA loans were often $0 down - they‚Äôd give you a loan for 80% of the price, then immediately write a secondary loan for the remaining 20%. Sometimes they‚Äôd make it 25%, and folks would walk away with a house priced 2x its value with $20-30k in their pocket. If you didn‚Äôt live through it, it‚Äôs hard to believe how crazy shit was in 2006-7.\n\nEdit: No Income No Job or Assets",
