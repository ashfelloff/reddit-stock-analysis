  "score": 186,
  "selftext": "Hey fellow Redditors! 🌟\n\nBuckle up because I’ve been on the trading rollercoaster for the past 10 years, and boy, what a ride it’s been! 🎢\n\nAbout three years ago, I decided to throw my hat (and some cash) into the options ring with OCGN. Spoiler alert: I hit the jackpot and made $100K! 💰🎉 But just when I thought I was on top of the world, I decided to test my luck again with a put option for SPY. Let’s just say the universe had other plans for me, and I lost a whopping $80K. 😱\n\nFast forward a bit, and now I'm in a love-hate relationship with taxes. Apparently, Uncle Sam wanted his slice of the pie too, and I had to take out a loan to pay taxes because of a wash sale. Who knew trading could come with a side of financial acrobatics? 🤹‍♂️\n\nNow, for the last three years, I’ve gone all in on one biotech company. It's like my version of a romantic commitment—complete with hopes, dreams, and a bit of anxiety. So here I am, wondering: should I keep trading and risk my sanity (or what’s left of it) or throw in the towel and embrace the peaceful life of a non-trader? \n\nWhat do you all think? Keep the trading adventure alive or retire my trading hat for good? Your insights are much appreciated! \n\nLet the comments roll in! 😄💬",

Most biotech don’t make money at all unless they have a solid pipeline that’s in commercial or have success in phase 2 (even then stocks get super shorted). Looking at this company, their pipeline isn’t that strong. The space in Alzheimer’s is very difficult in general because it’s a rare illness. Plus even if the drug gets approved, it is a rare disease so there isn’t much profit. GMP (good manufacturing practices which ensures compliance and regulations in manufacturing) is heavily enforced in drug manufacturing and it seem like they have issues in data integrity which is huge in the fda world. Not a financial advice but I would stay away unless it’s squeezing just purely from technical perspective when day trading.\n\nThe way some of these companies survive is a buy out from large companies like Pfizer or Merck which they would own the pipeline but again the Alzheimer’s is a rare illness so not sure how likely.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owdlyi1suwyd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=751e42f75b9dbf85ef06e798b4eab794c8b289fd",
