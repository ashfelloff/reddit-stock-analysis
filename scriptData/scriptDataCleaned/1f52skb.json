The Microsoft deal was announced January 2022. Buffet states the subsequent purchases were made after the transaction was announced and were based on the market price of Activision, again *after* the deal was announced. He's got slides that walk through the share prices in the days in late January showing this thinking.\n\nBuffet said they had \"no prior knowledge\" of the Microsoft transaction. He explained the second round of purchases in 2022 as \"an arbitrage deal\" and elaborated saying \"\\[i\\]f the deal goes through, we make some money, and if the deal doesn’t go through, who knows what happens.\"\n\n[Source](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/30/buffett-berkshire-owns-9point5percent-of-activision-blizzard-shares-in-merger-arbitrage-bet.html) (watch the video, it's less than five mins)",
