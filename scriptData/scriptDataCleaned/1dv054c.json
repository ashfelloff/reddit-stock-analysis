  "selftext": "Saw a post from someone with 92 Microsoft shares who made profits this month in a bull market and was hyping ‚Äúlong term investing‚Äù. Just wanted to be the devils advocate and let you know that you would have made a lot more if you had some balls and bought options. For reference most of the gains were on $msft $appl options holding 90 days from expiry, selling around 45 days out. Usually buying $20 off strike. I know for some apes this isn‚Äôt very bold and I don‚Äôt think so either, relatively conservative but pick sound stocks, check macro trends and invest like you‚Äôre trying to make money, not like you‚Äôre scared to lose it. (These are all realized gains, currently do not hold any options, evident given my buying power) \n",
