And flip phones can be trendy and appeal to older people who miss that extra protection of the screen and want something smaller for their pocket.\n\nWhile I love the idea of foldable flip style smartphones, I think the Fold (book tablet style) is more practical and has more utility. I had a Fold4 from Samsung for a bit and it definitely made me more productive while I had it. I left it because it wasn't quite there in terms of durability yet.
