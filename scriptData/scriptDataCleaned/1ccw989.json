If I understand the pic correctly, you avoid the IV crush but if the 400 calls are ITM after earnings and get exercised it will eat a lot of profits.

Very profitable.\n\nIf MSFT closes below 400 but above 380, the 400s expire worthless (keep the premium) and the 380s profit.  But what actually happened is even more profitable. Overall this was a very good trade on a risk/reward basis.\n\nObv Yolo on the 380s alone would be most profitable but you could have lost everything if MSFT reacted like META.  The premium on the 400s (maybe $110000? would be his to keep, offsetting any losses on the 380s)",

The profit on my long position will be whatever I sell the contracts for above my purchased strike minus the premium paid.
