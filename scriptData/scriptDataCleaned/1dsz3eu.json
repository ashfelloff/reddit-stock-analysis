  "selftext": "JACK is the lowest its been in 10 years (with the exception of the covid crash in 2020)\n\nIt‚Äôs been on a relentless downward streak for 6 months straight, with almost no rebounds. \n\nContrast this with McDonalds, which has been on a relentless upward streak for the past 10 years (with the exception of the past 6 months, which also has been trending down). \n\nIs this the beginning of the end of Jack In The Box?\n\nOr is there some other reason(s) why JACK has been performing so poorly?\n\nAnyone who was betting on a rebound has been getting crushed, myself included. \n\nPositions are 500 shares at an average of $52.44\n",
