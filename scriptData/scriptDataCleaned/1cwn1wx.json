Of the sum you plan on investing, 90% should go into a broad market ETF with dividends set to reinvest. The other 10% I’d recommend using 5-7% and diversifying into stocks you have interest in. The last 3% you can use sparingly to fulfill your gambling addiction on options but once it’s gone it’s gone. Don’t pull from your ETF or passion stocks because you think you have a hot ticket. Best of luck, don’t waste your windfall on gambling. One last caveat, make sure to max your tax advantaged accounts before taxable.",
