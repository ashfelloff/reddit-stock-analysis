Current speculation is that the company has stated 17 new birds for 2025 because that‚Äôs all they can afford now but what‚Äôs likely to happen is that when the 5 block 1 satellites start bringing in revenue, that revenue is going to be used to bring in debt. Now if my maths is still correct, each satellite is supposedly bringing in 20m per year but it could be more at the start since there are less of them.

The SpaceX launch schedule also got updated for September 13th. Take that for what it's worth, I personally don't believe anything until ASTS says it. I'm betting with the updated launch date on SpaceX we get a launch announcement from ASTS next week, possibly Tuesday. We shall see.",
