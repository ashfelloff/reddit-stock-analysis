What flipped the script was convertible notes being bought by T, GOOG and VOD followed by prepayments as well as some debt facilities. Current speculation is that the company has stated 17 new birds for 2025 because that’s all they can afford now but what’s likely to happen is that when the 5 block 1 satellites start bringing in revenue, that revenue is going to be used to bring in debt. Now if my maths is still correct, each satellite is supposedly bringing in 20m per year but it could be more at the start since there are less of them. Each satellite costs about 20m so they’ll all pretty much pay themselves off in a little over a year.",

The SpaceX launch schedule also got updated for September 13th. Take that for what it's worth, I personally don't believe anything until ASTS says it. I'm betting with the updated launch date on SpaceX we get a launch announcement from ASTS next week, possibly Tuesday. We shall see.",
