Ffs even SNAP is at 15.6 bil. Though I would agree that spez is paying himself a little too much, but it would be justified if he can continue growing this company.",

Well, I saw AMC was tanked hard and felt it was hugely undervalued, I knew theatres would make a comeback, so I did a full port into it... Welp, I ended up selling for a $2/share profit, which was nice, but it would have been even nicer if I'd held and ended up regarding my way into holding a huge bag of shares right when AMC became a meme stock... Sigh.\n\nOther notables are the lottery stock. This company had just IPO'ed, it was a pretty young company, but it had some awesome tech and properties like lottery.com and sports.com domains. They had it all, like capability to buy lottery tickets right from your phone, and a promising future of turning the sports domain into a sports betting app, bright future ahead... It had a huge amount of cash on hand, profitable business, and really low valuation... The only downside? A useless POS ceo that had no idea how to run a company. In less than a year he squandered tens of millions in cash on nothingness, drove the company into the ground. By the end of it the company pulled out of selling lottery tickets due to running out of $, the c-suite all abandoned the sinking ship, and the company went into limp mode... One member of the c-suite stuck around, and slowly but surely I guess they're trying to rebuild. I lost around $30k on this stock, a perfectly good company with a promising future RUINED by a moron ceo. I and many other investors filed reports with the gov because there was massive fraud happening, but nothing ever came of it.
