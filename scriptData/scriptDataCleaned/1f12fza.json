Sigh.\n\nOther notables are the lottery stock. This company had just IPO'ed, it was a pretty young company, but it had some awesome tech and properties like lottery.com and sports.com domains. They had it all, like capability to buy lottery tickets right from your phone, and a promising future of turning the sports domain into a sports betting app, bright future ahead... It had a huge amount of cash on hand, profitable business, and really low valuation... The only downside? A useless POS ceo that had no idea how to run a company. In less than a year he squandered tens of millions in cash on nothingness, drove the company into the ground. By the end of it the company pulled out of selling lottery tickets due to running out of $, the c-suite all abandoned the sinking ship, and the company went into limp mode... One member of the c-suite stuck around, and slowly but surely I guess they're trying to rebuild. I lost around $30k on this stock, a perfectly good company with a promising future RUINED by a moron ceo. I and many other investors filed reports with the gov because there was massive fraud happening, but nothing ever came of it. I mean fug, the CEO was cooking the damn books and giving false reports, it wasn't until he left that the full magnitude of the disaster could be unraveled. Total shit show.",
