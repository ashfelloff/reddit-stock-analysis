      "body": "From CBOE:  The VIX Index’s output reading is a non-directional, annualized expectation for the standard deviation of the S&P 500. (Quick back of the envelope mathematical reference point: the VIX Index at 16 means an expected +/- 16% annual move for the S&P 500.)  It is calculated based off of options with roughly 30 days to expiration.\n\nUsually the VIX moves inversely to SPX, so when the stock market goes up, volatility goes down.  So if you buy when the VIX is high, you are buying the dip.  Buying the S&P index at a 10% pullback is a great entry, and obviously the VIX would be elevated in that case.",

That tells you how much *extra* people are currently paying compared to what's just happened. \n\nAlso VIX vs VIX3M is useful because it tells you if people think there is more uncertainty over the next 30 days vs 3months, which is unusual and can be a good fade. \n\nFinally, SKEW tells you the directionality of that insurance. Sometimes people are more concerned about upside volatility (market getting away from them). \n\nOh and credit spreads, MOVE (VIX for bonds), gold, DXY, and other markets can tell you if other markets are currently seeing whatever is scaring the equity market. \n\nThere's no rule. You need to look at these things in relation to each other and decide if the price of protection is currently warranted.",

      "body": "It doesn't work that way man. VIX is a concept with 5-6yr time horizon in mind where we split the low vol and high vol regime. Then in a low vol regime you absolutely must be in short vol trade throughout those 2-2.5yrs. The way you can observe this phenomenon is seeing a trend rally in SVIX/SVXY etc.  But in high vol regime you must trade vix and be absolutely careful that when shorting vix the etf you are using should not go to 0 like what happened with XIV. And then you can basically long using UVIX/UVXY/VIXY and be watchful about the insane decay when monthly contracts rollover. Now there are numerous strategies you can use in trading high vol regime. Back in 2022 it was buy vix below 20 and sell above 30 or if you wanna deep dive watchout how vix behaves around vixexp.",
