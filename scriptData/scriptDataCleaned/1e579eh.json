He basically says if the potential for AI to usher in an era of exponential growth can be realized and if Nvidia can somehow maintain its dominance and profitability in the industry for when that happens, then there's a chance the company can see double-digit trillion dollar valuation, but he thinks the likelihood of that is around %10-%15.\n\nThe $50 trillion remark was an off-the-cuff comment about the potential of the market, if AI proves to be a world changer.\n\nGuy's basically saying if AI can bring about the 4th industrial revolution, the exponential growth in productivity and efficiency will be so high that Nvidia, if they can still maintain their dominance, could explode.\n\nWhich isn't such a ridiculous notion looking at how previous industrial revolutions turned out.",
