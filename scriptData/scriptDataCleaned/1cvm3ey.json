  "selftext": "The next potential pandemic, Bird flu, has been on the horizon for a long time now. I have been thinking about which stocks are very cheap at the moment and would benefit disproportionately from this. I have found two titles for myself: \nAbcellera (AI - pharmaceutical researcher) has already developed a vaccine together with Eli Lilly during Corona. The share is still worth 15% of the IPO and is debt-free with net cash of almost 1 billion dollars.\n\nValneva\n\nAlready has an approved vaccine against bird flu. This time, inactivated vaccines will be more in demand than MRNA vaccines. There was too much discussion about the side effects of the vaccines from Moderna, Biontech and AstraZeneca.\nPfizer acquired a 9 % stake in Valneva The purchase price was twice as high as the price Pfizer paid!",
