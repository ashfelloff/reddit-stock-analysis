Curious if there's something I'm missing that might make this look \"more expected\". So far reading through the article there's nothing standing out to twist except for personal savings, which went from 3.8% Q1 to 3.5% Q2. But despite this spending inflation is trending down nicely which makes this report seem even better.",

If you could calculate the lost value precisely to perfectly fill in that gap then there’s zero inflation. That’s obviously impossible to do perfectly. Perhaps they overshot the stimulus which could cause some inflation but the amount we saw was likely mostly due to 1) supply chain bottlenecks from covid, 2) more expensive energy because geopolitics, and 3) corporations raising prices by more than what they were experiencing on their end (leading to record profits that outpaced inflation).
