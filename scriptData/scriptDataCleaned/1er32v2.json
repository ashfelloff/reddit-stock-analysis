Cruise missiles fired all the way from Iran towards Israel are easier to defend then smaller rockets that hezbollah and Hamas militants continuously fire towards Israel. Iran’s only leverage is their drone warfare capabilities which would be far more effective against Israel if Iran was geographically closer. Not to mention that US has deployed several carrier strike groups to defend Israel in the region which on their own will most likely counter 70%+ of those missiles fired towards Israel. Iran & their proxies vs Israel + US isn’t even a fair fight. It’s not worth worrying about unlike china vs Taiwan which will impact the markets more directly.",
