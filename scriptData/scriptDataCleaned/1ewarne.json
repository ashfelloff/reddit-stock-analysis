      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nTo keep things interesting, we want to see big gains and big losses! \n\nSo we've set the following thresholds for Gain, Loss, and YOLO flaired posts:\n\n* YOLO posts must be a minimum of $10,000 of options or $25,000 of shares and recently opened.\n\n* Gain / Loss posts must show realized gains or losses of more than $2,500 for options or $5,000 for shares. \n\nWe want to see the actual trade. What you got in at, what you sold at. Then tell us why you did it. Give us the story of why you're a fucking genius (or idiot).\n\nThis is what a great post looks like:\n\n[$17.2K Gain on AMZN](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wb5m4o/not_too_shabby_172k_gain_amzn/) - OP described his gain in the title, has a clear screenshot showing both the entry and exit, meaning his gains were locked in, and they explained their reasoning in the comments and what they learned. All around a great post!\n\nHere are examples of what could get your post removed:\n\n* [$300,000 SDC Loss. Still not selling](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/wpm9am/over_300000_unrealized_loss_sdc_not_selling/) - Even though this is a tremendous loss and something worth posting about, **the position hasn't been closed yet**.\n\n\nHere are examples of amazing posts which could have been even better:\n\n* [$75,000 DDOG Loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/unsrey/loss_porn_ddog_call/) - This is a great post and one that won't get removed. However, the OP could have talked about *why* they entered the position in the first place, what their target price was, and what went wrong. OP didn't stick around in the comments to answer any questions.\n\n* [$1.1MM Loss, No details](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxm6wt/hold_me_1100000_loss/) - OP simply posted a screenshot of their overall portfolio balance. It's definitely a big loss, but it's not that interesting without OP talking about what trades they were in and why. OP didn't answer most questions in the comments which left many readers speculating on what happened.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

In the late 19th century, Sage began creating calls and puts options that could be traded over the counter in the United States. There was still no formal exchange market, but Sage created activity that was a significant breakthrough for options trading.\n\nSage is also believed to be the first person to establish a pricing relationship between the price of an option, the price of the underlying security, and interest rates. He used the principle of a put call parity to devise synthetic loans that were created by him buying stock and a related put from a customer.\n\nThis enabled him to effectively loan money to the customer at an interest rate that he could set by fixing the price of the contracts and the relevant strike prices accordingly. Sage eventually stopped trading in his way because of significant losses, but he was certainly instrumental in the continued evolution of options trading.\n\nHe was the the first modern regard, and as such, lost a lot more money than he earned.",

This is often attributed to factors such as:\n\nLack of understanding: Many traders may not fully grasp the complexities of options trading, leading to poor decision-making.   \nOverconfidence: Overestimating one's abilities can lead to excessive risk-taking.   \nEmotional trading: Letting emotions like fear and greed drive trading decisions can be detrimental.   \nLeverage: Options trading often involves leverage, which can amplify both gains and losses.   It's important to note that while options trading can be profitable, it's also inherently risky. Anyone considering options trading should thoroughly research the topic, understand the risks involved, and develop a solid trading strategy.",
