By the time planes like the 747 came around, jet flying had become mostly safe from actual plane failures and most fatalities were caused by pilot error. There were a few that were design defects (737 reverser deploying in flight) or all dc-10/dc-9 shitty design issues but turbulence does not usually bring down a plane at cruise altitude. Windshear/Microbursts when landing can crash a plane though.",
