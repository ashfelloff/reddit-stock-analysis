      "body": "I wrote my original response in the [weekend stocks thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1daz27b/rstocks_weekend_discussion_saturday_jun_08_2024/l7pdzya/). In short, the video is wrong on pretty much every account and is functioning as political propaganda. There are three other misconceptions to note with responses in this thread:\n\n* You cannot simply take oil in and out of the SPR. The SPR is not designed to withdraw oil - it relies on the unique properties of the lining of salt caves to keep oil sealed in under the high pressure the crude exerts on its rock layers. The geologists who helped advocate for the SPR's existence understood this with the assumption the caves would be a last resort and oil reserves would not be held there indefinitely. The damaging consequences of using it as a piggy bank [are well-known](https://www.aapg.org/publications/news/spheresofinfluence/details/articleid/36728/the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-the-strategic-petroleum-reserve) i.e. draining it destroys the structural integrity of the caves, shrinks their overall volume and allows oil to leak through the rock layers over time.\n* The claim that the Bakken shale field has enough oil reserves to function as a strategic reserve [is false](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/16/fact-check-bakken-oil-reserve-cant-power-us-2-000-years/6391181001/). I assume this is referencing the 2000 Leigh Price paper where he estimated up to 500 billion barrels existed in the formation. The problem is only a fraction of this is retrievable with present-day technology, and cost-profit ratios in fracking are extremely sensitive to depth. In fact, retrieval from the Bakken fields has already declined 20% from its highs. Ditto for Eagle Ford and the Permian. The latter has compensated with higher initial retrieval capacity in its wells while experiencing steeper falloffs over the last three years.\n* There is no massive conspiracy by American oil companies to keep prices high. All it takes is eavesdropping on one quarterly earnings calls to find out the real answer: their biggest stakeholders are adamantly against investing anything more than minimal capex into the exploration, procurement, and building of new wells. Why? Because the latter assume that 2010s oil prices are the true market price, and our current elevated prices are an aberration caused by the pandemic + the Ukraine war. They remember when prices plunged to $30 during the shale revolution, driving most of the mid-tier companies into bankruptcy and costing the likes of Exxon billions of dollars due to growth expenditures that never paid off. The stakeholders want their FCF poured into share buybacks and dividend payouts, not dumped into a (perceived) black hole. And this was before government-pushed ESG initiatives convinced Big Oil they would be obsolete in a couple of decades. Never wondered why we haven't had a large refinery built in the U.S. in over three decades, or why Shell is selling off all their refineries around the world as we speak?",

It was originally planned to last 25 years because of its geological limitations with 5 prolonged drain cycles to get all the oil out. It was never meant to be refilled. The more often you fill and drain it, the closer the caverns get to collapsing. Past a certain point, the cave floors will fracture and the SPR turns into a net negative.",

When oil hit $114 for four months in 2022, Exxon made $55.7 billion net profit that year. During Q4 2020 it *lost* $20 billion. Q4 just happened to be the peak of WTI for 2023; the oil companies made a lot less in Q2 when oil was $70 instead of $84.\n\n> I would think that has a significant impact on US fuel prices.\n\nIt doesn't. As I explained in my original post WTI, Brent, etc. are dictated by the futures market which prices oil according to anticipation of future supply/demand: the oil companies don't have a say. To copy-paste what I said:\n\n*In the energy market where demand is often inelastic and traders can't accurately ascertain the fallout of geopolitical events, you get harsh price swings in defiance of traditional supply/demand dynamics. In 1979 the U.S. only relied on Iran for 5% of domestic demand; total domestic consumption only dropped 3.5% from the all-time high of the previous year, and the world oil supply shrank by 4%. Given all that, crude prices from 1978-1979 still rose from $15.85 a barrel to $39.50! U.S. citizens saw similar spikes in distillates during the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine despite importing very little from either country.*\n\nAdditionally, the price difference between crude and distillates is also determined by refinery crack spreads.\n\n> This needs to be tempered if investment is stagnant and net profits are just being put into the hands of shareholders\n\nIf oil companies stop believing $55 oil a barrel is the future (which makes most offshore rigs cost-prohibitive to build) and the Biden administration isn't on a mission to drive them into extinction, then they'll start drilling and constructing refineries again. Alternatively, they discover new technological breakthroughs that make low-cost oil profitable to extract. \n\nUntil then, management will be browbeaten by majority stakeholders to practice \"fiscal discipline\", optimize extraction from existing wells and do nothing else.",

If oil companies influenced the price directly, that would give them a consistent metric to determine whether investments are worthwhile. Since oil prices are volatile and had been low for the last decade, they follow past expectations and assume it will continue to be low. Refineries and large offshore rigs take 20+ years to pay off the initial investment - not including maintenance, salaries, repairs, etc. There's currently no incentive to build them and expand supply.  \n\n> Everyone realizes burning oil and coal is destroying the planet and the demand for oil is absolutely on the decline.\n\nThe demand for oil is rising among countries that want to modernize and reach second world/first world status e.g. India importing tons of coal and oil recently. Regardless of its ecological impact, oil still ranks among the highest EROI and is perhaps the easiest energy source to store. The green energy transition is prohibitively expensive and crippling for any nation that isn't rich; in fact, it's starting to cripple us, and the U.S. is the richest country in the world.\n\n> In reality we should limit stock buybacks and dividends on the oil industry as they begin the inevitable decline.\n\nI don't see any legal justification that doesn't rely upon a fascist interpretation (in the descriptive, not pejorative sense) of the state's role.",

There's still plenty of oil that can be accessed in the permeable layers, but it's becoming more and more cost-prohibitive to get it out. \n\n> In my very basic understanding of commodities, this would be a point in the cycle where in fact you should anticipate higher future prices, due to lack of investment.\n\nIn theory, companies could anticipate future demand and use their capital expenditure at the right time in anticipation of macro tailwinds. In reality those entities suffer from recency bias, pressure from investors to do what works best in the present, and conservative attitudes due to projects taking decades to get off the ground. Hence, why the boom-bust cycles exist in the first place.",

And when energy prices spiked in 2021-2022, and we had inflation, we saw more violence and authoritarianism in the Middle East and Russia. Like what happened in the 2010's, like the so-called \"Arab Spring\". Security started to deteriorate in 2022 as oil prices began to spike, for similar reasons. \n\nIt turns out that very expensive energy prices makes Russia and Middle Eastern terrorist-funders flush with cash as well as angers voters. \n\nThe premise is correct: Biden made oil & gas cheap again, just as the climate-change prevention programs that were intended to make oil undesirably expensive, were working. \n\nBiden did a 180 degree turn and went from a starve-them-and-shut-them-down policy for oil producers to being the most oil & gas pumping advocate ever, starting with dumping from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They've made a big show of funding renewable energy projects, but that can't possibly make up for the environmental impact of the massive oil production surge under Biden. \n\nIt's almost as if people don't remember the ESG drive to defund oil companies and shut them down, just a few years ago. I spent a lot of time on here trying to explain why that won't work, and no one paid attention. Every time I tried to explain on here why you can't just cut oil & gas production without conservation programs to cut energy use, people would just run out and short energy stocks. \n\nIn the meantime, my coal stocks have doubled and tripled. Biden doesn't have a Strategic Coal Reserve to dump coal from on short notice, and switching people to renewables requires more electricity.\n\nBut the other title for this post should be \"We don't care so much about climate change when foreign policy and economic policy dictates our energy policy\".",

If investors avoid oil on ESG concerns, it will push the share price down, but this does not affect the actual finance of the company. If they did need to raise more capital, the could take on debt (many oil companies have plenty of space to do so), or, they could issue shares. If the market share price is lower, they'd just issue more shares. Investors avoiding their shares achieves nothing at all, as far as I can tell",

              "body": "Depressing the share prices makes a company's market cap lower. It takes a lot of capital to produce oil. \n\nI'm not sure what you're questioning. \n\nYou say avoiding oil company shares achieves nothing, but ESG-oriented investment funds are still doing it. So they're doing it for some reason. \n\nThis is really easy to Google on your own. You can find explanations of anti-fossil fuel divesting that are simplified down to layperson level pitches.\n\n> In the early 2010s, when the movement to divest from fossil fuels started to accelerate in the U.S., it seemed that activists had hit upon a potentially important strategy to reduce reliance on planet-warming energy sources. Proponents of fossil fuel divestment argued that if enough entities pulled funding, the oil and gas industry would be starved of capital, making it less productive and less profitable, until the industry was ultimately replaced by renewables. Protests and other grassroots action – largely on college campuses – demanded financial institutions stop funding the fossil fuel industry. Eventually, a number of high-profile funds pledged to divest, with institutions like Harvard University pulling their endowments out of public oil and gas investments. By 2022, $22 trillion had been divested from fossil fuels across public and private markets, with over $40 trillion assets now committed to divestment, representing almost two thirds of the total global pension fund assets under management ($56 trillion).\n\nhttps://malk.com/oil-gas-divestment-considerations-for-pe/\n\nIt's even in wikipedia:\n\n> A study by the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford found that the stigmatisation of fossil fuel companies caused by divestment can \"materially increase the uncertainty surrounding the future cash flows of fossil-fuel companies.\"[37] That, in turn, \"can lead to a permanent compression in the trading multiples – e.g., the share price to earnings (P/E) ratio of a target company.\"[37]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_fuel_divestment#Effects_of_divestment\n\nActivists not only avoid buying long positions in energy companies, but they also disrupt the market by aggressively shorting oil & gas stocks and oil & gas futures, creating crazy volatility and driving out responsible investors. It also appears that short sellers often mobilize on a national scale to drive down oil prices. Saudi Arabia has had an open battle with the aggressive short sellers in oil & gas for a long time. \n\nSaudi Arabia Can’t Win Its Fight With the Short Sellers\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-05-24/shorting-saudi-oil-giant-ignores-energy-demand-is-shifting-for-good\n\nThe bottom line is that instability of the energy market due to geopolitics, aggressive short selling and divestiture has depressed fossil fuel stocks. The price of energy also drops at random, despite increasing demand at random times, when short sellers attack the sector (sometimes for political reasons). \n\nThis is why there are a lot of well-run smaller energy companies out there that have extremely low P/E but pay double-digit dividends to shareholders, now. They're cash cows because they can't grow their market cap.\n\n_______________\n\nThe problem with the ESG investing is that it only targets what people hate, and not what is actual reality on the ground. The current generation is the most energy hog generation ever. So whatever shifts they make in going from one source of power to another, is lost in the noise. The only blips in steady energy consumption growth were in the global financial meltdown of 2008-2009 and the pandemic of 2020. Activists attacks on oil & gas producers are absolutely a projection of aggression and blame for what is this generation's energy consumption growth. \n\nThe same activists who have convinced the financial world that ESG investing will reduce energy consumption when it doesn't, are the same ones who are protesting in support of Hamas, and Islamic jihad, chanting slogans about wiping out Jews on campuses. I.e. Greta Thurnberg and the crowd that follows her. They believe that by stopping Israel's bombs and guns, they can stop Islamic violence, and they act by singling out a guilty party they project all the blame and aggression onto, and trying to cancel them. So ESG investing to starve oil & gas companies and the pro-Hamas movement, are forms of cancel culture-based activism on a large scale -- attempts to cancel industries or countries. \n\nAnd no, it doesn't make sense. Cancellation is just an outlet for condescending cultural aggression. \n\nThe hallmark of today's Ivy League activism is that they simplify complex markets and complex conflicts down to one-liners and catchphrases, and then actively pursue a goal to cancel the party they blame as being the bad or least likable actors in the situation. It doesn't matter if their cancellation as activism makes sense or not, because that kind of activism is not about actually accomplishing good but about their acting out their need to be heroes against evil forces. So these movements are like mass aggression coming from privileged people who consider themselves to be more right about everything than everyone else, even when they don't understand a subject. \n\nCancel culture activism like ESG divestiture from energy and energy short sellers, create volatility in energy markets. It disrupts energy markets and creates a lot of buying opportunities. They do suppress energy prices and energy company shares for long stretches of time. But then, also, from time to time, energy prices spike as they break out, which is usually followed by some kind of Russian aggression and Middle East violence, as the popular economic stress caused by inflation coupled by corrupt actors being flush with cash destabilizes energy producing regions. \n\nDuring the times when activists and anti-energy shorts keep prices low, you can make money on the high dividends. During the breakouts, when the price spikes hit, you can make money with capital gains. Both of these kinds of profits come with tax burdens, which is why they're better for non-taxable accounts like IRAs.\n\nSince Biden has suddenly turned into a high-energy producing president, Democrats have gone silent on starving oil & gas companies of capital. So in that sense, the OP's title is accurate in that refraining from trying to destroy the production of energy has stabilized the energy market more and has made oil a less volatile sector to invest in.",

What is the mechanism?\n\nIt depresses share prices, but that doesn't affect the finance of the company, as I pointed out in my last comment.\n\nEven the material you have quoted is vague:\n\n> In the early 2010s, when the movement to divest from fossil fuels started to accelerate in the U.S., **it seemed that** activists had hit upon a potentially important strategy to reduce reliance on planet-warming energy sources. Proponents of fossil fuel divestment **argued that** if enough entities pulled funding, the oil and gas industry would be starved of capital, making it less productive and less profitable, until the industry was ultimately replaced by renewables\n\nThis is clearly written by an author who is aware the arguments they are presenting may not be true\n\nThe wikipedia source is about how ESG would depress the valuation of the company, which it obviously would, if it depresses share prices.\n\nAnd on short sellers, whatever 'crazy volatility' they might think they are creating, they are not. Oil and gas sector is actually low volatility.\n\nI don't even know what relevance the wall of text you added is, it sounds like you're spitting out brainless chatbot responses\n\nA company's management may still be motivated to divest from fossil fuels if they believe that will propel the share price up in the short term, regardless of whether in the long term, it actually makes much sense.\n\n'Feels over reals' IMO",

What is the mechanism?\n\nThis is an internet forum connected to the internet. You can look things up. You don't get to demand lessons from people whose comments challenge your thinking. \n\nEnergy markets is a subject of complex commodity issues as well as geopolitical, activist and strategic national investment. I'm actually refusing to explain it to you.\n\nI'm referring you to Google because there's a lot of information on all levels of expertise/introductory information. You can select material that matches your own level of education and information, as well as your questions. Otherwise, I'd have to profile you to develop a lesson that matches what you need.\n\nLook at the way you criticize and attack me for what information I did post. Seriously, seek out your own level of information and detail and don't insist that (1) I teach you something a topic about a complex market while (2) you criticize the level of detail and coverage of my comments.\n\n> This is clearly written by an author who is aware the arguments they are presenting may not be true\n\nWho cares what the guy's attitude is? The concept he's describing is what I was referring to. If you have a problem separating writer bias from content, then you need to go to college where you can take classes where learn to read material without belief interfering with your processing of information. Take some literature or journalism classes.\n\nAre you seriously asking me to provide you with sources infused with the author's belief that ESG activist investing to starve old energy of capital is a good, viable approach? Everybody in commodity markets, except for extremists and marketing people, knows that ESG investing is a populist marketing scam tailored for idealistic dummies who believe they can change the world by what they buy instead of what they do. That is, when they're not cancel culture haters who feel they need to publicly organize boycotts of parts of society they hate. \n\nESG investing is currently undergoing retrenchment and/or revision as it become less popular (for obvious reasons).\n\n* Investors pull cash from ESG funds as performance lags. Sustainability-focused equity funds suffer net $40bn of outflows in 2024, the first sustained exodus\nhttps://www.ft.com/content/cf9001ab-e326-4264-af5e-12b3fbb0ee7b \n\nIn fact, as investors come to realize that it's useless to implement cancel culture in investing, especially for goods and commodities people mindlessly consume with inflexible demand, energy stocks stand to gain from ESG fading as a trend.\n\nThe \"wall of text\" I added was sufficient background for you to separate geopolitical, ESG investing and social activist investor issues, from regular commodity market dynamics when you do the Google search you should be doing instead of arguing with me.",

It is not the job of the US Government to \"protect\" consumers from high prices. As far as subsidies go (which long-term storage is, in effect, a subsidy), anyone who has taken Econ 101 knows a subsidy only ever makes sense for a commodity with positive externalities. Oil does not have positive externalities - it has negative.\n3. The cost of storing and then releasing long term oil is obviously more expensive than simply subsidizing it. This is obvious from #1.\n4. The national reserve is utterly tiny both in capacity and flow rate compared to the size of global demand and essentially has zero impact on oil prices. It is about 1 week of global oil demand in size, and about 4% of global oil demand in flow rate. In essense, it is utterly infinitesimal compared to the scale of the oil market.",
