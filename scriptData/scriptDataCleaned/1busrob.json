He removed dividend that was paying nearly 10%. \nNew CEO Kate is in the drivers seat for a bit over year with mission to transform the business.\nStock hit a bottom around $0.8 where new ceo bought 1M shares. \nInsiders are net buyers over the past 12 months.\nKate is pushing additional cybersecurity services in addition to their fiber business.\nLUMN infrastructure is the largest for intercontinental connections between US,Europe and Asia.\nThey are heavily working with Microsoft and Google in interconnectivity between their cloud data centers.\nSomeone already mentioned that more and more Microsoft executives are being pulled in by new ceo coming from Microsoft.\nI believe that we have moved past the rock bottom point and starting uphill journey with SP.\nDebt maturities have been renegotiated and moved past the point of threatening default.\nRevenue declines are recorded due to sale of business lines.\nNow is the time to see if the new setup and new strategy are yielding revenue growthâ€¦if that is the case 8-10x in SP to be expected in 18-24months.\n10% trading portfolio allocated and risking into this play.  \nGood luck ðŸ¤“",
