Again, that's **daily**.  \n\n51,350,000 people per year injured or killed in road-traffic incidents, but the news isn't lit up about it, screaming about how egregious it is. Even if the current incidents had injured or killed anyone (they haven't) the numbers wouldn't be remotely as high.  So I agree with you that it's a massive perception-distortion problem.\n\nIt's unreal, the spectacle and drama people place on aviation and aviation crashes/incidents. Commercial flying is [literally safer than taking a shower,](https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/1975/CPSC-Releases-New-Study-On-Bathtub-And-Shower-Injuries) but ohhhhh man, do people get worked up any time something happens.\n\nAlso- the autopilot wasn't the issue in the 'nosedive' incidents.  MCAS isn't even active with the autopilot on.\n\nNor was it a window blowing out of the Max 9.  It was a fuselage door plug.\n\nIt's getting a little nuts, this 'Boeing!' wave the media are riding.  The Max crashes were 5 years ago, and the issues surrounding that have been fixed.  Millions have safely flown Maxes since.  No one was injured in the door plug incident.  *All* the 'because Boeing' things that the media is pumping since then are fairly common things that happen to any type of aircraft without serious consequences.\n\nYet Airbus are under [EASA investigation for flawed main landing gear axels](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/easa-mlg-a330-a340-mlg/amp) being installed on their planes.  They've also caught a lot of heat worldwide for [questionable business practices/bribery](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/airbus-agrees-pay-over-39-billion-global-penalties-resolve-foreign-bribery-and-itar-case).  But the media kind of looks the other way on all that because it doesn't generate clicks and views like \"bOeInG pLaNe!\"\n\nIt's getting really bizarre.",

If you use all the air miles of planes to argue for a safety argument of a particular model impacted by quality issues that's just as wrong as using the number of passengers to calculate miles to pad the safety statistics.\n\nAt the end of the day, the question is if the newer models are operating safer than the old ones or worse. Perception right now is that quality has gotten worse.\n\nIs this realistic? If the numbers are so, then that's really bad\n\nIf this is just public perception, then that's bad for business and profits, since it impacts sales.",

                              "body": "Well, we don't use miles travelled to measure aircraft or flying safety.  We use fatalities per departure.  Basically, the risk of a fatal incident/crash is calculated on a per-flight basis.\n\n[Here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/aviation-fatalities-per-million-passengers) is the worldwide chart of fatalities per million departures over the 50-year period from 1970-1920. It has been a steady decline, [despite the number of flying passengers increasing dramatically over the same time period](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/air-passengers-carried?tab=chart) (there's a drop at the end of the chart because COVID).  It currently, including the Max crashes, hovers around .1 fatalities per million departures.  Put another way, you could fly every day for something like 30,000 years and not be involved in a fatal airline crash.\n\nSo now that there's a baseline established, how do we look at individual models of aircraft?\n\n[This data](https://www.airsafe.com/events/models/rate_mod.htm) is current for the 737 through 2019, and is the most recent I can find.  Keep in mind that that the  current fatality rate for the 737 Max will actually be lower than what is indicated because it has flown for 5.5 years since the MCAS-related groundings without a fatal crash.\n\nSo, as of 2019, if you look at similar categories of aircraft, 737NG (the most common 737 currently flying, despite production ending in 2019) vs. A320 series you'll see that the 737NG actually has a slightly better safety record than the A320, at .07 fatalities per million departures vs. .09.\n\nThe Max data has to be taken with a grain of salt because the chart data was compiled just after the two Max crashes.  Since then, over 1000 more Max airplanes have been delivered and the number of MAX flights has increased exponentially.  Over the last five years, Maxes have completed millions of flights carrying at least tens of millions of people with zero fatalities.  That number continues to improve, so the 3.08/million rate is old and quite skewed because of the lack of time in existence and smaller number of total Max flights at the time the data was compiled.\n\nNotice that the 787, everyone's favorite punching bag, the one everyone is screaming about being \"unsafe,\" is not on the chart, because it has had zero, none, no fatal accidents, no crash-related hull losses,  in its 12-year history. It's currently at or near the top of the list of safest aircraft ever made. The Airbus counterpart, the A350, also has zero fatalities, but one crash resulting in hull loss.\n\nThe 777 is a tough one to compare because it has been in production for ~20 years now and its closest current competitor is also the A350, a much newer aircraft. Probably the more-honest comparison for the 777 is the A330.  777 is at .18 fatalities per million departures compared to A300 at .19. Several hundred more 777 were produced than A330. \n\nSo the data don't seem to support the media and public-opinion noise that specific current-production Boeings are death traps, or somehow more-significantly flawed, compared to their competitors.\n\nNow, if you want to start comparing other 'scary' things like parts falling off, landing gear collapsing, engine cowlings popping open, panels and parts departing in flight, aircraft having sudden nosedives flinging passengers around, wheels and tires falling off, etc.; *all* that happens at about the same frequency between Boeing and Airbus. It's not hard at all to find a 'Bus counterpart for every single 'OMG Scary Boeing' incident reported over the last several months.\n\nSo it's a public-perception thing, which *could* affect sales, but the public is fickle and has a short memory.  If the media ever tire of Boeing bashing  for clicks and views and move on to something else, people will forget about it and go back to flying around and not even really knowing or caring about what airplane they're on.",

But Boeing had several extremely relevant safety catastrophes in the past years.\n\nThe only reason orders are not being cancelled as much as you may expect is because there is a lot of momentum in the business. Plane production capacity is hard to increase and flight & maintenance crews learning a new plane is expensive. But airlines are switching. The A320neo production is booked out almost a decade in advance.\n\nIf you could snap your fingers and magically get an Airbus instead of your ordered Boeing including the needed flight crews, mechanics, etc, Boeing would be in deep trouble. But because airlines who bet on Boeing decades ago are still on the hook, they have a lot more time to get their shit together (or continue pocketing the difference) than they might deserve.",

Small panels falling off cuz they weren't properly affixed, weird vibrations, error lights, etc. Completely unknown to the public. \n\n\nMost of the time, the overwhelming majority of the time, it's not dangerous. There's so much redundancy built into these things that small errors don't even result in a plane being turned around and then landing at it. Its origin airport. They continue on to their destination, file out a little report and then the next flight is delayed or canceled while they line up another plane. \n\n\nBut again, the Boeing door blowout has resulted in everyone being willing to publish any story that comes their way of even a minor error involving a Boeing plane. A year ago if you called up a reporter and said hey, a panel fell off of a Delta Boeing 737. They would just kind of shrug their shoulders and go \"okay and nothing bad happened.\" Now, it's a story. ",
