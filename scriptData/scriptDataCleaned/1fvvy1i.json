Crisis-stricken Volkswagen meanwhile called on the EU and China to continue talks about the issue, saying that an alternative solution was still possible, according to Reuters.*\n\n*Swedish auto maker Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Geely Holdings, said that it would “continue with our long-held strategy of building our cars where we sell them and have committed significant long-term investment into Europe,” according to a statement.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Division in the EU*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*The decision comes after months of debates and deliberations between EU member countries, which have expressed varying opinions on increasing tariffs on imported Chinese made EVs.*\n\n*While France has been a big supporter, previously pushing the EU to start investigations of potential tariffs, Germany has advocated against them, raising concerns about consequences for its own struggling car makers.*\n\n*German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Friday urged the European Commission not to start a trade war.*\n\n*“Despite the vote for potential punitive tariffs against China, Ursula von der Leyen’s EU Commission should not trigger a trade war. We need a negotiated solution,” he said in a post on social media platform X according to a CNBC translation.*\n\n*Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Thursday his country would veto a proposal from the European Commission that puts forward tariffs of up to 45%, Reuters reported.*\n\n*Potential retaliation from China has been a key concern for some EU members, especially as China has already launched anti-dumping probes into pork and brandy exports from the EU, as well as an anti-subsidy investigation into EU dairy products.*",

So it's fairly difficult to bring an antisubsidy case against another country.

Biden's IRA passed in 2022 is one; as is France's recent NEV policies updated last year is another.
