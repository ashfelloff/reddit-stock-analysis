As of March 2024, the 787 program has received 1,912 orders and made **1,123 deliveries with no fatalities and no hull losses.**\n\nZero hull losses since the airplane started flying 12 years ago.

Literally thousands of flights a day, millions of people carried yearly, tiny accident numbers.  The Max crashes were 5 years ago, and those issues are fixed. Millions have flown safely on Maxes since. \n\nThe 787 has a near-perfect safety record.
