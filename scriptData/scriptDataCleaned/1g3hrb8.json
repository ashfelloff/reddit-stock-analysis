It doesn‚Äôt matter if ‚Äúbillions of people‚Äù are doing buy-and-hold, if people won‚Äôt pay higher prices due to some kind of economic shock or black swan event, the market will plummet.\n\nWhat actually happens with the market is good economic times cause bear markets. Sounds counterintuitive, and it is. But it‚Äôs the very fact that the market is flying high (and has little fuel left to churn higher) that bad news causes the market to drop.\n\nAlso true is that when the stock market is doing great and there lot‚Äôs of positive economic news, people feel good about their situation and start taking on more debt. When there is a drop in the market and a recession and they lose their job, the debt becomes a weight around their neck. If the debt levels are high enough it becomes a weight around the neck of the entire economy, like happened in 2008.\n\nThis is the real meaning of the saying be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.

Everyone will loss their shit, and the house market will crash to prices not seen since 2026.\n\nThe problem for Bears buying LEAP PUTs is that i think the puts for 2030 are still not available, and even if they were the premium would eat any hypothetical again in any case.\n\nSo my advice for Bears is to throw a WarrenBuffet and sell everything and keep the money on MMF or short term bonds meanwhile they wait for SPX to reach 9ksomething before going all-in into puts",

Don't listen to people who have no idea what they are talking about pointing out minor problems and thinking they will be the end of the world! If there is war it doesn't even mean the stocks will go down. If America and it's allies can dunk on a shithole country like Russia or Iran that will only mean that American stocks will be more valuable because now everyone wants to trade with you just to make sure they are on the right side of history. Stocks went down rightly when covid happened, but then we fixed the issue after a few years without too much damage and now stocks are going up again.\n\n  \nStocks aren't magic, they pertain to the future of the companies you invest in, and the future is looking good, as it has looked good for decades. Everyone is buying American exports. Other countries arent that impressive, but we arent investing in them too much. Maybe just the best companies there.",
