I hate to break it to you but the \"culture of safety\" at most airlines solely exists due to regulation not any sense of duty or doing the right thing.  That's why nearly every regulation is written in blood.\n\nI am not suggesting the airlines should have engineered the solution.  What I *am* taking issue with is the fact that an AD is needed.  A service bulletin from the manufacturer should be sufficient to spur them into action.  \n\nThat was the whole point of my initial post that you missed.  It wasn't about who should engineer the solution (your initial response) or what the solution is (your response above).  It was about the fact airlines have to be told to do this by a regulatory agency because a large number just wouldn't fucking bother if they weren't.  There have been COUNTLESS accidents that have resulted for poorly performed (either in terms of timing or technical) maintenance that resulted in inspection notifications for things that SHOULD be caught if the maintenance was done according to the OEM's guidance  in the first place.\n\nI am also not saying the OEMs are blameless either, far from.  Alarmingly, they are getting worse, not better, so they are just as worthy of ire these days, but... that wasn't the point of my initial post either.  There is just too much pressure across the board these days for the last 0.01 of profit and it's going to end up fucking up 100+ years of progress.",

My point was this sort (edit: ate some of my own comment): issue should be pulled back into the work list even without an AD when the fix is available and an AD shouldn't be NEEDED.  They didn't used to issue ADs for a lot of things they do now, because if they don't the issues just don't get handled.  In the \"before\" the OEM would post a service note and the airlines just did it.  \n\nAnd I'm not biased against big companies at all.  Just ones that are NEEDLESSLY greedy.  (Note the capitalization, that is the important word).  Somewhere in the last 30 years, the scales tipped.  It used to be a balance of long and short-term return.  When long-term still mattered the risk for that incremental short-term gain wasn't worth it sometimes.  That era gave us meaningful r&d and big advances.  The focus on next Q isn't sustainable if we want to keep advancing as a species.  \n\nThink about it. No manufacturer would build a 747 type aircraft today and gamble everything like that.  (Not 747 in size, but the conceptual departure it was at the time and the massive self-financed risk). Sure Airbus tried with the 380 kinda, but that had SO MUCH EU behind it the risk wasn't really on Airbus (indeed the eu governments ended up forgiving a good chunk over the years).  It's just kinda sad all around really.  \n\nWhen I was a kid, I would have sworn we'd have a Concorde 3 by now.  Anyway I'm just salty and disappointed with everyone so I will go grumble into some coffee lol.",

They changed the world in so many ways.  \n\nI think engineering companies need to find their value in their engineering.  Not in their (unneeded) cost cutting.  Shareholders, however, aren't shareHOLDERs anymore.  I get the irony of saying this on this sub, but when shares were held for years, the objectives of a company were different.  Deep r&d isn't cheap and makes no sense on a quarterly balance sheet (it makes tons one a 5 or 10 year look though). There is no reason Boeing shouldn't have a MoM aircraft by now, except for shareholders risk aversion.",
