  "selftext": "I'm seeing a lot of people who believe this is gonna blow over. \"It's just an outage bro, happens all the time, we just fix it and move on\". No. Not when it's on this scale. Not when it takes billions off the global economy and cripples businesses. Not when it threatens the financial system. Not when it hurts the government themselves. It is just too big to ignore. \n\nCongress will investigate this and conclude that it's unacceptable. Not unacceptable 'I'm angry at you', but literally unacceptable - it cannot happen again. And the only way they can do that is to take it out of private hands or regulate the shit out of it. Either way, there is no future for it as an investment. \n\nAnd worse, it will prompt them to look at the implications of using AI to take over production in various areas. Something they know is an issue, but have managed to ignore so far. They won't ignore it anymore. There will be sweeping regulation in this area too.\n\nCRWD+AI/tech bull took a mortal wound yesterday, it just didn't realise it yet. Do not be fooled because the stock bounced. It was too obvious a short. It will go down, but only once the shorts have capitulated. ",
