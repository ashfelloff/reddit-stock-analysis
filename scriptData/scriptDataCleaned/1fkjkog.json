Extension ended 09/16 and still no report. Class action suits filed. Stock was down on news in August but went up since then.. so puts.",

      "body": "About 15 years ago, I did some research on why large accounting software had zero sales in Asia, especially among SMBs. Here is what I found.\n\nImagine going to a small manufacturing store to buy stuff. The owner keeps two virtual pots -- one in the front, the second in the back. The money (and transactions) get split between the two, getting pulled from either as needed when it comes to reporting. The inventory record itself gets split. Much of this is on a trust and deferred payment basis. Come tax time, only one of the pots gets declared. Also, even when there are chain-tracking mechanisms like GST which are built on credits across the supply chain, there are plenty of TXNs where the credits don't apply. All those go to the second pot. Finally, when they have to get debt, they can artificially inflate the valuation by inflating orders through round-tripping by artificially increasing the second pot letting a subsidiary or \"fantom customer\" make those orders.\n\nIt was crazy to see this whole thing in play in India and China at such a wide level. Not to say that Western companies don't do the same shit with IP relocation in tax shelters, but that's another story.\n\nNow scale that to SMCI, where they were once caught doing this and delisted, and have been accused again.\n\n* That 8% of the orders came from their subsidiary, which hints at round-tripping (or worse using that subsidiary to supply to Russia, etc. violating US federal laws)\n* That they pulled future revenues in the present quarter (when payment was not made, and goods were not supplied) to pad EPS and revenues, which went into the earnings report\n* And other discrepancies...\n\nTheir CEO claims no material changes - because these are earnings after all, even though for another quarter. But both are illegal in the US, and if proven THEY WILL be punished.\n\nAnd I can understand why E&Y won't sign on any audit reports without validating that Txns from both pots occurred in the quarter they claimed they would, and earnings from the same period. If they were misreported - internal controls are to be blamed, which is what the CEO claims are being reviewed.\n\nI think if they were clean 10K would have been a routine report. The fact that it has taken so much time implies bad news and legal trouble ahead.\n\nIt would be foolish to touch SMCI at this point. There is a high likelihood they will get delisted and back as an OTC stock.",
