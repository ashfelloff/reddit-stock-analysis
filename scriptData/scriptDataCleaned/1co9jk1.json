      "body": "Last year so many were saying that ChatGPT would disrupt Search and destroy Google’s monopoly (Brad Gerstner, Chamath, etc). They were dead wrong as ChatGPT isn’t a replacement for a search engine. In fact, they had to tie ChatGPT into a search engine to make it useful. GOOGL has doubled since all that doom and gloom in early 2023. Their market share hasn’t been touched. \n\nGoogle has become a verb and that will be incredibly hard to disrupt even if OpenAI launches a search engine that’s slightly better. Not to mention Google’s ad network and ad tech has high switching costs for advertisers. There’s no guarantee OpenAI could even monetize their search engine and pull ad dollars from Google if they manage to take some percentage of market share.",
