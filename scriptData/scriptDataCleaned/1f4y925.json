I suspect it's due to the big institutions purposely dumping to avoid getting their short positions assigned at expiry. I searched around and apparently there's contradictory information claiming Friday should be a bull day, whiich I find ludicrous based on my personal observations.\n\nDoes anyone have the hard statistics on this?

Unless they're swing traders, but they barely influence the market since they often don't use leverage and they don't have the funds that Institutions have.\n\nWhy do options affect the market? Because they must be hedged. If I buy a long call contract at 130 for NVDA, the market maker is essentially going short 130. They don't want to have any direction in the market, all they want is to profit off commissions fees, other misc fees, and spreads. So they hedge by BUYING 100 shares. This hedge is dynamic however and is generally calculated using dynamic. If the strike is very far away or has low probability, they won't hedge right away.",

      "body": "Here a GPT answer:\nThe trend of the S&P 500 declining around the time of the European market closure and then recovering during the trading day is a topic of interest among traders and analysts. Here are some key points regarding this phenomenon:\n\nObservations on the Trend\n\nMarket Dynamics:\n\nThe S&P 500 often reacts to global market movements, including those from Europe. When European markets close, any negative sentiment or economic data can lead to a dip in U.S. markets.\n\nRecovery Patterns:\n\nHistorically, there have been instances where the S&P 500 has shown resilience, recovering losses later in the trading day. This can be attributed to various factors, including:\n\nInvestor Sentiment: U.S. investors may react differently to news than their European counterparts, leading to a rebound.\n\nMarket Adjustments: As the day progresses, traders may reassess their positions, leading to buying opportunities.\n\nRecent Trends:\n\nRecent market behavior has shown that the S&P 500 can recover from initial losses, especially when driven by strong fundamentals or positive economic indicators in the U.S.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile there is anecdotal evidence and some historical data supporting the trend of the S&P 500 dipping at European market closure and recovering later, it is essential to analyze specific market conditions and broader economic indicators to understand the underlying causes fully. Traders often monitor these patterns to make informed decisions, but they should also consider the volatility and unpredictability of the markets.\n\nSPY",

So for example if a bunch of calls were ITM because someone sold them the calls, they would exercise then sell the calls in the morning, dropping the price. The drop in price causes puts to go ITM, and then they exercise those and the price goes back up.\n\n\nLikewise in the last hour stuff loses all its extrensic value, so stuff gets exercised then too.\n\n\nThis pattern happens overnight entering Friday as well. People short overnight then exercise the call to close the position. Whoever got early exercised buys the shares in the morning.",
