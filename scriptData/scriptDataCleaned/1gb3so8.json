          "body": "Thank you!\n\n  \nReally, it was a huge mix of things (sorry, this might get wordy).\n\nRecently we broke out of a very long long down trend from \\~ Nov 2021, and retest the break for a full week before \"the event.\" We gaped down under the breakout exactly to the 200 daily EMA, and held there for a week. I had been building a TSLL position since June 2024 because of news of their battery advancements, and talk of robotaxi event. Once we broke down, I ended up liquidating my TSLL to protect profit as I wanted some time to digest and see what the market did on this support. I ended up swapping to NFLX before earnings with this postion, which ended up playing out pretty well. \n\n  \nAfter I digested \"the event\" and really thought about what was introduced and ridiculed, I regained my confidence in where things were going. One of the largest gripes from people was the fact that maybe some of the robots were controlled via VR headsets, or something remotely. To me, that is HUGE, you're telling me someone from anywhere in the world could control one of those robots and do a huge variety of task? The van they previewed for mass transit/deliveries is a huge innovation as well. The robotaxi, sure, maybe some day.\n\nBut it all adds up to a vision that I think a lot of people greatly discounted. The big take away was there was not enough \"details\". Ok, Elon is no idiot, so the market gave him the easiest soft ball to just provide them with details on the call. I had a gut feeling he would listen to all the cries and deliver a call with everything they wanted, and then some.\n\nSo I sold 70% of my NFLX, bought back my TSLL, and then wanted to try to leverage the possibility of a 240 TSLA bounce(back to the trendline breakout/gap) after earnings via options, they were dirt cheap because the market was so bearish.\n\n  \nAll in all, it was pretty lucky, but not just a whim. Honestly, I could of played it even better, I left a lot on the table today, but I'm not worried about it, I'm quite grateful, and I have all my exposure to TSLL still without worrying about my options I sold. Will I play their next earnings? I'm not sure, if there is a good setup, probably. But this opportunity was just very obvious to me.\n\nFor next week/earnings I'm watching, I really think Goog, MSFT, and AMZN have a pretty good setup to surprise market. I've been buying some ATM calls for Nov, and also some for March 21st 2025. One of them, or all of them I believe is going to drop some pretty good numbers on their data hosting growing due to demand of AI tools. Many people are building some great systems but cannot afford to build out their own infrastructure so they lease it. \n\nI also believe looking at TA these three are lagging the market quite heavily, thus have room to run (although, not as much as TSLA). \n\nSorry for the long winded response, but you asked :\\*D\n\nPs. I've also been loading up RIOT $9 calls for March 21 2025 as well on dips. Their valuation/under performance makes 0 sense to me with their hash rate/utility contracts they get in Texas.  They're also talking about diversifying in to AI hosting.",
