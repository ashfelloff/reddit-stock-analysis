Well it's even worse than that because the majority of trades are driven by algorithms (look up high frequency trading), and that does 2 main things - introduce market volatility (which options do as well because they have so much leverage), and cause the price fluctuations to remain relatively small.\n\n\n¬†Anyways you can imagine thousands and thousands of different algorithms evaluating trades and trading thousands of times per second. Their net effect controls the stock price. So it will typically shift around news, and because we don't know news ahead of time it's always a gamble.",
