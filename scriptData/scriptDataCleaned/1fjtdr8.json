  "selftext": "Hi Everyone \nI received around $85,000 recently as a back payment for a long term consultancy assignment I was working. Instead of spending it, I was thinking of saving it on the side for the future. Now the question - should I put the amount in an ETF right now such as S&P 500. I’m skeptical of the stock market these days considering it’s already overvalued and the risk of an impending recession but then I also get a FOMO. The second option I’ve been thinking about is putting the entire money in either bonds or t-bills for a safe return without risk. \n\nYour advice, albeit I understand non financial, would be greatly appreciated.

Lump Sum starts with baseline of a person having $X. X could be very large or it could be very small. The size of X isn't relevant to the strategies. We just start with $X and then assess how to invest it and in the case of DCA the goal is minimizing exposure to drawdowns in the near future and with lump sum we are maximizing overall returns. The people who are investing 10% of their paychecks (or whatever dollar amount) every two weeks are not dollar cost averaging. They are just working within the confines of their situations. We're not basing our market entries off arbitrary stuff like the vernal equinox (or however the DCA crew does it), we're basing it off of pay roll. I didn't read the animal sinews and deduce that the 1st and 15th were the best times to invest because that's when Venus is retrograde. It's just when the money comes. Investing out of every single paycheck is quite literally the fastest way for people to get their money into the market and thus maximize their time in the market which is exactly what DCA'ing tries to avoid.",

Do research. I think the idea against just chucking it all on one market means that if the USA has a bad year then you have a bit of an hedge. And then Mark Cuban recently said the idea of using 10% of your portfolio on stock picks, say 0.5% on 20 stocks, that are higher risk higher reward - I have my bias and say that a few I have the following invested in: higher risk: Polestar, Sofi, LAC, Rivian etc. others more secure First Solar, Novo, Eli Lily & then your usual blue chips Amazon, Apple, Google. You also want to think of industry diversification so you’re not all in on one industry; tech being my largest but I try to keep it below 18%. \n\nI actually do 40% ETF, 30% Blue Chip, 20% Medium Risk mid-cap/high growth, 10% high risk high growth but no one position/holding (in anything even ETF) has greater than 5% total of my portfolio. So the most I can ever lose on a stock is 5%. But my highest at the moment is Google at 4.2%. So like penny stocks like Maxxelon. It’s 1%. This is riskier than ETFs. \n\nThe riskier the more variability you’ll have I.e in August I dropped 10% but had it back in 2 weeks. I was up 3% from this morning to close with -1% for the day. So take into account your risk tolerance. But, diversify, don’t mess around with options or shorting, try not to overtrade - no one know on a particularly day whether a stock will go up or down it’s a 50-50. Take profits where you feel it’s appropriate or something is reaching a ceiling. Don’t be afraid to go some side cash and hold cash for an opportunity. \n\nMost I can suggest is to read up and learn on investing. Until then bonds and interest accounts are stable enough rewards and 85K until you get your knowledge up. But even then remember there are plenty of investment bankers who fail to simply outperform the market. Also, compounding is your friend!",

People lost a lot of money after Trump won by assuming the initial signals were negative and waiting to jump in. So they missed the upturn. On the other hand, January 2022 (edited, I had a typo that said 2021) was the start of a couple of tough years lol\n\n\nI would say what matters is OP's risk tolerance. High yield savings accounts are still at pretty decent rates, so that could be a good option for semi liquid portion of the total funds. The rest can be portioned in index funds and a small percentage maybe in a stock or two they're interested in with lots of potential upside. ",
