Its estimated that trillions of these cicadas will come crawling out of the ground in droves. The last time this took place was in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson was president. \n\nHere is a map of the areas that will be largely affected by this event. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/afafjtu7d2vc1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=44695b8bc51732e6c4a2d561d6e5c9025a528d91\n\nWith a cicada infestation sure to come next, many people are ready to start stocking up on their bug spray. The company with leading market share in this space Scotts Miracle-Gro who owns many companies including Ortho Bug Sprays. \n\nNow where the fuck can I buy these products if I'm covered in cicadas, you might ask?\n\nLowes, Walmart and Home Depot carry these products across the entire nation. Here are maps of their locations in the US for reference.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/149mqlb0g2vc1.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f3aecca8bddd9c4dace6552ac1d7037222e9175\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u4fxln75g2vc1.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=ceefd9da364a4e7ac6d76030e63fc19dea59cc8b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0j10xy1yh2vc1.png?width=2448&format=png&auto=webp&s=a5e38ed0c4f99b179221a84aa0a90d06e4b831c2\n\nSMG$ is currently on a downtrend trading around $67/$68, and a 52wk high of $77.95. With about 60% of market share in this sector and its availability to consumers in these affected areas, it will definitely make the needle move over the next couple of months. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMY PLAY\n\nSMG$  May 17 70$ call/ June 21 70$ call. \n\ninfo links:\n\n[https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/cicadas-2024-emergence-periodical-brood-2024-map-cicada-rcna134152](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/cicadas-2024-emergence-periodical-brood-2024-map-cicada-rcna134152)\n\n[https://www.ft.com/content/a8f1462a-878d-4177-bd58-216a7508227b](https://www.ft.com/content/a8f1462a-878d-4177-bd58-216a7508227b)",
