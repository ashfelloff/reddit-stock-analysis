Not generally worth the cost. Only very large companies did (Microsoft, Amazon) and now they sell it. \n\nI work in this space....I've used Snowflake, aws, and Azure. Snowflake is just not as good of a product, it's really that simple. Here are my key reasons. \n\n. Snowflake can cost more if you aren't careful, they have a \"pay as you go system\" so if something goes wrong you can end up paying WAY more than intended. Some consider this a little predatory. AWS(redshift) you pay for a certain amount of data and they simply don't let you go over. \n\n\n. Both AWS and Microsoft offer the same service...... and much more. Automation is HUGE right now, and aws and Microsoft both have built In options for you to include automation however you want, and are very flexible. \n\n\n. This is really the only pro for Snowflake in my opinion.....it's very very easy to setup. The documentation is very good, and someone with little experience can probably set it up without many issues. Redshift has worse documentation, but someone familiar with it won't have issues.\n\nMy opinion though. I've only been working in this space for about 3 years, more experience professionals might have more insight.",
