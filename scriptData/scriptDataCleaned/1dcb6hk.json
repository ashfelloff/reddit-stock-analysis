  "selftext": "Last big surge in volume was during the Krashkari scare during Fed talk around April 4th. It was also heavily towards the downside. We had BTD investors swoop in and NVDA hype causing a slow melt up to new ATH. Essentially centered around one stock. Jensen signed some jacked tits, said AI a few more times, and announced a 10:1 stock split. This may be a sell the news type event where the hype has been announced and executed. Now the market may be looking to start pulling back, especially with a heavily anticipated CPI report and interest rate decision coming out Wednesday.",
