              "body": "You receive a loan (margin) and sell call options. You will receive the premium (amount you sold the option for) as income. Now, you have 2 ways of selling these options. Covered or Naked (yes these are the actual terms; no I do not mean naked in front of your 4 monitor setup in your wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs in-law suite).     \n\nCovered means you took the loan and purchase shares of the underlying and limit the number of options sold to the number of times you can divide your shares by 100. Example: you bought 244 shares, so you can only sell 2 options against your position (244 / 100 = 2.44). Now, this is great for when the stock doesn‚Äôt go above the price you sold the call for because then, as most of these regards know, the call would expire worthless meaning you keep all your premiums.    \n\nNaked means you took the loan and sold way more options than you had the liquidity to cover. The nice part is you‚Äôre making money money in premiums then you were before. The dangerous part is if you only had the money to purchase 244 shares, but sold 10 calls that are now In-The-Money (ITM). You now have to come up with the funds to buy and extra 756 shares (10 calls x 100 shares each - 244). *Technically, you didn‚Äôt own the 244 shares when selling naked but you had the capability to purchase that much, so just roll with the example dammit*. Basically the only way you get out of this situation is to sell your bodily holes in a Wendy‚Äôs parking lot, or declare bankruptcy. Hope this helps.",

                          "body": "It‚Äôs real simple. \n\nIf you buy 100 shares of any stock you can now sell a COVERED call. This means you‚Äôve already ‚Äúcovered‚Äù your contract. \n\nLet‚Äôs say the stock is trading at $20 right now. You bought those 100 shares for $15 each. \n\nYou sell your covered call at a strike price of say $22 for a premium of $100. \n\nThe person who buys that contract will pay you $100 for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase your 100 shares at $22 each. \n\nIn almost every case if the price doesn‚Äôt go above $22 then the buyer of the contract will not ALSO purchase (exercise the contract) your shares. So what happens is you keep the $100 premium plus you keep your shares. \n\nNow, if the price goes above $22 before the contract expires, the buyer now decide to purchase your shares. \n\nIn that case you‚Äôd get $100 (premium) + $2,200 = $2,300 total. \n\nIf the actual price of the stock goes waaaay above $22 you still only get $2,200 + 100. But the person who exercised the contract is now sitting on a much bigger unrealized profit. \n\nNow since you purchased the shares for $15 each your profit is \n$7 x 100 shares + $100 premium = $800 profit. \n\nThat‚Äôs a good start. The other terms you can look up.\n\nDo not sell/buy NAKED (you don‚Äôt own the shares) until you have the cash to cover your bet should you lose.\n\nIf you do this, and you‚Äôre doing it on margin (loan) the sale (exercise) may still go through and your account will go negative until you deposit more cash. Until then you cannot make anymore trades.",
