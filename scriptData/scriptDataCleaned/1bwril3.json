You can lean on external expertise from the joint vendors and consultants (and hire employees from the competition).\n\nIt is just very expensive and will take years. Shareholders might not be happy.\n\n\nIntel will be the chip maker of the western world as soon as they have equivalent volume and technology close enough to TSMC. The big question is indeed whether they can do it profitability enough.\nToday everyone is skeptical, that is the best time to buy cheap shares...",

They keep running the old equipment, they just add a new line. That's why older chips are cheaper, everyone has already paid for their equipment and can just keep making chips on it.\n\nSo if you are watching what a competitor has successfully accomplished, you are going to be able to copy them in 22 months, MINIMUM. \n\nThey are already on the next generation when you are getting your equipment delivered and dialed in. \n\nAlso the bulk of the income that pays for the expensive equipment is made in the first 2 years. When margins are very high. 2 years out, competitors come online and you cut your prices by 50%.\n\nNow you are making chips that are being replaced in datacenters all over the country.
