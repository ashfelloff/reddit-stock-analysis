They want companies to make cars in India. Tesla wants to first start selling in India and then move manufacturing which India is not agreeing to. Tesla wants India to give them an exception with tariffs. \n\nBMW went through the same in India a decade back and eventually gave up, moved manufacturing to India and now has a large operation where they make cars for Indian market and also export to SE Asian countries from India.",

China and America has their corruption, but it really feels like the current economic progress in India is the result of fraud. If you read the claims made in the Hindenburg report about Adani, who's basically business partners with Modi, the current game plan is to scam scam scam. I really feel bad for the people stuck in India with such corrupt leadership. I think this explains why the Indian diaspora is so high.

If your car costs $50k then import tax will be another $50k on it and then road tax, insurance etc. Then reports said that Reliance, Google Mukesh Ambani dude is very rich and powerful, will form a JV with Tesla in India and boom the import tax was reduced to 15% but there was a cavaet that Tesla will have to buy some batteries from groups like TATA. Also as per reports Musk wanted to launch Starlink in India. But there was no way that Jio (Reliance) and the others (airtel, vodafone idea) would let him do that as Starlink would have eaten them all up. Musk was basically coming to announce these things but I guess somewhere the disagreement happened.",
