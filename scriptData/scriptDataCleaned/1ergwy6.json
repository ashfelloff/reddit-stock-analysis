And it‚Äôs food. As long as they have similar/same supply chains and quality. They will keep getting customers. Because ppl go there to eat. Ppl go SBUX to have their ego boosted by a name on a cup, or just very craving that they went to the nearest place. For CMG They will be waiting on hopes. \n\nNow you can see how CMG turns out to be a bull play hedged by longing SBUX as well, on a thesis of food and beverage companies will continue without turmoils.

Be aware though that if we have an actual market crash, most people on these investing subs (who are mostly backwards looking and behind the curve) will have the same attitude towards U.S. stocks that they have towards Chinese stocks right now - no eagerness to invest or \"buy the dip\" and saying stuff like \"The market is a scam, I ain't touching that shit.\"",
