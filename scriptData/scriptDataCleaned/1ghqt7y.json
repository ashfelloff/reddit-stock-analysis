              "body": "I’ll probably get downvoted cuz people hate it, but most of these I got from the Motley Fool. I started out listening to their podcasts (motley fool money and rule breaker investing), then my grandfather had a subscription and let me use it and I liked their analysts videos so I got the cheapest subscription. People hate it bc their advertising is aggressive and they promote a ton of hype stocks that are extremely over valued. But I learned to weed those out, from buying into some and losing money. There are a few specific analysts I like that have similar investing strategies as myself so I take some of their ideas. I always do my own research too and try to avoid their overhyped stocks, super expensive stocks and unprofitable/pre revenue stocks. \n\n\n\n\nI like to buy and hold then DCA/add to the winners. However, like you I sometimes struggle to buy more when they’re performing really well. Like AXON and IRM have done really well for me, but I just can’t seem to get myself to buy more bc of the price and how fast they went up. But companies like HD or DLR that just steadily beat the market without crazy jumps I was able to add up on. \n\n\n\nSometimes I do some trading, usually end up regretting it bc I miss out on gains. So I’m trying to teach myself to just buy and hold. Don’t add to losers, but add to winners when a good opportunity arises. This is another reason I like the Motley Fool, they have a live show every morning for subscribers and many of their analysts have this approach and help keep me calm when the market is volatile. They discuss some of their winners and how companies like Netflix have had 5 70%+ drawdowns over the last 15 years, but if you help the whole time you’d have really great returns. If you added when it dropped (or after as it starts to recover), then you’d be very wealthy after awhile. If you don’t add to losers, then they tend to not have a large enough impact on your portfolio to matter if they drop down 90% so why sell? An example for me is $ME I had a starter position just a couple hundred bucks and it tanked. I road it out for a m year at a 90% loss and selling wouldn’t matter bc it was like $20, on the off chance it became a real winner like a Netflix situation I still had it and could monitor it and add in if it did come around. I did end up selling for some tax loss harvesting. A similar situation was RKLB, I first bought in at like $15 a couple years ago. Road it all the way down to $3, but I really really was convinced in the company and even though it wasn’t a winner I added more to get my cost basis down to the low 4s, now it’s around $11-12 again and I think it still is a 10-20 bagger in the next 5-10 years. \n\n\n\nSorry for the wall of text. TL;DR is to simply buy good companies at good prices. Do your own research. Invest for the long term.",

Does it make delivery quicker, easier or more convenient? Can it navigate upstairs in a downtown area where the use case is probably the highest? Does it make sense residentially - at all? \n\nThis does not fit “boring” and “consistently outperforms”. Extremely speculative. If it catches it will be 10x and more easily but the odds they burn through their cash without new investment and the AI bubble pops is higher IMO. This is a really good stock to make the case that there is in fact a bubble. \n\nHere’s where I think it does have some value. The biggest costs for ride share companies are 1) labor and 2) insurance. It eliminates labor and reduces the cost of insurance drastically. The robot is extremely unlikely to cause a fatal collision compared to a distracted delivery driver. I think that’s why you’re seeing some external investment in it. I don’t think it adds value for consumers at all though. It’s similar to people not wanting a chat bot for customer service. People want to deal with other people. \n\nI am talking a lot of shit but I do own the stock. An extremely small amount.",
