Make Truth Social the only avenue for all government communications. Trump's already looking for any excuse to gut the bureaucracy, this will be his chance.\n\nMost prediction markets and modelling has the election as a toss-up. If Trump has roughly a 50% chance of becoming president, the stock has a real chance to moon. Even if he doesn't actually do anything with the company, the mere possibility of massive corruption and influence peddling will likely lead to a huge post-election spike.\n\nIs the stock tradable? Probably not, IV is too high and there's way too much uncertainty. But absent persistent selling pressure I could see an argument that this is a cheap way to bet on a Trump win.",
