A vape that would last 3 packs is like $12. \n\nI often wondered who TF would smoke a ciggy when it‚Äôs cheaper to vape. \n\nIn the US it seems cigs have been resorted to two classes: the class over 50 that did it for forever and isn‚Äôt going to stop regardless of cost or health, and the poor. Lots of overlap that there, draw your own conclusions.\n\nBut what ‚Äúkid‚Äù (20-30) would buy cigs?",
