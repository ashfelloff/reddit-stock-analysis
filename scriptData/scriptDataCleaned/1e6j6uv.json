  "title": "Ok so this is what you need to know before playing NFLX earnings (prediction inside)",
  "score": 45,
  "selftext": "Guys, NFLX is releasing it's earnings today. Is anyone playing it? The stock hit a record high of $700.99/share in 2021 and is currently trading near $650. Why am I playing it? This stock is prone to big moves after reporting earnings and can easily gap up if the numbers are strong. But obviously as everyone knows, if the numbers disappoint, the stock can easily gap down. To help you prepare, I've written up all my research on the stock ahead of the earnings with my play at the bottom. \n\n\nNetflix is undergoing the biggest revamp of its TV streaming app in more than a decade to try to keep its 270 million subscribers engaged for longer periods. 270 fucking million. It also wants their investors to focus on how satisfied its customers are more than how many subscribers the company brings in.\n\nWhat sucks is they plan on no longer reporting quarterly subscriber gains next year, having already dumped its regular forecasts for quarterly additions. It's looking to wring more cash from its lower-priced plans, which show ads within its streaming content. \n\nNetflix in fact told us back in May that its ad-supported tier, which costs around $6.99 a month, topped 40 million active users that month, up from just 5 million over the year-earlier month. Insane. \n\nStill, we will continue to be focused on subscriber additions. I've read that analysts expect Netflix to have brought in a net 4.82 million new users over the three months ended in June.\n\n**Netflix pushing into live events**\n\nThat's still likely to help drive revenue 16% above the year-earlier quarter, however, to around $9.5 billion. I hear that this figure could rise as high as $9.8 billion over the three months ending in September as the group mulls new price increases to match recent moves by its competitors.\n\n\"In our view, recent price increases by competitors and ongoing low rates of churn support Netflix price increases over coming quarters,\" said Justin Patterson; an analyst from KeyBanc Capital Markets. He recently lifted his Netflix price target by $22 to $735 a share. Churn is the measure of subscribers switching to rival services btw.\n\n\"As pricing returns to a more normal cadence, we believe Netflix has ample room to sustain more than 10% annual revenue growth with 2% to 3% annual operating-margin expansion,\" he added. \n\nAlso if you've been reading up, you'll know that Netflix is also looking to beef up its offerings of live programming, which are crucial to the growth of advertising-based video on demand. These include the addition of two National Football League games on Christmas Day and next year's launch of WWE \"Raw\" wrestling events.\n\nIn January Netflix agreed to pay TKO Group Holdings $5 billion for the streaming rights to \"Raw,\" the WWE's flagship weekly wrestling program. Streaming is slated to start in 2025. \n\n**Emmy haul**\n\n\"Netflix’s still limited foray into live major sports with Christmas NFL games complementing scripted WWE content and successful behind the scenes efforts including Drive to Survive and Break Point reinforces a view that streaming bundles will increasingly emulate the traditional linear bundle,\" said Matthew Harrigan, an analyst from Benchmark. \n\nOriginal content has also been increasingly important for Netflix, although its recent slate has been helped by shows that it licenses from mainstream networks as well.\n\nLast summer's strikes by both the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild hit Netflix hard, ultimately reducing its overall offering of TV and movie titles by around 15%, following at least a decade of increases. Netflix now looks to be focusing on quality over quantity.\n\nNetflix earned a total of 107 Emmy nominations this year for titles including \"The Crown,\" \"The Bear\" and the controversial series \"Baby Reindeer.\" Winners are slated to be announced Sept. 15. \n\nNetflix shares were marked 0.36% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $649.82 each. That move would extend the stock's year-to-gain to around 33.5% and put it within touching distance of the all-time peak of $697.49 it reached earlier this month.\n\nFrom what I see, analysts expect Netflix to report $4.74 per share, up from $3.29 per share in the year-ago period. Netflix is expected to post revenue of $9.53 billion, compared to $8.19 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. And with this many of them are raising their price targets with the stock. We already heard from Patterson. Well Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris has maintained his buy rating and raised the price target from $700 to $735 on July 17. This analyst specifically is reported to have an accuracy rate of 76%.\nB of A Securities analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich boosted her price target from $700 to $740 just a few days ago on July 15th. Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne raised his from $700 to $780. JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth, from $650 to $750. Bruh. These are all experts basically telling you to BUY BUY BUY ahead of earnings. And they're all considered \"high accuracy\" analysts. Evercore ISI Group analyst Mark Mahaney boosted his PT from $650 to $700.\n\nSo with this I'm getting a call spread. Why a spread? Because FUCK the IV crush is a lot. We're aiming for a 10% increase, so it's reasonable to get the 7/19 675c for 15.40, and sell the 710c for 6.95. This means you can grab the spread for $845. If the stock goes up to 710 or higher, then we should see about 4x gains on this play. Who's with me?",
