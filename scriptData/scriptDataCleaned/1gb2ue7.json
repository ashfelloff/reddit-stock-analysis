Unless you are trading contracts that are very close to expiration - you're gonna want to book gains whenever the contract makes the move in the direction that benefits your trade. That's pretty much the best possible outcome - continuing to hold the contract is just allowing your profit to potentially be erased and now you are again waiting for the same move which may or may not come again. Best approach is to book your gain into the strength and stand on the sidelines until you witness the pullback and perhaps load up again upon reversion to the mean.\nGreed is what will end your trading career.",
