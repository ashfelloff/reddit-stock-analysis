I know we all want a big big contract, and I'm sure it's coming. All big contracts start with smaller contracts to prove up the concept usually.\nThat being said I think there's a couple areas where we are in the late stages of proving up, such as powders and drosrite, pfa's destruction, torches for iron ore pelletization, to name a few. So we are at the point that a big big contract could come any day. Jmo",
