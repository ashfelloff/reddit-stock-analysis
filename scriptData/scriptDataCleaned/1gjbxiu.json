The space economy is a violent one and destroys cash and balance sheets at a rapid gaylocity. \n\nThe only way to be FCF positive on the long run is not to launch, it‚Äôs to have a paying service ! A mega constellation selling subscriptions for the greatest number. \n\nA lot of companies can build a mega constellation, not many can build one AND send it to its target orbit : \n\n- Only SpaceX has achieved this prowess. \n\n- Blue Origin seems to be on its way ever since daddy Bezos left Amazon to 100% focus. \n\n- $RKLB is the next one to do just dat. \n\nPeter J Beck is a gem, brilliant passionate yet humble and focused engineer while you‚Äôre a regard who can barely read, who should you trust your money with ? \n\nGay power to all of you. \n\nPT by end 2025 : $20 \n\nFull position : 200x $12 Jan 2027 call options avg $2.6\n",
