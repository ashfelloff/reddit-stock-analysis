This week was the confirmation that something is indeed broken with this particular stock. I don’t think anyone outside of the players that were shorting the stock at $1 in 2020 knows what the real situation is.\n\nIt is true, I only have 2 things I can rely on, price and volume, any data apart from price and volume is 100% tampered with. Only the very top at Wall St probably have the real data on short interest, plus they have some insane tools not even available to retail, swaps for example.\n\nSo based off of price and volume alone, why didn’t shorts continue to short it down to single digits this quarter? And if the stock found support at $10 and they couldn’t make it go down anymore, why not just run it to safe levels, $20 and short it again from there. Why bring it back all the way to $80 in a couple days. Think about it. The stock went from $17.50 Friday close to $80 on Tuesday pre market. That wasn’t retail bro. That wasn’t anyone but some very specific players that had the whole thing orchestrated for weeks or even months",

I mean by you're own logic here, not even institutions outside of these guys have any reason to buy in because somehow DFV tweeting didn't cause the temporary spike. \n\nSo now we have to explain either why the shorts bought in, or we have to explain why the non shorts did, but totally not because of DFV FOMO. Or rather, you have to try and explain.\n\n>it is true, I only have 2 things I can rely on, price and volume, any data apart from price and volume is 100% tampered with.\n\nGod, dismissing any data point that doesn't suit your needs, I see no way that this could possibly go catastrophically wrong with all the massive, blinding holes patched by the generic \"some conspiracy or other\" which changes based on the whims of the day.\n\nLike if you're dismissing everything else, why in the absolute fuck do you think volume is somehow perfectly tamper free. Every other fucking factor feeding into it is somehow bullshit but somehow, volume is immune from fuckery? \n\n>why not just run it to safe levels, $20 and short it again from there.\n\nWhy throw in all your eggs in low during a spike in price? The stock has on average taken a while to drop down so if you wanted to make good money as a short there was no reason to borrow stocks early. Even if you think its going to go down, you at least want an idea of the timeframe.",
