  "selftext": "I’m genuinely curious. I’m not trying to dog on any of yall. I’m sure some of you have made a lot of money on individual stocks.\n\nBut like… I struggle to understand why you guys even bother. I just don’t see a point in investing in single company stocks.\n\nThey’re too volatile, companies change, etc. for instance Cisco used to practically be a monopoly. Now I’m not even sure it’ll reach the ATH from 20 years ago… ever. \n\nAlso all of the time invested. Time is money… you really gotta research a lot before even considering buying stocks. \n\nSo why not just go S&P 500, bonds, 401k, etc. it’s going great for me (130k net worth at 25.) \n\nJust curious, thanks.

Beating SPY/QQQ isn't particularly rare; if you happen to pick the best performing stocks in an index without picking the worst, you'll beat the index's returns.\n\nThe problem is that it's almost impossible to do consistently over time without taking larger risks. For example, buying TQQQ will probably give you better returns than QQQ, but you would be exposing yourself to much higher levels of risk and could much more easily lose most/all of your money if the market has a nasty downturn.\n\nThere are funds like SPYG that have slightly outperformed SPY over the last 5-10 years by weighing their stocks differently without taking on any significant extra risk, but there's no guarantee of that continuing in the future; they could just as easily match or underperform SPY.",

But he obviously doesn't think that *noone* can or should try to beat the index through stock picking. Then his entite life work of Berkshire would be a self-contradiction. \n\nHe didn't bet that no financial advisor/fund manager can beat the index. He bet that this particular advisor wouldn't be able to. \n\nAdditionally, a big drawdown of investing in actively managed funds is the annual fees you pay to them. This raises the \"threshold\" for performance - the fund/advisor has to not just beat the index, but beat it by a margin high enough to make up for the fees paid including the missed potential compounding effect of those. When picking stocks yourself, there is no such annual devaluation of portfolio. (Yes there are still expenses related to buying and selling stocks - but that is another discussion, and they should be insignifact unless you are actually *trading*, rather than investing.) \n\nThere are also other benefits to picking stocks yourself, rather than through advisors/active funds. The latter will often have some guidelines they must to adhere to. This could be diversification of sectors/geographies, level of risk tolerance, asset class(eg. stocks/bonds/commodoties/crypto/real estate) and so on. Therefore you are more free to overweight certain asset classes, sectors etc., when both you and the hypothetical asset manager agree that it will outperform the market in the future. Additionally, you can tailor it more to your specific circumstances, goals, risk tolerance and time-frame. As an example, technology and small caps may be more volatile, but provide better returns over the long run. If you are 25 and saving for retirement, you may want to be overweight in these assets, as returns will be better, and the shorter-term swings won't matter to you. On the other hand, if your investment is the be realized in the near term (e.g. for real estate or as retirement payments), you may want to underweigh them as you don't want to jeopardize being able to buy the house when you want to, or you may be forced to sell assets on a downturn because you need the cash. \n\nThe bottom line is that *yes* there are benefits and good reasons for stockpicking as a private investor. Both over actively manages funds and passive indexes. But yes, there are also major risks, pitfalls and disadvantages. And the calculus for the majority of people will be to just use index funds. But for some, it may be wise to include some individual stocks or targeted ETF's in your investment strategy.",

However, I couldn’t find a good screener for doing that, so I created my own screener back in July 2017 to filter all megacaps stocks for growth and updated my stock list annually (mid-year) to keep the list from getting stale (what grows well one year, may not grow well the next). \n\nSince that time in July 2017 to Sept 2024 my strategy has gone up +463.49% with +26.93% average annualized returns.  \n\nFor comparison purposes S&P (total returns) went up by +169.53% for a +14.66% annualized growth rate over the same period.\n\nSince July of this year I have been sharing my stock list with individuals who are interested in trying it out for themselves.  The stock list is free, but for research purposes I am looking to find out how many people will use it and track how much money is being invested in my strategy over time, so If you would like to try it, please message me directly and I can provide you more information about the strategy and how to obtain the list.",

      "body": "What about those who are in a different situation than yours who don’t have 130k by 25 years old? The housing market is a disaster and inflation has bent so many people without a decent support system over in the last 5 years, so the dream of striking oil with a rocketing individual stock is about the only chance some have to buy a little breathing room aka financial freedom for themselves or their family in the short term. A nominal gain of 5-10% a year doesn’t cut it for those who are living in poverty or only have a small pile of cash to try to grow. Try putting 2k in a slow growing ETF and see how little It gets you over time when you can only put a couple bucks in when you can afford it, and you’re living paycheck to paycheck. \n\nI’m up 30%+ this year after being a first time investor for the last 3-4 months on single stocks and avoiding options. and that’s with nvidia only being 20% or so of my portfolio. Not a brag by any means because some people here make that look like child’s play. But in my opinion it stands that you can definitely make more than the s&p on a reliable basis if you do your research, invest in companies that seem like they are going to continue positive performance, and most importantly as long as you have the patience to sit through down days where your stocks are getting eviscerated and you can stomach it without liquidating your losses. Let’s not forget the luck aspect too. You won’t hit the lottery with snp like you would a single stock that breaks out. \n\nIf I had a 6 figure lump, or a much longer time horizon, I’d put way more in ETFs but it’s just not that simple. If I don’t yolo a large portion of the money I can afford to lose into stocks that may eventually moon, I’ll never be able to afford a comfortable life so it’s just about all or nothing as safely as I can do it. \n\nJust my two cents, this is definitely not financial advice!",

      "body": "Because I can easily outperform the SPX, it isn’t even hard. Just selling deep ITM puts without doing anything else has massively outperformed the S&P 500. If (when) the overall market sells off for whatever reason, my delta exposure will be less than yours and I’ll just roll  down in steps to keep collecting theta premium. If I layer any kind of risk management with VIX on top of that basic strategy alone I’ll be almost completely insulated from the downside, and that doesn’t even begin to include results like 18,000% gains in $NVDA. \n\nNotwithstanding a 20%+ drawdown in the market I’ll outperform you every single time—and you can bet if there’s a 20% retracement I will have already adjusted to profit from the decline while you’re still holding the loss. \n\nAs one of the biggest proponents of buy and hold, Buffett would have never accomplished the same result if he hadn’t been intelligent and involved—being active and strategic has no substitute.\n\nIt takes time, intelligence, diligent risk management, taking advantage of opportunities when there’s fear—$TSM this week, $ASML, etc., but it’s absolutely unequivocal.\n\nUnironically, if you go back 100+ years, almost all of the annualized gains in the SPX statistically are accumulated on an average of  just 17 days a year. Beating the index bigly relies on nothing more than being slightly more long in the market these 17 days and just making sure you’re collecting premium on top of whatever movements the market makes on those other 235.",
