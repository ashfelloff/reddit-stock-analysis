Walmart is also having some trouble meeting their growth targets internationally, so Costco, with a much smaller international footprint, has more upside potential.\n\nFinally, I’m buying 30 DTE options, not shares. I’m expecting a run-up over the next couple weeks as earnings gets closer.

Compare that with Walmart, whose margins have been dropping year after year while rates were high. Costco also can buffer the impact of inflation with membership fee revenue (which increases YoY) and non-food sales, unlike grocery stores.\n\nI don’t think this year’s stock prices reflect anticipation of this specific upcoming earnings report, no.

Maybe they miss and knock a few points off, but I think (hope!) that would only last as long as it takes funds to rebalance their holdings to compensate. There’s no *fundamental* connection between COST and NVDA, just the overlap in ETFs, which I think is mainly just the S&P. So I don’t see that being an extended risk.\n\nEdit: in other words, if NVIDIA sinks a fund, indirectly sinking COST, I would expect funds to buy up the non-NVDA components of the fund separately to take advantage of the stat arb.",
