  "score": 375,
  "selftext": "Lululemon (LULU) is down 45% this year, but the fundamentals actually look really good.\n\n\n\n**The Numbers** \n\n* **Market Cap:** $34 billion\n* **Debt:** Zero. Yep, you read that right. Lululemon has a clean balance sheet.\n* **Free Cash Flow:** Last year, they generated $1.7 billion in free cash flow, which is pretty solid compared to their $1.6 billion net income. \n\n\n\n**Growth Rates Are Great**\n\n* **10-Year Revenue Growth:** 19.7%\n* **5-Year Revenue Growth:** 23.5%\n* **3-Year Revenue Growth:** 25.5%\n\n\n\nLululemon has been on a growth tear, but the stock price has taken a hit. It peaked at $516 in December 2023 and is now down about 45%. I don't know the story for the drop.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3wduisujlrtd1.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7159d2bb9c643b8765a2aa7ed55b3f1d85ef25c\n\n**Brand Power**\n\nLulu has a cult-like following. People love this brand. The community and lifestyle they promote are strong. But sentiment can shift quickly, and that’s what we’re seeing now.\n\n\n\n**Break Down**\n\n* **ROIC:** Amazing returns on invested capital.\n* **Cash Flow Growth:** More cash flow growth than net income growth over the last five years.\n* **Low Debt:** They’re in a great position here.\n\n\n\n**Analyst Projections**\n\nAnalysts expect Lululemon to double its EPS by January 2029. Feels bold but really just a matter of it's old multiples coming back into play.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wsto3yjllrtd1.png?width=2422&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a72d475d9ccc66ee68fd6603433ba6f2aac4d88\n\nSo at what price does buying LULU seem obvious to you?",

I work with kids now and the current fashion trends are baggy bottoms and thrifted; even all the kids I see on reels or tiktok are bagged out. So many kids are being climate and resource conscious and fashion has been so quick to go from baggy to tight back to baggy recently it means there's a huge supply of thriftable clothing that are high quality and still conform to modern trends. \n\n  \nRecently, fashion went from baggy everything, to baggy bottoms and tighter tops. The cycle was super fast, so I wouldn't be surprised to see a huge comeback of tighter clothes over the next decade. That said, the youth are building their foundation today on thrift, and lulu is less of an image brand, and more worn by moms, nurses, people working out, and business casuals who wore it when they were younger. \n\n  \nI don't think the decline was a business thing.

It's initiatives are also completely braindead.\n\nWe used to make less than 20% of our sales to men. One year we had a sale for International Women's Day where only women got 18% off (for gender wage gap) and men got nothing. Countless men walked away and left their items at the cash out of protest.\n\nAlso worth noting quality has gone down significantly and company is no longer standing behind it's promise to replace faulty items. Items used to be made in Vancouver but in order to cut costs now made in China.\n\nFurthermore USD and CAD prices do not account for inflation. For example a $138.00CAD item is also $138.00USD. So people who buy in bulk come up to Canada to shop at a 27% discount.\n\nStaff meetings are wildly unproductive (focused on feelings instead of performance). For example, write something that makes you feel vulnerable.\n\nFunds at store level are allocated to completely random stuff. One time we hosted a ping pong tournament at a local bar that was like a $10K writeoff. There are routine getaways and yoga retreats staff are flewn out to at no cost to themselves. Staff also receive a $250.00/mth credit card to spend on anything fitness related.\n\nI can go on but the company is run horribly.",
