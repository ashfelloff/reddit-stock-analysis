You might make a few bucks but one mistake and you are toast, at least with options.  \n\nI think the semi conductor sector is over bought.  If you are risk tolerant of losing the $200 you could do 0DTE QQQ options near the money especially in the afternoon.  Normally, I’d say this is a terrible idea but the NTM option prices are cheap and fluctuate quickly.  I used to call this my lightening round and only really put up around $30 at a time.  Keep in mind, odds are pretty good this will wipe you out. If you make money don’t be greedy. Make a few bucks and get out.",
