  "selftext": "Listen up, you crayon-munching regards! üñçÔ∏è\n\nImagine you've got a time machine, but instead of going back to buy Apple stock in the 80s or prevent the creation of Robinhood, you can only send ONE piece of financial wisdom to your smooth-brained past self who just stumbled into this casino we call WSB.\n\nWhat nugget of pure golden tendies would you bestow upon your younger, even more autistic self? \n\nWould you:\n- Warn yourself about a specific YOLO that went tits up? \n- Tell yourself to diamond hand that one stock you paper handed too early?\n- Advise yourself to inverse every single play you were about to make?\n- Or just send \"Sir, this is a Wendy's\" to remind yourself not to take any of this too seriously?\n\nSpill the beans, and maybe we'll all learn something (but probably not). \n\nBonus points if you can make your wife's boyfriend proud with your answer.\n\n*Obligatory: This is not financial advice. I eat crayons for breakfast and my brain is smoother than my wife's boyfriend's head.*",
