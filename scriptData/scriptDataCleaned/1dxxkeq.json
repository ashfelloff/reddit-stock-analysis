It’s only a matter of time until we start seeing other EVs overtaking Tsla in the US as well, esp with super chargers opening up to other makes.\n\nBattery storage- there isn’t much here in my opinion. Their solar was pretty much a flop so far T least, and one quarter of big revenue isnt a trend change. Let’s see how they compete longer term. I bet next quarter revenue from energy dips. \n\nOptimus- there are actual competitors ; Boston dynamics >> anything Tesla can do.\n\nDojo - failed\n\nFsd - Elon even mentioned that there data advantage is declining rapidly with model complexity. Let’s see if their approach can compete in the age of generative ai against a platform like NVDA as that starts to get adopted.",

And the main customers all being trillion dollar companies with more cash than they know what to do with?\n\nPeople don’t realize how big their data center growth has been. 426% YOY growth. \n\nEven if NVDA lost ALL of their gaming and AI PC consumers tomorrow, they’d still only have lost less than 10% of their revenue. \n\nThat’s nuts. That means for the “dot com bubble burst” analogy to work, it would be that MSFT, AAPL, META, DELL, and all the titans to all fall at the same time.
