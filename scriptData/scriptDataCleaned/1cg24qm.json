          "body": "Good question. NAV protection gives shareholders the opportunity to redeem their shares at the guaranteed share price, after which time those shareholders do not have a seat at the table to vote on the merger, since the vote is for existing shareholders. So, the only people who will vote as to whether the merger goes through are people who are invested in the company, like Sam Altman and many other founders. Essentially the merger vote is a formality since the people at the table are people who would lose a lot of money if the vote fails. Everyone else sold their shares.\n\nIn addition to this, ALCC has hard tangible cash assets that it is providing Oklo with to get its business up and running, in addition to what Oklo already has on its balance sheet. Given the amount of outstanding shares and the amount of current assets Oklo will have, the worst case scenario, before intangible assets get calculated in, puts the share price fairly close to what it is with NAV protection anyways. The owners and founders are subject to a lockout period that we do not experience, their investment must remain with the company for specified periods of time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljdceckjdgxc1.png?width=920&format=png&auto=webp&s=17db5ca723374869929c11993b56623f3b9dd9c8",

My exit point is if Oklo does not get NRC approval for the second time, but I am betting that they will get that approval, and if they do I expect their value to double at least.",

I think that surge will be very small compared to when they resubmit their NRC application, and then when the Airforce chooses its SMR for Eilson AF Base, and I don't really have the time or ability to try to micro-time things. I did downsize my position some from the time of posting this, but I still have a lot riding on it. I don't want to feel anxiety about needing to watch it every minute of every day. I intend to keep my eye out for the news that will come out this year, possibly soon after merger, and enjoy the slow growth over time. I believe in nuclear power and am quite bullish on it.",
