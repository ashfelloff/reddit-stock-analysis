A turn around has already been developing there as companies adjusted to Nem 3 .\n\nThe rate cuts here and abroad will be like a dose of high octane.\n\nThe utility scale solars are where i would focus my investment on .\n\nExpecting a multiyear rally for profitable solars .\n\nThese had been beaten down to multi year lows and some trade at less than 1x sales - yet are putting millions on the bottom line. Example ARRY trading at 1x sales\n\nARRY is putting more net income on the bottom line than Enphase and Enphase trades at 10x\n\nUtility sector stocks are ARRY, NXT, FSLR-",

          "body": "This is only true for home solutions, which is more politically sensitive.\n\nFor utility level solar, solar farms are proving themselves as reliable and extremely low upkeep cost at the same time as manufacturing them is getting incredibly cheap.\n\nGlobal installed solar capacity has been growing literally exponentially, doubling every 3 years. The more panels that are manufactured, the more economies of scale kick in, and it becomes even cheaper to make, making even not so sunny places cost effective for solar, even in the absence of sufficient grid level storage mechanisms. (Which are also developing fast, just not exponentially like solar.)\n\nIn 10 years, solar will be the largest source of electrical power on the planet. Energy produced by them will cost less than half as much as the cheapest electricity to produce today.\n\nNo politician can deny reality in the long term, as republicans are finding out as people whose homes are destroyed by flooding in the SE US are more likely to believe in climate change regardless of political leaning.\n\nSolar is going to be a huge part of the future, and most people don’t see it yet.\n\nOf course having said this, many of the factors I just named mean that actual margins in the industry will probably go pretty low in the long term, and it’s going to be essentially impossible to establish a moat. So still hard to pick individual winners.",
