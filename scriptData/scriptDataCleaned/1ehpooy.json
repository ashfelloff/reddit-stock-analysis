                  "body": "Ok here goes. So search engines like Google need to “crawl” webpages, meaning visit them as a scripted server and scan the page contents, in order for that page to be “indexed” (appear in search results). Search engines are always crawling because new pages are always being created. That includes a URL to a news post once it’s published. \n\nBonus info: site admins can mostly control the crawling/indexing behavior with a file called robots.txt placed on the site, which is sort of like a privacy policy for crawlers that tells them whether you want to be indexed and what pages not to look at. But any news company won’t be trying this because they want their articles, even paywalled, to be in search results so they get traffic who will maybe pay. Side bonus: as you likely know Google places a certain emphasis on news sources and can pull content from the article to spit back as an answer in a card directly on the results page. Google also runs a system called AMP, which more or less archives a page and stores it on Google servers for faster loading. \n\nAll of those bonus tidbits that you may already be used to experiencing in search without realizing it, mean that Google is already getting scripted access to the entire content of pages like news articles, even when it’s all paywalled. How do they see all the text behind that? Because when their server scrapes a page for indexing or AMP, those sites see the indexer/crawler as “GoogleBot”, whereas they see us as “Chrome 128.0.6 Desktop / Windows 11.1”. This is called the user-agent and it’s the same way sites track your browser and OS. Google simply sets its browser to give its custom name.\n\nAny script kiddie in Python could pull webpages and do the same thing, masquerading simply as GoogleBot or BingBot or what have you. There may be a few other security measures like what IP range is the bot coming from, do they have a display or extensions installed etc. but the useragent is the most important, and it’s freely editable. That’s all archive.is (or 12ft.io) are doing when they programmatically retrieve these pages. They think it’s a search engine looking, so they happily give the full text content so it can get indexed and be in results. \n\nYou can learn more about this on a ycombinator forum with the owner, or the site’s support page where he sometimes explains the mechanics to people. Some sites required further workarounds but obviously they won’t tell us everything so it doesn’t just get patched",
