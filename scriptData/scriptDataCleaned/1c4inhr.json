Whose going to put those parts on? You can reorganize the work stations, and give each person 12 parts to put on. But this takes a long time. You can’t just wake up one day and decide to do it. It takes years. You have to shut down the plant for weeks or months to reorganize the work stations and logistics. You have to change shipping and receiving and material handling operations. You no longer bring bolts A though J to work station 137 left side. Maybe A-C gets moved to station 136, and 137 takes on k-m. The material driver no longer delivers boxes with 1000 bolts on their cart to station 137 at 9 am every day. Those boxes get moved to the delivery driver that stops by at 9:30,1130,130 and restocked on night shift. \n\nAssembly lines are incredibly complicated manpower and logistical operations. You don’t just lay off part of the work force to reduce production. The same way that it takes 2 people to lift a 75 pound box. You can’t reduce it to 1 worker and lift 25% less boxes every day. 1 person can’t lift the 75 pound box at all by themself. \n\nIf they’re we’re laying off an entire shift and reducing production by 50% then you would see a much greater work force reduction. You can easily lay off 20% of office workers or support staff or cleaners without skipping a beat on the production line. Problems may occur in the long run. But it won’t impact production tomorrow. \n\nExcept one time, at our plant they got rid of a guy that ordered some critical parts and shut themselves down for 6 weeks since the lead time was so long. But that was just improperly assessing a support workers job before eliminating it.",
