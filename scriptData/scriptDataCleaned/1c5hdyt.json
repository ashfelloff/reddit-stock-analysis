They are still living off the AI madness from last year, they have sold everything they can make already.\n\nIf the rest of the industry starts pulling back on their CAPEX spending however, that will be a future event for Nvidia since it will effect production and sales several quarters down the line.",

In fact, many companies have already done exactly that.\n\nAnd so far, almost all the orders have gone to the big boys. NVDA might claim to not play favorites, but would you rather sell $10 Billion worth of your product to one company (MSFT = 15% of total NVDA sales) - or enter into 1,000 contracts with numerous small companies for the same revenue amount.\n\nSure, you might have to cut a deal with the big buyer and lose some profits on margins - but imagine the resources and overheard required to sell the same $ amount to 10,000 smaller players.\n\nAnd there are still countless small players (biotechs, start-ups, etc) still waiting on their chance to buy NVDA GPUs but have been shut out by the billion-dollar buyers.\n\n\\*Speculation by a full-blown regard that knows nothing.\\*",
