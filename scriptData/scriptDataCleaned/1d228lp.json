  "selftext": "\n\nHappy Memorial Day weekend, everyone! In addition to honoring our fallen heroes in war, figured I'll share a YOLO honoring our fallen ghey berr compatriots from last week.\n\nIn unison with Jensen, I too, am in _berr hunting_ mode these days, so I'll reiterate:\n\n1. You don't announce a 10:1 split unless you see nothing but clear skies ahead. This likely also means that they're gunning for inclusion in the DOW.¬†That in itself is bullish ‚Äî here‚Äôs why ‚Äî [Sauce](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidias-split-soaring-stock-could-boost-retail-investor-appeal-dow-chances-2024-05-23/). tldr: poors can get on the train easier\n\n2. There are no demand \"air gaps\", whichever regarded school of economics berrs learned that shit from. Hopper demand continued to grow despite Blackwell's announcement and quick production timelines. Jensen couldn't be bothered holding back from openly telling everyone either, that this demand isn't going anywhere through 2025 already.¬†[Sauce](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-demand-didnt-pause-moved-133800401.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKsv5T1uHmNrP5dW2kZhEBA420IrzBRQ4U_WAFMIuLGajeUXFjzerozv4viMxP77Izc92Ifd3MDizNyZjW62Pinxpiyc_SZwmb3iVU6smvAqj_qX6FepcN0feba1sDjT2IBNviDJgQEZRgsFWjKGy3quWvSsAgqwl0erEYBZ6Iea)\n\n3. New horizons:¬†[Windows AI PC market](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/dell-hints-at-nvidia-made-chips-for-windows-ai-pcs-as-soon-as-next-year),¬†[SpectrumX Ethernet networking](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/nvidia-is-now-a-significant-ethernet-player-rosenblatt-432SI-3456530)¬†- markets in which NVDA has had no expectations/revenue, but are now addressable because of advancements coming from their massive R&D investments over the years. Networking revenue, in particular, grew 3x YoY and opens up the on-prem AI servers at a much larger scale now. \n\n4. Sovereign AI with¬†[Japan](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/japan-sovereign-ai/): Jensen called each country's data their \"natural resource\" like copper, gold etc on the call. Hyperscalers work for the corporate world, but they're not exactly secular from a nation's national security standpoint in a world where data is intelligence. Japan will certainly not be the last country to announce this.\n\n5. There's another chip after Blackwell (now on a 1-year rhythm) : Here are some numbers for a perspective -- NVDA 1000x'd (yep, a thousand times) their compute in 8 years, and Blackwell is 4x faster than Hopper for training or 25x lower TCO (total cost of ownership). So it's safe to assume imo the next chip will provide a meaningful jump, especially to keep ahead of the pace with which multimodality models (next leap including text, image, audio and video for training) are anticipated to grow.\n\n6. As for the China angle with Taiwan: I dare Pooh to try. General Huang has the entire US military complex at his disposal when it comes to protecting the West's semiconductor interests. This isn't gonna be Ukraine/Russia part 2\n\n***Positions: 2x NVDA Feb '25 $1040C for $38k***\n\n",

I think when it's a short contract (under a week), the volatility can make it drop like a rock quickly, and it's easy to get spooked and sell. When it's far out, you know there is time, and there is less theta decay. The last thing I'm doing right now is buying stuff in the money rather than out of the money. This helps minimize theta decay, I think, along with the longer-dated calls. Buying NVDL calls last week has been a good 'call' so far (sorry for the pun, lol)",
