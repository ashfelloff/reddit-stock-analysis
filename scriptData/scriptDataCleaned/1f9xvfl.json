  "score": 330,
  "selftext": "China’s embrace of a stealthy strategy to manage its  currency is exposing the nation’s banks to billions of dollars of potential losses — and handing easy profits to investors on the other side of the trade. \n\nAt the center of it all are transactions known as foreign-exchange swaps. These have quietly become a key tool for state-run Chinese banks seeking to prop up the yuan during periods of outsized selling pressure, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a sensitive subject.\n\nBy some estimates, Chinese banks have used swaps to build short positions in the dollar exceeding $100 billion since last year. That has pushed one measure of the swap market to extreme levels, creating virtually risk-free returns of about 6% as recently as July for traders who took the other side. While those returns have since moderated — and there’s a chance Chinese banks may ultimately profit if the yuan strengthens — people familiar with the trades estimate banks racked up anywhere from $5 billion to $16 billion in mark-to-market losses when the currency slumped earlier this year. \n\nIt’s the latest side effect of China’s shifting approach to currency management, following a botched devaluation in 2015 that led authorities to burn through $650 billion of foreign-exchange reserves trying to stop the yuan from falling to levels they feared could prompt capital outflow or harm domestic companies who’d borrowed abroad. With banks now bearing the brunt of efforts to support the yuan, China has been able to stabilize the currency without a drop in reserves that might encourage a pile-on by bearish speculators keen to test how much firepower the People’s Bank of China is prepared to deploy. \n\n[more continued in story]",

While the swaps threaten to erode value for shareholders of Chinese banks and make official meddling in the exchange rate more difficult to track, they’re also generating solid returns for investors who have pounced on the resulting market anomalies.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tgaf4qio52nd1.png?width=827&format=png&auto=webp&s=c94cf2a841bced4dd51e30564c1071b260a0ce7e\n\n>The swaps trade has become popular among overseas banks and hedge funds that can amplify gains by adding leverage, according to interviews with dozens of currency traders, strategists and fund managers. Multinational corporations — and even some offshore units of Chinese banks and brokerages — have also participated.\n\n\\[…\\]\n\n>How the Trade Works \n\n>► The overseas party gives the Chinese bank dollars and gets the equivalent in yuan at the current market rate. In a year’s time, the bank must repay the money, at a rate set at the time of the deal. \n\n>Overseas traders make money by: Pocketing the difference between the rate the deal was based on, and what they actually have to pay back. For example, in the case of a $100 million deal at an exchange rate of 7.25 yuan per dollar, the traders would get 725 million yuan initially. But as US interest rates are higher than those in China, the rate they’ll have to pay the money back at — known as the the forward exchange rate — is lower.\n\n>That differential, measured in swap points, has been hovering under -2,500 for most of the past year, much wider than would be expected by economic fundamentals. That means the trader would only need to repay 700 million yuan in a year’s time, resulting in a profit of 25 million yuan. \n\n>► Over the course of the year, the trader can also use the yuan to buy shorter-term, low-risk Chinese bonds and earn interest. Increased buying of so-called negotiable certificates of deposit — notes that mature in a year or less and typically yield about 2% — has pushed overseas investors’ share of NCDs to the highest level since at least 2015, according to a report from Bloomberg Intelligence. Taken together, the two money-making angles have given traders virtually risk-free returns of about 6%.   ",

It hasn't been there for a while. If you had started this trade say 1 year ago you'd be down since Yuan has fallen from 7.33 to 7.09\n\n2. That trade assumes said person/bank already has $100M decided to trade that into yuan risk (already regarded since everyone including the [Chinese themselves are moving factories/workers/jobs/funds/families/themselves OUT of China](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Why-so-many-middle-class-Chinese-migrants-take-risky-illegal-route-to-U.S)). It doesn't consider the risk of yuan/dollar exchange, China risks, China bond risks, FX fees, and/or other factors related to the trade. \n\n3. And that's to net a fucking ~2% return on a 1 year lock after 2,500 swap points? You're already getting 5.5% risk free in USD as a US investor. That's absolutely fucking regarded. That's like me saying instead of going to my local Wendy's to give BJs for $10 I'll fly my ass out to China for a year to get 75.0RMB per BJ (with possible 2.5 tip) which I MIGHT be able to swap back to $10 US (instead of say give BJs here and have that cash earn 5.5%). I get to privilege of paying for the flight, possibly getting arrested for the CCP, possibly having the exchange rate fall, and possibly just having the Chinese mofo not pay me after my BJ.",

That why most Chinese built cities in Africa are compact commie blocks. Green energy, roads, rail and brigdes are the game changer. Electric battey stations make oil peaker plants obsoelete and check this, tesla gigafactory as doubles as a battery station. Chinese have the same tech as CATL is a Chinese company.
