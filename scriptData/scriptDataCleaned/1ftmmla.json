It's a low effort approach that basically just aims to \"own the market\" rather than trying to pick winners.\n\nYou should research the role of international stocks in a diversified portfolio, and also consider the role bonds might play for you, too.\n\nA boglehead portfolio could look like this:\n\n100% S&P500.\n\n80% SP500 20% international (or even 60/40 for some folks).\n\nA super well rounded general purpose approach would be something like:\n\n60% SP500, 20% International stocks, 20% bonds.\n\nRelevant ETFS to investigate would be: VOO (SP500) VXUS (international stocks excluding the US), and BND (a general well rounded bond fund).\n\nThis is a generally safe and reasonable way to invest.   IT's well rounded/diversified.   Such a portfolio will never be the best, but it will absolutely be far from the worst.   (The thing is, no one knows what will be best until after the results are in, but a diversified portfolio will never be the worst).\n\nEdit to add: you should absolutely do enough research to understand why a person could sensibly recommend the above.   Be able to answer the questions: why index funds (SP500) instead of individual stocks?   Why or why not include international stocks?    Why would a person want bonds, especially when bonds generally underperform indexes like SP500?    You absolutely should be able to confidently speak to these questions before you start seriously investing!\n\n(Good news, these things are not that hard to learn about and understand).",

Of course the big benefit of having more time in the market is compound interest, especially at the later stages when you have large investments. \n\nBut it's never too late to invest in your future IMO. Keep plugging away at VOO with your $200 weekly deposit, and don't get discouraged if the market dips. That is natural and while it's easy to say 'I'm losing money!' its never a loss until you sell the position. And when it dips, you are technically getting a discount on your purchase, so your $200 will go further. \n\nGo look at the 10 year chart for VOO: \n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/voo#price\n\nYou can see the dips throughout the years, but it always recovers. And if you just stay the course and keep adding, your time in the market and consistency will win in the long term. Good luck!",

I'd be concerned if there wasn't innovation. Just look at the past 150 years. Industrial automation, automobiles, the computer revolution, telecommunications, etc, all of that is far more impressive in terms of economic impact than AI has been.\n\n2. The market is putting very optimistic assumptions on growth, based on the P/E it is trading at. Historically, the schiller P/E ratio was at a median of 16. Currently, it is at 37, suggesting it is more than 2x its historical value. Basically, the S&P500 is pricing in the entire next decade of growth. \n\n3. The national debt is the highest it has been since World War 2, and deficit spending is propping up the stock market. The longer this deficit goes on, the more tax money goes to maintaining the debt, which will eventually necessitate both austerity measures and tax hikes. Higher taxes and less economic activity will slow economic growth.\n\n4. A big aspect of economic growth has been population growth. But the rate of population growth has been rapidly declining. The aging population will put further strain on the population, as less people are working, requiring more taxes to support.\n\n5. A huge aspect of the past 45 years of returns has been the steady decline of interest rates. But we're now at low interest rates, so there is little room for this to continue.\n\n6. Historically, the US has been an outlier in terms of performance. A big reason is that is suffered minimal damage to infrastructure from WW2, experienced rapid population growth, and had relatively free markets. But the US is quickly moving away from the things that made it so successful. Restrictions on trade, tax hikes, more regulations, less enforcement of property crimes, more barriers to immigration, etc.\n\n7. Dividends made up 32% of historical returns. However, dividend yields are at record lows, at just 1.25%, compared to historical average of 3%\n\n8. Equity risk premium is estimated to be 1-2% currently. Based on the 3.6% 10 year treasury rate, that indicates a forward 10 year return of 4.6-5.6%.",

Existing technology has been instrumental in development of new inventions for centuries. You think engineers are still designing things on pen and paper? Or do you think they don't use computer simulations or use computers to solve design constraints? Technology is always an essential component of new innovations.\n\nI work in tech, and I always hear stories from older coworkers about how they had to use punch cards to code, and if they got it wrong, it was a pain to correct... nowadays, even before AI, we have IDE's that make us significantly more productive.\n\n>It doesn’t invent a way to grow food in a lab for a million times cheaper, which is a metaphor of what AI promises to deliver.\n\nThe potential of AI is massively overhyped by people that don't actually have a computer science or mathematics background to be able to understand its abilities and limitations. It definitely has many potentially useful applications. But it cannot magically invent new things without reliable data to reach those conclusions from.\n\n>Debt is irrelevant. It’s spurring growth which is outpacing debt. There’s no reason why our debt obligations will negatively affect that and defaulting isn’t a concern.\n\n1. US GDP growth over the past decade has been well below historical averages. If we need to borrow a lot of money just to achieve 2% GDP growth, that is alarming.\n\n2. Borrowing money is sustainable if the debt grows slower than GDP, but debt is significantly outpacing the GDP, which is not sustainable.\n\n>Dividends being low doesn’t matter because dividends are just not reinvesting in companies, driving more growth and innovation.

      "body": "Large-cap US stocks can be a great investment, but they're not a complete retirement portfolio.  Other assets should be included, such as smaller-cap US stocks, international stocks, & bonds.\r\r\n\nwww.bogleheads.org/wiki/Getting_started has some great free resources to learn about investing. After a few hours reading the articles, and, especially, watching the Bogleheads Philosophy videos, most beginners can learn how to get better results than most professionals. Bogleheads is named after John Bogle, founder of Vanguard.  Some of the info on the website is USA-specific, but the Philosophy applies everywhere.  If you can't find the UK info, a question in the Bogleheads forum should help.\r\n\r\nI retired at 57 years old. Investing doesn't have to be complicated or costly to be successful; simple & inexpensive is most effective.\r\n\r\nI invest 100% in total-market, index-based, low-cost mutual funds. Specifically, I use mostly Vanguard's Total Stock Market, Total Bond Market, Total International Stock Market, & Total International Bond Market funds. I've been investing this way for 35+ years. It's effective, simple, & inexpensive.\r\n\r\nMy asset allocation (ratios of the funds mentioned) is based on my need, ability, & willingness to take risks. Market conditions are not a factor. Vanguard's investor questionnaire (personal.vanguard.com/us/FundsInvQuestionnaire) helps me determine my asset allocation.\r\n\r\nBuying individual stocks or sector funds creates unnecessary & uncompensated risk; I avoid doing so. Index funds are boring, but better for making money. If I wanted to talk about my interesting investments at parties or wanted a new hobby, I might invest 5-10% of my portfolio in individual stocks. As it is, I own pretty much every publicly-traded company in the world; that's interesting enough for me.\r\n\r\nAll of the individual stocks & sector funds are being followed by thousands or millions of other investors. Current prices reflect their collective knowledge of future expectations for each one. I'm a member of the Triple Nine Society, but I'm not smarter than all of them. If I found a stock or sector that looked like a bargain, the most likely explanation would be that the others know something I don't.\r\n\r\nI prefer mutual funds, but ETFs could also work well. The differences are usually trivial for a long-term investor, especially if they're the Vanguard funds I mentioned above. Actually, the Vanguard funds I mentioned above have both traditional mutual fund shares & ETF shares; they both represent a piece of the same fund.\r\n\r\nThe funds I use comprise Vanguards target date funds and LifeStrategy funds; these are excellent choices for many investors. Using the component funds allows some flexibility that can have tax benefits, but also creates the need for me to rebalance them periodically. Expense ratios are slightly higher than for the components but are well worth it for many investors.\r\n\r\nOther companies have funds similar to the ones I own that would work well. I prefer Vanguard because they've been the leader in this type of investing for decades & because Vanguard's customers are also Vanguard's owners.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! I'd be happy to help w/ further questions. Best wishes!",

Try putting in 5%, or 15%, and you'll see what kind of range you're working with.\n\nAlso, as others pointed out, 35 years is a long time so the biggest challenge is going to be keeping up with the savings for the entire time, and not blowing your nest egg on stupid purchases.  The primary skill you need if you're to follow this path is not really knowledge - it's discipline.  Even if your knowledge never progresses beyond \"buying S&P good\" then you will likely do very well if you are able to stick to your plan.\n\nNote that this calculation you made includes contributing *all the time*, especially including when the market outlook appears terrible and everybody around you has no hope.  It's easy to have the discipline to put in money at the end of a huge bull run where everybody has been making money.  The trick is finding the will to keep contributing after the market falls 20% over two years in a bear market, and there's no sign of the drop slowing down.",

      "body": "Generally you want to subtract out inflation (currently around 3%, while the fed generally aims for 2%).   You also want to consider that the growth of the S&P500 over the last 10-15 years was extremely exceptional (one study has the odds of such performance at about 1 in 200).\n\nGenerally, when a stock, or an entire market does so exceptionally well, more mediocre performance is likely going forward.   One issue with the US stock market (and the S&P500) is that part of the growth of its value is really just people paying more money for the same value of stock.   People have bid up the value of the stock market without a commensurate growth of the actual economy.   That kind of performance is less likely to continue indefinitely, and it's more likely you'll actually get much less fantastic performance going forward.\n\nThis is one reason most of the major investment firms (Fidelity, Vanguard, and many others) predict international stocks to outpace the US market (SP500) for the next decade (over the last 10-15 years, international has sucked in comparison to SP500).\n\nAnother point: the SP500, the US market, and other markets, can and do experience 10 year+ flat spells.   For instance, if you invested in the SP500 around 2000, it might be around 2012 before you broke even!\n\nIt's best to be conservative with your expectations.   It works out that around 5-6% is historically a much more realistic real return (ie, accounting for inflation).   I personally tend to run with about 4-5% in my own calculations.\n\nYou also want to make sure you recognize that in real life, it's scary when the stock market crashes and all the news is painting a (convincing) picture of doom and gloom.   This causes people to panic sell.   People also try to chase fads (after the amazing performance has already happened).   Everyone feels like a genius investor when the market is rising.    My point in this paragraph is that your good performance depends on a buy and hold strategy for the long term, not timing the market, not panic selling, etc.\n\nBottom line, be conservative in your expectations and only invest in markets or stocks when you know you an wait at least 10 years till you need the money.\n\nAs great as investing in indexes like the S&P500 can be, the fastest way to make lots of money is to invest in your skills and move upward into higher paying work (edit: and reducing your expenses relative to your income).  Investing in stocks is a long game, and as great as it is to make an easy 4-5% per year (on average!!!! - some years being -20%+ and some years - like this one, being +20%), it's not going to make you rich quickly.",
