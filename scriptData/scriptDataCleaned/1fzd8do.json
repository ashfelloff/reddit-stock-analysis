That why alot of people do long term options it can be 6 dollars away or 10 and if be profit if it within the time frame. The closer it get like a month or 2 before it 145 ur premium cost of profit will go down. So if you hit 140 now u be up like 30k. But if it hit 140 by June expiring u be down 3k.",
