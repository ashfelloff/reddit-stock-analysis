  "selftext": "If you have worked for any farm, you know they struggle to turn a profit ( all farms nearly without exception are backdooring illegal weed to the East in order to survive and they are barely surviving even doing that, legal weed farms are basically just black market fronts) anyways, with all this talk of rescheduling, whole lotta hype. Sure there will be a big short term pop, it will not be sustainable or long term. Any regular weed user will be growing their own when it is eventually legalized when people realize easy and relatively free. This will never be even close to a fraction of the alcohol market. Unless they create OPEC for weed production and make it impossible to grow, there is no industry.\n\nThe point of growing your own is irrelevant. The costs are too high, the prices are too low. Inevitable oversturation. Has happened in every market so far. There are no millionaires in the weed like people imagine. It’s bums struggling to survive. \n\n",

That said, in states like Oklahoma or Oregon where plant canopy way exceeds consumer base, price erosion for THC has made an artificially difficult market. Schedule 3 will come with the ability to conduct interstate commerce so there will be some price balancing. This will help some companies (mostly larger ones) but really fuck up small business in smaller states where a price differential was creating artificial price hikes.\n\nSome companies are currently floating on top of a wide net of mediocre activities across multiple states with lots of partnership deals. Other companies are lean and efficient but look bad in the current market because they don’t have the wide net and massive investment capital. \n\nCompanies like Cresco have really good oil processors but a smaller network. I like investing in them because they are cheap now and ripe to be bought out. Home cultivation is another factor that I think will bifurcate the “industry” and split it into mass production versus regional craft product. There will always be people who prefer buying stuff packaged in fancy containers with cool names, but as home cultivators get better access to their community (farmers market sales, local shelf at dispensaries, etc) there will be a balancing effect on prices.\n\nI spent 10 years pushing the envelope of extraction processes and efficiency, seeking quality levels that exceed that of competitors…and I can say with complete confidence that the industry has already hit the maximum ceiling in terms of purity, potency, entourage complexity, flavor, etc. There isn’t much a big company can do to stand out from a talented home cultivator besides repeatability, pricing at scale, distribution network, marketing, and all the things one does to reach customers when your product isn’t actually any higher quality. \n\nWe can now make 99.99% pure THCa crystals at home. If we get the seeds or breed our own strains we can grow premium flowers in enough quantity to be economically viable for a small group of amateurs. Weed is an agricultural product which will follow an agricultural pricing model as the government stops creating artificial scarcity.",

But concentrate processing is the endgame for most outdoor grow large operations 5000+ plants. Because as you said quality doesn’t matter at all, specifically, bugs honestly. Extremely hard to grow weed outdoors and not have issues with bugs, and spraying can really only be done prior to flowering.\n\nI think the industry has actually gone backwards on flower: almost all flower sold today is hybrids that have excellent yield and short flower times. Gone are strains like Kali Mist and other near landrace sativas or indicas because the flowering times and yields are less than ideal. Imagine a flowering time of 180 days vs 55 days. That’s a huge difference to a grower. Which is a bummer because some of those strains were excellent smokes/highs and are impossible to find.\n\nI’ve also noticed a drop in quality in top shelf over the last 5 years as commercial grows have started to dominate the landscape. Improper curing, improper flushing, etc. again, as the time from clone/seed to harvest has become optimized, so too has the end product suffered. \n\nLike everything there will be a balance. I personally grow top shelf flower in a medium sized operation (1000 plants). We’ve been doing fine, but I’ve been in the industry for 12 years now, and have various patents regarding PH control systems and eduction mixing/doping. Actually building a new system right now for a client of mine. The whole operation is turn key, I pretty much only hire help for trimming and packaging. We grow hydroponically in a greenhouse with supplemental lighting. 5 years ago we installed solar when they had those sweet deals, so the whole op is off the grid. We make money. Are we billionaires? No. Obviously it’s a volume game like any agricultural product, so the top will eventually be a grow of thousands of hectares in Mexico or someplace with cheap labor and land.",

A single marijuana plant can produce enough to last even a heavy smoker an entire year. There's a lot of key differences in the industries.\n\nIt's also just braindead that even the biggest reddit regard can grow a weed compared to the very fiddly specialized (and large-scale) requirements for tobacco.

      "body": "Weed business is similar to restaurants. Lots of cost controls, stress, low margins and opportunities for mistakes that lead to losses. You don’t have to be the first, you just have to be better. The legalization and federal issues also make a lot of things more difficult. Cash only business makes convenience worse. Permits are 10k non refundable in my state just to apply for a shop license. Owning water rights on land for farms makes growing difficult. I believe the business can evolve but is in early stages with lots of hurdles to jump through. \n\nGrowing sales is the key to higher profit margins in this business. Some things that can grow sales in the future; less frowned upon culture, leniency on commercial sales legality, delivery, public smoking legality, etc as the list goes on. The top line has tons of opportunities for expansion but who knows how long that will take. Imagine only being able to buy cigs or vapes at 3 licensed dispensaries in your area and that is pretty much where we are with weed. Imagine if you could sell weed products to every business like gas stations and restaurants for example. One day, we need the demand but complications with legality skis the expansion.",

As people become of age, they'll go to the store to get their smoke and not look for a connection. Also, prices will come down as more growers increase the supply.\n\nLet's not forget that companies will now be able to write off losses, rent, etc that they haven't been able to do. This will increase profits. - for example, if they ended up with a bunch of moldy weed, they just had to take the loss, now they'll be able to write that off. It's going to change their bookkeeping very quickly and dramatically.\n\nAs for tobacco taking over weed, unlikely. There are already large enough (world wide) players in the US to not let that happen. Also, a lot of states have laws saying that weed must be locally grown and cannot be shipped in from other states. This means it's less likely to have 1 or 2 companies running the whole thing.",

The weed shops have been at a major disadvantage to begin with, so the process of becoming profitable is even slower. It takes a long time for an industry to become efficient with their production and distribution, and weed is very young compared to the giants like Alcohol and Tobacco. Given time and freedom, the weed industry will become more efficient and find ways to lower prices of production.",
