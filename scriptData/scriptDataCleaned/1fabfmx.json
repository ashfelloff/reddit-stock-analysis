              "body": "I think the bigger issue is that we’re very much seeing the consequences of the “K” shaped recovery we experienced during the pandemic. Those who possessed and bought assets before the pandemic are doing exceptionally well for themselves now and are flush with cash to spend. Those who didn’t have assets on hand noticeably fell behind are feeling more crunched than ever before. Unfortunately each of these two demographics split the population damn near 50/50 which puts the Fed in a real pickle of a situation. If they raise rates further there is a significant chance they’ll push the struggling half beyond its breaking point, but if they drop rates the other half which is still flush with cash reserves will go into a frenzy reigniting high inflation. So the only real option that the fed has is to play the long game by making a boiler room that ever so slowly wears down the market’s hopes and expectations that we’ll eventually return to a new period of “free money”. ",
