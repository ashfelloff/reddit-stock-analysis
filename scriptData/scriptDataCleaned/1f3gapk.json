  "selftext": "The monthslong Trump Media stock slide continued Wednesday, as shares of the company majority-owned by former President Donald Trump fell below $20 for the first time since the Truth Social maker went public in March of this year.\n\nAs of 12:45 p.m. ET, the stock price of DJT has dropped more than 75% from its intraday high on March 26, the day the company debuted on the Nasdaq stock exchange.\n\nTrump Media has also lost more than half its value since its recent surge on July 15, the first trading day after the Republican presidential nominee narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nA Trump Media spokesperson did not immediately respond to CNBC‚Äôs request for comment on the stock‚Äôs latest dive.\n\nTrump owns nearly 59% of Trump Media‚Äôs stock. Even after losing much of its value, Trump‚Äôs stake at Wednesday‚Äôs stock price is still worth more than $2.2 billion ‚Äî more than half of his on-paper net worth, according to Forbes.\n\nTrump, and other company executives and insiders, are bound by lock-up agreements that have so far barred them from cashing in on their shares.\n\nBut the lock-ups are set to expire as soon as Sept. 20, at which point Trump may choose to start selling his shares.\n\nTrump has given no indication that he plans to cash out once he is able to do so. But speculation has flared that he might, especially as Trump Media‚Äôs latest earnings reports show it losing millions of dollars and generating little revenue.\n\nIf he does sell ‚Äî or if he even appears likely to ‚Äî investors could lose confidence in Trump Media, a situation the company‚Äôs own regulatory filings have acknowledged.\n\nSimilar to other meme stocks, investing in Trump Media has come to be seen as a way for Trump‚Äôs supporters to back him and bet on his chances of beating Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election.\n\nBut the company has noted that its fledgling social media platform, Truth Social, depends at least partly on Trump‚Äôs enduring popularity and reputation. Trump, who holds the most popular Truth Social account, has recently started posting more on X, his former messaging app of choice, and TikTok.\n\nThe stock‚Äôs recent slide has also coincided with Trump‚Äôs shifting political and legal circumstances. Trump‚Äôs odds of winning the election appear to have narrowed after President Joe Biden withdrew his reelection bid and endorsed Harris as his successor.\n\nTrump Media also announced last month that it had entered into an agreement with investment firm Yorkville Advisors, which could enable the company to issue up to $2.5 billion in stock to Yorkville.\n\nThe deal would ‚Äúguarantee access to additional capital, if necessary, to pursue big strategic opportunities as we look to build out our portfolio by acquiring assets and technologies in the Patriot economy,‚Äù Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes said in a July 3 press release.\n\nThe company noted in a separate regulatory filing, ‚ÄúThe sale and issuance of Shares to Yorkville will cause dilution to our existing shareholders, and the sale of Shares acquired by Yorkville, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our Common Stock to fall.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/28/djt-trump-media-stock-falls-below-20-per-share-for-first-time.html",

There was a brief flurry of market maker support to it about 40-50 days ago but they could not overwhelm the overall negative sentiment.   \n\nFor me the real final straw was the last release of financial information.  That data made it extremely apparent this is a straw company and its valuation premise a complete fabrication.  The last couple of quarterlies told the same story but I think the latest financial news, combined with the negatives about Trump otherwise, finally nailed the point home to even his most faithful acolytes.
