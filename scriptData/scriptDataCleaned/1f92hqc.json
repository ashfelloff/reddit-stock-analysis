              "body": "Intel is  different. It will be harder for them to split fab and design as AMD did (Global Foundries is the old AMD fab business).\n\nIt's true that all the top chip designers besides intel only design. AMD, NVIDIA, Apple design chips and TSMC makes them. Samsung is another high end  fab, and China has started doing high end fabs as well.\n\nThe  CEO has been to split fab and design business but there is no mention yet of spinning out one of them, so both are tied to the fate of the new fabs. And without Intel design being 100% on TSMC it would be hard to spin out, and by being 100% on TSMC they would also loose the vertical integration advantage. \\*\\*So, unlike AMD success in the past, Intel chip design fate is still tied to the fabs, while AMD was able to spin them out\\*\\*  \n\nOne thing to note about fabs is that they do not have the high margins of designers like AMD, NVIDIA, QUALCOMM, instead they have \"stickiness\"/ vendor lock-in, NVIDIA and AMD cannot move out of TSMC easily, because all of their designs are for TSMC machines.  \n\nIn terms of risk, fabs needs ridiculous amount of investment needed to keep up (i'm talking about high end only, dunno about other makers), just check on how many billions TSMC spends on new machines, and how much intel is spending on new factories. It's a big risk and new nodes might not work as expected.\n\nHigh margins and less need of CapEx makes design usually more profitable (until TSMC blows up, then designers rush to be able to design for something else).\n\nSo, why couldn't intel do an AMD and split fab and design and go back to the top?\n\n1. AMD cpu division did not had its CPU rival also making chips in the same fab. Intel would have to beat AMD at what AMD is already great.\n\n2. Intel has trash  middle management and trash board, and is now paying for good engineers as well as other companies. Also, the legendary Jim Keller did join Intel and did not last long there, seems like as usual Intel management was not very welcoming.\n\n3. ARM is getting more mindshare, and intel team needs experience in both TSMC fabs, and understanding a new instruction set should intel produce products for it or another instruction set. Or simply innovate enough to keep x86 relevante in the age of single board computers.\n\n4. Competitors might be able to pay TSMC more, and therefore getting access to new nodes earlier. Also something that keeps AMD \"behind\" NVIDA on GPUs and Apple on CPUs.\n\nso, for chip design, intel will have plenty of challenges, but it does have positives:\n\n1. existing contracts, as long as intel doesn't piss people even more.\n\n2. Compiler tech and specific extentions on x86. Intel did invest a lot on software unlike the cash stranded AMD, and like for GPUs AMD fights the CUDA battle, for CPUs there are lot of extenstions on intel CPUs  in use  popular libraries for scientific computing (and other high performance computing) , that make intel chips still performe better than AMD's, but AMD beats them in every other workload.  \n  \nIMO, Intel design might survive with change of management/board etc, (not  good odds though) and a high margin business doesn't need much to survive\n\nWhat about the fab business?\n\nIt's a fucking gamble.\n\nIntel is full of debt to make these new fabs.  Remember me mentioning how much freaking expensive it is to build and upgrade these?\n\n1. If Intel design ends up using more of TSMC instead of their fabs, then lots of money lost.\n\n2. If no other designers use them, more money lost.  \nThere is much less experience in building EUV, high risk of failure and therefore loosing fab contracts.\n\n3. CHIPS act is by  parcels and milestones, shall intel fail to deliver it will have to pay all the fabs without big daddy government money.\n\n4. People quote intel Book value, but they are evaluating new fabs as pure assets, while they are a fucking huge liability, a wrong there can mean the fab will be worthless.\n\n5. Intel is all in investing into the new fabs, if these are failures, Intel goes bankrupt, it will have no way to pay the debt incurred into building the fabs.\n\nINTC = new CEO (due to crisis) decided to take BIG GAMBLE building lots of new fabs with new tech, and by buying INTC you are alongside him in his huge bet.",
