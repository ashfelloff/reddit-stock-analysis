I still own all the stock because I consider it likely undervalued by 25-100%+.  I will probably start to take some gains on the next jump up.  To be more precise I acquired a mineral exploration license for about $4,500 and sold to a publicly traded company in exchange for shares that are currently worth about $1.6M before taxes, not including the royalty I retained. Not exactly wall street, but wall street enough for this thread?",

              "body": "The license was/is for the exploration of minerals/metals (mostly via borehole core drilling). Basically you are allowed to look at rocks and analyze the area systematically. The real value is that the holder is the only one who can eventually apply for a mining license and since it is a huge deposit, with very favorable economics, the exploration license is a necessity. I worked on the project about 17 years ago and when the original license eventually expired in 2022 I snatched it up after it had literally been forgotten about.  The land is all privately owned land but the land owners don't own the minerals below their property.",

They can't purposefully block your path but if their old tractor has conveniently been in the way for the last decade, well, you better find another way in. If you knock over a small tree or two or make a mess while drilling, you pay them, at minimum an industry agreed upon compensation, but the drill rigs are pretty tidy overall. If it ever became a mine they do get a royalty but its surprisingly small, maybe a few grand a year, plus if they have to move they get paid the value of their house.  All of the landowners will appeal your work plan and tie it up in court for 4-8 months or so, but their appeal will get denied since there is really nothing wrong with drilling a 6 inch hole in the ground with clean water as the drill fluid.",
