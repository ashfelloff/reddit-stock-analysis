  "selftext": "On Oct. 18, the S&P 500 has closed at a new high 46 times this year, and the Goldman Sachs Group's trading team says the run is expected to continue into the final months of 2024. Scott Rubner, the bank's managing director of global markets and a tactical expert, expects this benchmark index of U.S. stocks could end the year well above 6,000. His calculations of data going back to 1928 found that the median historical return for the S&P 500 between Oct. 15 and Dec. 31 was 5.17%. In an election year the median return is even slightly above 7%, implying a year-end level of up to 6,270.",
