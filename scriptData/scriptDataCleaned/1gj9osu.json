Just cause your CPU hits 80 doesn't mean you have to ramp the fans up. \n\nMy 7900XTX has its fans max out at around 56%. This way, under load, my hotspot only surpasses 90° on hot summer days. Using the default fan curve, my GPUs fans will hit up to 80-100% speed, but the hotspot temp will be above 100° even on cold days.\n\nHigher fan speeds don't necessarily cool better or help with temps, it's more about what speed at what temp, and also pre-emptively ramping up speeds. By having my GPUs fans ramp up to mid 50% at mid 60°s already, I avoid higher temps while keeping noise down.
