The fed has literally made zero suggesting of such a thing in their recent statements, nor suggested there will be any cuts this month yet these people have suggested it is a certainty to influence market perception. If the fed wanted to avoid a bad recession with stagflation they will not be cutting rates yet. If they wanted to influence the election, they might cut rates to help push propaganda narratives about a strong economy.",

Also how price functions - things will not drop massively until large hedges start selling to a large degree. Considering they work alongside the US gov many of them, and are political donors, this will not happen yet. This is what we have been seeing alongside economic propaganda downplaying the state of the US economy. Things are already very bad - any business owner will tell you this. Most profit increases are purely inflationary at this point for many companies, and numbers can be fiddled.",

I'll just look at the call chain and figure out how many months out I need to go to get something worth my time and sell a 125. If I'm looking to get off something just to sell it rather than use a limit order I will sell a weekly atm call. I get a little premium and if they take the shares, that's fine, if it expires I'll just sell another one. Using options in this fashion is a great way to collect extra money. So, whatever you want to sell those shares for, look how far out you have to go to get some reasonable money for it and write them. There's nothing wrong with selling three, six, 12 months out if you bake in and expected return because if you get it, cool let them have it, if you don't you keep the premium",

If you have a $100 company, just look at the values of 100, 101, 102 etc. see what kind of money is in each call and what makes the most sense. \n\nLike you said you wanted to get that position size down a little bit, just short however many contracts are necessary to get down to the size you want to be at, with any luck you'll get to do it at least once or twice before your shares get called\n\nPremiums should be pretty good tomorrow since we have the Fed on Wednesday",
