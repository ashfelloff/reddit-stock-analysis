  "selftext": "Fed numbers are in. The consumer is not letting up. Royal Carribean showing people are loading up on self prizing, despite high interest rates on items that don't bog down too much on loan interest rates, like trips and low ticket items. \n\nThese guys have a good feel for spending. Their latest consumer spending report:\n\n* Total card spending per household rose 0.3% year-over-year (YoY) in March, following the leap-year boosted 2.9% YoY increase in February, according to Bank of America aggregated credit debit card data. The early Easter holiday likely brought some spending from April into March. Controlling for these seasonal impacts, spending fell 0.7% month-over-month (MoM).\n* While spending was soft on the month, the solid labor market continues to sustain consumer momentum. March saw strong jobs growth, and this appears to be reflected in strengthening after-tax wages and salaries growth in our data – with growth at the highest level since early 2023.\n* Tax refunds may also provide additional support to households, with average refunds up by 5% this year through the end of March. While most consumers appear to be planning to save or pay down debt, there is a small rise in people saying they will go shopping.\n* We are seeing signs that easing rent inflation is providing a tailwind to renters' spending. Renters' spending growth appears to be improving most in retail categories.\n\n[https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/consumer-checkpoint-april-2024.html](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/consumer-checkpoint-april-2024.html)\n\nLow Ticket items, relative to high, like cars and computers are guess who's specialty? Bezo's little Jungle. Yup. But guess what else is doing super cool and bueno these days? CLOUD computing, cuz all that AI compute has to live SOMEWHERE!! and it sure as hell won't be your personal computer lil bitch. It will be on the vast farms of computer these juggernauts control. \n\nAWS has massive patterns of purchase, and consumable data, like movies and products and services. They are now in the Pharma business, Medical Insurance, Home Insurance. Talk about spreading your eggs in several baskets. Movies? socks? Tampons? whaddya need? oh and you don't need to drive anywhere for it either. \n\n\"The report followed news last week that [job](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-job-growth-beats-expectations-march-wages-increase-steadily-2024-04-05/) growth accelerated in March, with the unemployment rate slipping to 3.8% from 3.9% in February. The stubbornly higher cost of living looms large over the Nov. 5 presidential election. Still, there were some silver linings, with food prices at the supermarket unchanged and the cost of motor vehicles declining, leading to the return of goods deflation.\"\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-march-2024-04-10/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/us-consumer-prices-rise-more-than-expected-march-2024-04-10/)\n\nCar prices are going down because there is less spending on large ticket items. The consumer trend is strong in certain areas where Amazon benefits. And growth of AI to supplant workers in many areas is only growing. So Amazon is growing.

              "body": "This is such a dumb take. You should always want the maximum amount of capital available to you at vest. Trying to dodge a little extra in taxes is beyond pointless.\n\nFor example, you have 100 shares vesting.\n\nyou either pay $3500 in taxes on $14,000 (say 100 shares at $140) or $4500 in taxes on $18,000.\n\nThe suggestion is that you should want a lower share price on vest so you can pay less in taxes at the end of the year. And then pay an additional long term capital gains tax by selling the shares after they’ve (hopefully) climbed to the higher price after a year has passed.\n\nSo in that case it’d look more like $4100 in taxes if you chose the lower share price at vest, versus $4500 if you chose the scenario with the higher share price at vest. \n\nHowever, there’s a some problems with this suggestion. For one, it assumes the share price runs 28% again to the higher share price by the time you’re selling the shares the following year to save you paying $400 in taxes. Even if the share price outperforms the annualized SPY return and grows 15% you’re still missing out on compensation.\n\nTwo, in the lower share price at vest option that money is now virtually illiquid because you’re forced into holding for a full year to avoid a second short term capital gains tax.\n\nThree, you have less overall compensation to grow. 14k invested over 10 years at 10% return results in 10k less than if you started with 18k. \n\nFour, it assumes you only want to hold shares for the vesting company who issued the shares. Maybe you think the vesting shares will underperform the market, or there’s another company whose shares you want to own. You should want maximum capital for your initial investment to maximize returns.",
