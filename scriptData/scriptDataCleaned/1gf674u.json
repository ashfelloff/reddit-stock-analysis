That includes deleveraging and risk-reduction and hoarding liquidity.  Worst case, you might have one or two smaller banks with usually large CRE exposure (like NYCB, now FLG) go into a period of distress.  Big banks are perfectly fine, as are most regionals.\n\nAnd all that is assuming the Fed doesn't step in to backstop them in the event of an emergency, which they've already shown they're willing to do anyways.",

Too few people are willing to pay substantially more for those goods and services.\n\nWealth is a nice bonus, but the main thing you need to keep a nice downtown or mall around is a good customer base through density. And judging by the average, wealthy cal towns *hate* density, because it lets the poors also afford to live there. So they don't get nice malls or downtowns.\n\nSo yes, it's a market abnormality, and it's because your average low density cali town is as dead as that shitter midwest mall.

Their paper losses are 1:1 correlated to interest rates and are only a liquidity problem in the short term, the underlying cash flow is still good it just can’t go as far when cap rates are higher due to COL. \n\nIf you can’t see the difference between those 2 situations, you should not waste time talking about the topic.

The liquidity issues of FRB and SVB were unique to them. So, banks don’t need to sell the underwater securities and since they are agency secured (essentially no credit risk), they can just wait for them to pay off.\n\nAlso, the article states that “Many of those HTM portfolio loans are approaching maturity…” as if it were bad. This would actually be GOOD for the banks, since debt paid off at lower rates can be invested into higher rated debt.\n\nIt’s just a poorly written article made to sound sensational in order to get clicks.",
