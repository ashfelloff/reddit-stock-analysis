  "selftext": "Editing down a long emotional post of blah blah blahs, I spent 5 or so years thinking I was mastering technical analysis and the art of trading only to realize in the most painful way that I was just gambling (that alone is hard to admit).  Well, I would use TA to enter trades and despite having risk management in mind, every trade became a zero-sum game. \nI was exclusively trading SPY 0DTE.  Over the years of trying to master this, in my head, I never lost. By that I mean, I looked at losing as the cost of another lesson to learn that will lead to mastery.  That outlook changed harshly when I thought I had figured everything out (consistent decent wins will small losses) and took out roughly $50,000 in personal loans.  Well, it started off as just $25,000. I lost this within 3 days (but convinced myself I knew what I did wrong) so I immediately took out another $25k loan (the curse of having good credit).  This time, I managed to turn that $25k into $90k over the course of about 5 weeks. \nI could have paid off both loans at this point but told myself not to bother until I hit $100k.  A demon took over me and kept buying calls on a huge down day until I had lost $60k.  Over the next 2 weeks I panic traded the remaining $30k until I lost just about all of it.\nFittingly, as I waited the few seconds for my eTrade mobile account balance to refresh, it showed $666.\n\nThis is the culmination of years of small losses, reading thousands of pages on TA, using literally every indicator in TradingView until I developed a simple custom setup (I had over 100 templates saved of \"Aha! This is it!\" setups). \nIf I was single I would probably just go at it again.  But I'm married with a child and can't be gambling foolishly like this. \n\nThe problem is I have this itch to trade, to speculate.  How can I tell the difference between just not over my 'gambling' problem and simply not being happy with the 3 or 4% APY my savings account earns? \nObviously, if I ventured back into trading, I would only use a small portion of my cash and I would probably (probably) not buy options. Most likely UPRO shares or something.  But how do I not let the demons win again? \n",

Mind divides. It says \"this\" is good and \"that\" is bad. This division not only creates a division in the world; this division creates a division in the divider also. If you divide, you are also divided in that division, and you cannot transcend your inner division unless you forget outer divisions. Whatsoever you do to the world, you have done to yourself also.\n\nIf you say that someone is angry and anger is bad (good-bad division), what will you do when you will feel angry?\n\nYou will say that this anger in me is bad. Then you have started to divide yourself into two persons – a bad person and a good person. Of course, you are bound to be identified with the saint within, so the evil within you is to be condemned. You are divided in two. Now there will be a constant fight, a conflict. Now you cannot be an individual; you will be a crowd, a house divided against itself. Now there will be no peace, no silence. You will feel only tensions and anguish. This is what you are feeling, but you don’t know why.\n\nA divided person cannot be at peace. How can he be? Where to put your devil? You have to destroy it, and it is you; you cannot destroy it. You are not two. The reality is one, but because of your divisive attitude you have divided the outer reality. Now the inner is also divided accordingly – so everyone is fighting with himself. It is as if you are fighting against one hand – fighting the right hand with the left hand – and the energy is one. In my right hand and left hand, I am I am flowing in both. But I can oppose one against the other, my right hand against my left hand, and I can create a conflict, a bogus fight. Sometimes I can deceive myself that the right hand has won, and now the left is down. But this is a deception, because I know that it is me in both and any moment, I can put the left up and the right down. I am in both; both the hands are mine.\n\nSo howsoever much you think you have put your saint above and crushed the devil down, know that at any moment you can change the positions, and the saint will be down, and the devil will be up. That creates fear, insecurity, because you know that nothing is certain. You know you are so loving this moment and you have crushed your hatred down, but you are afraid because at any moment the hatred can come up and the love will be just crushed down. And it can happen at any moment because you are within both.\n\nAn undivided man will say a person is saint or evil with the same attitude as saying day is light and night is dark...\n\n-Osho",

(Not a financial advisor, yada yada)\n\n1) Never gamble with money that isn't yours. Loans aren't yours. Your mortgage isn't yours. Your kids college fund isn't yours. Margin accounts are not your money. \n\n2) The stock market is definitely gambling. Never gamble with money that isn't yours.\n\n3) Never gamble with more money than you can afford to lose. I don't know your budget, but for me, that's about $200 in any given trade. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n4) If you zero out your account, stop trading until you have enough discretionary funds to start again. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n5) Always have a plan, always stick to the plan, don't get emotional. I lose money because my plan is this: 1) at any% loss, hodl until profit; 2) at 50% profit, take profits unless i 'feel' like I'm gonna get more profits; 3) at 100%+ profit, sell, but text my friends who are not financial advisors asking if I should sell or not, and wait for the reply. If it never comes, never sell. \n     5a) Always have a better plan than me. Always stick to the the plan. Don't chase. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n6) Take profits and put them somewhere \"safe\" like an index fund or a high yield savings account or a cut out section of the mattress your kids were conceived on. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n7) If you have a gambling problem, get help. Go to meetings, therapy, finance classes, whatever you need to do. Be honest with yourself. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n8) If you win, don't look back to see what you could have won if you'd stayed at the table. It'll make you feel like you left money on the table, and that isn't true. You won. Take your profits and your pride. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n9) Don't be a victim of FOMO. I am not an experienced trader. Only been at it casually for 4 years or so. But in that time I have seen (and missed) at least one \"once in a lifetime\" trade every year. I know it won't always be that frequent but there will always be another \"once in a lifetime\" trade. If you miss one, wait for the next one, don't jump in late just to be part of the party. Never gamble with money that isn't yours. \n\n10) Never. Gamble. With. Money. That. Isn't. Yours. \n\nMy biggest loss to date is $6000 all at once. That was a lot for me. I stopped trading for about 18 months after that, and when I started again it was just \"safe\" stocks and funds. \n\nYou have to know when it's time to walk away and you absolutely have to be honest with yourself about it.\n\nIf you're the type of person who has to leave their wallet at home and bring only cash and ID to a brick and mortar casino, stay the fuck out of the stock market. \n\nNever gamble with money that isn't yours.",

So I quit while I still could.\n\nLike you, I also was not satisfied just letting my money sit in a bank account, however I also didn't want to just put my money in an ETF and let it sit because on any timeframe longer than a year I think we're closer to the top than the bottom ( I'll reconsider after a hefty drop ).

If a trade goes tits up, oh well, it'll rise again in a few days or weeks. Stonk always goes up if you zoom out. And if the trade goes the way you want, then you sell for a decent but ultimately small gain.\n\n\nAnd that's how it gets you. You love winning big like all the other gain porn posters here. Like, kudos for making 65k on a 0DTE that one time, but no one should make that kind of money except in one-offs like NVDA. You have to be okay with making a few grand here, a few grand there. It's so insanely addictive if you think you can win big all the time. But you can't. You're full-porting into options that **have** to go your way or you lose **everything**, and you have zero margin of error for being wrong because the expiration is so close. I wouldn't do that even for a sure thing like NVDA. \n\n\n\nIf you can't trust yourself not to engage in gambling, then hell, I wouldn't even trade UPRO. Just put it in QQQ and forget about it. But if you can learn how to be disciplined and take the small but sure wins, then dust off your trading manual and get your money back. Clearly *something* about it worked, you just didn't manage your risk.\n\n\nAnyone here trading SPY 0DTEs is an idiot. Full stop, do not pass go, do not collect $200, idiots.",
