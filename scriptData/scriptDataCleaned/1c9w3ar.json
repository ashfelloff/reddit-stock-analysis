Oil will remain of paramount importance for at least another decade but likely three decades going forward. Most oil use is industrial and we're not turning over the entire fleet in the next five years. No intelligent government should allow their oil production to be entirely in the hands of foreign nationals, and domestic production will never hit $12 a barrel it's simply cost prohibitive. If anything the value of a barrel of oil will increase in the future, think about what you can even buy for $4 a gallon right now... Glucose, glycerin, alcohol, nothing that has the same level of refinement as oil can be had at $4 a gallon. You can get milk but that's a loss leader.\n\nMass production keeps the price down and oil companies have a pretty short tolerance for not being profitable, thinking these companies with track records going back a century for shutting down when the cost of a barrel dipped $10 nevermind $70 shows a pretty naive understanding of the economy works.\n\nI remember when Cathy Woods said the words \"invest in disruptive technologies\" and won the hearts of Reddit, how times change 😂",
