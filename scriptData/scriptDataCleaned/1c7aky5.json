I found a blurb in one of his partners biographies:\n\n\"Keith Campbell was on his way to Hawaii in the 1960s when he took a job in California instead because he could both ski and surf there. When his roommate moved out of their California apartment to get married, Campbell placed a newspaper ad for a new one. His choice: Chet Conrad, a commodity broker. (Conrad) got me into trading as a customer, Campbell recalls. But he was always moaning he didn‚Äôt have enough money to trade. In 1971 Campbell put together $60,000 from 12 investors to form his first futures fund with three advisors‚Äìa fundamentalist, a bar chartist and a point-and-figure advocate. And he learned his first lesson: Do not make decisions by committee when trading futures! Another fund, the Campbell Fund, started in August 1971; Campbell himself took over trading it on Jan. 1, 1972. It is the oldest commodity fund still trading today. By the time Campbell, Isaacson and Conrad split up a few years later, Conrad had turned a borrowed $10,000 into $3 million with some gutsy trading in sugar and moved to Lake Tahoe, Nev.\"\n\nSpoilers: He lost it all. (Bought a casino, started a 100 acre pot farm that he had to bulldoze when a DEA helicopter buzzed the property, bought a claim and spend several years mining silver in Nevada... so many memories.)",

Consumers can‚Äôt control what their insurance companies charge them, they can‚Äôt control what electricity and gas will cost them and these will keep inflation high. \n\nThe market is having a natural pullback to oversold territory after being in overbought territory for an extremely long time. If earnings - which mean guidance these days as last quarters don‚Äôt seem to matter anymore come in better than expected it should propel the market upwards. If companies miss on an above average level with low guidance I would anticipate a continuation of the sell of until extreme oversold conditions (5-10%). At that time Investor Sentiment will reach a low, Valuations will become cheaper and people will sell. \n\nThe Fed will then start to lower rates, market programs will buy and the next leg up will start. \n\nEven war seems somewhat priced in.
