The robotaxi was something of a desperate throw to recoup market share losses caused by a mix of Cybertruck's struggles and Musk's own decisions alienating half his customer base.  I'd hold off on buying a bounceback until Tesla releases a new model sedan or some other project that shows that sanity is starting to win out over fantasy over there again.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I definitely see Tesla bouncing back, but it's dependent on their CEO taking a back seat to the actual design people again and contenting himself with setting the direction of the company rather than trying to force his company to produce retro future boondoggles straight out of 80s and 90s scifi that no one is actually asking for.\n\nIf they start being an automaker again, and release updated versions of their successful car models,  then they'll bounce back quickly, they've got an advantage in brand recognition that other EV manufacturers (Rivian mostly) would kill for.  but the longer it takes to make that happen the more things will slide in the meantime.",
