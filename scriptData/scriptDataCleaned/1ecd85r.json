Electron rocket doing fine, Neutron in development. \nAlso satellite business and space solar panels. Sadly i never found their proper ratios where their satellite rev comes from depending in category, but their solar panels production will be ramped up like 50% after the us money pump of roughly 20m $. \n\nNow we add the start of huge satellite constellations being made like SpaceX, ASTS, Eutelsat, RKLB seems to have a potential huge runway for their current 2,5bn $ marketcap for everything in that chain: satellite parts, services, launches.",
