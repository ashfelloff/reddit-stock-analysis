I've worked in downtown Cleveland and Ashville and just your standard Holiday Inn or Hampton can be $300/night, this is where Air BnB is still viable, but I had a work trip in Nashville and was able to get a Marriott for like $120/night in downtown - in that caes I'm always going hotel over Air BnB.\n\nI'd agree that Amazon has raised their prices to the point it isn't really much of a deal anymore cost-wise, now you use them for the convenience of delivery. I don't want to drive 15 minutes each way just to go get a bag of dog food at Pet Smart",

If I'm traveling with a dog, I don't have an airbnb host messaging me three days beforehand being like, \"Actually, we thought about it and decided we don't want you to bring your dog. Did we mention it's half your booking fee if you cancel now?\"\n\nAt least that guy responded to threats pretty well, but any Moxy / Aloft hotels allow all dog breeds. So I could always be sure I could just show up and put down a refundable pet deposit. No fuss, no muss",

Not always but entirely depends on your situation. Is it sometimes the only place to stay you can find in a lot of areas, especially rural areas? Absolutely. Can you spend a long weekend in an entire house, relaxing near a beach with your whole family at a hotel? Fuck no, and certainly not for near as cheap.\n\nAirbnb has specific cases that it is very good for. People trying to one-for-one vs hotels in a city are being silly. I stayed at a house with friends and a view on the Columbia River, watching various huge ships roll by. There was a pool table in the basement. I stayed in a house in the middle of mountains by a river in the Canadian Rockies, we made Thanksgiving dinner. We stayed a block from the beach off an estuary, watching bald eagles catch fish.

My own personal political view is that this market behavior isnt a cause but more an effect of artificially constrained supply due to lots of reasons but mostly we stopped building enough to keep up with demand. If we make it cheaper and easier to permit and build (maybe look closer at taxes to further incentivize owner occupied dwellings) then things will start to improve. \n\nBut politics aside I feel like it’s so popular on Reddit to twist that into “AirBNB is evil” - it’s crazy to me AirBNB didn’t invent vacation rentals. They just made it less work to find and book places than the newspaper, travel agency, or clunkier non-mobile app based websites that existed for decades before…. \n\nAnyway.\n\nMy family is large and we vacation together usually. Our favorite things to do are to cook together, enjoy nature, play cards and board games, have a fire, relax. Staying in a hotel would absolutely not even be close to the same experience we get from renting a house together.\n\nPlus when you talk about the difference between having a full kitchen and being able to bring groceries and cook for a week for a group vs eating out often because you are staying at a hotel…. I’m not sure the hotel is even cheaper.\n\nIve had great luck with vacation rentals (some BNB some through other sites or direct from owner). You have to research, exchange some messages with the host before hand (it’s not really that hard to tell who knows & loves  their property), but overall my experiences have all been good, and most great. I’ve never been asked to do more than do the dishes, take out the trash, and put dirty laundry somewhere.\n\nTLDR; fix permitting, build more housing, BUT also reddit stop please pretending a hotel room is the same as a secluded lake house",

Any decent considerate person would do that. Some of you are lazy slobs you probably just piss in the toilet and don't even flush and consider that a 'chore.' A host is in the business to make money. Too many rules = fewer bookings = less $. Only bad hosts have a ton of rules and they usually get few bookings and/or lower their price to try to get more bookings. You guys probably saw it on TikTok and believe every host makes you clean their home when it isn't true. There are thousands of hosts in any given city. A few host who have no clue how to use Airbnb doesn't mean others are bad.\n2. Airbnb is great if you find a location that you like. Hotels are generally in one area whereas Airbnb's can be in every block of a city. More selection is always a great thing, IMO.\n3. Airbnb's are better if you have a family. Not even a debate.\n4. Being able to have a stove, microwave, fridge, etc., to bring your own food is a Godsend if you're on a budget and not trying to eat out every single time. This is where Airbnb shines. You can pick what you want in your stay and the price will reflect that. Hotels are pretty much standardized and subsidized. That pool still needs to be cleaned whether or not you use it. Rooms still have to be cleaned daily regardless of whether it is booked. That cost falls on you. Airbnb also makes a ton more sense if you're staying in an area with activities because good hosts often provide these items such as bicycles, beach towels, beach chairs, etc., Hotels won't provide you anything unless you're in a resort and pay a fee.\n\nIf I'm just by myself or with a partner, hotels are probably a better option most of the time. But if you're traveling in a group or a bigger party, Airbnb just makes much more sense. Canceled bookings can happen but it's generally with bad or new hosts. The trick is if you're booking in an area with lots of Airbnb bookings, you should be fine if the host cancels because Airbnb does a good job of re-booking you a place nearby and will often waive the price difference if it isn't significant. Once had a host cancel on me a few hours before I landed and Airbnb found me a place a few blocks away. It was about $300 more expensive for the stay and Airbnb just gave me a credit for it.\n\nOverall, the only thing I'm upset with is the cleaning fee that they charge per night stay. Makes no sense to me. It's not like they clean the home 5x more if I am there 5 nights instead of 1. Other than that, Airbnb is a great option if you know how to book.",
