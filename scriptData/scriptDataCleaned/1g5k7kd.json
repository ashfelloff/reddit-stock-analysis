          "body": "Great question.\n\nGOKU: Should capex start growing should we have concerns about this. Good question.\n\nWe use a discipline and forward system to determine capacity to build. We always review this. Higher capex is related to growth opportunities in the coming years. Next year, looks to be a healthy years. Our Capex will be higher next year and tell you more in January conference. \\*\\*\\*\\* Good for ASML!!! and obviously NVDA.\n\nUBS SUNNY: gross margin into 2025 (BTW gross margins are great)\n\nToo early about 2025 in detail. few things I can share. dilution from N3 to reduce next year. We continue to sell our value. Next year utilization is a positive. 2-3% dilution when we begin to ramp them. Converting N5 capacity to N3. And ramping N2 in 2026. There will be ramp costs.\n\nElectricity costs have risen. 14% higher in October - Uranium!!! Electricity price has doubled. Highest in the Asia region.\n\n**Next Guy:** Are you worried about something (inquiry?) Antitrust concerns\n\nCompetitors complaining something something\n\nTSMC - NO lol\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nI guess you won't stop your margin increment until 75%? lol DAMNNNNN lol\n\nDo you care about Intel or do you want to inquire them and something about IDM (INTEL) outsourcing. Foundry 2.0? US IDM. Outsourcing from Samsung.\n\nThat's a lot of questions. The answer is no we aren't acquiring anything. Lol love this guy. Once of the IDM's in California has been a very good customer for TSMC - We receive sizable business from them. Will we continue to increase that is too specific but you will see in the next few quarters. BULLISH.\n\n**Next Guy Bruce**: Do you have revenue guidance beyond 2026 - WHAT THE HELL LOL (Horrible question) - What is the next 5 years. lol - My lordy.\n\nI don't have a long term CAGR number to update you. I can assure you it is good for now.\n\nAI demand can you grow faster than before\n\nI hope so! DuH.",

              "body": "What is capacity outlook for 2nm that TSM is looking at? And migration from 2nm to A16\n\nYes, the chiplets have become our HPC customers strategy. It's going to reduce capacity for 2nm? The answer is NO. We see more demand than we ever dreamed about it than we saw for N3??  We expect more demand for 2NM and preparing for more capacity. His name is Bruce too? lol\n\n**Next Guy Brit:** How does TSMC get comfortable beyond 2025 - How do you get long term plans for capacity what commitments are these customers giving you? How do you de-risk. Good question (slick) - How do you plan capacity for the long term.\n\nEvery AI innovator is working with us. The long term profile - We have a picture in our mind and we make some judgment. We work with them on a rolling basis. We have a window into capacity.\n\nDo you need nuclear power for future of TSMC fabs - I like this guys questions - What our power challenges? TSM getting nukes YIKES lol.\n\nYES we need more electricity. We work with the government for this. They will support TSMC. We are not ready to share with you yet. Yeah I bet. lol. We will use water, earth and the damn.\n\n**Next Guy Chris**: How is PC and Mobile?\n\nPC and smartphone is in low single digit but more AI chips - ARM!!! PC and smartphone business is gradually increase and it will increase over the next few years.\n\nAdvanced packaging - What is the revenue growth outlook over the next few years?\n\nAP in the next several years will be growing faster than the corporate averages. Margins are improving too and approaching corporate.\n\n**Next Person Citi laura**: Will you have a dividend in the future and other things?\n\nDividend is steadily increasing and as the free cash flow increases the div will steadily increase. Organic growth will bring shareholders the biggest return and the rest is dividend!\\*\\*\\* Harvesting dividends. Nice!!!\n\nFoundry 2.0 AP and things... Can you give us idea for growth outlook for different segmentation in that new definition. \n\nLarger wafer segment etc etc... \n\nThe AP has much stronger growth. Mature nodes. Not so rosey as AP node. Not sure what was said here. \n\n**Last Question Rici:** Update forecast for memory - said last time it was 10% growth\n\nOur forecasts stay the same as last time. We did do better. Overall the whole industry is the same as we said in the last quarter. Next year, it's too early to make a comment on 2025 but we will share with you. Sounds extremely bullish. \n\nCan you share your CoWos capacity plan - revised several times. - ASML -Reference to NVIDIA Tiff.\n\nRoughly, today our customer demand FAR exceeds our ability to supply. We are working very hard but it is not enough.",
