First with NVDA they have been beating earnings so the expectation creates a rally going into the earnings date. Also IV on most options tends to rise going into earnings and drops the day after (IV crush) unless there is a big move to the upside. The day or two before earnings is a good time to sell if you are profitable and in a short term swing trade. Earnings are always a roll of the dice, so holding over the earnings date you never know how the market will react.  If your calls have a delta of .8 to .9 IV crush won't effect it as much but you will see a drop in the option price most likely.",

I mulled over whether I should take that huge quick profit or let it ride up further and decided to cash out while I was waaay ahead. I've read too many stories of people wishing they'd cash out before a crash. But I've also read numerous stories of people regretting selling early as the stock rallied. But I think taking a 60% profit as the stock continues to rally is less painful than holding on too long with the stock crashing while holding. I can also jump back in to buy more should the stock continue to rally.",

But the more rational side of me is trying hard to knock some sense to my egotistical side and saying it's mostly luck and that most swing traders lose money. I think ASTS historical run up is going to lead to greed.   \n  \nI've done tons of research before buying shares of PLTR are up 26% and RYCEY are up 8%, which further boost my ego. But I honestly barely know what those companies do or why they're performing they way they're performing. My shares of NVDA are down 8% and sorta keep me more grounded and humble.   \n  \nThis emotional rollercoaster is exciting but also nerve-wracking. I know if I allow greed to run amok, I'm eventually going to get burned. I'm hoping I'm just greedy and lucky enough to make a couple more lucky trades before my portfolio crashes and burns. I will then invest in broad market ETFs and be a passive investor who only looks at his portfolio monthly at most.",
