Nvidia is going to hog a huge percentage of the AI market for the simple fact that they are the first major innovator to come sit at the table. I get that quarterly reports are short-sighted for long-term investors, but considering the continued demand for Nvidia chips, AMD won't be taking any of their business. The only way I see AMD taking off is if AI demand gets even steeper and Nvidia fails to step up production to meet it. Nvidia isn't losing any of their market share, otherwise.",

You're as good as your last product and in hardware, very often companies that have the best products make several mistakes thinking it's gonna last forever so keep milking customers rather than investing. Intel's done that and paid a high price, first in mobile, then on desktops and servers too.\n2. In tech, there's always space for new paradigms, innovations, etc. AMD has pushed a shit ton of them both on CPUs and GPUs why would you exclude they will in the future? Do you think they are stupid with such a giant market outside and say \"nah, let competitors make all the money\"? Of course not.\n3. Having the best product is not what big customers necessarily care about. There's many factors like price efficiency, energy efficiency, etc. Which is why you will find AMD GPUs in most supercomputers in the world. Radeon professional solutions tick a lot of these boxes like price and energy efficiency.\n4. While Nvidia has good hardware, the reason it enjoys this huge headstart isn't just hardware but software. AMD historically did poorly there, Nvidia invested for years in the ML ecosystem making sure CUDA, drivers and user libraries (from Pandas to whatever) worked together so naturally they have a huge advantage. Again, doesn't mean it's gonna hold forever.\n5. The biggest competition for Nvidia isn't just other hardware vendors like Intel or AMD that are more than capable of producing decent hardware that may hit multiple boxes on number #3 but especially it's big clients. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc, etc, those are not companies that have intentions of spending tens of billions forever in hardware just so Nvidia has 78% margins. Their margins are crazy, they are selling GPUs multiple times what they could with more competition. It's only natural that those huge clients, with deep resources which have lots of experience building both software and hardware will look into opportunities to cut their hardware expenses which are insane. It's a very bad idea to be cornered with only one vendor. All those companies are 100% looking into building their own hardware and they have the resource to build their own drivers and software for their use cases. Right now it's an arm race for these companies to release products, but the time will come quickly where they will look at cutting costs. Now costs aren't the issue, products are.\n6. At the end of the day, what AI is, is just matrix multiplication, done very fast. Huge arrays of float numbers that need to be multiplied very fast in large quantities at scale. All GPUs excel at that already. But it's not just horsepower you need but the entire package, and obviously the sector with such margins will attract more and more competition and investments.\n7. If you have red all I've said till now you may realize now, that Nvidia could potentially be another Cisco/Intel like in 1999. Yes, those were good companies that made lots of money, but weren't worth anywhere near what they were worth in 1999/2000. So \"doing\" an Nvidia might mean only being priced very irrealistically.",

Everyone still wants more though and AMD is a far behind second but still second and offers products for cheaper. \n\nWhen there's an AI arms race going on globally and people, corporations and even countries can't get it enough chips maybe they get what they can and buy some AMD. I don't think growth is going to exactly mimic nvidia's past growth because Nvidia was in the right time at the right place in history, but AMD has room to run, grow and break into the market share of AI for sure.

Notice how they're consistently strong in the mid range (i3/i5), anything lower is overpriced to make a quick buck off of brand recognition and anything higher is directly matched to AMD to uphold said brand recognition/reputation. It's a somewhat scummy business plan but it shows that they're probably not going anywhere.\n\nThe question is just are they gonna drop the sandbag already and give AMD a run for the money or keep being sleazy and boring?

I just sold my amd position yesterday, essentially admitting defeat. Maybe rdna4 will bring them on par with the AI capabilities of nvidia but even if it does, they have allot of infrastructure to build out. My idea is, wait for rdna4 and if it does have similar capabilities to nvidia cards for AI application, I’ll reinvest and I’ll do it HEAVY.

AMD generally runs cooler for cpu and is cheaper and has gained high traction in the laptop and budget build/creator media sector. They all tend to have their hands in multiple things.

I started accumulating NVDA in 2019, already having some AMD. I kept adding NVDA and today I sold my final 150 shares of AMD and rolled it into NVDA. Now I have almost 500 shares of NVDA. It doesn’t mean I will never own AMD, Lisa is amazing and the chips are great. CUDA and the software stack for AI is 5 years ahead, this is the issue, not their architecture. But being 5 years behind is huge IMO.\n\nMost of you are likely too young to know that MSFT tried to answer iPhone with the Zune (actually zune media player to compete with iPod), but that was their ambition to have a Zune phone, but Jobs was 5 years ahead and nobody knows what the fuck a Zune is in 2024.\n\nThere you have it. I love AMD and for my laptop/pc I ALWAYS go AMD over suck ass INTC but in this case there is a clear leader like the ipod/iPhone in mid 2000’s.\n\nThis is not financial advice lol ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)",
