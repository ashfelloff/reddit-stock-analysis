Earnings usually leads to volatility for most major companies because it gives investors an understanding of how the business performed over the last quarter and what their expectations are for the next. This is lined up with what investors are expecting and the discrepancies lead to volatility. For example, earnings could be above expectations, but I’d investors were expecting very aggressive guidance and instead hear lukewarm forecasts, that would likely lead to a drop. The market is future facing. There are of course macro pressures to consider as well like labor and interest rates. Investors (the big ones) could be more focused on those than individual earnings if sentiment is iffy. If you’re investing based off earnings then it’s more like gambling.",
