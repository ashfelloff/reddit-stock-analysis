  "selftext": "“At stake is one of the top two spots in the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\n, whose June rebalance is based on market cap values as of Friday’s close. Apple\nand Microsoft\n are the two biggest holdings in the fund, at roughly 22% each. Nvidia makes up less than 6% despite being only slightly behind the two leaders in market cap.\n\nThe rules used by S&P Dow Jones Indices suggest a similar gap could occur again at this quarterly rebalance, and the race to be among the top two appears to be coming down to the last day.” \n\nIdk how common this is, but seemed interesting",

The relationship between stock price and money flowing into the stock doesn’t have to be linear (this is ~price elasticity IIRC). An influx of $10 billion can create a significant demand, which can lead to a disproportionate increase in the stock price.\nEg. If, by hypothesis, for some weird reason all the people that hold NVDA decide that they are going to sell NVDA stocks only for 200$ or more… and then someone buys NVDA for that stock (because you always have regards) then that’s the last traded price and the market cap will reflect that jumping from 3T to 4T. But only 200$ flowed in the stock, not 1T$.\n\nAnd indeed in 2022 the market cap of NVDA was 0.3T$ and you know that people didn’t pump 2.7T$ into it.",
