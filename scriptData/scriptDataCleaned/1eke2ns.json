  "selftext": "* **Carry Trade Mechanism**: The article explains that a carry trade involves borrowing in a currency with a low interest rate (such as the Japanese yen) and investing in assets with higher returns (like U.S. stocks). This strategy is influenced by differences in interest rates between countries.\n* **Yen Depreciation**: The Japanese yen has been weakening against the U.S. dollar. A weaker yen makes Japanese investments less expensive for foreign investors, potentially driving up U.S. stock prices due to increased capital inflows from Japanese investors.\n* **Impact on U.S. Stocks**: As Japanese investors seek higher returns, they may be buying more U.S. equities. This increased demand can push up U.S. stock prices, particularly in the short term.\n\n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nhsv565xmrgd1.jpg?width=518&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dc276b67b1e1b5518f721ed3b183ef8035f118a3\n\n",

Now that Japan is raising rates and their currency is getting stronger at an incredible rate, these investors must liquidate their holdings to repay their loans.\n\nI don't have any figures as to who holds most these carry trade loans. But perhaps ironically,  at least in the short term, US bonds are popping since they still represent the safe haven in uncertain times.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the US ability to repay our own bond interest in coming years will be made that much harder if we have a recession and therefore lower tax revenue. With the Fed lowering rates and unemployment rising, USD strength should be falling fast.\n\nSo far tonight,  emerging market currency is up, Asian equity markets ex China are down, but Chinese equities up.",

A lot of aggressive short sellers were shorting the Yen in the past months because the BOJ refused to budge on their rates even while other central banks held rates high. Those short sellers are now getting squeezed, which is causing a lot of the buying. This is exacerbating the carry traders, which in turn are then annihilating equity markets.\n\nVIX futures up over 37. It's just like 2018. Except this ain't over yet. This carry trade unrolling may take weeks. And frankly, the Fed lowering rates is only going to hurt it worse.

Whenever the Bank of Japan (BOJ) intervened, the exchange rate quickly reverted to its original level, which I interpreted as the effect of hedging against FX risk. However, we are now observing 1-2% fluctuations in the JPY without a subsequent reversal, indicating that hedge funds might have finally exited the carry trade.\n\nHedge funds typically borrow in Yen and invest in US equities.\n\nThe estimated notional value of all investments from the yen-carry trade is around 20 trillion. If a significant portion of this amount was invested in US equities, the impact could be substantial.",
