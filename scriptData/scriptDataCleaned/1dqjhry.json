  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader who trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on ____?‚Äù will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. ‚ÄúIs ___ a good investment?‚Äù will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Fed‚Äôs Favored Price Gauge Slows, Supporting Case for Rate Cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-28/fed-s-favored-price-gauge-rises-at-slowest-pace-in-six-months)\n\nAlso keep in mind the presidential debate was yesterday.\n\n**[NKE](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=NKE)-** Earnings yesterday, cut full-year guidance and said it expects sales to drop 10% during current quarter. EPS $1.01 vs $.83 expected. Revenue of $12.6B vs 12.84 expected. Sales miss was attributed due to lifestyle business declining, and traffic in China declining. I‚Äôm watching to see if we bounce at the open. Most interesting stock I‚Äôm watching today.\n\n**[INFN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=INFN)-** Nokia to acquire INFN in $2.3B deal to scale up their network. Note this news came out at the close yesterday.\n\n**[CHWY](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=CHWY)/[WOOF](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=WOOF)-** Spiked yesterday during the trading day due to DFV posting a picture of a dog. I wish I was joking.\n\n**[AMZN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=AMZN)-** We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\n\n**[WBTN](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=WBTN)-** IPO'd yesterday, watching for any moves upward due to how it traded premarket today.\n\n**IPO today: ALMS** (immunosuppression therapies)\n",

(this is a genuine question, not being a troll).   \n  \nE.g.   \n1. for Nike, you say \"I‚Äôm watching to see if we bounce at the open\". If it does bounce at the open then what action would you take?  \n2. for Amazon you say \"We nearly hit that $200 level yesterday, will continue to watch this.\"  \n  \nI'm understanding:  \n- Is it that you expect the stock to rise that day, but then if you're watching it rise without buying it then you're missing the rise?   \n- that you're actually buying it and watching the price change in order to decide when to sell. Or some other appropriate action based on some other position you took\n\nthanks!",
