Similar to the FCC working with asts to develop the regularions, joby was and still is setting precedent with faa for evtol usage. They acquired some teams from Tesla's early days to develop the motor and battery systems which was a big step forward. From there it spiraled and the top players in integration, vtols, motors, etc got involved. Toyota handled a lot of the manufacturing processes too which is why you'll see joby meet demand a lot sooner than some of the other ones. Back then the motor stack was good enought that the IP would probably have covered the company failing in other ways. \n\nThe new archer looks really good though I'll be honest.",

Nice to get from the Central Park to JFK or from Santa Barbara to LAX for those who can afford, but not for much more.\n\nIt will take off only when FAA allows fully automated, human-guided (no pilot license) vertical take-off vehicles with cost of ride below $100 per flight, possibly split between up to four passengers.
