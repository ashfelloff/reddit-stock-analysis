The setting is serene and the person’s expression is one of genuine appreciation and esteem”**  \n\n\nooo copilot gave me this one:  \n\n\n **“Generate an image that showcases the bold and humorous spirit of WallStreetBets traders, possibly including elements like a rocket ship (representing the desire for stock prices to ‘go to the moon’), diamond hands (symbolizing holding onto stocks despite volatility), or a character that embodies the playful yet daring attitude of a ‘regard’ investor.”**",
