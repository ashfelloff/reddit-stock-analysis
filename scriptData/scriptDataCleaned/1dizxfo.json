  "selftext": "They are up over 60% in the last month, with a P/E of 606. Did I miss something? As far as I know, they get most of their money from royalties, which isn’t the most lucrative business. 2.6 billion revenue in 2023, and 632 million in net profit, with a market cap of 168 billion. It seems heavily overvalued, and the recent share price run up has intrigued me.",

When times are good and you're flush with cash, you'll go out and shell out tons of money for that collectible you've always wanted -- for this example, let's say it's an autographed pair of Air Jordans signed by the GOAT himself. You could probably convince most people who have grown up watching MJ play that these shoes are priceless.\n\nNow you've fallen on hard times and you're living on food stamps. Your priorities are entirely different. Would you hand over all the money in your possession for the same collectible? Probably not. The intrinsic value is a really old pair of sneakers that are too big for your feet; you wouldn't even be able to wear them to get around.",

TSMC and Samsung have both proven to be large players, but it's not like there aren't other players; it's just that TSMC and Samsung are the only ones making advanced processes, so once Intel enters in they'll be in a 1 of 3 market where producing stateside is a huge advantage.",

              "body": "I work as an applied scientist in AI/ML and I believe there will be many efficiencies gained by ML in the future. There already are and have been for more than a decade. Most of them occur in less dazzling applications like recommender systems, search engines, ad placement, etc. The current GenAI chatbot hype being pandered to the laymen is just that, hype. It is nowhere near ready for primetime as it isn't reliable enough for any business critical or safety critical application. It works fairly well as a writing aid as long as you're willing to fact check it. It works for low level customer support. Beyond that there is very little adoption and productivity being gained from it on a broad scale (enterprise business, etc). There are a lot of fancy demos out there and money being raised but very little in terms of applications being adopted at scale. I say this as someone working in the space.\n\nAI will continue to be transformative. We've just gotten way too far ahead of ourselves with GenAI specifically. Same thing happened during dotcom bubble. The internet transformed the world but the stock market was way too early. It took Microsoft 16 years to recover to dot com peak after it burst. Oracle, IBM also took a decade or more to recover. Some of the top tech companies in terms of market cap during dot com never recovered. This includes Cisco, Intel, etc.\n\nThe bubble is already starting to pop if you pay attention to what's going on in the startup space where I work. Many of the unicorn AI startups are starting to fold or looking for an early exit because they aren't gaining any traction with an actual product that's generating enough revenue or path to profitability to justify continued investment. This includes Inflection AI, Humane, Stability AI, etc. AI companies that have raised hundreds of millions the last year or two at billion dollar valuations facing massive down rounds, looking to sell IP, or get acquired for pennies on the dollar. There are a few winners at the top being propped up by massive investments from big tech (Anthropic, Mistral). Unless some actual profits start to get generated from viable business models soon I expect investment to taper off on massive GPU clusters and LLMs. Training and querying these models isn't economical. I think we see a shift to smaller expert models that can be trained more efficiently on less compute to do narrow tasks instead of asking a foundation model to do everything. My two cents.",

      "body": "Back in the early 2000s after doing some research I realized that the power efficiency of the ARM platform made it the perfect mobile platform. At the time Apple was using ARM for its new iPhones and had just bought an ARM design firm called PASemi. This was right before the iPad came out, and there were reports of the new ARM chips having 10 hours of video life vs 3 for the Intel based ones. Putting all these pieces together I concluded that ARM was going to dominate the new mobile market and any other portable devices, and that Apple was going all in on the platform.\n\nSo I called up my broker and said I want to buy ARM. He said it was a penny stock that they don't follow. It was 5 dollars at the time but he said anything under 10 was considered a penny stock. I told him to buy shares anyway and then proceeded to watch it go to 60 before I sold. I made over a million dollars on 100k investment. Not long after that it was bought by SoftBank.\n\nFast forward to ARM IPO'ing again. I again bought in at around 50. Why? Because the one huge tech market not dominated by ARM right now is the Windows market. And the Windows world is moving to ARM because Apple has shown that ARM based desktops are superior in most cases. ARM says it wants to take over the Windows market, and I think they can. And Intel agrees. Even they are going to start building ARM based designs for others and eventually their own. The desktop market is moving to ARM just like the mobile market did, leaving only the server market for Intel chips. For now.\n\nThis is why I invested again. And so far it is going pretty well ;)",
