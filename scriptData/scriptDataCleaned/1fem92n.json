                  "body": "Ah, the markets been pretty bad the past two months and there is a lot of volatility. By long/short I meant how many days till an option expires. Like a while back I bought some call options on apple that had like 3 months till expiry so even though apple dropped a bit after I bought it, it eventually went back up and i made some money just by being able to hold the call option longer. If I had bought a call option that expired in a few weeks rather than a few months then my theta value would’ve been higher which makes it harder to make my money back if I do lose it. I know it’s kinda annoying cuz it’ll sometimes seem like everything goes the opposite of what you wanted but what kinda research do you do before deciding to open a position? Or do you go off of stocks popular in wallstreetbets?",
