Companies manipulate their user metrics all the time, some are just better at it. And the child predator stuff I think will be a slow build unfortunately. There is a lot Wall Street can look past as long as the money is coming in. But PACs, to me, seemed a lot more pressing. The whole healthcare system is unfamiliar to me, as far as regulations and operationally speaking, but to me there seemed to be a lot of deficiencies that would prevent these facilities from being open let alone being able to push through false claims.",

I’m also not a Medicare expert so someone please correct me but wouldn’t you think their ability to submit a claim to Medicare gets revoked pretty quickly?
