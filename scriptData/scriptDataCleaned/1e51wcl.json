  "selftext": "NVDA's volume today and yesterday (along with the week of July 4th) have been getting as low as the 200-218million range(avg 407 mil),  When looking at [NVDA's Historical Data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/?period1=1563307041&period2=1721159802) this is the lowest it's been at since October of 2021(range 150-190mil). The only other exception is July 3, 2023 at 198mil. So what could this possibly mean?\n\nI'm just a Wendy's employee but there are definitely some obvious factors for why this is happening.\n\n* People are waiting to either sell or buy until NVDA's earnings report in August. Volume may even continue to decrease until earnings or some big news.\n* Everyone's been saying this but as we see with the Russell 2000 and rate cuts looming, people are rotating into the small caps. It's hard to say if this will be ongoing until tech earnings season or continue beyond that as rate cuts keep coming later into next year.\n\nNVDA is also currently on a downtrend so decreasing volume can be a bullish indicator that a reversal may occur at some point. ([Decreasing volume in a downtrend may indicate a coming reversal and a time to buy.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/why-trading-volume-important-investors.asp#:~:text=High%20or%20increasing%20volume%20in,to%20sell%20and%20take%20profits)) But as long as volume continues to decrease, NVDA may sink for a while longer.\n\nmy copium: 5 NVDA 9/20 140c, avg price $9.43, currently $7.33. I may DCA if NVDA continues on this downtrend it's been on this week.\n\nEdit 7/17/24 1:30pm Eastern: Well we definitely got a higher volume day. NVDA's volume today is increasing, already approaching 300million and obviously a very bearish day due to the news. We'll have to see what the rest of the week has in store. It's possible we test 115.00 and personally i think if it breaks that, there will be pain that might not even recover until we get closer to earnings.",
