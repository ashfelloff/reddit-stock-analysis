  "selftext": "Today is day 1 of Schwab usage for me. I hate this app. \n\nIt feels clunky and you have to swipe screens to see the information that you want, instead of being able to have it all in one place at a glance. \n\nWorst of all, there is a massive lag in pricing. TD would keep up in near-realtime. Schwab seems to be using 1998 computers to provide pricing updates. ",

      "body": "I have been long term schwab user for my day/swing/investment trades with their web based street smart edge platform. After they bought thinkorswim(TS) platform I switched to TS about 4-5 months ago. As you may know when you switch from streetsmart to TS, schwab wont allow you to go back to streetsmart.\n\n Here is my brief experience with TS:\n\nCompared to streetsmart, TS, I found, was so cluttered for the things I do. I use multiple (8+ moving averages on W, D, and various intraday charts and stochastics. It takes me a few more clicks to get done on TS than street smart. Also data speed is too slow on TS. I realized the data what I am looking at on TS is not truly real-time, it is a kind of delayed. I never had that feeling with street smart. Recently I added 2X more RAM on my game computer (now 32 RAM), that did not help much. \n\nI am not a software guy, I think it is the clutterness of TS that is the issue. It looks like someone wrote the software back in time, put it out there, but never improved on it speed or simplicity for use. For example on TS, a moving average appears as \"simple moving average xyz\" instead of SMAxyz or simply xyz. Every single character uses a portion of computer capability. They need to find a way to de-clutter the app.\n\n  \nI also use TC2000. To me, it is much better than TS or streetsmart. Hope that JPM, Fidelity or Bank of Ameriaca buys TC2000, I will rush to go there.",
