          "body": ">Say more, basically.\n\nAsk and you shall receive...\n\n[First, some context](https://www.wcrf.org/cancer-trends/bladder-cancer-statistics/). Bladder cancer is the 10th leading cause of cancer in the world. 6th most common for men, 17th most common for women. \\~573,000 new cases of bladder  \ncancer come about every year. \\~212000 a year die from it. So it's not prostate,  \nor breast, or lung, but insomuch as you value human life, 212000 people a year  \nis also not nothing.\n\nCurrent treatments: People are talking about chemo. Chemo is great as an intervention. It can slow tumor growth. With bladder cancer though, it is by no means a cure. [5 year survival rates go from around 31% to 36% for non-chemo to chemo groups respectively.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12090338/) However, consider some things. First, how often do you get your bladder checked by a doctor? Now consider that by the time the disease is found, you may already have several tumors localized to the bladder. [Depending on how aggressive is the disease,](https://www.cancer.gov/types/bladder/treatment). They actually just cut out the diseased portion of your bladder in an operation. This is called a tumor resection surgery. [After the resection of the bladder a medication that was approved for use by the FDA way back in 1976 commonly gets prescribed. That drug is Bacillus Calmette-Guérin or BCG](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684637/#B6). BCG is a vaccine that helps post surgery, in addition to chemo. It basically reduces the spread of cancerous tissue that might still exist post surgery by instigating an immune response in and around the diseased bladder. Despite the drug, the recurrence of bladder tumors is still very high, [\\~70% for most patients](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684637/#B6). Also, the cancerous cells tend to build up a resistance to this immune response. So what do they do then when the tumor starts to grow too large or it started to invade the muscle? [They basically just cut out all or most of your bladder in an operation known as a cystectomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807330/). Not fun. This operation comes with a hefty \\~9% mortality rate, [post operation complication rates around  30-70%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7807330/), a severely reduced quality of life, and high costs post operation. The goal is to avoid getting to this point. BCG after the resection can help a lot, but as stated, resistance gets built up, and some people are straight up unresponsive to the drug (no drug is perfect). Once your body becomes unresponsive to it, not much they can do. There are two other drugs on the market approved by the FDA to help with BCG unresponsiveness (pembrolizumab and valrubicin). In combination with BCG they did an okay job at helping to beat the cancer back into remission \\~16% for valrubicin and \\~40% for pembrolizumab.\n\nEnter ANKTIVA, and this is where it gets exciting if you have bladder cancer.[ In phase 3 clinical trials, ANKTIVA in combination with BCG boasted an approximately \\~71% total remission rate in the cancerous tissue of the bladder. Approximately 90% of patients avoided the cystectomy operation in certain groups.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684637/#B6) [The toxicology report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684637/#B6)\n\nWhat did the FDA approve recently? They approved the combination of ANKTIVA with BCG for the treatment of bladder cancer. Unfortunately, there is a BCG shortage.[ But wait! The Serum Institute of India, the largest manufacturer of vaccines by number of doses produced, has agreed to an exclusive arrangement for global supply of BCG](https://immunitybio.com/immunitybio-serum-institute-of-india-agree-on-an-exclusive-arrangement-for-global-supply-of-bacillus-calmette-guerin-bcg-across-all-cancer-types/). Basically, Immunity Bio is positioned to always have BCG when they need it which means that ANKTIVA can be prescribed freely.\n\n[In addition to all of this, Immunity Bio has an](https://immunitybio.com/pipeline/). This comes after discovery and development, new drug application, preclinical research including animal testing etc.",

In the world of urology there are very few treatments after tumor resection, and only 2 drugs given in concert with BCG. Now with ANKTIVA, there is a third. I am sorry, but if I have cancer I don't give a fuck about 'chemo being the way'. I am going to listen to my doctors. And you better fucking believe that urologists around the world know what BCG is and what bladder tumor resection is. They also know that BCG + (one of the other drugs listed) helps in preventing the need for a cystectomy. If there is a drug that shows a 2/3 improvement in cancer remission rates over the other existing drugs on the market, and that drug supplier has a lock on the largest supply of BCG then yeah, they are going to know about that too.\n\n212000 people a year die from bladder cancer. This isn't some fucking meme. I would venture to bet that most of those people would much rather be alive today. Or, of those alive who had their bladder removed, I bet they would want that back if they could.
