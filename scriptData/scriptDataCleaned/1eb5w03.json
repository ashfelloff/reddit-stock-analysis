There is definitely some luck involved here given the whole market downturn, but IMO, the chipotle stock is still overpriced based off unrealized stock split hype. Tomorrow I am betting we will see a huge move downwards. Fuck you Bill Ackman give me my good chicken portions back",

Earnings are absolutely nuts because for every no brainer I see there is at least another that makes zero sense. Google yesterday should have gone up but dang the market was bleeding already. Tesla was a no brainer. Given a different widespread market adjustment could Tesla have reached $280 today? Certainly.\n\nMy thesis on Chipotle was it would do the opposite post split, which is normally bullish. Then the hit piece on the portion sizes which is total BS and borderline media espionage IMO. So I expected this all to come out on the wash on earnings and was bullish until this morning. Once the market bled red I stayed away but still think this has its return to $60 in the not so distant future. I don’t know a single negative hit piece on it from earnings yet lol. But…it is also valued above its peers and this correction could be exactly that",
