          "body": "so this is kinda misleading because you don't just average CPI and PPI. PPI is cost inflation for producers. Producers can choose to offset those cost by raising prices for consumers, hence increasing CPI or PCE. PPI could drop, but producers could still choose to keep price the same or even raise prices to increase profit margins, hence increasing CPI even though PPI is dropping. But average CPI and PPI together doesn't make sense.\n\nPPI is mostly used to calculate PCE, but not all components in PPI is relevant for PCE. The most relevant ones in PPI are medical care services and financial services. Medical care service is a notable one because it has a sizable weight on PCE, but on CPI, it has a different calculating method than PCE. Economists will rely on medical care service cost on PPI to guess what it will be on PCE. Financial service on PPI is important because it isn't a component on CPI.\n\nBecause of different weights for components and some differences in calculation method, there's a huge spread between CPI and PCE, about 1% right now. The Fed 2.0% target is based on PCE YoY.\n\nPreliminary estimate for PCE MoM is around 0.1% and core PCE MoM around 0.3%. Core PCE is relevant, and 0.3% is higher than what the Fed would like (they prefer is more around 0.2-0.25%), so on net it probably delay the rate cut by 1 month. The Fed wanted to do it in June, so there's a tight window for July now to do it. They certainly don't want to do it in Sept because it's too close to the election and to start rate cut in Sept would put the Fed in the crosshair of politics.\n\nSo there's still a window for a July cut, but if the inflation data next month isn't favorable, there's a big risk rate cut won't happen until December after the election is over. Then there'd be only 1 cut for 2024.",

Commodities are going up which is bad for future reads to cpi and ppi.\n\n\nNo cuts and pausing for longer is going to hurt the bull thesis that were getting 4 or 3 cuts this year.
