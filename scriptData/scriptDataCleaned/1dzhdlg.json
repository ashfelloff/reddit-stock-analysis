      "body": "If anyoneâ€™s curious to why the fee is so high, itâ€™s likely bc arbitrage. Liberty media is doing a split-off into SIRI. Short SIRI, long LXSMA/K. The letter salad is supposedly trading at a discount, 1 share converts to 8.4 Siri shares. So long 1 share LXSMA/K, short 8.4 SIRI. Or realistically some whole numbers like long 100 LXSMA/K, short 840 SIRI. Iâ€™m not an arb guy though so someone can correct me there. \n\nThe final ratio wonâ€™t be known until I believe a week prior to the split-off though. Thatâ€™s said, maybe the price runs up bc these short figures. If LXSM was liquid you could even buy options there as it should close the arb gap as the date closes in (they look pretty wide right now tho, A better than K). Unfortunately, donâ€™t know the exact date bc they still have to vote and there isnâ€™t even a definitive proxy yet. Target is Q3 2024.\n\nEdit: fixed tickers bc typing in bed with thumbs.\n\nEdit 2: u/Fit_Lengthiness_5231 pointed me to a post over [here](https://x.com/andrewcoye/status/1806312233451900932). He has a much better understanding of this bc itâ€™s pretty complex.",

              "body": "Maybe lol? Arbitrage isnâ€™t my thing. Thereâ€™s also risk that siri is pushed down further causing lxsm to drop more. But at the same time, which I think you realize is that the arbitrage gap should close, bringing lxsm up.  If you zoom out youâ€™ll notice theyâ€™re both down quite a bit since the deal was announced late 2023. That was likely caused by shorting siri.\n\nIf I understand correctly, something I didnâ€™t add is that liberty media owns a pretty high percentage of siri, like 80% (would double check these numbers). They canâ€™t sell or buy any more bc the deal. ~~So the tradeable float of siri is smaller than the total amount of shares shorted. If someone did a rundown on this and presented it, I could see both running up if it caught wind. That said, I imagine if liberty owned shares are available to short that could suppress the price. Also, arbitrageurs and hedge funds have a lot money, so they could probably weather quite the storm.~~\n\nEdit: fixed a word\n\nEdit 2: double checked some numbers and def not the case. LSXM owns 3.2b shares of the total float so that leaves around 600m shares siri which lines up with a lot of the numbers from various sites.",

              "body": "that's a solid thought, maybe that's what's happening now forcing SIRI to move up almost every day? \n\nAt the time of this post, the fee was about $.025/share. Multiply that by 8.4 (subject to change), and thats about .21 an arb is paying per  long share of LSXM. Even if there's a $5 arb gap (arbitrary number for example, i think it was around $6 at the time of this post), it's lost after holding that position in just 24 days. Note: IBKR fee seems to fluctuate quite a bit throughout the day. as high as 300% at open but 177% by close. Anyway, the smaller the arb gap and higher borrow fee for SIRI, kinda forces them out even faster. And like you said, they'll have to hold for months. \n\nSeems like a pretty solid long idea. I did pick up a couple hundred calls for Aug. a week or two ago but after your comment, I might risk a few k more.",
