I shorted a variety of companies. Most of the value of my shorts is currently in DJT and Carvana going into next week, but I also shorted Nio, VinFast and Aurora Cannabis. I believe all of these stocks are in a clear downtrend, and most of them also have other critical issues (for example, the stock float of DJT)",
