      "body": "Barrons:\n\nDell \nDELL\n-5.18%\n Technologies posted better-than-expected results for its April quarter, boosted by both strong demand for AI-powered servers and improvement in the commercial personal-computers business.\n\nNonetheless, Dell shares were down 13% lower at $147.99 in late trading.\n\nFor the quarter, Dell reported revenue of $22.2 billion, up 6%. That is ahead of both the range of $21 billion to $22 billion the company had forecast, and the consensus for $21.7 billion among analysts tracked by FactSet.\n\nAdjusted profits were $1.27 a share, in line with the Street consensus, but ahead of the company’s forecast of $1.15 a share. On a GAAP basis, Dell earned $1.32 a share, up 67% from a year ago.\n\nDell’s Infrastructure Solutions Group—servers, storage, and other enterprise hardware products—had revenue of $9.2 billion, up 22% from a year ago, and ahead of the Street consensus at $9 billion. That includes 42% growth in servers and networking revenue.\n\nShipments of AI-optimized servers were up more than 100% sequentially to $1.7 billion, Dell said. Its backlog of orders for AI servers jumped 30% to $3.8 billion from $2.9 billion at the end of the January quarter.\n\n“No company is better positioned than Dell to bring AI to the enterprise,” Vice Chairman and COO Jeff Clarke said in a statement.\n\nRevenue from Dell’s Client Solutions Group, mostly PCs, was $12 billion, flat with a year ago, but ahead of the Street consensus for $11.7 billion. While consumer PC revenue was down 15%, commercial PC revenue ticked up 3%, as some customers began replacing aging hardware.\n\nFor the July quarter, the company projects revenue of between $23.5 billion and $24.5 billion. At the midpoint, that would be $24 billion, up 5%, and ahead of consensus at $23.3 billion. The company sees profits for the quarter on an adjusted basis of $1.65 a share, give or take 10 cents, which is below consensus at $1.88 a share.\n\nFor the January 2025 fiscal year, Dell now sees revenue of between $93.5 billion and $97.5 million, with a midpoint of $95.5 billion, up 8% above the old guidance midpoint of $93 billion. Management said it now expects growth of more than 20% in the infrastructure-solutions group, ahead of its previous forecast for mid-teens growth. Dell continues to see growth in the low single digits for client solutions. The company sees profits for the year of $7.65 a share, give or take 25 cents.\n\nDell repurchased $722 million of stock in the quarter.\n\nAhead of the results, Dell shares were up 124% so far this year.\n\nWrite to Eric J.
