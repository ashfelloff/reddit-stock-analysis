The $2 was severely underpriced to the potential, but there was immense risk if they never got picked by telecoms. Now that they’re picked, they have MASSIVE revenue potential in the future. Intuitive machines rocketed because they have money to fund operations. They have some money over time. Not as much of a huge source of revenue that ASTS has (satellite data for telecoms for 1B+ customers globally).",

ATT literally ran a Masters commercial month before with AST SATs in it and market did nothing.\n\nSo did people think they would never agree on revenue split terms??\n\nThat’s literally all that happened with ATT and they didn’t even tell us the split. But AST was low 2s and flirting with bankruptcy so the split is favorable for ATT imo.\n\nThen ATT gave them 10m for a successful BB1 launch which was in last round of dilution earlier this year and once again known months before “omg ATT is partners!” And finally just happened last week.\n\nI can continue but literally AST going from $2-30+ made 0 sense.",
