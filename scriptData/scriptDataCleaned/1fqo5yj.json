This can be incredibly biased, and in fact earlier this week other survey organizations have determined the Labor Differential has narrowed recently.\n\nIt's hard to say how this survey was polled, who was surveyed, how many were surveyed, and if this can be considered forward looking. This is just an opinion based on a group of god knows who and their potential insights into macroeconomics or the labor market.\n\nOpinions are like assholes, everyone's got one.  \n  \nSelf plug, check out my recent WSB post if you want to see some real data of why I'm short based on current macroeconomic trends.",
