It’s great that you’re taking accountability and claiming you’re going to get help, you need to follow through on that promise to yourself. I and many other people know that terrible, gut wrenching feeling that comes with these types of mistakes. You’re not the first and you won’t be the last. \n\nSome of the best things in life come from your darkest moments. You have an opportunity here to pour all of your negative emotions into investing in yourself. Go hit the gym and take those terrible feelings out there. Or take a new class in something. If you use this negative energy of gut wrenching anxiety and adrenaline to do something positive for yourself, you will quickly rebuild your confidence and move forward.

I've gambled big money and lost and dealt with the regret. Lost big a few times actually. Not on options... Sports betting mainly. \n\nIn my experience, you feel horrified and wish you could bargain with reality. You cannot. So you have to accept the current situation. Then, you need to say \"never again\". However, saying never again doesn't mean shit. Remove access to even making further moves. Lock yourself out. Then, even if you really want to fuck around again... You can't. \n\nWhen you can't make the plays your mind will eventually get used to not thinking about it. If you're thinking about doing risky shit with your money, put it in an envelope in your home. Occasionally check out how much you have in the envelope. You could do it with a bank account; however, holding the money in your hand will help you. \n\nWrite yourself a letter, if it would help, and if you're about to gamble again, read it. You don't need gambler's anonymous. You'll just be told \"it's a disease and you're powerless\", or some shit. You're not powerless. You've either taken enough pain to make a change or you haven't. No one changes until it hurts to a level that you can't accept. \n\nBuddy, you rolled the dice and the dice didn't play. But you'll be okay. For every \"win\" you see on here with the options...

I'm assuming you're not of retirement age and still have many years left to make that money back and then some. In the mean time, I'd suggest trying to spend time with friends and family, and get out in nature if you can. Spirituality helped me a lot when I was in a similar position as you.
