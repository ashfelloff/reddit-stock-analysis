I haven't checked the statistics since then, but this small town of 25k people decided 40% of all patent lawsuits in 2017.\n\nIn 2017, however, there was a ruling by the supreme court that patent infringement cases must be filed where the defendant is based.\n\nSo, if Tesla were to incorporate in Texas, they could force whoever is suing them to file against them in Marshall, Texas?\n\nI am just guessing, but whenever I've ever read a story about any tech company moving to Texas, this is what I've assumed has always been the motivation behind it.",

That translates to 1.1Billion of asset value which turned over an equivalent $177 million profit (17.66 billion total).\n\nSo, ignoring the share value, they need tesla to grow by at least 7x for it to be rational. Tesla, by all metrics, has shown a down trend in all performance metrics that Elon hasn't manipulated or obfuscated.\n\nPersonally, I think he's going to be bankrupt in 5-10 years and the only reason I don't put money on it is because Tesla is not a rational stock.\n\nIt seems insane to me that he wants a pay package that is worth more than half the company's asset value to \"keep him interested\". He's promising robo taxis and he's pumping sales figures (0 deposit, 0 interest car loans). If he gets this approved, I imagine Q3 earnings + robotaxi presentation will just be a song and dance for him to exit the company while liquidating his stake in the company.",

So it doesnt matter that Delaware has a 0% income tax.\n\nTo me, this is an example of people assuming that 50+ other jurisdictions just sat on their hands for the past 40 years and didnt compete with Delaware at all.
