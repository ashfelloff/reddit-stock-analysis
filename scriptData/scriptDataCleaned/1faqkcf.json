Their tools are highly opinionated, as in they force you to setup your data in a way that is amenable to the way their software analyzes data. Highly opinionated means less flexibility, and this is the complete opposite of what the industry is doing, which is to maximize flexibility by offering every niche solution as a SaaS product and hiring a bunch of data engineers to do the custom integration.\n\nBull case is that their productivity tools are not only top tier but also scalable, as in they can become more of a monolithic SaaS company and less of a consulting company over the next few years. Also, if anyone figures out how to manage autonomous agents that can execute business logic within organizations, it’s going to be MSFT or PLTR.

It/I wasn't expecting an event this Friday... and I haven't updated my code yet to boost the closing order from $0.01 to the mid-price before closing if it's not executing\n\nMy brokerage has updated on the weekend - I'm now short 400 shares (but still long 10+ calls).  I'll probably be able to get out of that next week without too much pain.\n\nAt $34 you should be fine / not exercised :)",
