I have nothing against those companies they are great but wondering about the hundreds of other stocks in the market.\n\nWhat companies outside of those 7 stocks. And outside of baskets like index funds and ETFs do you feel will outperform the market next year and the coming years?",

They argued that like Facebook and Uber stayed private for a long time using private investor money to grow their market share, and then when they did go public, they already became large cap companies.  I think they were saying the next superstar would be OpenAI if it goes public.  Anything can happen, but it was definitely what the article was saying.",

      "body": "For me it is Broadcom. While a very obvious stock to some, I feel it is often overlooked by retail and mostly preferred by institutions (around 75% of the stock is owned by institutions). Some of my reasons for the coming years:\n\n1. One of the top companies in the world typically at or around number 10 in market cap\n\n2. They have a myriad of big customers like Apple, Google, Cisco, Arista, and more\n\n3. Their product/service range is very wide which makes them a more stable semiconductor company compared to most competitors \n\n4. They are going to benefit massively in the coming years from huge growing areas like AI, cloud, data center, automation, cyber security, power generation, software, and overall interconnectivity of the world. As the world continues to integrate AI into their business they will be looking for businesses to customize solutions and chips for their businesses. Broadcom is one of few who provides such customizable chips and services. \n\n5. VMware is a BEAST for income and engrained in a ton of the world\n\n6. The company is very good at acquisitions of very high revenue generating enterprises to further their income long term (even if it causes a short term hit in cost)\n\n7. They are stellar at cost cutting unnecessary parts to boost profits\n\n8. While Broadcom certainly sells at a premium, compared to most other big semiconductor companies, they are still a great deal and consistently provide amazing return to holders yearly\n\n9. Some people worry about their China revenue, which yes is a risk. But if you view their world revenue sources their world ex China revenue is growing strongly yearly by year. If something happens with China Broadcom is continuing to hedge its position with more revenue sources to reduce their reliance. And in the case things improve with China, China is having their 2008 stimulus moment where they are down big, but poised for a big recovery in coming years which would only further benefit Broadcom with more spending.",
