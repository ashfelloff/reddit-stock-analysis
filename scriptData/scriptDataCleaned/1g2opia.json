Those were successful tests, not failures.\n\nAs for Elon being “relatively quiet” on SpaceX, that is, with respect, one of the most regarded takes I’ve seen.\n\nMusk has been vital for SpaceX. Him owning the majority of voting shares and keeping the company private is the single biggest reason SpaceX are allowed to push the boundaries and take such immense risks.\n\nNot to mention that he’s the chief engineer and has the final say on all the engineering choices and has contributed greatly to its design - just read or watch any interview from Mueller back from even the Raptor days. \n\nThere literally HOURS long videos of him with Everydayastronaut there he goes into GREAT detail of the engineering behind Starship and the reasoning behind the choices they made. Both of Eric Berger’s book, Liftoff and Reentry, goes into great depth of just how crucial Musk work is for SpaceX’s success.\n\nRedditors need to realize that people they think are bad can also be really good at what they do. Like are you fucking people children where everything can just be black and white?",
