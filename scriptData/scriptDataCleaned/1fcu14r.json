The interest rates are called swap and they're usually very low for liquid assets (e.g. just 0.025% of your final position value for Nasdaq futures) and it's paid at the end of each day.\n\nNote that in forex swap is sometimes positive, i.e. the broker pays you, for example for going long on ZARJPY (swap is 0.016%)\n\nIn forex the leverages are the biggest, usually about 30x. However depending on your broker you can get a professional account where they give you up to 300x",
