              "body": ">Brand new groundbreaking chips released were utter garbage and causing issues?\n\nReads like a GN hit piece. Way too much hyperbole and not addressing the actual root cause of the company's struggle.\n\n*The gist is that the decisions that were made 10 years ago will impact them long after the choice was made.* No EUV when they were on 14nm is a big part of that, now they have an uncompetitive process on old tools that don't make fiscal sense to design on. A two year miss on Xeon delivery as a result of that. I mean, hell, Sapphire Rapids was a good product but the design team brought all the way to F stepping or something insane because they couldnt get it working. So it was a design and fab failure and everyone involved in that got canned. \n\nWhen your core business is technological innovation and you have execs that are skimping out on R&D capital expenditure like Krzanich and Swan, then you've lost the plot. One trip up and an aggressive competitor in the most demanding processor economy in history (Covid WFH) is all you need to lose footing.\n\nSemiconductor manufacturing is the most advanced thing humanity can make, and it takes an extreme amount of capital and knowledge to make it work. Intel, until last year, was a closed fab gig. But now that they don't corner the market due to failures on 14nm they can't do that anymore and went to adopt the foundry service model. But who else has the staff capable of designing this stuff and moreover, how long does it take to design them? \n\nThere are only three semiconductor manufacturing companies in the world that are developing advanced nodes. TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. No one else is capable of breaking into this market segment because there isn't enough demand in manufacturing alone, and it's extremely capital intensive. All of Intel's losses are in the Fab and overexpenditure on building new fabs that don't have external designs running through them. Look at the CCG graphs out in the wild, Intel's design team is still printing money but the rest of the business units are struggling to stay afloat. \n\nThis has a pretty telling story when you consider 14nm designs were in production from 2016 to 2021. Their designs were so far ahead they could operate a horribly inefficient fab for nearly 6 years not including the spin up time before their first 14nm wafers and still had a corner on the market.\n\ntl;dr only 3 companies in the world capable of mfg. Intel with the biggest track record, even if company is going through reorgs, and won't be failing anytime soon.",

          "body": "Nvidia didn't want to buy ARM because they thought the company was better, they wanted to buy ARM to dominate the RISC processor market.\n\nTo give you a bit of insight, Intel and AMD are the only two companies in the world allowed to license the x86 CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) process for CPU instructions. ARM develops using the open RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) process.  \n\nWhile CISC is absolutely critical to any high end computing, it is also very inefficient thanks to the number of instructions that are needed to process which aren't important for most low level tasks.  This is where RISC shines.  The reduced instructions means that many tasks can be handled in a more efficient manner. \n\nOne of those tasks that can be delegated to a reduced instruction set environment is machine learning.  That's where Nvidia comes in.  They wanted to buy up the dominant player in the reduced instruction set environment which is ARM since it was the easiest way to completely dominate the RISC market.  \n\nHowever unlike x86, which requires a license, anyone can develop a RISC architecture on their own.  They don't \"have\" to use ARM, they chose to use ARM because it's simpler than developing their own instruction set, well established, and proven efficient. \n\nHonestly there are a lot of reasons why nvidia wanted to buy ARM, but in the end they can just develop their own RISC based processor if they truly wanted to completely bypassing ARM, but they would rather not devote the resources to getting that done.  Plus there was the added benefit of completely dominating a ARM saturated RISC market which was pretty much the actual goal.\n\nThere's actually a lot more, to this, but I'd imagine most people who don't already know about this stuff have had their eyes glaze over at this point.  Short story is if Nvidia would be allowed to buy Intel and the x86 computing license, they would be ecstatic, but the US and EU would never allow that to happen.  It would be shut down even quicker than the Arm acquisition was.",

No spending $20B to build the fab, no maintaining the fab, no billions spent on process R&D... just pay what you need to, when you need to do it.\n\nIt's also less risky than tethering yourself to an internal fab. Right now, if TSMC starts sucking, they could just switch to Samsung. If your internal fab starts sucking, like Intel, then you're just shackled to a corpse.\n\nThe only way the vertically integrated design + fab business model works, is if you design both leading-edge products and maintain a leading-edge fab (OG Intel strategy). Then you can earn top dollar to pay for both, and can take advantage of the efficiencies of having a custom in-house fab that you're always first in line for.\n\nBut on the whole, fabless is just a less risky endeavor, and it's why the industry has pivoted that way.\n\nI won't even get into the anti-trust implications of selling off Intel's fabs and patent library. It's a major extra tangle towards finding a buyer.\n\nI think an Intel default is looking pretty certain at this point, so those fabs will be up for liquidation pretty soon. The path of least resistance would be for Uncle Sam to take some money printer injections and buy them out, GM style, and just keep the status quo going. Otherwise, I think the only option is for the govt is cut up Intel into several antitrust-friendly sized chunks and sell them to different semi competitors, with Intel's creditors taking the proceeds.",
