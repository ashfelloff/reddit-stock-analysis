              "body": "I think MARA can go to 50-60 at 100k BTC, whenever the hell that will be. But max like 200 end of next year with BTC at 200k bc of unwinding of longs and eventual shorting when BTC hits peaks\n\nMara is an insanely shorted stock. It goes down when BTC is up 2/3rds the time. But when any real breakout happens, it will go up 10%, 20%. There will be atleast one 40-50% day for the shorts to unwind some, when BTC gets closer to 100k.\n\nWith BTC ETF options, we are going to see rapid price swings generally upwards, after the elections. I would get out of this position when it spikes to 50 eoy when BTC is bobbin around 100k (hopefully).\n\nBut yeah, all weeklies get slaughtered every week, it's so bad. Stock is the way",
