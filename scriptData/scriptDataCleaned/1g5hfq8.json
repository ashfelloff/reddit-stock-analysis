There are literally small car dealerships/showrooms on every street with like a $3m inventory and the people here actually buy these cars. You’ll see Porsches, Benzes, and Beamers everywhere in a city where it’s so inconvenient to own a car especially an expensive one because of the traffic and lack of careful drivers. It would be the equivalent of seeing like high end benzes and beamers or entry level Bentleys, lambos, and Ferraris everywhere since the price ends up pretty much being the same.
