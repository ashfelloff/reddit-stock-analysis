  "title": "TSMC Revenue Jumped Over 60% YoY in April 2024. TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor) makes all the chips for Nvidia, Apple, AMD, among others",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. saw April sales jump 60% to NT$236 billion ($7.3 billion) as sustained artificial intelligence demand was helped by the beginnings of a recovery in consumer electronics.\n\n\n\nThe world’s largest contract chipmaker is estimated to increase sales by about a third in the current quarter, after revenue growth accelerated to 34.3% in March, buoyed largely by insatiable appetite for AI semiconductors. The global smartphone industry returned to growth over the first three months of the year, including in the highly competitive Chinese market, which may drive orders for TSMC’s traditional mainstay of mobile chips.\n\n\n\nHsinchu-based TSMC weathered a year of muted demand for personal electronics last year, which Nvidia Corp.’s highly sought-after AI chips helped make more tolerable. Now the AI boost is pairing with rising prospects for consumer demand, though TSMC Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei has cautioned about the pace of any recovery.\n\n\n\nThe company’s shares soared to an all-time high in April, as it remains in an enviable position to benefit from the rise of AI technology, being Nvidia’s sole manufacturer for the most advanced training chips. TSMC also fabricates semiconductors for Apple Inc., which just announced a new lineup of iPads, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the closest competitor to Nvidia in the AI chip race.\n\n  \nThis would entail be positive news considering Nvidia's earnings is scheduled on the 22 May 2024.

This development is only the third major shift in semiconductor design since the 1950s. Initially, we moved from planar to FinFET transistors, which reduced leakage currents significantly and enhanced power efficiency, providing a 20-30% increase in switching speeds and cutting power consumption by more than half.\n\nNow, we're transitioning from FinFET to GAA. GAA transistors offer even better gate control, further reducing leakage currents, and are expected to improve performance by over 25% compared to their FinFET predecessors. They also allow for up to 50% lower power consumption and better scalability, especially important for nodes smaller than 5nm.\n\nThe front-runners in this technological leap are TSMC, Samsung, and Intel. \n\nThis isn't just a step forward; it's a giant leap for semiconductor technology, enhancing the capabilities of future devices and systems dramatically. For anyone skeptical about the significance or progress of these developments, consider the profound impacts that updating the structure of the core component in computing for the first time since 2000 will have on our technology landscape.\n\nBuy.",
