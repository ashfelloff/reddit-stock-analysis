Whether the price is $25 or $15, I’m confident that this investment will be a 10-bagger by the NRC decision in 2027 and potentially even a 50-bagger by the late 2030s when they go through massive scaling.\n\nThey have the healthiest balance sheet amongst SMR projects, a strong leadership team with PhDs, first mover advantage within the NRC application process and have hired on former regulatory staff, reactor technology that was already proven through decades of testing between 1964-1994, unique expertise within uranium recycling, and probably most importantly, partnership commitments driven by a robust commercialization model that is scalable and profitable overtime.
