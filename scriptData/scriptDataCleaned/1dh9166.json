When they expiry isn‚Äôt really what‚Äôs the most important here the IV when you buy them is. A few days before the event is when IV will start to increase so this is why it‚Äôs important to be up to date on events so you can buy your options before everyone else does and jacks the price up. The longer dated calls will naturally have less IV though so that‚Äôs why people get them so if you find out an events next week and the IV had already jumped you‚Äôd buy the longer dated calls to mirage your IV risk. The longer dated calls will usually be more expensive but you avoid IV inflation. Though yeah if you bought them with inflated IV you should be trying to sell them before the event or during before IV drops. So get whatever expiry just sell it early.",
