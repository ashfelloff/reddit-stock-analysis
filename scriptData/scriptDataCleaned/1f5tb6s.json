I've been using Nubank as my primary bank since the early days when they were invite-only.\n\nI studied CS and some of my brightest colleagues from university now work at Nubank. From what I've heard, they're a very modern company in terms of mentality and leadership. They're hiring a lot of talent from Brazil and Latin America which would otherwise be brain-drained to Europe or the US. Remote work is the norm.\n\nTheir user interface is way better and easier to use than other banks. It's easy to see as a user that they're constantly innovating, expanding and trying new things. For example, they've recently integrated an investment interface into their main banking app. This exposed millions of Brazilians to the bond and stock markets, who previously only knew low-yield savings accounts. They've also given millions of people easy access to more credit than they would otherwise be eligible for. Not sure if this has paid off or not. \n\nWhen I started using them 8 years ago, no one had heard of Nubank. Nowadays, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a Nubank account. In the past 2 years, however, we're seeing some old, more established banks catching up.\n\nAlso relevant: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brazil/comments/1akd4i3/why_do_brazilians_like_nubank_so_much_why_so/\n\nI have no idea how these things affect the stock, just thought I'd share my experience with them.",

Why do they like it so much if they can’t speak to financials? As an analyst, it sounds like the marketing department trying to explain my work. \n\nBigger players have a lot more to gain from drumming up hype than I do as a regular dude approaching a 6 figure portfolio, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to assume astroturfing until proven otherwise.
