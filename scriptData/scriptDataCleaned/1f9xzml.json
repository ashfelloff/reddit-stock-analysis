Yuk. No stories of yolo'ing ice cube futures with their grandma's surgery money, no real fun either as the posts were functionally the same. So, it was decreed that low tier garbage posts about the store shall be stricken from the sub unless it is in oblique references like this. It didn't help that ape types got culty and accused the mods of being in bed with hedge funds and all kindsa crazy stuff. It was bad, like my Friday 0 DTE spy calls bad.\n\nTLDR: I put the TLDR at the top.",
