You have a lot of time left on these for things to change: if volatility was going to bother you it was a bit too much to bet\n\nOptions are not only a leveraged bet on the directional movement of a large amount of underlying shares, but time bound and with a specific magnitude. The reason they sometimes print big is because quite often they do in fact go tits up.\n\nSending you e-hugs and hope you can cycle through the stages of grief fast.\n\nAlso I‚Äôm pretty sure I ordered a frosty so if you could grab that while we‚Äôre young I‚Äôd appreciate it",

Those are the ares where Databricks has a superior solution and is winning customers.\n\n\nSo I don't think the snowflake warehouse is going anywhere, but yeah the only way SNOW bounces back is if they can execute on those products.
