A bit nervous and slow for a bit. Then confidence, feeling like I actually understand the greeks, but… mostly have massive gratitude for current market conditions. BUT! I THANK YOU GUYS MOST OF ALL, who taught me to take profit, size positions, and so much more. I am so grateful to you for your help. And the laughter and love. ♥️\n\nPositions: a ton of different calls, on all sorts of ideas (some illiquid and other errors) Steady SPY calls with occasional puts (based on the chart over a few days.) Random momentary wins are represented, eg Game Store calls, bought that Tuesday and sold leading up to the livestream. I was “letting one ride,” a lot through this time. I have recently cut back on that - the situation would have to be spectacular going forward. Full list in my trading journal, i.e. WSB. Usually set sell orders at 30%, sometimes 20%, rarely watch (I have many positions for now.) Best of luck and much love to you guys. You make my days brighter. ",

              "body": "For me, a big turning point was taking gains at a set percentage (20-30,) most of the time. Too often before that, I’d watch things drop precipitously, even to almost zero. And the key, and this isn’t on lottos, that helped me was not to look back at the contract after. Otherwise I’d feel I messed up by leaving money on the table. That kind of thinking is how I lost all gains and dropped down to the start, earlier on. That advice helped me build and grow beyond what I thought possible. And in this market, at least, there is always another opportunity. I also learned to make smaller plays, all around the same size, unless it was a total experiment. That kind of slower build maybe doesn’t feel like a cool screenshot at first, but led to one quite quickly in this case. It’s also perhaps a bit about following one’s own rules and mental health. Easier to be happy on a down/ish day. \n\nThe cutting at 8% isn’t something I’ve done yet, but is important as far as I understand. That is about preserving capital. Get out of the trade at a set point if it goes against you. I mostly buy 45 or more DTE (aiming for 60-90 and sell by 45, now,) so I’ve been sloppy on that. I’m still learning, but as the amount I have for options grows, just, I need to do that. Warren Buffet said something like: Rule number 1 is: Don’t lose money. Rule number 2 is: refer back to rule number 1. The focus being on preservation first over growth. This is also why I tried to hedge, once so far, on Monday. (Three calls and one put on SPY, was hard to do!)\n\n(I do still have some I watch. Especially if longer dated. To learn how they behave. And for a special event might hover or let things go an hour or too. But day to day, setting and walking away - or rather clicking away - for most, has been *really* beneficial to my mind. Haha, I mean, I’m so happy I fully funded retirement and started my…I’m not sure what it is actually called, but ballast stocks. Need to learn lots more about those because I am lost when it comes to dividends and value and CEFs and BDCs…um, really clueless. So far I mostly buy BRKB, which is still a lot of Apple…I’ll have to see if anyone talks about that here. I keep getting in trouble on the other stock subs, even being friendly and polite, I think.)\n\nEdit typos and nervous ramble as I realized my ‘ballast’ portfolio is…?\n\nEdit2: I buy 45+ DTE, mostly. Of late go for 60-90, but still get out fast usually. I think of LEAPS as more efficient capital allocation, so different on those, longterm.",

And sometimes, while I am looking it over it starts going up and even above. I do follow my rules better, now. Aiming for that percentage and not looking back again. It’s kind of magical - money just appears in my account, since. Embarrassingly, I haven’t set a SL yet. Just because so am trying to get a sense of the volatility.
