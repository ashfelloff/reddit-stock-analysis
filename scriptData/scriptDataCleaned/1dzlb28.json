There's robotaxi but Google have self driving taxi too and they didnt rally 50%. \n\nCould someone please tell me why it rallies 50%?",

The AI side of their business is growing fast. Their in house chips are now taking off and are specified toward applications that assist other parts of their business. FSD legitimately improved a lot in the past couple upgrades. It’s a bigger leap than they’ve ever had IMO. Partnerships created in China for autonomous driving.\n\nThose are some reasons, none of them insignificant. It’s also been beaten up pretty badly and there are short positions to cover. The people who are flabbergasted by this rise just haven’t paid any attention for a couple years. Tesla is in a better place now than they’ve ever been in before regarding realizing potential. Of course if you’re still in the camp that a company with one of the biggest self-built supercomputers in the world, who designs chips, upended manufacturing in the auto industry, has a full fledged AI segment, and is building autonomy on the level of robots and vehicles is only a car company, then you’ll be confused at this price action.",

                  "body": "Fantasy isn’t meant negative here. Maybe the use of the word is misleading - my native language is German and we use the term „Phantasie“ in stock valuation. It is usually a positive thing in stocks - as in if you can’t have a fantasy about revenues and developments than the evaluation will be very conservative.\n\nTesla is still valued at PE ratios between 45 and 80 recently (currently at about 67). \n\nIf there was no fantasy - or call it hope or betting on expectation - then such a valuation would not be sustainable. However if there is believe in possible developments (what I called fantasy) then higher valuations can not only be sustainable but also be still on the low end.\n\nTherefore the 8/8 presentation will be important for the route the stock will take. The only thing I’m not sure about would be what happens if the presentation was mediocre - so not bad but also not really good and especially vague (as has been the case before). Usually that could be fatal but Tesla has a strong following among retail and institutional investors by now. So maybe even a mediocre presentation might mean no serious problem.\n\nTo be clear about one thing:\n\nI don’t really have an agenda regarding Tesla. I earned a bit of money with it and currently hold no position (long or short). I’m not planning to either because I see the stock as pretty volatile and it could very well go either way so I’m too conservative for it. I don’t care much for Musk but I like EVs so Tesla is a neutral company for me in essence. \n\nWhat makes me really wonder is why so many people have an agenda about Tesla though. It seems very controversial and hard to just debate based on objective arguments.",

Waymo/Google is shooting for level-4, which needs more technology breakthroughs to apply to every road. It's typical of how google works. But a level-4 can only be a robotaxi.

For tesla, a car maker, that would be sucidial.   \nIt's much better to shoot for level-3 autonomy, like GM and Benz are trying. Level -3 means car can run autonomously and will ask the driver to take over if it sees unlearnt scenarios. This is probably achievable within few years if technology keeps pace.
