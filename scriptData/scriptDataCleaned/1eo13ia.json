So if your calls have a strike of $100, and the shares are at $105, means you are in the money and you can excercise the options and actually own the shares.\n\nRemember that options are a contract. So the idea is that the last person who buys your contract has to eventually want to excercise the options and actually own the shares.\n\nSo if you are in the money, as long as the company isnt some shitty penny stock there is usually always somebody willing to buy them from you so that they can own the shares. But if you are holding options in the money of a shitty company, there is a chance nobody actually wants to own the shares and so your options would be worthless",

                              "body": "this just refers to selling an option and relying on the \"theta\" value of the option to decrease. Theta is related to time till expiry. \n\nIn practice, you need to get option trading enabled on your brokerage then you are good to go.  \nI personally like to use this website to visualize my trades: [https://optionstrat.com/build/covered-call/NVDA/NVDAx100,-.NVDA240823C110](https://optionstrat.com/build/covered-call/NVDA/NVDAx100,-.NVDA240823C110)\n\nSelling theta can be pretty risky if you aren't careful. To play safely you want to execute \"Cash Secured Puts\" or \"Covered calls\"\n\nFor the puts, the idea is that if you want to own 100 of some stock, you can instead sell a put for that stock at a price point you would be OK owning it. If you option gets assigned then congrats, you got paid to do a trade you were gonna do anyways. If you option doesn't get assigned, then you got paid essentially to wait and buy that stock later.\n\nThe risks here are you can get assigned at a value higher than the stock is trading during option expiration. Or that the stock can skyrocket before you get the chance to actually buy it. You want to make sure you have the money to make this trade when you sell the Put. Otherwise you can get shafted if you get assigned.\n\nCovered Calls are the opposite. If you own 100 of some stock and you plan to sell it, instead you can sell a covered call.\n\nThere are other strats too, one that is more annoying to execute is called an Iron Condor. I don't do these often but there is def ways to shape risk how you like: [https://optionstrat.com/build/iron-condor/NVDA/.NVDA240823P95,-.NVDA240823P100,-.NVDA240823C110,.NVDA240823C115](https://optionstrat.com/build/iron-condor/NVDA/.NVDA240823P95,-.NVDA240823P100,-.NVDA240823C110,.NVDA240823C115)",
