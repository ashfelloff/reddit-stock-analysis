Also, would you buy now or wait for a better entry point since most stocks are constantly hitting or close to all time highs right now?\n",

I suspect they are already using it and being private do not publicize it, like APPL (who prefer to use the term Large Language Modeling)\n\nMSFT except for OFFICE has been a follower or acquirer; they were way behind on AI and is the reason the partner with OpenAI and did better PR.\n\nI will stick with Google.\n\nI personally also suspect that APPL (I know they partner with OpenAI for the consumer front, but believe they have internal products) and AMZN have better AI tech as it is captive and will never be in the open market for competitive reasons.\n\nThere was a good new release of data is king and those that can exploit data will win. Isomorphic Labs partnering with LLY and NVS on drug discovery. If you can shorten drug discovery time and extend protection - it is a big win.",

Unless they axe significant parts of their business (which are the ones that actually make money for them) I don't see how they will be super profitable in the foundry space.\n\nIt looks like they're mostly betting on the foundries thing to work out: in x86 CPU design AMD has a superior design both in client and datacenter. For GPU/AI they're trying to compete with companies that have DECADES of experience. They have no play in ARM CPU design. In order to catch up they need a ton of R&D money I'm afraid they won't have.\n\nThey won't be number 2, they might get close to number 3 but with all these startups and big tech companies making their own AI accelerators who knows how relevant that \"kinda 3rd place\" is.\n\nNot saying they will go bankrupt, US government seems to be ready to help them out, but that does not make them a good/growth company.",

Intel foundries can catch up but like you said it all depends on them not running out of money before they reach profitability in foundry, if they take longer they're probably doomed.\n\nTheir design side has always been good, but sadly those \"sit in your laurels\" years of rebranded Skylake and 14++++ have hurt.\n\nThe roadmap does not seem to hint any major/new architecture, which is something they need to stay competitive and regain leadership in the CPU front.\n\nTheir General-Purpose GPU stuff has been a little obsolete, if they decide to catch up and do what main competitors have (AMD/NVIDIA) it will require some years to get it right in R&D and more than one product, which again, is a money pit that requires another steady source of income.\n\nIn summary, it seems like Intel is betting almost everything in foundries working out, which is also the business that is bleeding the most and not generating any profit (yet). In order to get there, they need to keep injecting money which right now comes from the design division products + subsidies/chips act. Design products only make money if they're competitive, and they (again) need millions for R&D but right now budget is tight thanks to the foundries bet... Seems like a vicious circle.\n\nI would love to hear a detailed bull case because I can't see how they regain leadership/stay relevant in both products and foundries. Competitors are pouring millions in R&D too (and their budget isn't as tight as Intel's)",

They have sold first batch of pyrolysisoil, but the shareprice dident move.\n\nI'll think they have to prove stability in the production, and god quality of the product before we will see any positive movement.\n\nThe CEO had his last day at work last friday, so that made it drop a little this week. When all of this is sorted out, I think there will be a nice upside. WPU is the company to compare this with, and they have a stockprice 2,7 times higher.\n\nThis is not a investment advice",
