  "score": 3180,
  "selftext": "Elon Musk is still cutting hundreds of jobs at Tesla. The automaker went through another round of layoffs in the early morning hours of May 6. That means there have now been layoffs at Tesla for four straight weeks. Workers who spoke with Business Insider said they were notified of additional cuts to their team on Monday morning. Several also posted on LinkedIn that they’d been let go. After watching my team gradually slimmed down week after week since mid-April, I received the dreaded ‘Hello Employee’ email this Sunday afternoon,” one Tesla worker wrote on LinkedIn.\n\nAnother worker shared a screenshot of her layoff email on LinkedIn that showed her last day of work would be May 5.",
