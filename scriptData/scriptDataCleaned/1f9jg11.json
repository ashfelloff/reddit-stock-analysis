If one is a special snowflake that thinks they are the chosen few that can outperform by active trading, good luck. Its something like 1 % of active traders that consistently outperform the market.\n\nI for one accept that I don't have an edge and will utilize the optimal approach that the abundance of data supports. In the end one's savings rate (and degree of career success) is probably the biggest factor anyways so long as they are not blowing up their account with horrible trades.",

I agree that most people do not have the expertise or discretion of a professional trader who's job it is to do that, and it's not a good idea for retail traders to do it, but if you use broker managed account, it's probably part of their risk management to sell off stocks during uncertain times.\n\nMeasuring how much traders outperform the market, to make a point on sensible risk management, isn't a good comparison. Most retail trading on the market, is no different than playing poker or sports betting. 90% of traders don't know what an edge even is, and they are \"timing the market\" the way someone predicts a roulette table. Wheras, analyzing the real economic conditions that influence the market is not just guessing and is not always a wrong bet.\n\nUnless you are willing to dedicate a lot of time and potentially some losses to learning to do this efficiently, you are better off investing the way you are told.",

      "body": "A steady trend of labor market degradation in the United States\n\nThere is little doubt where this is all headed. A year ago at this time of year, the three-month average of nonfarm job creation was at 211k, and now it’s only 116k (142k in August), and the long-term norm is about 190k per month.\n\nAt the same time, the data for June and July were revised sharply downward by 30% or minus 86k (from 293k total for the two months to 207k employed).\n\nIt’s still better to count in percentages, as as the economy and population grows, you need more and more employment growth in absolute terms to have a commensurate effect. The 3-month average is 0.07% per month, the YTD average is 0.11%, and the 12-month average is 0.12%, while the medium-term rate before COVID (2017-2019) was 0.13% per month and the 10-year long-term rate is 0.16%.\n\nThe visible deterioration started in June and the data is about half as bad as the long-term trend in job creation. It’s not a crisis (requires at least three months of job contraction) or a recession (a rate of about 0.03% per month averaged over 3-6 months), but the first clear signal.\n\nIt should be taken into account that BLS manipulates data and recently «lost» over 800 thousand employed, yesterday they revised the data for the worse by 30% and it is not excluded that soon we will find out that all this is a complete fake and the economy is in recession since spring 2024.\n\nIt’s important to note the structural degradation: \n\n- Native American workers have lost about 1.5 million jobs since the beginning of 2020, replaced by over 3 million migrants (mostly from Mexico).\n\n- More than 2 million part-time (low-wage) jobs have gained over the past year with nearly 1.5 million full-time jobs lost. \n\nWhere is the job growth concentrated? Over the past year, 85% of service sector jobs were in health care, trade, food service and entertainment - mostly low-paying jobs, while IT is cutting employment and banks and professional and business services (the highest paying) have the smallest rate of growth since early 2008.\n\nAll signs point to a dip into recession soon.",
