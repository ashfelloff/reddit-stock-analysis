We are in an environment similar to 2001, yield curve starting to uninvert, unemployment ticking up, inflation in the 2s, tech valuations extremely high. Gold went from mid 200s to 400 in less than 2 years during that time. In my eyes, it’s safer to be bullish gold and silver during a rate cutting cycle than to be bearish stocks.
