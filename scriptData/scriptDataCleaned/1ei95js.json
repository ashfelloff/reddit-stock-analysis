If you are already employees you obviously arenâ€™t in the calculation but if you switched jobs within the month you also arenâ€™t calculated. Most people already have a job so the job growth number is far lower than the population at large.\n\nThe second thing is that itâ€™s a number calculated after surveying about 20% of businesses in the US (more than that becomes unfeasible). Itâ€™s a big enough sample size to be accurate enough but thatâ€™s part of the reason it gets revised so much.\n\nThe number itself isnâ€™t whatâ€™s important so much unless itâ€™s exceptionally high or exceptionally low, itâ€™s generally used to measure a relative change in the economy based on how it compares to historical numbers.",
