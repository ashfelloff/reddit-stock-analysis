  "score": 1152,
  "selftext": "Tech giants like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta are spending billions of CapEx on AI. Lets just look at their last 2 quarters spending:\n\n* **Amazon**: Increased CapEx from $60 billion in Q2 2024 to $70 billion in Q3 2024.\n* **Google**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion in the same period.\n* **Microsoft**: Increased CapEx from $44 billion to $49 billion.\n* **Meta**: Increased CapEx from $29 billion to $31 billion.\n\nHowever not all that CapEx is going to third party AI solutions like Nvidia/AMD. Each and every company listed above has or is developing it's own custom AI silicon.\n\nLets look how they are transitioning from 3rd party to In-House AI silicon:\n\n**Amazon**: Developed AWS Inferentia and Tranium chips for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).\n\n**Google**: Developed Tensor Processing Unite (TPU) and Axion chip for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).\n\n**Microsoft**: Developed Azure Maia AI chip and Azure Cobalt for AI processing (manufactured by TSM & INTC).\n\n**Meta**: Developed Meta trading and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) for AI processing (manufactured by TSM).\n\nAll those developments reduce dependence on external GPU suppliers, allow more customized/efficient AI processing and most importantly huge cost savings.\n\nJust to understand the level of savings (and why would they invest huge R&D budget on this):\n\nA **regular Nvidia H100 GPU**, cost approximately **$3,320** to manufacture from TSMC. However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!\n\nThat's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.\n\nAs more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)\n\nAnd this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.  \n  \n\n\n\n\n",

TSMC falling under Chinese control would have a massive cascading effect across economies around the world, not to mention security concerns of China having sole access to the latest tech advances in CPUs.  It really has the potential to lead to WWIII so therefore I think such an invasion is unlikely.\n\nAlso, SHOULD such a situation come to pass, the market will just tank all around.  The entire NASDAQ would collapse.  All of our portfolios will turn to shit whether or not it includes TSM stock.\n\nIt is a good thing the TSMC plant in AZ is doing really well. The risk will be greatly diminished if fabrication can be done in the U.S. and other allied countries.  I believe TSM will eventually have the highest market cap out there. \n\nIntel, on the other hand… yeah.. maybe if a conflict becomes inevitable we can give Intel to China and let them feel like they came out ahead or something.",

Also, you can bet your ass that the US would ship out all the top end fabs and engineers they could, and then destroy what’s left before China gets even close. It’s a lose-lose situation, but China loses more as their country is more dependant on foreign trade then just about anybody. They would have to be stupid as hell to try it",

The latest and greatest is going to be running on Nvidia and it's going to keep rolling that way for some years. \n\nThey do want to run it cheaper and they're working towards that but the newest innovation is just not going to be cheap to run. It's like 4o-mini perhaps. But I don't even know that's true. All of Microsoft's custom silicon was purely ARM server based offerings. TPU's is a dangerous game.

At some point the compute density of what Nvidia is offering is extremely efficient.\n\nYou can't say oh this TPU that I made 10 years ago is viable today.

However, once you train your model and have your weights, you don’t really need CUDA. In fact, you can build custom chips specific to the model architecture that can run inference a lot more efficiently than any of the NVIDIA chips. \n\nFor almost all the companies, my guess is more than 90% of their current compute goes to inference, not training. Think about it, once Anthropic trained Sonnet 3.5, all the GPUs are just used to serve that one model to millions of users. \n\nGiven this, I totally expect every company spending billions of dollars to try and invest in their own chips. They might still use NVIDIA chips for training sure, but that won’t be as significant as today. \n\nPlus, in a few years, every company will try to create their own framework and training chips from scratch. Google kind of did it long ago. They trained Gemini in Jax, which uses their own TPUs and doesn’t depend on CUDA.",

But it’s pretty clear that’s not going to happen simply because the real economy isn’t growing in a way that would allow the spend that would make these chip investments worthwhile to actually occur.\n\nI’m massively short semis for this reason. I think the last couple of years created a massive hype cycle where semi companies, hyper scalers, and enterprise software companies all had an interest in pumping AI as the future but what is still lacking are significant numbers of paying customers.",

While their own custom chips may be good enough for some inference services, they won't be as competitive for training.\n\n\nSo just like chip designers continue to use TSMC because of its superior technology even though cheaper offerings are available from Samsung and Intel, hyperscalers will continue to use Nvidia for the same reason. They don't mind paying a premium for the best bleeding edge technology.\n\n\nThe one exception is Google who has been designing AI chips for almost as long as Nvidia, and have an already mature ecosystem around them.",

They don’t even have transformers working on them efficiently. Meta is also using it for non-transformer ml models like Ads. Meta will never train Llama on MTIA, it’s not built for that and the performance can’t compare. The closest competition are Googles TPUs and their performance is still garbage compared to Nvidia. I’m talking like 10x slower inference. But Google is locked in and has already put too much money so they might just stick with it. And I don’t see a universe where Amazon and Meta are using TPUs over Nvidia. So yeah, I think you might want to look deeper into what they mean by custom silicon.

Those companies are making inhouse chips with TSM, in very low volumes, just a few thousand. \n\nAMD and NVDA are high volume customers of TSM, paying for millions of chips to be manufactured. \n\nBundled with Apple, the 3 major customers of TSM are Apple, AMD and Nvidia, they make up 99% of TSMs manufacturing capacity. the other 1% are the other companies you mentioned.\n\nSo for you to claim TSM will outpace AMD/NVDA is an impossibilty.",
