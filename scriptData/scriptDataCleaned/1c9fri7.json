  "selftext": "Despite a massive bull run for bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have lagged significantly.  The halving may be a reminder for spot holders that their asset won't be inflated away, but it's also a warning for miners that their income stream is being cut in half every four years.  If you're new to bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have two sources of revenue: transaction fees, and block rewards.\n\nHistorically, most of the revenue for bitcoin miners has come from the block rewards, ie the new bitcoin being created by the protocol.  The block rewards were cut in half on 4/20, aka the halvening.  Fees don't make much money for miners:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[bitcoin fees as a &#37; of total block rewards](https://preview.redd.it/b0ddnytabtvc1.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=34652730f25848f864830e86404ed0115ff0fb95)\n\nAs you can see, user fees as a percent of miner revenue has been close to zero for most of bitcoin's history.  Since the block subsidy is being cut in half every four years, the future appears grim for the bitcoin miners.  Wall Street rates them holds or sells.  But what's that historically huge spike we just saw on 4/20?  That, my fellow regards, was caused by the *Runes* protocol, which went live along with the halving.\n\nLong story short, Runes is an attempt to bring NFTs to Bitcoin.  Anyone paying attention to crypto at all the past couple years will know the potential mania that might come with this.  It hints that bitcoin could be a long-term threat to Ethereum, something most analysts don't consider, and it's causing a dramatic surge in demand for bitcoin block space right now.\n\nHere's the realtime bitcoin fee data:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[recent bitcoin transaction fees intraday](https://preview.redd.it/optlsmkvctvc1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2fcd990ab19a029c3e45e9c23d84460bcafdd58)\n\nYou can see that fees per block have moved substantially higher post-halving, compared with the previous week, a period that was already showing elevated user fees compared with bitcoin's history.  The demand for bitcoin block space is increasing exponentially, and this bodes well for bitcoin's future.\n\n$MARA Marathon Digital is the market cap leader in bitcoin mining, and has been very profitable as bitcoin has been going up.  EPS of $1.08 in the past year, low debt to equity, all with bitcoin at prices well below current levels.  Meanwhile, US bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful launch in history.  ETFs were just approved in Hong Kong as well.  Bitcoin will be the world's first global money.  Now with Runes, the narrative that the miners will struggle because nobody actually uses bitcoin will take a serious hit.  So you're going to see three things happening simultaneously in the next quarter:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. the bitcoin price is going to rip higher, as high net worth individuals and small companies start allocating assets to bitcoin, following a still-building wave of Wall Street marketing, helped by...\n2. ... the anti-bitcoin narrative that miners can't be profitable long-term and therefore the asset security model is broken takes a big hit, since...\n3. ... demand for block space will be rising significantly, providing a much rosier outlook for the long-term future of bitcoin miners which will lead to ...\n4. ... analyst upgrades, as bitcoin miners will be reporting record earnings due to increased fees and rapidly rising bitcoin price\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWith earnings going up AND P/E multiples widening, the upside potential for $MARA is huge.  Now the cherry on top, the grim outlook for miners has created a significant short interest of 18% of the float, \\~43 million shares short. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n[significant short interest in $MARA](https://preview.redd.it/valuc5yritvc1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92dbbbc19aecdf5f262089436e2f269d30289db)\n\nBetween a new wave of insane bitcoiners FOMO'ing into NFTs at any price, shorts covering, and legitimately increasing revenue and prospects for the company, imo this one is a firecracker set to pop.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ku5xcgxftvc1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=103b63f4428501266aee97297dc8ed681bd824d6",

              "body": "Alright, I'll bite.\n\nThe way it works is that Bitcoin is a container of value. As hashing power goes up, this container becomes bigger. Right now the size of this container is approximately $1 trillion as the cost to produce 1 Bitcoin is around $45,000. And we can only measure this in Dollar, because the Dollar itself has an energy-equivalent. And that's really the only thing that matters. How much energy (work) your Dollar can buy. Now the thing is that the Fed can just change the money supply and hence change the energy-equivalent value of the Dollar.\n\nMiners essentially do the same thing, but without the extra step in between. By adding or removing hashing power, they directly change the size of the value container that Bitcoin can hold. When there's a halving, the size of this container doesn't change. It only changes later, in case there's less demand. Because that will force miners to shut off their unprofitable rigs.\n\nSo why is the reward to fee ratio so important? Because as long as it is low, the demand comes from speculators and not from the real economy.\n\nOK, that's pretty abstract, so let's talk some numbers. If Bitcoin wants to be the world currency, it needs to at least represent M2, which is around $100 trillion. Where would that put Bitcoin in Dollar terms? At around $5 million. But this is not possible right now! Why? Because we need to talk energy. Bitcoin currently uses around 200 TWh of energy per year. A valuation of $5 million would justify a hash rate so high, energy consumption would jump to 17 PWh per year. Which would be 2/3rd of the entire electricity production of the planet. That's not realistic.\n\nThis kind of energy consumption is not justifiable for block rewards. But it is for fee rewards. Because if it's from fees, it represents real economic activity. And this is the important part. This is the regulating system that replaces central banks. That's the link between hashing power and economic activity.\n\nSo what's the end game here? How much power should or would Bitcoin consume, if the vision of the maxis becomes a reality?\n\nHalf. Half of everything. Half of the total output of the economy on Earth. Why just Earth? Because Bitcoin is only planet-scale. It only works for participants that are within a few lightseconds of each other. But that's a different topic.\n\nWhy half? Because that's one of the key fundamentals of actual money. Any entrepreneur would have to decide between either mining Bitcoin or doing something else in the economy. Whichever is more profitable. Like take for example someone having to decide whether to search for gold nuggets in the river versus building a terrace for someone else. The amount of work required to find those gold nuggets is what defines the value of building a terrace. And just like that, the amount of work required to mine Bitcoin is what defines its value in the real economy. That's the thesis.\n\nHow much is the economic output on Earth? If you look at the world energy consumption by primary energy, we're at around 180 PWh annualy right now. Here is where it gets a bit complicated. Because not all energy is equal. But for simplicity's sake, let's say we get around 30% of work out of this primary energy. So our total economic output is 54 PWh/y.\n\nSo in a Bitcoin world, the container size represented by hashing power would also be 54 PWh/y.\n\nSo as you can see, for Bitcoin to work, we will need to keep this container size in balance with the real economy and the actual real growth of the economy. The diminishing block rewards via halving are pushing us towards this equilibrium. This is why the value of Bitcoin will not go to infinity. At least not in energy terms. If it does, it's because the Dollar goes to 0. But then you're not gaining anything anyway.",

Was way undervalued on a hash rate basis and has shown consistent solid growth that will catch them up with the bigger players quickly if the trend continues. Operations and energy costs are managed very well. I’ve been rolling forward some call options slightly above the current price for a little while now. It’s been on a tear lately also based on the AI/HPC rumors after CORZ got their deal with Coreweave. Announcing an actual deal would prob shoot it up. Also I think it could make a great acquisition target given its solid performance and undervaluation. Price targets are starting to be set around $10 now too and since it’s passed $5 it has been getting more higher level attention.",

But the market is not anticipating the potential for the lost revenue of the subsidy halving to be replaced by increased user transaction fees in each block, ie more demand to move bitcoin.  Long-term hodlers use bitcoin as a store of value, but short-term traders may use bitcoin to represent NFTs or other kinds of tokens that want to change hands more frequently.\n\nAlso, it's a little more nuanced than first appears.  The halving cuts the rewards, yes, but this will also knock out the  marginally-profitable competition as well, reducing total hash rate.  So for the best miners, yes, the reduced subsidy hurts, but you also win more blocks since you own a larger percent of the total bitcoin hash rate.  User fees can rise independently of the drop in block subsidies, and we are seeing that happen now.",

Anyone trading bitcoin would have been short into the halving, so the natural longs are not only sustaining the price, but continuing to push it UP defying every expert.

          "body": "It's hard to say.  Results are strong, but they are mainly driven by bitcoin appreciation.  Mining results don't look that great for a quarter when they should be turning a profit.  But $1.26 / share in profits for one quarter is a lot for a company you can buy for $20 / share, especially when the company holds over $6 / share in assets.  That's a juicy PE, and the block space value jump after the halving may give institutional investors more reason to believe this profitability will last or even go up.  The hash rate acquisitions will look brilliant as bitcoin continues to rise, but I'm still looking for that big bitcoin move and / or new use cases to develop that will the value of block space up.  Mara is well-positioned to take advantage if and when it happens.",
