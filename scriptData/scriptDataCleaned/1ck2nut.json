  "selftext": "Newb here, story is below. Tell me how to make money on this, looking to short US steel industry. \n\nCommercial construction general contractor here. Just awarded a multi-million dollar job to a reputable Mexican fabricator. They undercut my favorite (and historically cheapest) guy by 38%, apples to apples. I’ve been doing this for ten years, this has NEVER happened before. A few weeks before a friend/client called me to vet a bid he received from another GC (we did not bid the job), similar situation, different fabricator but Mexican. \n\nI know what you’re thinking… labor? Maybe, but not that much. We’re talking a delta of ~$1M. \n\nThen I see this: \n\nhttps://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/031324-us-senators-introduce-bill-to-reimpose-25-tariff-on-mexican-steel-imports\n\nWhat are the odds Mexico is undercutting by buying Russian steel? \n\nEither way, the US steel industry is about to get ROCKED if the tariff bill fails. Which, it probably will because congress is useless at this point. \n\n\n",
