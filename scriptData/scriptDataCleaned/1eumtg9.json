A crash of 20% to 30% at this point would make 2000-2030 the worst 30 years of stock market growth in history. This does not seem plausible given the growth we have seen and the fact companies are making money hand over fist. This next decade also has India coming online, whose GDP currently grows at 8%. 8 fucking percent with their population is WILD. I expect that number to increase even more. The 1975 to 2000s run up looks absolutely parabolic compared to Today‚Äôs run. The point of this post is this: Stay agile, don‚Äôt be a bull or a bear, let the data guide you because this can go much higher or much lower. If they soft land while we enter an easing cycle you can bet your ass the economy is about to get hotter than it has been in a long time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ylsoe0llc9jd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=810c8ce23751b3bf6f8018e8b2d2071cbba2659c",
