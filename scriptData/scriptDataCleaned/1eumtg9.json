Bears scream “bubble!” constantly so sure, over 100 years they get it right now and then.\n\nI think everybody knows that unless somebody shows a clear route from AI to revenue, and soon, AI-inflated stocks are in a bubble. But identifying which companies will pop, and how far they will fall, and when it will happen is *hard*. It’s easy to just shout “bubble!” but a lot harder to make money as a doom-and-gloom bear.\n\nIt’s also not clear (to me, anyway) that an AI bubble is as widespread and influential as the dotcom bubble. NVIDIA has actual revenue, good fundamentals. If all the hot air companies pop, I’m not sure the S&P will be impacted much. And the greater economy, not at all.",

Stocks didn’t drop because they were overpriced, they dropped because folks who bought them with borrowed yen *had* to sell them, *no matter* the price. That’s why everything dropped, not just high-premium stocks.\n\nAnd the fact that the market fully rebounded within two days suggests that the valuations were actually pretty solid, and easily survived the synthetic shock of lots of big positions unwinding.\n\nThe yen event should give bulls even more confidence IMO.",

A crash of 20% to 30% at this point would make 2000-2030 the worst 30 years of stock market growth in history. This does not seem plausible given the growth we have seen and the fact companies are making money hand over fist. This next decade also has India coming online, whose GDP currently grows at 8%. 8 fucking percent with their population is WILD. I expect that number to increase even more. The 1975 to 2000s run up looks absolutely parabolic compared to Today’s run. The point of this post is this: Stay agile, don’t be a bull or a bear, let the data guide you because this can go much higher or much lower. If they soft land while we enter an easing cycle you can bet your ass the economy is about to get hotter than it has been in a long time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ylsoe0llc9jd1.jpeg?width=828&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=810c8ce23751b3bf6f8018e8b2d2071cbba2659c",
