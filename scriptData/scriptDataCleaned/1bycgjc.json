That mistake has put them in a very precarious position. \n\nIf JPow walked out and said “no cuts” in May, there would be instant capitulation. So he’s continuing to be optimistic while all the other members keep warning that there won’t be as many cuts as initially predicted. The market will slowly price out the chance of a cut in June, July, etc, while JPow keeps trying to calm things down. After the election (depending on where inflation and jobs are at) shit will get real. \n\nMy guess is that the market eventually freaks out and starts to correct after one of these data days, but that could happen in a week or not for multiple months.",
