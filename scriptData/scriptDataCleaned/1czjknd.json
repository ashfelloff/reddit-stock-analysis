  "title": "NVDA 10-1 Stock Split Options Play?",
  "score": 34,
  "selftext": "With NVIDIA’s upcoming 10-1 stock split on the horizon, I’m curious about how the community is planning to approach this event, especially when it comes to stock options.\n\nFor those who have navigated stock splits before, how have you seen options adjusted post-split? Do you think this split will lead to increased option volatility or present some unique trading opportunities?\n\nI’m particularly interested in hearing:\n\n\t1.\tYour strategies for handling current NVDA options positions before and after the split.\n\t2.\tAny specific plays you’re considering with the new, lower-priced options.\n\t3.\tHistorical insights or lessons learned from other major tech stock splits.\n      4.    How options are affected by stock splits (If I buy before what happens? How are IV/greeks affected? Etc.). \n\n\nLooking forward to learning from your experiences and hearing your thoughts on the best ways to play this split. From my understanding the options are split the same way as shares (10/1) but I have no experience in how this affects premiums and pricing. \n\nThanks. \n\n",

Also $130,000\n\nSomeone playing on the upside of the split itself would not buy contracts so far out of the money (this example nearly $250 overpriced today) and would buy options that expire on June 14. The split happens on the 7th after markets close. $1,000 call options or $1,050 expiring 6/14 or 6/21. Which would be post-split, 10 contracts at $100 or $105 per share.\n\nThe best way to play a split assuming retail buyers are the target for the newer and more easily bought shares is to buy options at or near or even in the money depending on the premium, and have them expire not on the date of the split but a date after they start trading at the split price, which is the 11th.\n\nAnd buy them now because depending on demand the price may rise anticipating the split, before the split date. \n\nI traded Iomega 2-1 options when the Zip drive was the big deal and the stock exceeded the expected post split price before the split even happened and was trading at the old price or more the next day, even though there were double the share out after the split.\n\nAlong these lines - Split date Friday. Current Price $100. Long calls $100 expiring 2 weeks after the split. \n\nMonday price $100, T: $105 W: $150 Th: $180, F: post split $105 ($210 pre split). So after the split the price was higher than before despite the shares outstanding having gone up 100%. \n\nEvery split I made money on the frenzy and often sold before the split happened since I doubled my money already.",

You definitely do not want to be long unless you plan on holding until expiry and exercising. If you are long, you may still be able to use the non-standard option for post-split call writes. A good broker should have it coded for your margin requirements that 1 $1000 Call is sufficient to cover 10 $100 post-split calls, but it's not something I have ever tried.\n\nAs far as good buying opportunities, if you can buy them non-standard options, you should have lower break even points for the same dates as their new counterparts. But being able to buy them is a big if. Best way for a normal person is to stay away from the split. Or exit before and re-enter after.\n\nI ended up taking a bit of a haircut by exercising PBR LEAPS a few weeks ago when they did their special dividend. Exercising early to get the dividend was the least bad option. I was on the phone with my broker for a while as they struggled to understand why I wanted to exercise a deep ITM call with like 18 months of time premium on it instead of just selling it. I said ok. See if you can get more selling it than I would exercising. Bid-Ask spread was huge and they couldn't.",
