  "selftext": "4 of last 5 days have been green for SPY, 100 day MA acting as resistance. While SPY could remain flat tomorrow and even possibly go up, I believe we will see a red day before FOMC.\n\nPrice action this afternoon was very interesting. Major tech tickers down but QQQ and SPY were up even with a fake out rug pull mid afternoon.\n\nProvided SPY stays up above $509 (which with after hours and premarket you never know lol) look to enter SPY puts before 11AM if you can especially if it’s hovering around $510.\n\nPrediction is SPY closes tomorrow around $506. Gonna be a good day for puts if you day trade.\n\nObviously NFA. Can’t post positions as I didn’t open one and market closed for options. \n\n$508p will triple and $507 will at least double and you’re welcome and have a nice night!",

To me that suggested it was going to drop today.\n\nI didn’t expect the guess to work so well so soon lol. But I also know that especially on these types of days there is a reversal of this action in between 12:40-1:10pm. So I would anticipate SPY to recover and then fade for the rest of the trading day.\n\nAlso, FOMC is tomorrow.
