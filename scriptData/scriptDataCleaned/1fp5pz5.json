Most plans have a recommended set of investments. I chose to change it slightly and just do a low cost sp index fund and a growth equity fund. I use Schwab for this. The alternatives are pretty similar. You can also do an ira, and if you want to go above and beyond these then you can potentially contribute to a health savings account and have that taken out of your paycheck. Those have extra tax benefits and can be invested like a 401k. \n\nAside from that you can just transfer money into a brokerage account and invest it.\n\nHere are some basics. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/iVP47n7FXFo?si=tdTc6lvkp9JMwQOY\n\nhttps://youtu.be/2u0QgyyHS6U?si=8fL529lhlma6-uMj",

                      "body": "Honestly, brokerage account with VOO will beat 80%+ of personal investors over the long term. But if you know you have the fortitude not to withdraw early at a penalty, putting the money into tax-advantaged (401k or Roth IRA) will ALWAYS be the winning move because ... it's tax advantaged. That's built-in extra $ for you.\n\nSome basic personal finance 101 subreddits might not hurt before checking out FIRE stuff, but ...\n\nHere's the FIRE flowchart: https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/16xymii/fire_flow_chart_version_43/\n\nI wouldn't worry too much about which percentage into which bucket (401k/roth/brokerage) at this stage. Any long term investment into S&P 500, total market, whatevs, will be good enough that the differences at this stage won't matter in the long run. You can optimize further on the way. \n\nMy Roth IRA and brokerage are 100% VTI. \n\nMy 401k does not have VTI or VOO as an option, but does have access to some other very low fee vanguard index funds. For the 401k, I put 70% into an S&P500 equivalent, 20% into an international index, and 10% into bonds. \n\nThis is all pretty \"aggressive\" by Bogle standards (I have very low bonds, very low international), but sort of typical for a lot of the FIRE communities and will definitely out-perform anything I tried to pick myself even in the worst scenarios.\n\nAnd remember, don't pull money out of the market. Check what happens over a 20 year period if you happen to miss the 10 best days during that entire two decade run: https://i.redd.it/6xzmz7kmrecd1.png\nNote that 7 of the best days were during a bear market.\n\nEdit for funsies: As for what total percentage to save? No one can tell you that. Work backwards from your optimal (realistic) yearly spending. Once you have saved 25x your yearly spending, you can think about retirement. Do you want to retire and have $120k per year? Save and invest until you have 3 million. Withdraw 4% per year. Adjusting that $% down in bear markets maybe, but eh, you'll be fine in most scenarios (plus social security will kick in...).",

HAZAH I'll buy calls.\" Only to fall on your face have a panic stomach ache. Not have any conviction. Dumping for a loss only to see the underlying index go up after you sell. Tale as old as time. The fact is you're not informed, you're not doing research, you're not using data to drive decisions. You're just guessing and with options people make the mistake of thinking it's a binary decision. Stock goes up or down and either calls or puts will pay. Seems like a 50/50 shot but the truth is the probability for success has so many factors that the chances are way less than 50%. I'm not being mean. I'm being honest and it sounds like you're at a point where honesty is what you need. You're not a trader. Stop picking stocks. Stop looking to 10x. Other people's big wins are no different than walking by a casino and seeing people winning money. You're being tempted by a lie and the game is rigged to make you think \"Look at all those happy people having fun and winning money, all I have to do is play and I'll be like one of them\". Stop. Buy index funds. It's zero stress, zero skill, guaranteed gains. If we've learned the first lesson of investing we know it's not timing the market. It's time in the market. Good luck.",

I know it's tempting to want to get a lot of money quickly with riskier investments but unfortunately investment just isn't an income stream unless you have a LOT of money saved up. As long as you're at bare minimum beating inflation every year, you can be fine with where you're at. Seeing people make ridiculous amounts of money every now and then on this subreddit can lead to bad decisions. \n\nWhat I'm getting at is if you want to make 2 million with 85k, bust your ass and use that money to start a business. If you want to grow your money with investment, don't EXPECT to make more than the s&p yearly (even if you do sometimes) because that's the best that most people are getting. If you want to do risky options, you might as well hit a casino because that means that you're willing to take the risk of losing the money you put in. \n\nI think if you stop thinking of your investments as a way to get rich quick or to beat the system and live your dream life and just see it as a number you want to grow at least over inflation, you'll be okay long term.",
