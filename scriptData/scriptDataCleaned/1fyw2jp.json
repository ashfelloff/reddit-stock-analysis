'Cause they'll be able to design better analog computers. They'll be much, much more intelligent than people ever were. And we're just a passing stage in the evolution of intelligence. That's my best guess. And I hope I'm wrong. But that's sort of a depressing message to close on. A little bit depressing.\"",
