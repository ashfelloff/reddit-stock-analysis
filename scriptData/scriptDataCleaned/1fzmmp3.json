  "selftext": "I know Nike got a new CEO and people think he will turn things around. But why would anyone buy Nike when you can buy Google? \n\nNike's operating margin is 11.8% v googles 29.8%\n\nNike's forward p/e 29 v Google 18.5\n\nNike free cash flow $7 billion v googles $60 billion\n\nNike can never dream of having margins close to Google's and arguably sneakers are harder to sell than ads in a recession. It's harder for Nike to cut costs. Etc. \n\nIs there a an argument why Nike is a better buy than Google at current prices?\n",

      "body": "Much like most investing it’s not so much that Google is overall a better company but the potential for Nike to swing back and make greater returns in the short run are marginally higher. \n\nThat said Nikes sitting near its pre-Covid price, hired a new CEO, brought back some designers from their SNKRs heyday (~2016). There’s potential for it to go on a run again as they get their creative spirit back. However that includes spending again in R&D which never looks good on a balance sheet. \n\nThe sentiment is that Nike is down right now and has the potential to run with new leadership. Googles sentiment is that it’s currently a bit stagnant in terms of product line and currently under some anti-trust scrutiny.",
