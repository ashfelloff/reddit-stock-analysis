This addiction was fairly minimal in 2004 but in 2014 it was significantly higher and today in 2024 even higher. In 2034 it will be astronomical in terms of time spent online, number of devices online, volume of data used, number of people using devices that are online, Internet of Things usage the whole damn lot.\n\nMNO are supplying the addiction and the addiction aint going anywhere lol. The addicts sorry customers are going to pay the MNO whatever it costs and the MNO will pay ASTS. To what extent ASTS will be profitable I dont know but like I said the business model is inevitable‚Ä¶its the next big thing IMO.\n\nOne more thing, it‚Äôs almost guaranteed that the US DoD are all over this tech.
