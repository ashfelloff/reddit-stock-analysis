      "body": "For someone who can not read the external link(https://money.udn.com/money/amp/story/5640/8195464), copy and paste the English version from Google translator:\n\nSupermicro pointed out that the delay in the 10-K annual report for the 2024 fiscal year is mainly due to the change of the accounting firm appointed by the company and the delay in the SEC's request for supplementary documents due to the handover of the work. It is not an accounting operation and is expected to be submitted for the 2024 fiscal year before mid-September. 10-K Annual Report.\n\nThe manipulation of accounting reports was an allegation made by former employee Bob Luong. However, Supermicro filed a lawsuit against this employee in April this year. It is currently in the legal process and it is difficult to explain. In addition, in August 2020, after being accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of improperly embellishment of financial report numbers, Supermicro was fined US$17.5 million. After paying the fine, Supermicro hired back three senior executives directly involved in the case. This is partly true. , but they are all in compliance with local laws in the United States, and have also been licensed and announced by the SEC. For example, one of the founders, Liao Yixian, was rehired as a consultant in May 2021, and was approved by the shareholders' meeting to join the board of directors again in December 2023, [and was licensed by the SEC. and announcements](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001375365/50938d42-4aac-4346-b541-99b585f92a3d.html) .\n\nSupermicro had abnormal capital transactions with Taiwanese companies Daxun and Ken Micro, and paid US$983.1 million. The content has been recognized in the 10-K financial statement on June 30, 2023. Except for abnormal capital transactions, Daxun Liang Jianfa, the CEO and largest shareholder of Daxun, is the brother of Liang Jianhou, the founder and CEO of Supermicro, and Liang Jianhou and his wife (Director of Supermicro) own 10.5% of Daxun shares; in addition, the founder of Supermicro The Liao Yixian family, one of them, also owns 11.7% of Daxun shares.\n\nKenway, which was founded in 2004, according to the company's 2023 10-K annual report, the CEO is Liang Jianda, who is also Liang Jianhou's brother. Therefore, Supermicro, Daxun and Kenwei are investment partner companies, and [the relevant content was published earlier in SEC documents in 2009](https://ir.supermicro.com/financials/sec-filings/sec-filings-details/default.aspx?FilingId=16892625) .\n\nSupermicro emphasized that it deeply regrets that the recent turmoil has caused trouble to partners and investors. Many of the contents were announced many years ago, but have been distorted by malicious parties. In order to defend the company's reputation, any false accusations will be directly prosecuted from now on. If the rights and interests of shareholders and employees are affected, the company will resort to legal action.",

Why not state what these “other matters” are, unless there’s something far more dubious and sinister going on at the company as Hidenburg outlined in its short report. The disclosed and undisclosed related party transactions and relationships are a MAJOR RED FLAG as this provides the perfect cover for accounting and financial fraud. Can’t imagine any auditor signing off on SMCI’s financials until a thorough investigation is performed of these related parties, which is going to take a lot longer than 15 days. \nI’m guessing that these “other matters” are likely",
