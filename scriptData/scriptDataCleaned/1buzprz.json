  "score": 207,
  "selftext": "Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell doubled down Wednesday on his belief that inflation was on a \"bumpy\" path down to 2% and that central bank officials expect to lower rates at \"some point\" this year.\n\nPowell also once again asserted that the Fed would maintain its independence during this red-hot election year, noting that its analysis is free from any \"personal or political bias.\"\n\nHis comments about inflation marked the second time in the last week that Powell offered assurances that the overall outlook had not changed much despite some hotter-than-expected readings at the start of the year.\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/powell-still-expects-fed-to-lower-rates-this-year-as-inflation-follows-a-bumpy-path-down-to-2-161044483.html",

          "body": "Powell said it at Stanford; the rate cuts are a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy. He’s extremely vaguely dovish because he knows that, if he gives hints towards rate hikes, the prospect of a rate cut becomes less and less realistic. His vagueness is intentional, it’s necessary. I’m trying not to pick out little inconsistencies in what he’s saying because I feel like it may be convoluting when the message is so clear.\n\nI think it’s less that the market is ignoring the potential for rate hikes and moreso that it’s really just not realistic to expect it at this point. You see little scares here and there, troughs forming when we look at data that doesn’t line with a dovish approach, but then Powell gets in front of a mic and says the same stuff as last time. Problem solved.\n\nTelling us that the data is not out of line when it is out of line is simply a necessary act for getting it back in line. \n\nCould also be ai girlfriends.\n\nEDIT: Kashkari just has to go and make me look like an idiot",
