  "selftext": "Wanted some encouragement this week, so checked the dollar figure today on this. As it stands ~18k->$200k. I’ve taken profits along the way, in this account by rolling up and out and flat out selling ten contracts. Also sold almost all in baby account and Roth.\n\nI have done four successive YOLOs: NVDA then profits into MSTR then profits into ASTS and recently, profits into AUR (still building.) I’ve kept the base in each. (NVDA is the laggard!)\n\nThat’s most of this year’s crazy gains, but also got lucky on random tickers (KYVO, CERE, LNTH,) and until this past week, consistent gains on SPY and NVDA options (mostly calls - I think wrong on puts and get notes about naked positions from my broker - seems I’ve “level 4 options, or whatever.” (More or less sic 1ronyman.)",

          "body": "It is similar reasoning to my others. Emergent first leader, competition fading and nearly nonexistent now, amazing tech, narrow focus that may scale well, brilliant founder and ceo, on track with a business plan to be profitable by 2027, commercialization late 2024, great partnerships and institutional interest, etc. I’ve actually shared my thoughts on this, but perhaps need to be more concise. (I don’t intend to be directive!)\n\nOverall, as with the others, I’d rather be early than plain wrong. That’s worked well in this bull market (building a safer base with profits these days.) And when share price is $3, I can afford to be wrong a long while (actually, like I *seriously* don’t encourage anyone to invest, just yet, haha.) Also, if thesis changes, so do I, and I’ve only an allocation to 90+DTE to possibly and fully lose (um, on these, and some shorter dated, other larks are dying but “…there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow,” and I learn.) Unless they fail. All of them, at once, I’ll be back ahead more than 10% on the year, unless we’ve a -450% correction, in which case I am guessing that I will find succor in other means of survival.) Though they balance each other quite well this year, I’d not recommend this as a retirement plan as is. (Working on that, like you indexes, bonds and dividends …and am so confused.)",
