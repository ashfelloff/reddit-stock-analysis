  "selftext": "Tesla P/E is something like 75, vs ford which is 5. The justification is that tesla is a growth stock with amazing potential.\n\nYesterday results shows revenue growth has dramatically slowed. It's nots a growth stock anymore!\n\nYes profit was up, but that was down to cost cutting and interest rates / exchange rates etc. These can only be cut so much, tesla need to keep growing dramatically for it to justify the 75 p/e.\n\nAll this talk about robo taxi, robots etc. I'll believe it when I see it, and even then, they're not schedule until 2027.\n\n  \nedit: In fact, without the $739 million in automotive regulatory credit, income would also have been down.

Spending resources on a niche vehicle that can't be sold in most overseas markets takes focus away from your core business. Same goes for robot puppets and Semis that are so heavy they can only deliver potato chips.\n\nThis upgrade comes after Tesla had to drop prices due to competition. What if they had been able to prevent those price drops by having an upgraded model two years earlier? Maybe their market share would still be number one in the world.\n\nIt's not even that building an EV truck was a bad idea.

Look at energy generation - literally exponential growth. Likely to continue to increase dramatically as data center power requirements continue to rise. Heck, just look at all the tech companies literally buying nuclear reactors. And the margins on that part of the business is through the roof\n2. Most auto manufacturers are scaling back BEV production/expansion (even most of the ones who are increasing EV sales don't make enough to hit emission goals). This will lower their ability to hit emission targets without buying credits from TSLA. Those credits are literally pure profit. So, it's almost like double dipping. Other manufacturers sell less cars, TSLA sells more - thus TSLA earns more credits that it can sell.\n\n[Tesla Hits Record High Sales from Carbon Credits at $1.79B](https://carboncredits.com/tesla-hits-record-high-sales-from-carbon-credits-at-1-79b/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ffcm364xbwwd1.png?width=564&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd4bc13c7928f476d7d4161c117bc40594bab49a\n\nThe problem with TSLA analysis on WSB is that it is colored by emotion.

Amazon makes a significant amount of revenue from selling stuff. But a disproportionate amount of profit is from the cloud services. In fact, I remember reading a few years ago that AMZN lost money for 10+ years on all their product sales and used cloud profit to subsidize and keep the business running. As noted below - AWS is 16% of revenue but 75% of profit.\n\n\\---  \n\"In the first three quarters of 2023, AWS delivered [operating income](https://www.fool.com/terms/n/net-operating-income/) of $17.4 billion. By comparison, North American and international sales combined generated operating income of just $6.1 billion.\n\nRemember, AWS revenue only accounts for 16.1% of Amazon's total revenue, yet it was responsible for a whopping 74% of the entire company's operating income.\"",

Tesla, like it or not, has been one of the very few companies to actually change the world and propel it into the future. It’s not just a fucking car company. If it were then other car companies would be able to compete with them which they are but after 100+ years of being in the auto manufacturing industry no legacy auto company could even conceive of doing what Tesla did and still can’t formidably take a solid position as a front runner to compete with Tesla. \n\nI dont know why everyone on Reddit is so dumb and blind to the fact that they embark on things that don’t exist and literally bring them into existence. The revenue from their robotics and energy storage ventures will eventually surpass their auto revenue. Whether you believe it or not is irrelevant because they’ve already done something like create the market for EVs. So history says they’ll be able to do this again in the future. \n\nLook at fkn starlink, spacex, neuralink everything these are all doing is on the cutting edge of tech and pushing society forward into a future we can convince of. Stop being regards and embrace a company that is going to usher in the next future your dinosaurs ford and GM couldn’t even dream of in their labs.",
