So companies like Alibaba use what’s know as Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) to get around it. \n\nWhat is a VIE? Basically it is a shell company (think Cayman Islands) that is set up, and contractually is given specific controlling rights to the actual company. When Alibaba pays a dividend, the VIE is who gets paid. \n\nWhen you invest in Alibaba, you are ACTUALLY buying shares in the VIE, NOT the actual company. \n\nSo in short…your Alibaba ADR shares do NOT represent an ownership interest in Alibaba.\n\nThe Chinese government actually does NOT recognize VIEs. They were left out entirely of the FIL you mention. If they ever DO want to recognize VIEs, what do you think the chances are it will go in your favor? And what do you think the chances are of you winning a legal battle….in CHINA….to get your money back?\n\nAnd finally…you have no clue what you’re talking about so stop pretending you do.",
