I know lots of business/econ/finance/management majors that didn't amount to much. Those that did where either very hard working, very talented, very rich already, and/or very well connected.\n\nMost folks who don't know that \"\"\"can't believe\"\"\" that biz majors can get paid to fire folks because it sounds easy. And in reality it isn't all that hard unless you want to be good at it (however most aren't paid to be good so much as passable), but one does not simply land that job just by doing 4 years of college at a shit school. Much more likely if you got into a top 50 uni where your best bro in the frat who you saved from alcohol poisoning a few times and covered for him when he did border line illegal shit happens to have a dad who is a senior VP at McKinsey & Company.",

Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",
