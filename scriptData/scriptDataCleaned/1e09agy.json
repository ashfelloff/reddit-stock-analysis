  "selftext": "I have made amazing returns with putting the majority of my money in VOO but I fear that it will take a downfall soon. How would you hedge your position against such a downfall. I have a 40%+ return and it's peaked so much. About 60% of my portfolio is in it. I was curious if I should move my money into anything that would be a hedge that there will be a downfall eventually? \n\nEdit:\nWhat I learned is to just stay in VOO and if something happens in the long run it’ll weather any potential storm. \n\nI appreciate all the interesting strategies though! It will give me a lot to research regardless to understand some of the potential things you could do. ",

People don't really seem to get that if something as big as that crumbles completely, it means dollars have no use anymore either, which means it doesn't matter what you invested in because if it's not physical, it's worth 0. Case in point: currency resets we've seen over the past decade after hyperinflation. In the meantime, USD is inflationary by nature, such that there will always be more next week than there was this week. This, by default, means prices of everything (thus companies and stocks) go up over time. It's literally what USD is designed for.",

You just keep everything in there, reinvest your dividends and buy into the “eventual decline” whenever it happens. You’ll probably notice that unless you time it perfectly, you’re way better off just buying all the time, and being even more aggressive during recessions. \n\nIf you had tried to hedge at any point during the run from 2008 to 2021, you would have missed out on huge gains- the market more than 6x’d excluding dividends. The recession in 2022 didn’t even touch pre-pandemic lows. If you just kept buying through 2022, everything you bought is up 20-40%. \n\nIt’s not sexy, but for the vast majority of people, buying as much as you can of a broad market index is going to be your best bet. If you want to be more aggressive, buy some sector specific ETFs or something. An information tech ETF like VGT which holds a lot of the big tech companies has doubled in the last 2yrs. A bit more risk, a bit more reward. But just avoid trying to time anything. You’ll probably be wrong. Even if you’re right, there’s a good chance you will have left money on the table unless you timed it perfectly. And the risk that you miss out on gains that set you up for compounding interest long term is too high. \n\nRemember, the market is almost always at all time highs. Don’t let buying at all time highs scare you on broad market indexes. There hasn’t been a single 12month period since the inception of VOO where it didn’t hit an all time high.",
