Rather bullish to the industry, and reassuring to the general public in tone based on the FAA teaser video i watched, but was an expected release in OCT none the less. Still not a permanent SP changing revelation yet, IMO.\n\nMight be advisable to wait a week or so for FOMO investors to spend. Maybe longer if investment funds want to build DCA position. They appear to cause a sizable green candle in the morning then back off. Hopefully NOV 2nd FUD kicks in to assist bullish retail.\n\nBut I'm definitely not selling CC's anymore.\n\nNow there's a clear path to certification. eVTOL will be a thing without a doubt. I do expect to see a lot more MSM coverage in the future. The cat is getting out of the bag.",
