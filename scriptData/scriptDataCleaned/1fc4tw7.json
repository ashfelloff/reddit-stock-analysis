The scary part for many is that everyone thought that AI would only be replacing low-level workers, but if there's profit/savings to be made at any level, it will happen.  It's the honest truth of life and business.  We've publicly known this was coming since roughly 2015ish... and here we are!  If you ignored the warning siren that's been going off for almost a decade then, don't act surprised when the tsunami hits.\n\nOh yeah, and I loaded up on Nvidia years ago.  Fact is, they make the best products in their field, and have been the leaders for a LONG time.  Remember when new computers started having the Nvidia sticker on then instead of \"Intel Inside\"?  That was a shift to keep an eye on.",

My reason for buying was that I knew the demand for the chips was huge and probably even bigger than what has already been priced in.  The big run-up was, at least largely, in the absence of useful, profitable applications for AI.  So now the bet is whether those will come or not.  I admit I was skeptical about a year ago.  Now I think yes, they will.  This is kind of a silly example, but I went through a drive-through the other week and AI took my order.  This is such a good idea, in my opinion.  The employees can just work on making orders and not have to mess around with taking them.  And the experience was decent.  It got everything right and was at least as pleasant as ordering from a human.  That was never anywhere near my radar as a possible use for AI.  So I'm betting there's more.\n\nThe next big phase, if there is one, will be from AI applications gaining traction.  Then possibly every AI app will be overvalued and we can get a proper bubble going.  edit - in my opinion, for us to even have a noteworthy AI bubble, NVDA has to grow more.",

In fact, the kind of rampant pessimism we have right now is usually a trigger for me to start thinking things might turn around soon (a tip straight from One Up on Wall Street.)

Everyone expects you to participate and lead in this area so you have to and you have to believe it‚Äôs for real.\n\nBut the problem is that the companies that should be buying the products that AI enables aren‚Äôt. And they aren‚Äôt because those products aren‚Äôt actually generating new business or cutting costs. Most aren‚Äôt even using them. What is being termed AI is a one trick pony that has a very narrow use case which is ingesting random text and making statistical inferences about what is being said and spitting back a summary.\n\nI‚Äôm very bearish on nvda. Not only do I not believe the AI hype or that nvda is going back to ATHs I actually think the end result of this build out is going to be a supply overhang that will probably take a decade to work off and if that happens there‚Äôs a chance it could go sub $20 eventually. The path there is pretty clear where AI just has to not live up to the hype whereas to get to $10 trillion or whatever the other person said a million things have to go right which would be great but won‚Äôt happen.
