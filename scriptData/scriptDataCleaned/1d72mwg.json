  "title": "After 4 years of investing into single stocks: it’s not about financial education but all about psychology and luck ",
  "score": 450,
  "selftext": "In early 2020, at age 21,  I started to invest in the stock market by picking single stocks that I analysed through  thorough due diligence (mostly fundamental). During that time I just finished my bachelors degree in International Business and now I am on the verge of finishing my masters degree in Finance & Banking. Since I was 15-16 years old I always had an interest in the stock market and finance topics in general. Also I always considered myself to be really good with mathematical and statistical concepts, so all in all I thought that I must have an edge on the „regular“ investor in terms of not necessarily being better of just putting my money into index funds. \n\nNow after 4 years of investing I realised that I was wrong and the typical advice to just invest into an s&p500 or world etf applies to me as well. Over the 4 years I can account for returns around 22% on my portfolio (not per year but over the whole time span), massively underperforming S&P return during the same timespan. So, on the first of January I started to reallocate my funds by investment a fixed amount into an vanguard s&p500 and all world etf bi-monthly and I couldn’t be happier with my decision. \n\nHalf a year into implementing the strategy shift, I already accumulated a 4-5% return on those etfs and didn’t stress a bit along the way. No reading financial statements and listening to earnings calls for hours. No spreadsheet nightmares, no waking up and checking the market every hour till I go to sleep. \n\nSo yeah I know, what I realised is what everybody keeps preaching since the early days of investing but I had to experience it myself and get humbled to know for myself. Even though I have the knowledge when it comes to finance, mathematics, statistics etc. it seems like this is just the barrier to entry. From that point onwards buying and selling single stocks is 90% and mental game as well as some necessary luck. So a lot of the times I picked the right stocks but failed to stick to simple investment rules, and human biases got the better of me. I kept stocks that underperformed in hopes of getting back in the green And sold of stocks I believed in just to realise gains (e.g. selling Nvidia at 160 bc I already doubled the initial investment) \n\nI hope someone reading this may benefit from hearing my investment history and reflects on if picking single stocks is really worth it 🙏🏼\n\nEDIT: \n\nIt’s crazy how one single post which is just summarising my personal experience got the people of this sub visibly divided into 2 camps:\nThe first consisting of people who agree and/or congratulate me to my personal realisation. The second being people who feel the need to flame me for my experience, decisions, educational background etc.\n\nSo just to make it clear:\n\n\nNO, I’m not thinking that I know a lot about stock market mechanisms! In fact, over the past 4\nYears I gradually became more and more aware of the fact that, for me, learning all about it is not worth it. \n\nNO, I wasn’t trying to generalise or say that picking stocks is a bad choice no matter the person. \n\nYES, I was just talking about myself, and the fact the I, as a person, am prone to human biases and that psychological errors led me to screw up good investments\n\nYES, I believe there are tons of people who are capable of beating the market, it’s just not for everyone \n\n\n\n",

His Medallion fund had 66 percent average annual returns for decades. Mr. Simons, the prizewinning mathematician who abandoned a stellar academic career, then plunged into finance — a world he knew nothing about — and became one of the most successful Wall Street investors ever.\n\nAfter publishing breakthrough studies in mathematics that would play a seminal role in quantum field theory, string theory and condensed matter physics, Mr. Simons decided to apply his genius to a more prosaic subject — making as much money as he could in as short a time as possible.\n\nMr. Simons’ tenure on Wall Street is an unbelievable story of a secretive mathematician who pioneered the era of algorithmic trading - and made $23 billion doing it. Mr. Simons has been hailed as the greatest money maker in modern financial history. No other investor - Warren Buffett, Peter Lynch, Ray Dalio, Steve Cohen, or George Soros - has even come close to touching Jim Simons’ stellar investment return record. Since 1988, Renaissance’s signature Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66 percent. The firm has earned profits of more than $100 billion, and upon his passing, Simons left a legacy of investors who use his mathematical, and computer-oriented approach to trading and building wealth.",

I was hit harder during the downturns, but also earned more during the upswings.  Psychologically it can be nerve wrecking and off course not everything I touch turns into gold so you do have to learn when to cut your losses, but you also have to be able to identify when to double down. This is not easy and I realize it carries a higher risk, but I am ok with that. My strategy is mostly to try and pickup macro trends before they are fully playing out and then thoroughly analyze companies in the field and pick 2-3 potential winners. I have learned to be patient, it really takes time for most big changes to take place, I am usually a few years too early, most of my investments do not show any substantial growth for the first few years. \n\nI also review my investments regularly to see if I would still invest in them today, and then if I have money available I will add more. I also rebalance my portfolio regularly to lower the risk and have build up a diversified portfolio in different market segments and asset classes. \n\nDid I just get lucky? Well I think I definitely got lucky with the timeframe in which I have been investing. In the past 17 years we have seen a very long bull run (2009-2020) and the biggest part of my money was invested within this period of time. \n\nSo just wanted to say that investing in the market index is a great strategy, but it is not the only possible winning strategy.

Maybe in 10 years hydrogen will be like the gasoline now, and you would wish you bought APD today and not NVDA. There could be massive water related issues in the years ahead and AWK/AWR to outperform MSFT. The same case can be made in any other field. We are at wired point in time where tech is dragging the entire market up and everything else is pretty much guaranteed to under perform. Yes this can carry on for a long time, but not forever. I'm 100% in single stocks with 35% of them being in EU, and more - I do not own a single tech related stock. I'm under spy for last two years but I'm happy with my picks and I'm confident in the long term prospects.

(I didn't pay attention to markets for all of 2023 because I was doing other things, like renovating a house, and so lost money).\n\nI think the issue is that most people ignore geopolitics. Geopolitics accounts for a lot of the unexpected gains/losses in the past few years. \n\nThere are many market-transforming geopolitical events, such as the oil price wars. In 1-2 years, Biden and the ESG left went from concerted efforts to shut down oil production by divesting from oil companies and starving oil majors of capital, to pushing the US to being at the top of the oil & gas producers globally. They did this because the divestiture from oil majors and starving them of capital was leading to spiraling energy costs, which is the natural result of starving supply. But once inflation got out of hand, the US started pumping oil & gas like crazy to bring prices down. \n\nThe US was even dramatically dumping oil out of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2022-2023, which broke the oil market and depressed energy prices. Then it spent the next couple of years ramping up to be a top oil producer. [Now, the Biden Administration is trying to prosecute oil executives for not producing enough oil, blaming them, instead of the ESG movement, for low capital investment in energy production](https://www.wsj.com/business/energy-oil/ftc-says-ex-pioneer-ceo-tried-to-collude-with-opec-on-oil-prices-27edf5bd). It's as if the ESG movement to divest from energy producers never happened at all and it was all just an acid trip. \n\nThis is a 180 degree turnaround in politically-backed ESG investing agendas that the industrials couldn't have anticipated, without paying attention to politics. \n\nThe semiconductor trade war, for example, has transformed the S&P 500, as we have all seen this year. And before then, starting in 2019, there was the tech trade war vs China where the US went to take down Huawei, which greatly benefitted Apple and US communications tech companies for a few years.\n\nThe truth is, most of the unexpected gains and losses in investing now are due to geopolitics. You must follow politics and factor in government agendas and foreign policy into market analysis. \n\nThis is where Michael Burry often screws up. His picks are great, but he doesn't take politics into account, so that his timing is way off.\n\nClassic economic and market analysis is no longer enough.",
