  "selftext": "I am the half-regarded grandson of dear Nana. My brother, u/Sad_Nefariousness10 infamously bought 23k INTC shares for $30.45 before the last earnings and he lost hundreds of thousands of Nana's inheritance in minutes. Luckily, it took me a few days to figure out how to use my computer's internet explorer, so Intel was in 19s before I could start loading my bags. I have now increased my original position from half the size of my brother's 23k share count to over 15k shares. There are a lot of news hit pieces on INTC this week; it seems Grand Papa might be pissed at Nana. It is only fitting that this momentous day is to occur on Halloween, for Nana. This should be their worst, most bloodiest earnings ever.\n\nI am ready for this next bloody battle of INTC earnings this All Hallows Eve. Are you?\n\nLettuce prey Pat gives us Shrek's green raging phallic candle today!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nxtdvw163yd1.png?width=357&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2e5ddd27d1d1a773694b16a477a079998b39a21\n\n",
