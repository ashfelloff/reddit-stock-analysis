      "body": "(Bloomberg) — Tesla Inc. (TSLA) suffered a 24.2% year-on-year fall in shipments from its factory in Shanghai, marking the fourth time this year output has fallen for the electric car leader amid a price war in China.\n\nDeliveries of Tesla Model 3 and Model Y cars declined to 71,007 units in June, according to Bloomberg calculations based on preliminary data released by China’s Passenger Car Association on Tuesday. Shipments were down 2.2% on May.\n\nThe drop comes ahead of closely watched global second-quarter production and delivery figures for Tesla, due later on Tuesday in the US. The lower output in China, the world’s biggest EV market, will add to the strain Elon Musk’s company is under worldwide as EV sales growth slows.\n\nAnalysts project Tesla will hand over 439,302 EVs in the second quarter, marking a 5.8% drop from a year ago and a second consecutive quarterly decline.\n\nMore broadly, new-energy vehicle sales in China are expected to rise 28% last month from June 2023, the preliminary PCA data show, as subsidies unveiled in April for trade-in cars gradually came into effect.\n\nTotal shipments of new-energy cars were projected to reach 970,000 units in June, an increase of 8% from the month prior.\n\nMy $70 Friday 7-5 $200 puts will print ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4267)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)",
