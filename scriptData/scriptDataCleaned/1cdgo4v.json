  "selftext": "Energy materials scientist here. I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nEnovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.\n\n# Financials and stonk mommy moves:\n\n* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say \"bankruptcy,\" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.\n* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.\n* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.\n* **Manufacturing muscle**: They’re expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.\n* **Strategic alliances**: They’ve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.\n\n# Tech specs and market hype:\n\n* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.\n* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there’s a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.\n\n# Bottom Line:\n\nEnovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It’s a textbook high-risk, high-reward play. They could be the garden gnome that wins the Iron Throne that tech investors have been praying for to lead the next big wave in battery technology. Or, they could go down in flames as a cautionary tale of overreach and under-delivery. Personally, I'm bullish and have shares and calls.\n\nThis is not financial advice -- I am only a primate in the sense that I boof bananas.",

      "body": "I'm torn on this one.  It went public through a SPAC like many garbage companies that I have little regard for, but I think there's really something here.\n\nYes, the Malaysia Fab will be operational soon, but there is always a ramp with new factories, as well as long customer qualification times of new products (even if they've already tested the product in small batches, they'll probably have to re-qualify material coming from the new fab).  Don't expect real revenue out of it for a while yet (probably end of the year or early 25).\n\nThe bump in revenue towards the end of last year is almost entirely from their acquisition of Korean cell manufacturer RouteJade.  This was a good strategic acquisition, since it guarantees electrode coating and packaging capacity, something Enovix previously outsourced.  It also comes with RouteJade's existing customers, which could be a serious boon for Enovix in the early stages of breaking into the market.  Not to mention RouteJade is actually making money selling plain old lithium ion cells, not burning it on R&D for next gen silicon anode cells.\n\nAll that being said, I don't think there's any competition really even close to leaving the lab in this space (despite lots of marketing fluff to the contrary), let alone dumping lots of money into ramping a high volume fab.  I could be wrong about this though, things move fast and I might not be up to speed.\n\nOverall, I think the stock is undervalued where it is and will probably shoot up by the end of the year.  Whether this earnings is a good entry point or not is up in the air, but if you want to take a gamble on this technology, I think this is the right company to bet on.",

      "body": "I follow Enovix very, very closely. I hold a large number of shares and calls (my position is more than 100x yours)\n\nThe -$214 million in 2023 is entirely from setting up fab-2 in malaysia and buying their first production line which is in FAT (factory acceptance testing) and is currently moving its way through zone 3. Zone 3 is the hardest part of production since that's where all the silicon anode production and stacking takes place. Given that they recently also stood up an agility line (a line that is built for producing battery samples and not for high volume production) and that agility line passed FAT, now it just needs to go through SAT (site acceptance testing) for the line to be fully operational. The Agility line passed FAT, so it seems likely the high volume line will pass FAT too, but that work is not quite done yet.\n\nThe $190M in debt is $150M in equity that is a part of a share offering that hits the books like debt that they did last year. Plus $40-50M in operational costs they incurred to set up the initial line in Malaysia.\n\nThe eventual goal isn't to move into EVs. The eventual goal is to create JVs (joint ventures) with other battery suppliers to get them to switch to producing ENVX batteries. The regular jelly roll batteries we're used to and ENVX batteries can be done with a swap out of parts in zone 3 and the jelly roll batteries can be changed into ENVX batteries for which ENVX can take a cut. That's way more profitable than trying to stand up their own lines to sell low margin EV batteries. EV batteries are in the future, but the profit margin is much better on consumer electronic batteries.\n\n  \nAnyway, I hope that answers a few things for you. Hugely bullish on my side.",

TJ Rodgers, the legendary CEO and founder of Cypress Semi and a big investor who made a fortune on ENPH, helped bring them to the market as a SPAC.

You can make good acquisition to smooth out your logistics, which is how companies like Samsung Electronics operate.\n\nBut buying up a Lithium-ion manufacturer, to sell Lithium-ion batteries, which are **OVERSATURATED**  in the market, is not why OP thinks the stock will balloon.\n\nWe're analyzing how likely it would be for Enovix ( new comer, led by SoC designers) , to develop a new battery chemistry that can compete/exceed existing battery solutions, AND scale the new battery manufacturing process to the point where it is profitable.\n\nFrom an electronics perspective (that is to say EE/CE), yes batteries are not complicated. However from a Chemistry, Chemical Engineering or Materials Science/Engineering perspective, that could just not be further from the truth. At a fundamental Chemistry and Physics level, the challenges we deal with are: resource scarcity (how prevalent the minerals are naturally on the planet) , dendrites, charge density and mass.\n\nWe've had a decade of Research in battery chemistry like graphene which meets some of the criteria above to replace Lithium. But then it turned out that graphene is just complicated to scale because of intrinsic material properties (like brittleness) and their manufacturing process was too costly due to poor yields.\n\nPoint being, assuming Enovix either found a Chemical compound that exceeds Lithium-ion based batteries, or they use someone else's research and only focus on Logistics, there is no guarantee they will scale given your \"supporting\" evidence.",
