A lot of companies lost a shit load of money in the millions and on the PC front a lot of people feel very burned by Intel because of this. \n\nThey are going to have a shit load of trouble selling their old 13th and 14th gen stock of chi\nPs even after the code fix. A lot of people arenâ€™t going to fully trust it and why bother when you can just go AMD instead and not have to worry about any possibility of their chips dying. \n\n- Datacenter they are continuing to lose their asses in. 10% margin with revenue dropping while everyone else is gaining is not a good look. \n\n- Any market shift CCG (laptops and chips people put in PCâ€™s) will get them killed. They are either going to have to make an extreme discount on 13th gen and 14th gen chips or they going to be screwed. Either way it seems they will be screwed \n\n- Thereâ€™s a bunch of lawsuits coming down the pipeline because of this \n\n- They just stopped or cut production on multiple fabs. At a certain point this makes the whole fab vision bullshit. \n\n- Getting customers in their fab after they fucked up their on chip design will be certainly a real head scratcher \n\n- Mobileye and their other investments continue to fall in value. Selling off an asset that has lost 50% of its value is just not great.  \n\n- Their market cap is trading around 84 billion. They have like 20 billion in cash on hand and 52.5 billion in debt. The debt continues to grow every quarter. \n\n- Intel could drop even further and probably will. A 15-20% downswing could get their credit cut across the board and some banks might start calling for their money and will have some tough conversations \n\n- AMDâ€™s new processors donâ€™t look godly out of box. If you raise the power they might look pretty decent. The big thing is they are extremely power efficient and this will have a huge effect on laptops. If Intel continues to have chips that run hot this is sort of a big issue especially in laptops. \n\nIntel still hasnâ€™t found its bottom. In 2-4 quarters we will see its actual bottom.",
