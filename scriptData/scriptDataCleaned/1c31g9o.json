      "body": " the net difference between US treasury bill issuance and Fed tightening is quite stark.while everyone is fixated on the rates announcement by the Fed, this is what everyone should be focusing on. Treasury bill pumps liquidity into the market, the difference between how much has been issued combined with Fed tightening has the net effect of siphoning off liquidity from the market. Per the table shown below, starting this April the liquidity has fallen off the cliff, while up until March of this year there was ample liquidity in the market eventhough Fed was tightening.\n\nThis explains why the market was behaving the way it did, and it foretells the future direction in general.\n\nAs they say, don't fight the Fed on the way up, this also rings true on the way down.  \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6lwyx9b039uc1.png?width=1302&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfb5b1380ef6ad1c1efbb548153c2300ad9ba823",

              "body": "Lemme help that waxed dome of yours.\n\n\nImagine you have a big bathtub (the market) filled with water (money). You have a faucet (U.S. Treasury bills) that adds water into the bathtub, making it fuller. But at the same time, you also have a drain (the Fed's tightening policy) that can let water out. When the faucet adds as much or more water than the drain removes, your bathtub stays full and everything is fun, like having enough toys to play with in a nice bath.\n\n\nBut recently, according to what you heard, starting from April, the drain is letting out more water than the faucet is adding. This means there's less water in the bathtub, making it less fun because you have less water to play with. This change is why the bathtub (market) is not as full as before and can tell us that it might not get fuller soon.\n\n\nSo, when people say \"don't fight the Fed,\" they mean that when the Fed is letting more water out or keeping it in, it's really hard to make the bathtub behave differently by ourselves, whether it's getting fuller or emptier.",

The fed has massively shrunk the reverse repo facility, which has essentially pushed banks into buying all the treasuries that the fed has been pushing off of their balance sheets. \n\nOnce you factor that in, the overall period looks much more like a neutral monetary policy rather than tightening. \n\nWith that said, the reverse repo facility is pretty close to drained now, so it will be interesting to see if the fed actually continues shrinking their balance sheet, or if they “pause”. \n\nThat’s also not saying that the fed hasn’t accomplished anything in this time period… shrinking the RR balance is an important step in normalizing the economy, too.",
