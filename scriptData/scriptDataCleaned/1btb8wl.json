  "selftext": "Fellow rate cut waiting regards, it’s the I TOLD YOU SO guy again. After being correct and right all of last year stating no recession or Pivot, I want to discuss the “Higher for Longer” scenario. The fact is interest rate is still extremely low based on historical measurements and norms. Here is the chart of US long-term rate dating back to 1790\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zce4chtqswrc1.jpg?width=553&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15b1fb12fc0b92615c61fed62ba000964e24b8d9\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInflation is already picking back up albeit slowly. Service inflation has held steady while goods inflation is crawling back up. Energy and commodity prices are going back up as China is recovering and the US oil reserve needs to be replenished again. The US 10 year bond is at 4.32% but still down from October high. If you want to know why, please read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1aeukdb/us_treasury_department_rigged_data_to_keep/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gp6heuouswrc1.png?width=1035&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b7f69ee877f7a9b709b95cc85c27aa24fb62876\n\nIn general, goods inflation will fluctuate over time. It goes up and down based on outsourcing, technology progression, and supply-demand dynamic. It is based on things you eat, wear, touch and feel and consumer goods generally depreciate over time. There are durable and nondurable goods and things lasting over 3 years are considered durable goods like cars, TVs, and refrigerators. While most goods are not considered essential (we can argue about gasoline but people own EVs too), they are good to have. So the prices generally have a ceiling as you can always stop buying goods if the prices spiral out of control. Service inflation is a different story and a different beast. These are prices you buy for Rent or airfare (even BJ behind the Wendy’s dumpsters) and are for services you received. You don't get to horde services like you do with good. Think toilet papers or water bottles during COVD Pandemic. The inflation action has been hot in services and this accounts for 66% of the CPI weighting. Services inflation for the most part sits in the category of ESSENTIAL as they are for things you MUST have to survive and you cannot horde them. Think utilities, hookers, or rent so prices cannot come down because you constantly need these services and they cannot easily be outsourced to China or some other shithole countries. The inflation in services remains hot and will not come down unless we have a severe recession which I do not predict we will have this year either.   \n\nSo how do you make money you ask? I got no f\\*\\*king idea, gold is at all-time record high along with stock, shitcoins, and real estate outside of shithole states like CA. However, I bet a crash may come sometime after the elections but I think it’s might be too early to buy puts.   ",

          "body": "I work with manufacturing supply chains and we are seeing a lot of insourcing now. Mostly because companies are realizing they can rely on their whole supply chain being completely out of control. Now that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re pulling out of China into the US, they may just be pulling out of China and into countries that may be more stable or at least not arbitrarily shut down with no end in sight. \n\nEither way yes it’s driving up prices and it’s only going to get more as companies recoup their losses by completely rebuilding their supply chains in other nations with potentially higher labor costs. \n\nPeople seem to forget why companies even moved to China in the first place, it wasn’t just the cheap labor but China basically told these companies they will give them all the land and the factory free of charge, and then subsidize the shipping of the goods as well. No other country is going to offer that.",
