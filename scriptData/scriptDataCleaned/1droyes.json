Growth over time though, as inflation cools and rates come down, this stock could really move over the next 3 - 4 years.\n\nHOWEVER, there's some serious bullish short term indicators. The 1/17/25 $10c and $15c have INSANE OI. 110k on the $10s and 166k on the $15s. The 1/16/26 $10c have over 100k OI as well. These are probably institutional positions, not retail. They were purchased months ago and cost multiple millions, and even though they are down considerably, they are still holding. Some were rolled to the 1/2026 10c positions, but only 10k OI has been trimmed off the 1/2025 15c's. That's it. So someone(s) is betting multi millions on a massive good news spike before January.\n\nEdit: but this specific earnings, meh. Could go either way. I'm in it for the rate cut announcement and potentially a very long term hold.",
