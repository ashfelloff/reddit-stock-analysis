They are lower risk strategies.  For example, the return for selling covered calls is usually lower than from just holding the stock.  The exception to that might be if you're buying incredibly volatile stocks.\n\nSo no, you can't expect to make 5 million with low risk in that time period.

It's a great start though and you should invest the max every year into a Roth IRA as soon as possible. The earlier the better. You can't touch it til retirement age, but you'll be sitting pretty. \n\nPersonally, I'm saving up as much cash as I can the next five years and moving to Thailand. I'm 32, I also want to retire and it's not possible in the USA anymore unless you slave away for 30-40 years of your life and that ain't it for me.",
