                  "body": "It's not exactly a bold prediction. I'm very bullish longterm on TSLA, but short term even tiny differences in earnings can send the stock down 5%. Hard to say if they will beat earnings by enough. From what I can tell, I think they will have an upside on the EV credits this quarter and cogs, but they took hits on interest rates, so I dunno. I figure they will beat earnings but not by enough. \n\nAlso forward statements are also big. If they push back model 2 to 2nd half of 2025, that will send the stock down. Long term none of this matters though.",
