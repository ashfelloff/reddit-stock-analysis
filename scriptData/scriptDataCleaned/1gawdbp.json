It’s a good way to reduce pollution because it lets the market do the work. That said, a company has to spend money for pollution so they are driven to reduce their pollution which will inevitably reduce demand for Tesla’s polluting credits and thus reduce Tesla’s profits. The underlying issue is Teslas profits are highly driven by other people polluting. To be safe you’d wanna calculate future earnings assuming they one day don’t get those credits 5/10/15 years out. So you’d probably wanna predict future earnings assuming 600M + 10 years of growth. Not 2.3B + 10 years of growth.",
