Ideally I wanted to use my shoes from the past season for practice and the new ones for games but the Nikes seemed to fall apart much earlier than other brands. So I haven't bought a single pair of Nikes since highschool. Ordinarily I would be interested in possibly buying a stock that dips like Nike has recently but based on how it seems like a fashion shoe that performs well athletically for a little while until it falls apart, I feel extremely wary of the brand since it seems like it has lost its shine in an increasingly crowded athletic wear market.",

I don't even have to go onto their other products from apparels to backpacks, people have brand fatigue and are starting to realize the shit they bought off ecommerce sites like Shein, Aliexpress, etc or other less popular brands all came from the same sweat shop chain in China that Nike got their stuff from.

This is night and day to how they were several years ago. Please look at most nike releases, they dont sell out anymore and just sit online.\n2. Nike relies heavily on its catalog of retro styles. You can only churn out so many retros before everyone that wanted/wants a pair already owns them. Now the market is so flooded that if the new generation of kids wants a retro, the market is flooded enough that you can buy it cheaper on resale than if you bought it from nike or a store.\n3. From a running perspective, Nike doesnt make good running shoes except its top tier Alpha Fly 3 and maybe vapor Fly 3. Thats it. Nikes competitors are running circles around them in most every other running shoe category including daily trainer, max cushion, etc. Nike is never in a conversation for best running shoes except the Alpha Fly 3/Vapor Fly 3, which are very niche shoes.\n\nNike shoes have fallen off bad from demand perspective",

Reason avg price for them are dropping is only because people are not buying as much. ) If ppl ain't buying due to not as much cash in their pocket...
