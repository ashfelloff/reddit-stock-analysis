  "selftext": "\"AI is a big elephant in the room because INTC's AI exposure is solid. Intel's Gaudi 3 AI accelerator is a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 series. During the Vision 2024 event, Intel's management stated that Gaudi 3 delivers a 50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100. With a more attractive price compared to H100, Gaudi is positioned well to become a popular alternative to the H100 series. Moreover, the previous generation, Gaudi 2, proved itself appealing as it powers Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (META) Llama large-language model (LLM). \"\n\nIntel gets these results because it spends as much on r & d as Nvidia and Amd combined \n\nit is always improving and raising the bar.\n\n\nthe point bears miss the most is that inspite pf all this capx spend- Intel is still very profitable. \n\nWhen the new foundry IDM 2.o is complete\n\ncapx will drop significantly and revenues will rise significantly. \n\nfor an idea of just how much revenue,  look at Taiwan Semi revenue \n\n\nIntel is going to be extraordinarily profitable and revenues will eclipse those of Nvidia and AMD combined. \n\n\nI think sometimes people fail to realize just how  big this will get .\n\np.s  We are a second half ai catch up trade and the more people understand what's happening here - the more crowded this trade will become. \n\nIntel will be a triple digit stock once again.\n\nthis is not meant to say that NVDA and AMD will not continue to grow. After all the semi sector is massive ",

NVidia's a decade more mature at all of those than its competitors. While machine learning was getting its feet under it in the 2010s, they were the only game in town.\n\nWhere I think the risk to NVidia comes is from the big FAANG players writing their own software stacks in-house. They don't need to be mature, per se, they just need to be capable of handling a few extremely large and extremely specific tasks. \n\nThe big tech players also has the silicon design expertise to develop their own competitive hardware in-house. In concert with custom software, I think they will essentially build their own proprietary datacenters, and cut NVidia out of the loop. And they're half of NVDA's revenue.\n\nThe guys outside of Big Tech though, are going to be stuck for NVidia for a while, or at least until AMD gets their act together. \n\nNVidia's probably going to be go-to 3rd party AI vendor for the rest of the 2020s, because programs \"just work\" on there and there is a bunch of pre-written code to steal. And NVidia is going to make a lot of money doing it. \n\nI don't think their 70% margins can possibly hold, but they're the first meme stock I've seen that actually has a fundamentally strong business behind it.",

You know how hard it is for me to get excited about a company?\n\nI think LLMs are a joke and NVidia is overvalued by 10x, and I also think they're a strong company with great management and some of the best engineering staff around. It's not exclusive.\n\nFundamentally, I think they're a similar tier-2 kind of semi player as say AMD or Qualcomm. They are stronger than either, but there's no way in hell they are more valuable than say Microsoft or Apple. That's just a different weight class.",

They estimated new fabs would cost $10b and projected a $100b fab investment worldwide. Turns out each fab is costing $30b each and renovating old fabs is around $4b. You can't be this incompetent. It's a huge amount of capital they needed and their numbers are 300% off. They're cooked. \n\nI'll be here to remind you in 2035 that you have no idea what you're talking about, but I'll still be holding my bags.",
