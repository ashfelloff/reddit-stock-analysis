Which would make a smooth transition for Intel today into a fabless designer like AMD/Apple..etc.   Exactly what they've been discussing last week with the board.\n\n\nError of Pride.  Failing to see how you're just living off the past greatness.    Reading the history of Intel from Fairchild on down is like the ultimate winning formulas for decades of great engineering.   And then you come to the late 2000s and watch them just sit on their asses at 14nm++++++ year after year after year.   The design team building amazing stop-gaps for poor engineering over and over again.  No real investment in the fabrication.   And then denial as the TSMC/ASML based 7nm leaps, and their 10nm struggles.   Now TSMC talks 2nm, ships 3nm Intel/Apple and massive amounts of 4-5nm chips for Nvidia and AMD.   \n\n\n\nIf Intel fab 4 doesn't catch 7nm, they will be shipping product competing with SMIC 7nm out of China with 10nm next year.   Which is why the new Core Ultra chips are mostly TSMC.  \n\n\nPat knew this roadmap in 2021...so why run your mouth?!  Either compete and build it or shut the fuck up and suck up your pride to take your 40%.  \n\nhttps://www.wired.com/story/intels-ambitious-plan-regain-chipmaking-leadership/\n\n\nThis is the sort of bullshit pride that we deal with in the USA...you aren't better until you prove it.

Intel was already on a down slope from years of stagnation and mismanagement thinking they will be the only one left once AMD goes bankrupt, AMD didn't and rebounded from the depths of Bulldozer hell and made the right choice by focusing on more cores and multicore performance. Intel was fucking losing consumer market shares to both AMD AND ARM, like do you know how fucking hard that is to do especially when INTC have agreements with OEMs that forces them to use Intel chips only? They were also quickly losing to pretty much everyone in the industrial space due to servers opting for AMD or ARM chips instead over Intel due to years of bullying and corporate strong arming from the latter.\n\nThey established monopoly, decided they can strongarm and force everyone to comply, then they lost it and still thought they can do it, they lost even more market shares and finally started to panic, calling in the one regard who decided to bet the entire company on foundries in hopes the government wouldn't fuck them over. Currently the aid package hasn't arrived while they're desperately finding money everywhere in hopes they could tank this down time until 18A FINALLY starts making promising yield. They are pretty much just a few bad months away from forced Chapter 11, so they have to keep appeasing their debtors with shit tons of lies.\n\nI still stand by the point that Beast Lake was Intel's turnaround point, they cancelled it and tried to skip all the steps like they could magically arrive at TSMC status with all the foundries, now government is not moving so they are pretty much fucked.",
