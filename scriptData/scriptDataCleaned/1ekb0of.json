  "selftext": "https://www.chaotropy.com/why-the-rumored-delay-of-nvidias-blackwell-gpus-is-unlikely-to-be-a-deal-killer/\n\n\nFrom the article:\n\n[ But even if there is a design flaw, it is most likely the interconnect between two Blackwell GB100s to a GB200. This would mean that the individual Blackwell GPUs are not affected. It has already been reported here that problems with this interconnect could lead to production delays of two weeks. However, such problems are not uncommon when starting production of a new, highly complex product like the GB200, and are usually resolved in a short period of time, resulting in an improved product.\n\nFor the above reasons, I think it's unlikely that \"The Information\"'s report uncovered a relevant problem at NVIDIA. No complex product has ever been rolled out at scale without at least some minor problems during development or production. ]",

Leading up to the rollover from 1999 to 2000 the world was worried computers would quit due to their clocks only having 2 digits for the year.   So every company on Earth bought a ton of new and expensive equipment and the Internet was built out for years in a few months.   Then 2000 rolled around and no problems.    So all of the next 5-7 years of internet hardware capex had been pulled forward into 1999, so CSCO and JNPR's sales fell off a cliff.\n\nWhat if the AI hype has pulled the next 6-10 years worth of investment in expensive AI chips forward into 2024 and it turns out that AI (which likely is the next great thing, but like the internet not the next great thing immediately) is slow to actually show a profit to the consumers of those expensive AI chips and they don't buy anymore for some years?   Then NVDA profits will crater and along with it their stock price.",

It‚Äôs very highly doubtful that there is a logic design problem or a design implementation issue, at least one of significance.  It‚Äôs always a significant likelihood that there may be a design-for-manufacturability (DFM) problem due to pattern limited yield simply due to the combinatorics of new as yet unseen new pattern complexity and pressing the limits of a new node.  They limit process window and yield.  Happens commonly, even during manufacturing to improve yield over the first year.  There‚Äôs also significant likelihood of new technology modes in the packaging interposer between chips.  The DFM issues are typically quickly found and fixed with new masks within a few weeks but can be very complex.   I expect this to be a yield ramp issue as Blackwell systems are out being tested broadly.  This type of thing is not unexpected in the business and won‚Äôt impact sales.  People account for this.
