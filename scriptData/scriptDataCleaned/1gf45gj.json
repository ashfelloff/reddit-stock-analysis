Then some random dude made a post saying why Reddit was a good buy. Everybody and including me was telling him he was full of shit. But I did some research the same day, and when I compared it to other social media platforms, It just made so much sense. I returned to the post and told OP I bought into Reddit. And then in the following weeks, I just began piling into Reddit and even bought the dip during the Japanese carry trade unwind.\n\nWherever this guy is, I can't thank him enough! I honestly wouldn't be in the Reddit stock if he didn't make that post.\n\nEdit: I actually the post as the guy actually wrote back to me :D  \n[https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e6bel4/comment/ldrsky2/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web3x&utm\\_name=web3xcss&utm\\_term=1&utm\\_content=share\\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1e6bel4/comment/ldrsky2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)",
