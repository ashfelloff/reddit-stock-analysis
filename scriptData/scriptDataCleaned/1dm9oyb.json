          "body": "I moved from Google Nest hub, Mini, and Lenovo clocks to Echo devices over the last couple of months because Google started making me repeat myself almost every time. However, I kept the Nest Hub and clocks for non-voice use because I like the Eclipse clock face so much (the one with the giant screen-filling digits), and because unlike Amazon clocks, they show the time continuously, like actual clocks do. It felt stupid at first to have an Echo Dot sitting right behind my Lenovo clock and an Echo pop on the nightstand opposite the Nest Hub, but I quickly got used to it. As a bonus, my Ring alarm system was finally under voice control. Alexa isn't perfect, but she's a lot better than Google, and I feel less stupid saying \"Alexa\" than \"Hey Google\".",
