  "selftext": "Never go full regard. Stop letting your hate for musk cloud your already ill advised judgment. I‚Äôm mad because time and time again every time this dumb sub says to buy puts on TSLA, I do and I‚Äôve finally learned my lesson.\n\n\nThese things are true:\n\n\n1) Cybertruck is not a failure. Demand is still high.\n\n\n2) FSD continues to improve and is postured better to scale than any of its competitors including wAyMo. FSD is transformational, a lot of you boneheads just refuse to admit it. FSD will be successful. But ‚Äúmuh LiDaR‚Äù. Shut up. You know nothing about sensors, inference, AI, etc.\n\n\n3) Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.\n\n\n4) Tesla continues to print money and hoard money. All this talk about ‚ÄúTSLA doesn‚Äôt trade on fundamentals only musk failed promises‚Äù is equally regarded. They‚Äôve been successful at reinvesting in areas where they either created demand or already have demand. TSLA is a successful fucking company, deal with it, idiots.\n\n\n5) ‚ÄúBut musk is a liar who manipulates the stock‚Äù. Shut up. TSLA isn‚Äôt a conspiracy. This often referenced ‚Äúcult‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have enough money combined to move the stock $1.\n\n\n6) Robotaxi will turn out to be a success.\n\n\n7) Optimus is also postured to scale for practical use better than any of its competitors. It will also be a success.\n\n\nIn other words. I‚Äôm done listening to you losers.",

                      "body": "I simply described what has happened. That's not cherry picking. It is factual that Tesla saw massive gains in a single year (2020) as future growth was pulled forward and valuation multiples went to absurd levels. It is factual that since then Tesla has traded range bound for 3 years and has underperformed the tech index while the rest of the market has marched higher.\n\nIf you want to chase gains with zero consideration for valuation and earnings growth then you pay the price. That does not negate people buying before it ran up and making money.\n\nIf Tesla actually traded at a reasonable tech multiple of 20x forward earnings instead of 70x (especially given the negative gross and operating profit growth since 2022) then the gains since 2018 would be the same as tech index. Around 3x since 2018. I'm not surprised that Tesla is mean reverting slowly over time. It could very well continue trade sideways for a long time as the rest of the market gains and its valuation multiple comes down. Eventually the outperformance will be eliminated.",

Elon is the richest man in the US, you are all just a bunch of meritless morons looking for a free lunch. If you believed in him and put your money in his work you would have banked. He is the most successful EV company in the US ever. Of course you don't support his political views because it would mean you'd have to actually do something with your life, as opposed to leech off your parents and government welfare checks. Stop trying to get rich gambling. Go apply yourselves, start a company, develop products and services. Make your own money first, invest your money in people who are smarter than you, and then maybe down the line you will earn the respect from others with your opinion. For now your opinions reflect the value of a bunch of brokeass, pot smoking 20 year old virgin fucks with zero ambitions, zero talent, zero merit and absolutely no prospects, huddled together in an echo chamber of virtue signaling and self pity.

I'm guessing 10 years. Tesla can't sell a single Cybercab to any private buyers until FSD is approved for level 5 autonomy. They are currently stuck at level 2.\n\nTesla could still win, but their strategy seems risky.\n\nWaymo has chosen an iterative approach. Start with a car that's way too expensive and put it on real roads but in a walled garden. Gradually expand the size and complexity of the garden and learn from driving millions of miles with no driver.\n\nTesla is hoping to take visual data from many more cars using level 2 driver assist, combine that with AI, and magically leapfrog to level 5 all before actually deploying any fully autonomous cars. It could work, but it may take a long time. In the mean time, Waymo will be logging millions of miles without a driver.\n\n>Tesla will be the king of EVs for the foreseeable future. No competitor is even close.\n\nLook at the trend lines.  \n  \nIn 2022, BYD surpassed Tesla as the world's top EV maker, with 18% of the global market share compared to Tesla's 13%.\n\nTesla's US market share has gone from over 80% to under 50%.
