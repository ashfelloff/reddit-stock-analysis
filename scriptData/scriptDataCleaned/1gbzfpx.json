  "selftext": "Unlike the CFOs of most companies the Alibaba's CFO seems to have a clear strategy when it comes to buybacks:\n\n[Latest BABA share repurchases per day](https://preview.redd.it/a163nmc6pxwd1.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=527f39f654372af9c601bba52662c8e07857b16b)\n\nWhat can we see here?\n\n* Share price between 80 to 85 = 60 Million USD for buybacks a day\n* Share price between 85 to 90 = 40 Million USD for buybacks a day\n* Share price between 90 to 100 = 20 Million USD for buybacks a day\n* Share price above 100 = no buybacks at all\n\nThe cheaper the stock the more money is spent on share repurchases. No buybacks above 100 USD/share at all.\n\nInformation taken from: [https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Equities/Equities-Quote?sym=9988&sc\\_lang=en](https://www.hkex.com.hk/Market-Data/Securities-Prices/Equities/Equities-Quote?sym=9988&sc_lang=en) (scroll down and click on \"Company Announcements\")",

      "body": "Yep, they've bought back a shit load of shares this year. I'm curious to see if they adjust the buyback program parameters if the stock makes a sustained move above 100. Either way, the reduced share float definitely contributed to how sharp the move up was recently. I imagine it will move quickly again if fiscal stimulus is announced at the Nov 4-8 policy meetings\n\nGood to see a company using a share buyback program sensibly instead of buying at the top. This is a good use of part of their very large cash position",
