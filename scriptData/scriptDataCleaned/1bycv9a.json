If an airline stock wants to really go down in the dirt, then a PE 400 might be appropriate. If well treated, it can serve them well for a good while. Ride it too hard and without proper maintenance... then it'll probably leave you stranded.

Bird strikes show up there.  Turbulence that injures a passenger also falls into that category.\n\nI can't really go further back because I have to do it by hand and most notably this doesn't account at all for flights the planes make.  I don't know for certain but I would bet that Southwest is using its 737-800s on more shorter haul flights than say Delta likely is.\n\nBut just looking at every incident the worst one by far was likely an American Airlines 737-800 that had brake maintenance improperly performed causing it to nearly end up off the runway at Dallas-Ft. Worth (and they have big runways although I am not sure if it was the somewhat shorter outermost one).

Before I left, I was half way up my airline’s seniority list and I had been there a year and a half, we had one guy who never even had to work night shift, when generally you are stuck on nights for at least 5+ years.\n\nSaid mechanics may have not developed their proper “work habits”, like triple checking for tools before closing cowlings, never leaving tools physically on a ledge on the airplane, doing a walk around of your area after cowling close-up to double check the cowling latches, which I’m 99% sure happened here. Happened at Alaska taking off out of Portland last year, except the cowling didn’t rip off until the pilots deployed the TRs.\n\nThese mistakes will continue to happen for awhile longer until all these new guys have their “come to Jesus” moment, gain experience, etc.\n\nSure, you could require inspector buy-back on every job… I’ve seen inspectors get burned for not properly double checking shit, it was a simple job, there were 36 valves to inspect and he picked 3 of ‘em, the adjustment of said valves is somewhat subjective… You’re dealing with humans. Complacency happens.\n\nAt my first airline you will never ride on (thank god) I used to sign behind apprentices servicing oil. I got the ladder out and double checked oil caps every time I signed. One day I felt like being lazy… I walked back out to the ramp, grabbed my ladder, and an oil cap was sitting on a throttle linkage. At least when the pilots went to advance the throttles to taxi out, they would have know there was a problem.\n\nAlso, you know what used to happen when Mx errors were made…\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_191\n\nEdit 2: dipfuck I replied to is Dunning-Kruger personified.",

It notable that in this situation for example the pilots didn't know anything was wrong at all, it was only people in the passenger compartment who could see this issue.  In terms of the plane itself and flying it everything was reporting and acting normal to the pilots.\n\nFor example United had a 777 flying out of Hawaii nearly crash after takeoff that wasn't really reported in Dec. 2022.  The plane reached a low altitude of 748 feet after takeoff before things got in order.\n\nAnd you are looking at the pilots needing to do perform 8 or so steps of the checklist correctly to get things oriented back to safe in about 15s or so.\n\nIf you were on the plane you likely didn't realize what was happening at all other than you would have felt the plane go nose down a bit, engines go to max, and flap position changing.  No radical maneuvering or anything like that.\n\nI found out because I do follow some aviation channels and there is one where an airline pilot does try to recreate things in Microsoft Flight simulator in real time to show how tight these things can be pilots.  The video is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDBhGPqPodo).

The full investigation isn't concluded but they are pretty sure that American Airlines did something wrong when they were putting the brake lines back on and didn't change things to account for a different type of brake pad that they put on or something like that.  \n\nThere was a near crash with a United Airlines 777 in Dec 2022 that wasn't widely reported.  A combination of things occurred and the flaps weren't set correctly for takeoff on the plane due to an error on the part of the pilots.  When that was combined with low visibility the plane started to unknowingly descend on the pilots after takeoff and reached a low altitude of 750 feet before they got everything going correctly (although part of their procedure was to exchange altitude for airspeed).  Nothing at all in the reports that the NTSB did of the incident would have any fault on Boeing at all for it but if it had crashed the comments on a site like reddit would be all over Boeing even though nothing that happened on that flight couldn't have occurred on say an Airbus A350 or A330 (I don't know the model that United was using of the 777 so its hard to say what a good Airbus comparison plane would be).",
