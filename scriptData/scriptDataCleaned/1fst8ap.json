The reason for this is because of nvidia's progress in the tech but also because of their partnership with TSMC who create the smallest transistors in the world, packing processors with more than anyone else.\n\nThe US government has forbid Nvidia from exporting AI based chipsets in general, last I knew.\n\nTSMC is largely why China is fucking with Taiwan and the US is concerned about all that nonsense.\n\nThe reason why is because of Ukraine. If you look at the combat there, it's all drones and a growing amount of AI. A plastic bee chases you down and explodes. That's war in 2024.\n\nAI clearly makes this easier overall. So whoever controls the chipsets controls the drone swarms.\n\nThat's where we are.\n\nBecause of that, the US government just dumped a fuck ton of money into Intel so it can stop dicking around and catch up with TSMC, but also, TSMC has a fabrication plant opening in America and also Texas Instruments is trying to catch up as well, last I knew.\n\nAll of this is the new space race. Again, whoever controls all this controls warfare for the next 100 years.\n\nWe are looking down the barrel of a massive war over it, even, and the fact that I've got to explain all this to you regards means I'll be explaining it on a fucking battlefield to your plebian asses sometime in the next decade, I'd imagine.",

The idea is they need ultra pure water to make these chips and we're ramping up production domestically while also the water table is struggling, so it suggests water related stuff will go up local to the new fab plants in the US, but you also have to rope in like DuPont because they make ultra pure water for fab plants, so it gets complex and I kinda walked away from it.",
