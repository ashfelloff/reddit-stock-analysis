              "body": ">How would it be easier to fill prescriptions for the pill vs injection?\n\nThe injectables require a temperature controlled supply chain which is difficult to scale to meet demand. Everything from manufacturing and distribution to installing additional refrigerators in pharmacies has been a challenge. Approximately 40% of Americans are obese, if even 10% of the population were on an injectable GLP1 it would require massive upscaling of the supply chain.\n\n\n\n>The ones who tried it ended up switching to weekly injection instead.\n\nThis is likely because Rybelsus isn’t as effective due to significant absorption issues. The maximum semaglutide injectable dose is 2.4 mg per week while the maximum Rybelsus dose is 7 mg per day. Most of this dose is lost in digestion, making it roughly equivalent to a 0.5 mg injection. If Viking's pill solves this problem it could be a huge winner.",

Regarding manufacturing, that may be an issue as I know ozempic ran into supply issues with the pen delivery system.  Regarding fridge space in the pharmacy, that's not an issue.  We get 2 deliveries/day from our drug wholesaler.  I don't need any extra fridge space, I can reorder for same day delivery if I need more.\n\nRegarding maximum Rybelsus dose (which is actually 14mg), that's because it's only indicated for diabetes, not weight loss.  Semaglutide injectable for diabetes only has a maximum of 1mg for diabetes, 2.4mg is only for weight loss indication.",
