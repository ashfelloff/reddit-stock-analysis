Tons of new Android developer tools coming out. Google Cloud is growing fast and taking market share. They're integrating LLM tools into all of their products from cloud to android to productivity tools (Gmail, Calendar, Meet, Maps, Docs, Sheets). On the AI front they have AlphaFold-3 which is revolutionizing pharma and drug discovery and they just spun it out into a separate entity called Isomorphic Labs that has multi billion dollar contracts with Eli Lilly and Novartis. Huge growth potential there. They are also scaling self driving cars very quickly with 100k driverless rides per week now. Another avenue for growth where they are leading on technology. They also make their own AI accelerators (TPUs) which they use for all of their own AI training needs and other tech companies use their AI hardware on google cloud as well (Apple, Anthropic).\n\nGoogle is not IBM. Not by a long shot. They are still growing revenues and profits nicely especially given their scale.",

I think AAPL is probably closer to becoming IBM given their anemic growth and complete lack of innovation/new products.\n\nDo you udnersatnd that google serves something like 500K queries per second? Even if you don't think LLMs are orthogonal to search (they are), the computational resources required to replace Google search by LLMs are prohibitively expensive, its not going to happen anytime soon or ever imo (Goog is synonymous wih the internet and they own Android which happens to be growing market share in the countries with low internet penetration, which means more and more people are being onboarded to the Google ecosystem everyday).",

This is not even to mention the incredible complexity of crawling literally the entire Internet every second of every day to locate relevant content and store that in an index which enables near real-time recall.\n\nA fucking fancy summarizer for Wikipedia is not going to replace Google search, I don't care how many fucking Barron's articles I read about the \"threat\" to Google's search dominance.",

There's no one better poised if the market takes a shit, and even when it doesn't they perform fine.
