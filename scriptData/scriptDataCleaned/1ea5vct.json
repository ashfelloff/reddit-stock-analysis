If you look into the founders, you'll find that prior to Wiz in 2012 they had a cyber-security company called Adallom which they then sold to Microsoft in 2015 for $320 million.\n\nNow in 2024 they have another cyber-security company (Wiz) and they are turning down a $23 billion (or 23000 million dollars for us poors) offer from another tech giant (Google) which is offering over 70 times more than they sold Adallom to Microsoft for.\n\nThe only explanation is greed. They feel that they were short-changed in 2015 when they only got a third of a billion dollars, so now they're shooting for the moon.",
