I suggest you read Dalio’s Big Debt Crises if you haven’t, or at least the first 70-100 pages\n\nAnd btw yes, yield curve uninversion has predicted all recessions for decades now, no “narrow criteria needed”\n\nEdit: also, Alfonso Pecattiello has an amazing analysis of the effects of yield curve uninversion and how it affects job market, inflation and real rates months after it uninverts. He used the last 80 years to do the analysis and funnily enough the same patterns are starting to happen again. For instance the Fed is underestimating unemployment at the end of 2024, the trend shows it will be higher than they expect and this is an early sign (among others)",

Historically, in instances where the Yield Curve has been inverted the range of outcomes has been everything from being coincident to a recession, to leading by 30 months or longer (in the case of ‘66).\n\n>Predicting recession isn't all that useful for investors since investors don't trade economies, they trade markets.  But that didn't stop many from quickly connecting the yield curve inversion to being a good reason to underweight stocks at the end of 2022 and through much of 2023.  After all, if you believe markets lead the economy and yield curve inversion leads the economy, then an inversion has all the hallmarks of a big equity market decline.\n\n>But there is no reason to speculate on this idea.  It can be easily tested.  The data indicates that yield curve inversion is quite an ineffective indicator to trade stocks.  The chart below shows the return of trading stocks short when the Yield Curve is inverted.  That indicator has generated negative returns over the last 100 years with a hit rate closer to random than positive.  Positioning that one might say is as good as a coin flip, maybe worse.\n\n>We are presented with a classic example of how expectations often influence market pricing which means that using well-worn leading economic indicators is unlikely to generate alpha.  Think of it this way: If everyone knew that a recession was going to come it would already be reflected in stock prices.  Yield Curve inversion is both a mediocre indicator and ubiquitous, which means that the consequences of it simply occurring is likely already well priced into stock markets either directly or indirectly.  The sheer widespread recognition of it almost by definition erodes the alpha.",

Keep in mind Japan has a bit over a trillion dollars of bonds. Offloading all of them would still be less than what the US sells in year, but even if they only offload half of them it will make a big impact on bonds.\n\n Now think beyond just those US bonds. Would you rather buy those bonds on discount or buy corporate bonds? \n\nAnyway I would keep a close eye on this.
