  "selftext": "TLDR: My grandma is still alive but I think she will leave around $90k inheritance. This is the best time to buy so I will yolo $90k before I receive the money. My plan is to hold this for a decade, depending on how it performs.\n\nHere's why I like Cisco:\n\n2024 Q1 up 11% YOY: Cisco has shown strong revenue growth, reflecting its resilience and adaptability in the tech industry.\nExpansion in Networking and Security Solutions: Cisco continues to dominate the networking and security markets, with a focus on expanding its cloud-based offerings.\n5G and Edge Computing Leadership: Cisco is heavily investing in 5G and edge computing, which are crucial for the future of connectivity and IoT, positioning itself as a leader in these areas.\nStrong R&D Investment: Cisco invested approximately $6.3 billion in R&D in Q1 2024, ensuring that it stays at the forefront of technological innovation.\nAcquisitions to Boost AI Capabilities: Cisco has made strategic acquisitions to enhance its AI and machine learning capabilities, critical for the future of networking and security.\nForward PE of 16.8: Cisco is currently trading at a forward PE ratio of 16.8, which I believe is undervalued given its growth prospects.\nGeopolitical Stability: Unlike some of its competitors, Cisco benefits from geopolitical stability due to its strong domestic manufacturing and limited exposure to regions with high political risk.\nDividend Yield: Cisco offers a solid dividend yield, which provides additional returns on top of potential stock price appreciation.\nI like the stock and think it's a great long-term investment: Cisco's strong market position, innovation, and focus on future growth areas like 5G and AI make it an attractive investment at its current valuation.\nNana, this one is for you.",

              "body": "I love how you call out their revenue growth without mentioning that more than 100% of the growth is coming from their acquisition of Splunk which closed last quarter. Adjust Splunk out of the numbers and you can see revenue for Cisco is actually down about 12% y/y. \n\nThey‚Äôve already said their revenue will only grow low/mid single digits in FY25. Adjusting for Splunk implies revenue will be down ~5% for core Cisco in FY25. You may want to reconsider if the market is ‚Äúundervaluing their growth prospects‚Äù. \n\nTLDR: Cisco is a shitty company run by a shitty CEO who drastically overpaid for Splunk just to give the illusion of growth and hide the ongoing massive deterioration in their core business of selling networking equipment.",
