Even if you buy your girl a diamond neklace she needs to pay 25% gift tax... no joke.   \nSure doctors are for free but you need half a year wait to see a doctor. Sure education is for free but unless you got a A\\* (highest grade) IN EVERY SINGLE SUBJECT you cant study medicine although countries like Germany are missing 25000 doctors.   \nEurope catches you with all the \"free stuff\" but after all you always pay for it through ridicolous taxation.   \nYes a coffe might only cost you 4-6 Dollars in Munich city centre, but as a lawyer in the best M&A law firm in the county you earn 160K yearly (per annum) salary for a 90 hour week, after taxes thats 84K. However If you would work at a similar high level law firm in Miami, you would earn 450k base salary with only 27.68% income tax, thats 325K after tax! or FUCKIN 4 X THE AFTER TAX AMOUNT of the same job in Germany!  \n So who cares if the coffe in Miami costs 8 Dollars instead of 4?! Since you make 4 times the money its waaaay cheaper in USA if you compare high level jobs payments. Fuck Europe seriously.",
