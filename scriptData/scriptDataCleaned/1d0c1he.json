  "selftext": "Advance Auto Parts shares collapsed during 2022-23 falling from $240 to a low of $50 per share. Currently trading at $69. My target price is 140$. \n\n# What happened?\n\nBasically due to bad CEO decisions operating margin decreased from 7,5% to around 1,5%. This was caused by a mess in the company supply chain, an increase in the SG&A costs and store comparable sales metric stopped growing. \n\n# What are the good news?\n\nThe necessary steps to fix this situation have been taken:\n\n1. Former CEO was fired,  and in Q3 2023 Shane O’Kelly was appointed as new CEO. Prior to that, O’Kelly worked as CEO of Home Depot Supply, a subsidiary of Home Depot. This is the kind of CEO we need to fix the supply chain issues. Also he has brought with him a new CFO and some other management leaders. \n2. Operating margins are going to increase. Not to the prior 7,5%, but management is guiding at least 3,2% in 2024. New CEO laid off 400 people in his first week and is cutting $200M in SG&A annually.  The AAP Canada business is on sale and he is also selling another part of the business called WorldPac. Proceeds from these sales are going to retire all debt and save additional 90$ in interest expenses annually. Also concentrating business in the US will boost margins. \n3. An activist investor, (Dan Loeb) has taken a stake in the company and has appointed 3 board members with experience in the auto parts industry ( prior board members lacked this experience). Also legendary Michael Burry also took a position in the company. \n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/13/how-third-point-and-saddle-point-may-help-boost-margins-at-advance-auto-parts.htmlFrom](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/13/how-third-point-and-saddle-point-may-help-boost-margins-at-advance-auto-parts.htmlFrom)\n\nA macro perspective shows the stock fundamentals are solid as the US consumer is hurt and new vehicles sales are being impacted leading to a higher maintenance cost from older vehicles. \n\nAlso US elections are going to take place in November and it is safe to assume that the worst case scenario is that the stock market won’t crash. A FED rate cut in September can also help.\n\n# Upcoming catalysts? \n\nIt reports earnings on 29th May and if it reaffirms the guidance they gave in February and some of the steps management is taking materializes, then stock can fly to more than 100$ per share. \n\n# What I have done?\n\nAlthough I think the stock will rise on next week earnings release, I think it is better to buy long dated call options. I bought 100 calls of the longest dated option which is January 2026. Strike 90$ at 11.25$ for a total cost of $100k dollars. Leverage 9 to 1. \n\n**TLDR**: I'm long $100k on long dated out of the money $AAP calls.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q2k1duxeel2d1.png?width=1603&format=png&auto=webp&s=819efb879c8c33c43cc9405d046873c515752881\n\n\n\n# UPDATE 23/08: \n\nI exited this position 2 weeks later losing around 10% ( I managed to sell short dated calls around 70 stock price) after the disappointing Q1 results. Turnaround is not expected anymore and recently Q2 data confirm this.\n\nHere are the proofs of my position unwinding, cheers:\n\n[ps://ibb.co/b6MgCkh](https://ibb.co/b6MgCkh)",

Additionally, their interest payments are due in March and September, which would negatively impact those earnings reports, especially at an almost 6% interest. They said they got 150 million dollars in cost savings and used 50 million to invest in the business with raises for front line workers, but I also see a lot of insiders buying on 04/30. Was that insiders buying on their own or are those stocks bonuses given to them by the company? If they are company bonuses, they really cannot afford that. They have 50 distribution centers and really need to invest in their supply chain and IT infrastructure before becoming efficient and profitable, so I think they will be investing a lot back into the business which will take a few years, thereby lowering profits. \n\nI also checked out their career board. It seems that the most important thing per their own annual report they should be hiring for is good engineers. They are looking for around 20 IT type jobs and around 20 finance type jobs. Almost all the IT jobs are in India, so looks like they are trying to save labor costs that way. We'll see how it turns out. Store lead positions where someone manages 5 people in a (in my opinion) HCOL pay between $19 to $21. I don't see them attracting the talent that could really make this place more efficient and result in better customer satisfaction. It does look like they are trying to hire a few industrial engineers throughout the country to improve efficiency. However, all of them seem to be extremely junior roles with high requirements, including traveling 75% of the time, at a salary of 65k. \n\nIt doesn't seem like the executives are willing to bleed a bit to make this place successful and doesn't seem like they are truly willing to invest in highly skilled and talented people to turn this place around.",

At one point, almost all IT roles were in the US (Roanoke, VA and a small Richmond, VA office) and the average age was 52. For cutting edge app development, that's not a good recipe, and that isn't meant as a knock on people's age, but because they didn't have talent in the pipeline. People got a job at AAP and stayed until they were terminated or retired.  They often also had 100+ contractors ranging from PM, App Dev, BA, and QA. So what were the internal people doing, nothing but managing the contractors. \n\nSupply Chain had its own issues as well. SVP and VP both came from Pepsico with the previous CEO, had no clue about integrating supply chain/logistics/stores/IT and tried to offshore the majority of the roles. People in Bangalore don't know these things either so it was doomed to fail. \n\nSource: FP&A at AAP from 2013-2016.

Worldpac is actually a good business, the rest of it is sort of trash.  This turnaround may work temporarily due to noise and temporary indications of success,  but I don't think a true turnaround will ever happen.  The supply chains for auto part retailers is WAY more complicated than home depot. AAP has two major issues in my view 1) the supply chain is a complete mess...its just mashed up acquisitions and every person who has tried to come in to improve it has given up.  Sure selling worldpac will help reduce debt and stock may go up, but again true turnaround will likely NEVER happen. 2) I have probably visited like 50 garages on how they order parts from these guys.  Its basically based on reliability / ability to deliver parts within 20 minutes.  Without fixing supply chain AAP will never be the first or even second on their list.  Again stock may work for next 12 months, I don't know, but i will bet against turnaround every day of the week.  \n\n  \nThere is a reason AZO and ORLY are expensive.  Their ROIC and ROIIC is above 20%. Just a hard game to win against.  I am biased so probably inverse me I dont know haha.

Here is the total return for each in 2018, 2019 and 2018-2019, respectively (assuming dividend reinvested).  AAP: 48.68%, 1.57%, 51.46% | ORLY:  38.14%, 28.47%, 75.82% | AZO: 13.82%, 42.08%, 61.74%. So historically great years for the industry and in a 2 year period the ORLY and AZO were still better investments. Based on my multiple conversations with garages they were rarely third during the period.  Some of the private players were above AAP, but below ORLY and AZO.  They were never third.  They just did well enough in an environment where EVERY competitor did well.  I just disagree they are the third best player.  2018-2019 was just a good industry to be an investor in...regardless of the player you chose.   I think AAP is definitely the 3rd best PUBLICLY traded player but definitely NOT the 3rd best player.  Go to 5 garages and ask them where AAP ranks.  Remember AAP relies more on garages than ORLY and AZO.  DIFM is AAP's leading end market.  Also, AAP HAS to rival ORLY and AAP.  Garages literally have a list of their auto parts provider by rank they call when they order parts.  Pricing is irrelevant since they pass it on to customer.  So they have to convince the garage to call AAP before AZO/ORLY.  I disagree with your premise that they don't have to rival ORLY and AZO based on my understanding of how car garages order parts.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/zse5njaneo2d1.png?width=1723&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd9ba82ed1aed376d5ba1613b9b10bb51789136c",

AAP would beed to make some aggressive moves in the area of supplying 3rd party parts to Indy mechanics directly and worry less about DIY’ers. Maybe eliminate some brick and mortar stores and streamline business to be a more distribution style business. I can see big value if they could ink some exclusive partnerships with high end OEM’s, think Bosch, Valeo, or similar. This would pull a lot of Indy business.
