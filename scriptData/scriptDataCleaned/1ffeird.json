It became worth $20,000 approximately by the end of today (and if I had continue adding contracts, we’re talking 40-50k possibly). I decided to cut corners when I wired the money and it resulted in me missing a massive trade and quite a bit of pain. All over $70. I sat there questioning whether to send the extra $200 or not. I figured it wouldn’t matter. It did.\n\nThe money was the difference between a comfortable living after a year where I had a triple bypass and most likely have a rare kidney issue. Based on my luck I must have been a dirtbag in another life.",

Even following the news and earnings, it's expected to be perfection or disappointment but the company is still going to be around, has an unwritten monopoly, and the immediate future is far more bullish than bearish from everything I've found. Stocks will go up and down. This isn't like an Intel situation where the CEO steps out, basically says \"shits fucked, time to ride or die fuckos\" and then ends the call.\n\nIf you were going to drop out, why didn't you do it at 20% or 15% if this was money you were going to dip out on anyways?",
