  "title": "'Safety Disaster:' Tesla FSD 'Galaxies Away From Being Anywhere Close To Competition'",

  "selftext": "* Tesla's FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised, is now the core technology behind the robotaxi service the company plans to launch.\n* Most analysts assign hefty value for the FSD technology alone.\n\n  \nWith just two weeks to go for Tesla, Inc.’s TSLA Robotaxi unveil event, an analyst painted a bleak picture of the company’s self-driving technology.\n\n\n\n**What Happened**: Tesla’s FSD, which is now promoted as fully-supervised FSD, is a “safety disaster” and “galaxies away from being anywhere close to the competition,” said GLJ Research’s Gordon Johnson in a note. Tesla’s competitors in this arena are Alphabet, Inc.’s GOOGL GOOG Waymo and General Motors Corp.’s GM Cruise.\n\n\n\nWith Tesla eyeing the rollout of its Fully Supervised FSD in China, the Elon Musk-led company would be up against domestic player Baidu, Inc.’s BIDU Apollo Go.\n\n\n\nJohnson referenced reviews by two sources to make his case. Independent lab AMCI Testing, which tried the technology, said the overall performance of Tesla’s camera-enabled autonomous-driving software is “suspect.” In a report released on Tuesday, the firm said its evaluation showed how often human intervention was required for safe operation. “In fact, our drivers had to intervene over 75 times during the evaluation; an average of once every 13 miles,” it said.\n\n\n\nWhile the FSD 12.5.1 was impressive, it is incredibly dangerous for drivers operating with FSD to drive with their hands in their laps or away from the steering wheels, it said. “The most critical moments of FSD miscalculation are split-second events that even professional drivers, operating with a test mindset, must focus on catching,” it added.\n\n\n\nJohnson also referred to data from [Teslafsdtracker.com](http://Teslafsdtracker.com), which aggregates TSLA FSD driving experiences/data, in real-time from users, which shows that the latest iteration of FSD has a **critical disengagement every 130 miles and every 72 miles when driven in a city.**\n\n  \nData reported by competitors to the California Department of Motor Vehicles show that miles to disengagement data for various players are as follows:\n\n* Waymo: 17,311 miles\n* **Amazon, Inc.’s** AMZN Zoox: 177,602 miles\n* [Pony.Ai](http://Pony.Ai) (startup): 17,077 miles\n* WeRide (startup): 21,191 miles\n\nThe **metric for Tesla is 13 miles**, based on AMCI’s statistics, Johnson said, although Tesla doesn’t yet report data to California DMV, given its FSD tech is **only Level 2.**  \n\n\n**Why It’s Important:** Johnson noted that many sell-side analysts assign a valuation of $300 billion to $600 billion for Tesla’s FSD technology. In real-time, the value is close to zero, he said, adding that it could be negative, given the “liability of putting something this dangerous on roads.”\n\n  \nAccording to Ark’s valuation model, by 2029, robotaxis, which has FSD as its core technology, would account for 63% of Tesla’s revenue and 86% of EBITDA.\n\nFuture Fund LLC Managing Partner Gary Black, a Tesla bull, said in a recent post on X that Tesla's FSD is not yet close to the 99.99% efficacy needed for unsupervised autonomy.\n\n\n\nIn premarket trading on Thursday, Tesla rose 2.05% to $262.30\n\n  \nSource: [benzinga.com](https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/09/41047267/safety-disaster-tesla-fsd-galaxies-away-from-being-anywhere-close-to-competition-says-bearish-analys)",

They both are fundamentally different products.\n\nWayno also operates with a very specific problem in mind that is to autonomously drive in specific cities. Whereas Tesla fsd tries to be a general autonomous driver. Tesla is nowhere near reaching its robo taxi goal. I don't see wayno being any closer either regardless of its higher qualification. The lidar based systems were good when I did my masters in ml and their improvement is minimal over those 7 years.\n\nThe vision based systems are reaching comparable performance but until Tesla can put money where their mouth is it is hard to give an accurate comparison. They have shown no plans to operate a robo taxi of any kind. \n\nThe lidar based solutions have shown very low commercial viability, hence why Uber and other companies have pulled back their programs. Tesla can continue to better their self driving capabilities because they are a commercially viable car brand which does self driving on top of that .\n\nThe insinuation that somehow I can't disagree with really bad takes from the analyst without subscribing to the brain dead fanbase of Tesla fans is preposterous. I think Tesla is overvalued but I don't think waymo is any closer to solving the self driving problem than Tesla is . \n\nAlso if you want to see Tesla being driven without driver intervention, there is a YouTube channel dedicated to driving in the sf area with Tesla fsd.",
