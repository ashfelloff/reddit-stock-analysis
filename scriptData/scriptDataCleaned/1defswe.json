If you keep trading like this there is a high probability that your gains will be gone again. You didn't need the money anyway, right? The AAPL move was unexpected - mentioned AI and it shot up wildly a day later. You got very lucky. You should cash in and take your original money out and play with any winnings left over.",

Put 2 and 2 together and figured it’d stay a double bottom and break resistance, so I just held as it kept going up. The short term TA kept being nice and volume kept steady so I just kept holding.

          "body": "OP bought calls. You don't need collateral to buy options, you pay upfront for them and the maximum you can lose is what you pay upfront. As per the screenshot, each option contract cost 0.07$. Brokers show the per share price of contracts but option contracts always represent 100 shares so whenever you see the price of an option always multiply by 100. So each contract was 7$ because it had short duration (14th of June expiry) and it was out of the money (OP said in another comment they bought at 197$). So when the price went even higher, the options were worth more, 850$ per contract more specifically since OP said they made 17k from the 20 contracts they had.",
