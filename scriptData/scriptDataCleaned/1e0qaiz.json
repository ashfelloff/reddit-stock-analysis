                  "body": "Weâ€™ve been seeing these sell the news events play out after extended run ups like we just had where profit taking brings QQQ down anywhere from 1-2%. When I saw the CPI spike get instantly sold off this morning and VIX reversal yesterday, I figured the algos/whales would do a mini rug pull to both lock in profits and induce retail into some panic selling. All of this plus the fact that itâ€™s the end of the week where MM gamma hedges would quickly unwind if there is widespread selling means that downside pressure mounts quickly. \n\nTLDR sell the news events after a prolonged run up starts a sell off where selling pressure multiplies on the way down for usually at least 1% or so intraday. \n\nI expect a reversal in the next few days but i could be totally wrong",
