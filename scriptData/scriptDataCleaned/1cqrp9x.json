Of those, 12 occurred during an economic downturn or crisis.”\n\n\nI don’t know shit about fuk, but 12 out of the last 17 times (roughly 70%) isn’t promising for a soft landing 🤷‍♂️ ",

Until they do it, everyone will say, \"It's never happened, ergo it can never happen.\" And they will be correct, right up until they are wrong.\n\nIn the meantime, the market goes up in the long run. Now, if you bought at the high in 2000, it took you 13 years to see a meaningful capital gain. With dividends, it's a slightly rosier picture, but still not great. \n\nIf you bought at the 2007 peak, it took you about 5.5 years to make money. In 2020, it took just 5 months. In 2021, it took 2 years.\n\nSo if the soft landing doesn't eventuate, you're put of luck for the time being. If it does, we're going to the fucking moon. If you've got a higher conviction investment than the US economy, go for it. Otherwise, I'm pretty happy with the horse I have.",

Thats because it’s the primary tool in the central bank’s toolbox.\n\nRecession -> elevated unemployment -> Fed reacts because their dual mandate includes maximizing employment.\n\nThats fairly irrelevant to where we are right now though.  Rates are restrictive to combat inflation, recession is not imminent, and the labor market is not collapsing.  There is still a very good possibility for inflation to ease enough that the Fed lowers rates slowly as their plan has been all along (ie a quarter of a point at a time).\n\nBasically these posts, deliberately or otherwise, conflate causation with correlation",
