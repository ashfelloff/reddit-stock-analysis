Assuming IV doesn’t completely go flat tomorrow your profit would not have been a ton, not double. \n\nMaybe it runs to $1020 tomorrow market open and those calls would be ITM with premium so there would be upside.\n\nBut I think you’re nuts for playing $50k to make a g or 2. Not stupid play in hopes that IV is your ride but before the last hour or so these were kinda not great",
