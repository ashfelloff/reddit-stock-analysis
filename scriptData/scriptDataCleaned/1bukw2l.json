It’s possible the call holder exercised their calls because spreads were wide and they wanted to close their option position without dealing with that spread. \n\nOn top of that the stock is currently hard to borrow, so holding the shares would allow them to get extra income through stock lending.\n\nThe Schwab vs RH assignment is kinda surprising, since assignment is supposed to be random. Wait to see if you get a notification later tonight, I think those Schwab short calls will likely be exercised too. Idk why you’re selling deep itm calls on a stock that has a borrow fee of 150% without expecting to get assigned",
