  "selftext": "I mean this isn't a DD [but he kind of dropped some bombs here on his way out](https://twitter.com/tunguz/status/1780367503941619854). I can't think of a person leaving a company and just decimating the competition on the way out while blessing his former employer with the highest praise.\n\nHe's saying there is no chance in hell for others to catch up and not anytime soon.\n\nI don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD, Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.\n\nHere is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.\n\nGPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief, Demis Hassabis, and I quote, \" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora.\" And that's ALL GPU's folks.\n\nIf one major player or sovereign nation state gives up on the pursuit of AGI they will be behind in a severely detrimental manner.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9in7zafcsyuc1.png?width=898&format=png&auto=webp&s=e309db0adf4c947a7ddeab221d5de11d676f3063\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/owo41bfcsyuc1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=303b1bfafdc79a1937a78836546ff0ff8082e30f\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qbwf5afcsyuc1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa5d12e47889ac43ebef7ba7c4e4bd9fb11cc42e",

                      "body": "I started blogging in high school around 15 years old. I always knew I had some minor talent writing. I randomly put Adsense on my website in my dad’s name without his knowledge. I never checked what it generated and the about six months later a DHL truck dropped off a $500 check for my dad. He was confused.\n\nI then worked at GameStop for a month after high school, got fired, and just started blogging. I would work sometimes 100 hours a year, got super depressed by how lonely I was. I would go to buffets and just sit and read and want to kill my self.\n\nThen I just stopped writing altogether. I hated myself. Ballooned to 300 lbs and eventually the blogging money ran out about a year and a half later. By the. I was doing odd jobs and sick of the loneliness from writing and other things. \n\nThankfully I had nearly finished a bachelors degree by 28. Got a teaching degree and now at 38 I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be. I’m pretty sure in a year or two I can quit and trade full time. But honestly think I’d just go back to hating myself without my job. \n\nI love it. I’m a surrogate dad for a lot of kids that need that kind of thing. I bring snacks. The kids get excited for Costco Day. Helped turn 37 Fs into a D or higher last semester. Helped some girl who graduated last year and got knocked up get an abortion.\n\nIt’s been pretty damn good. I lucked out.",

He simply doesn’t have enough knowledge of the competition’s internal research, or how AI tasks may evolve. I agree it’s unlikely anyone beats or catches up to NVIDIA anytime soon, but that doesn’t mean no one could develop a compelling alternative. If a company with a huge need for GPUs could develop their own chips in house and get them at cost, even if they’re worse than NVIDIA’s offerings. It could be compelling enough from a cost perspective to disrupt NVIDIA’s business. Obviously not many companies are anywhere close to being able to do that, I think Google is the best positioned, maybe Apple too since they have a lot of chip design experience, but they seem to lack the motivation with their ML/AI services seemingly being much smaller.",
