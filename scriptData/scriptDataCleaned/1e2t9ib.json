  "score": 174,
  "selftext": "Alright here is my first try at some research. Warning I am rather regarded. \n\n  \nLooking at SOFI they have increased income year over year, and it looks like they may become profitable these earnings. \n\n  \nThey have some of the best APY for holding money in their account. Seeing as other banks($JPM) want to start charging for accounts this could be something that sets them apart. Alot of the younger generation are looking to be more financially smart and put money somewhere that makes them money. \n\n  \nLooking at their stock, they look undervalued and look like they will start making a profit this earnings report if not next. \n\n  \nLooking at the next two weeks an in the money call looks strong with a lowish IV at 32% for 7/19 and 42 for 7/26. This week will be filled with many chances of black swan events so the IV could dramatically increase. \n\n  \nSaying this I really like the call prices for 7.5c but if you are not as regarded and want to be risk adverse stocks look super strong. \n\n  \n**TLDR**: I'm a regard who read a few equity research and looked at some IV histories. I really like SOFI so maybe some bias. Would love to hear what other smarter people have to say.",
