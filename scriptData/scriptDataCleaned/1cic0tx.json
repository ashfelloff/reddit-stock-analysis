I don’t know the time frame for it just look at the chart and see how long it takes for apple to bounce off the low and reach that range then account for +- few days. But timing is hard Apple is a slumbering giant. That was the biggest move I’ve seen post earnings for Apple. Mainly due to the massive buy back announcements. Analyst only predicts $90 billions but they came out and said. $110 billion. Bear in mind Apple has bounced off the low on april 19. If may makes a new high just cuz Amazon and Google had done so a week ago. But then the sell off may happens after just may take longer as well for sell off.",
