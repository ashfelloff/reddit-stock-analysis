This confirmation of resumed inflationary pressures, combined with the recent slowdown in GDP growth, suggests a negative impact on the real economy, heightening the risk of stagflation.\n\nFurthermore, it solidifies expectations that the Fed will refrain from discussing rate cuts, with some uncertainty already circulating among economists regarding potential talks of fresh rate hikes.\n\nCurrently, market participants assign a 60% chance of a rate cut by September 2023. However, a hot PCE reading could materially push rate cut discussions further down the road.\n\nUpside surprises in the PCE report will intensify upward pressures on Treasury yields and downward pressures on rate-sensitive stocks.\n\nSectors such as real estate, tech, consumer discretionary, and materials, known for their strong sensitivity to interest rates, may experience significant negative price action.\n\nTraders may anticipate the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) and the tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ) to end the week on a weak note.\n\nConversely, a cooler-than-expected PCE report spells good news for markets, signaling relief that rising inflationary pressures in the first two months of the year have diminished in the last month of the quarter.\n\nTLDR: high pce ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|downvote)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)\n\nLow pce ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)\n\nSource: Bezinga Newswire",
