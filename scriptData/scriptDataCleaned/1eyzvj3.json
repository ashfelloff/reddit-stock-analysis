          "body": "One of my friends' ASTS profits is over a $1M on his massive ASTS holding. He's normally the smartest and most emotionally stable person in my friend group, but he's refusing to sell a single share. He may be right, but I dunno... sentiment seems to be rising to near cultish levels, which is a big warning sign for me. He does very well for himself but $1M is still huge money, and if he just sold a 1/4 to a 1/2, he'd only be subject to long-term capital gains taxes, so I'm not sure I agree with his position.\n\nThe r/ASTSpaceMobile subreddit's gone from being relatively well-grounded to people claiming it will shoot up to $100's per share, perhaps even a $1000. Once again, cultish behavior is on the rise, and for that reason, I'd like to at least get back my cost basis and some profit.",

                  "body": "**Update:** I did talk to my friend about why he was refusing to sell even a 1/4 of his shares. He lives in California so with max state capital gains tax of 13.3% + federal capital gains tax, he'd need the stock to nearly halve in order for it to make sense to him to sell at all. That makes a lot more sense now. I have no state capital gains tax at all, just federal.\n\n**TLDR**: None of us know anything, manage your risk, and maybe, just maybe consider offloading a portion of a stock that nearly 20x'ed in 4 months if it makes sense for you depending on your state of residence's tax policy?\n\nI said \"cultish\" behavior, you already see some in this very thread calling people that have a different thesis \"brain dead morons,\" saying $40 is cheap, calling ASTS a $70-100 Billion company. It could be... but as of this moment? I know the stock market's forward looking, but this is imho too forward looking. I don't think Kook\n\nEven with next month's launch, revenues will be quite low, which once again, is understandable... I just disagree that the valuation should be so high right now., so I sold roughly 75% of my shares. Even then, I imagine my 25% is still quite a bit more than the vast majority of retail investors out there, so obviously, I still have some degree of faith that they'll pull it off. I even have thoughts of accumulating more should the stock price tank.\n\nAlso re: bank price targets, those bank reports always have a wide range. It's $600 if absolutely everything under the sun works out... which I don't think has ever happened to any organization ever in history. I think most in my friend group were hopeful of a lower 3 figure valuation... perhaps $200'ish in a great scenario albeit not the best case scenario. And why aren't you questioning what these bank reports mean? I'd question how far the valuations were from initial price target reports to reality years if not decades later for all companies they've drafted a report on. This is part of what investment banks do... they draft reports on speculative events so they and their clients will be prepared should those events hit.\n\nDo you think even the drafters of great DD's and insight like Kook and Professor Mak, our 2 greatest supporters of ASTS, threw their whole net worth at ASTS? Of course not, this post isn't a FUD, it's to be optimistic with the company but maybe urge them to take some profits.\n\nI've heard a lot of business pitches in my time, very, very, very few work out to even be a moderate success. Don't get things twisted, this was always a binary play. Even my friend with approx. 50K shares that's refusing to sell even a single one admits that the odds of success are probably about a 1/3 at best right now. When he first mentioned the stock back in 2011, he said the odds were below 10%... that seems far more accurate than the people talking about mooning.\n\nIt was always a speculative play... investing in a pre-rev company by definition is a speculative play, no? You have ASTS holders here making $100's of thousands and refusing to sell any shares. I know we're on wsb, but that seems beyond arrogant to me as I imagine it's a big % of their total wealth. Of course I'll regret it if shoots to the moon from here on out but it was always money set aside for speculative plays, 95%+ of my wealth in brokerages are in boring EFT's and the vast majority of my wealth is tied to my business, so this is just a gamble... anyone who tells you otherwise is lying to themselves and others. Even for a gamble, maybe take a few chips off the table?\n\nAnd just as a gamble to put my money where my mouth is, I opened what to me was a conservative put contract, 25 contracts: \"01/17/2025, 30.00 P.\"\n\nCould be right, could be wrong, who knows?",
