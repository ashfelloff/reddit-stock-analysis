  "selftext": "9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024\n\nAt least a 5% further drop from\n$169 levels.To $160 or lower.\n\nI just cannot see any good news\nexcept the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.\nBut is that enough ?\n\nEven Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.\n\nReason one.\nApple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.\nLong time to be under the 200 days moving average .\n\nCurrent 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.\n\nCurrent 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.\n\nCurrent 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 \nDefinitely not oversold by any means.\nIn the low 30’s it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.\n\nIn the case of Apple stock, its 50-day “line crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.\n\nThe last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. \n\nThe two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.\n\nhttps://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/\n\n\nThe Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. \n\nTypically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.\n\nThis pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.\n\nReason two.\nApple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.\nThis is extremely significant.\n\nA double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.\n\nIt is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.\n\nThe double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.\n\nThe double top chart pattern resembles the letter “M”, due to the two equal highs.\n\nA double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. \n\nTherefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. \n\nYou can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. \n\nThe double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.\n\nReason three.\nApple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023\nand $165.24 in October 2023.\n\nIn April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.\nThe 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.\n\nIf it was one day,it would be okay.\nBut for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.\nTrouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?\n\n\nDouble Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.\n\nBut you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.\n\n\nReason four.\nApple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.\nWhere it has been much of the last 3 months.\nApple stock current price is \n$169.30\n\nReason five.\nApple hit another double top formation recently.\nHit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.\nAnd more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.\nVery bad.\n\nReason six.\nApple’s market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.\n\nApple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.\nPronounced downtrend.\nNot a good trend.\n\niPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.\nApril 26,2024\n\nAccording to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. \n\nThis gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.\n\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/\n\nhttps://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024\n\nWith the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.\n\nApple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.\nDefinitely a good thing.\n\nBut can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.\n\nHere is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.\n\nFor years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: “Designed by Apple in California. Assembled in China.” The slogan illustrated the tech giant’s two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.\n\nApple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: “Designed by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.”\n\nReason seven.\n\nExpected EPS for May 2,2024 is \n$1.51\n\nThe latest earnings whisper is $1.50\n\nExpected revenue for May 2,2024\nis $90.61 billion.\n\nThe latest revenue whisper is\n$89.79 billion.\n\n\nHow can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,\n\nMake the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.\n\nAccording to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.\n\nBased on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.\n\nUnless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.\n\nBut what about Apple Watch sales.\nAnd Vision Pro sales.\nPlus the iCar exit.\n\nReason eight.\nApple Vision Pro sales tank.\n\nAccording to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.\n\nApple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.\n\nWill the “iCar” Exit Impact Apple Stock.\n\nWhy Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.\nApril 12,2024\n\nhttps://www.morningstar.ca/ca/news/248065/will-the-%E2%80%9Cicar%E2%80%9D-exit-impact-apple-stock.aspx\n\nApple Watch X: The latest on Apple’s plans for a major design refresh\nApril 24,2024\n\nhttps://9to5mac.com/2024/04/24/apple-watch-x-design-overhaul/\n\n\n\nAre you bearish or bullish on Apple \nstock.\nCould a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.\n\nReason nine.\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.\n\nJim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer’s Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.\n\nThat is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.\n\n\nDespite all these nine negatives,\nthe options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.\n\nThe put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.\n\nA falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator\n\nFor May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66\nVery bullish.\n\nFor June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 \nDefinitely bullish.\n\nThe average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.\nMaximum pessimism.\n\nMorgan Stanley likes Apple stock.\n\nBut even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.\n\nBuy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.\n\nWe believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. \n\nAt $165, this appears priced in but in today’s volatile market, it’s a tricky setup. \n\nThat said, with Apple’s biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we’d buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.\n\nIf Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.\nHint.\n\nIn other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.\n\nWhat say you regards.\nListen to the option investors or options money flow.\n\nOr is Jim Cramer right on Apple.",
