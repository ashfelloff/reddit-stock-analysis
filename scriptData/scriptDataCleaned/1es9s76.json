They may have to separate the company somewhat.

I think that is highly unlikely.\n\nBut a broken up Google would be good for Google investors as it would be worth a lot more.\n\nI think all of this could end up being very bullish for Google.  I believe there is a 50/50 chance the resolution is a choice screen.\n\nIf that does happen then this is going to be one of the best things to ever happen for Google.\n\nAll along Android, and Chrome were a lot about protecting search.   Making sure it was a fair choice.\n\nThey finally would get that with a choice screen with the added benefit of not having to pay for it.\n\nBut a choice screen would be very bad for Apple.   Which I am also a very long term shareholder.   Owned it for over 20 years now and added through the years.\n\nIn the end I think you want to own the major ones Google, Apple, Microsoft and probably also Amazon and Meta.  But definitely the first three.  Google first and really can do Apple or Microsoft next.   I have been more Apple for 20 years but it is now very close for me and Microsoft is getting close to moving ahead of Apple.  I hate to say it.  But also a Microsoft shareholder and one of my biggest positions.  But with that said.  Never cared for the company or how they roll.\n\nI wish they would roll more like Google.  Google makes the HUGE innovations, patents them, then shares in a paper, but then lets everyone use for free.   Heck if not for Google we would not even have any LLMs and so many other things.  Not just AI.  But a lot of the cloud things that are common today were Google innovations.",
