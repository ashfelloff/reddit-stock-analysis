  "score": 148,
  "selftext": "Share of Paramount Global hit a milestone today, and not a good one.\n\nThe stock price fell below $10 intraday, changing hands at $9.91 just now, down 2% from Friday. It‚Äôs never dipped below ten bucks since Viacom and CBS merged in December of 2019, making this an all-time low after David Ellison‚Äòs Skydance packed up and went home.\n\nShares of the combined company have have bounced around, starting at about $35 at the merger (ViacomCBS was subsequently renamed Paramount Global). They were briefly around $10 in the depths of Covid, but were pushing $90 a year later, before a slow decline. It‚Äôs the media industry ‚Äî the streaming wars, linear woes ‚Äî but also some self-inflicted wounds. Paramount had a chance at different times to sell both Showtime and BET for a nice cash infusion. The shares were above $16 at the height of merger speculation last fall.\n\nAfter discussing a potential transaction for months, Paramount‚Äôs controlling shareholder Shari Redstone backed away at the 11th hour last week, leaving the company her father built in a complicated position with high debt, significant exposure to declining linear television, and ongoing streaming losses. She surely had her reasons but it was so messy.\n\nThe company‚Äôs three newly appointed CEOs have outlined plans for $500 million in costs cuts, a strategic partnership in streaming and other measures to keep the company chugging ahead.\n\nBut the drama of the last six months has left Wall Streeters frustrated and considering the options.\n\nThere are two other parties (Edgar Bromfman and Steven Paul) interested in buying her family holding National Amusements (which controls Paramount). and other may emerge for a transaction that would be a simple change in control. Redstone could also sell just a part of her NAI holding for some cash to address the holding company‚Äôs debt payments. Loans are collateralized in large part by Paramount stock and NAI has had to renegotiate debt covenants several times as the shares slipped.\n\nThe Skydance proposal was two steps, the first being an acquisition of NAI from Redstone, a number that was lowered in revised offers to find cash for Par‚Äôs public shareholders. The second step was a merger of Skydance and Paramount. Sticking points included how Paramount would be run during a period of regulatory scrutiny, which it was expected to pass. Another was legal liability since shareholders had threatened to sue Redstone if the deal went through. There may have other considerations.\n\nThe current restrictive regulatory regime has hovered over all aspects of the deal. An offer from Sony and Apollo was considered by many a non-starter due to foreign ownership rules for broadcasters, station caps, and concerns that it wouldn‚Äôt be easy to merger two more Hollywood studios. Everyone‚Äôs eyeing the polls because it‚Äôs though a victor by Donald Trump that could reconfigure the FCC and FTC might shift the landscape and be more forgiving of deals. For now, a trio of CEOs are running Paramount and have anticipated cost cuts, a strategic partnership for Paramount+ and other measures.\n\n[Source](https://deadline.com/2024/06/paramount-global-shares-hit-low-as-skydance-merger-up-in-smoke-1235975782/)\n\n&#x200B;",

      "body": "Most of the focus on the stock is on whether or not a deal will be made. A lot of investors this year bought in hoping that they can make a quick buy if Paramount gets sold off. Byron Allen offered $21.53 per class B share, The Apollo/Sony Offer was $26 Billion, or about $20 per share after debt is paid off, and the most recent Skydance offer was a $15 per share tender offer on about 50% of the shares. So the stock has hovered between $10 and $15 based on various leaks to the media about offers, negotiations, etc.\n\nWith many offers shot down by Shari Redstone, the most recent one being the Skydance offer, optimism for a deal is at record lows.\n\nWhat also isn't helping is nearly every media outlet is releasing articles implying that the company is on the brink of collapse, even though the company's financials paint a completely different picture.\n\nThere is reason for optimism- Legacy TV, while it is slowly declining(about 1% YoY decline in subscription/affiliate revenue, and a cyclical downturn in advertising), it is still producing over $4.5 Billion in operating income per year, while the company's market cap is just $6.3 Billion. Direct To consumer, despite its tremendous growth, has been a money pit for the past 3 years, which is why the stock has tanked so hard, but is on track to become domestically profitable by 2025.\n\nThe stock isn't going to be the next Nvidia, the next Apple, etc. But it is a deep value play- with the actions they're taking to cut costs, aim for cashflow/profitability, and deleverage, I think the stock can easily double in the next 3 years and triple in 5 years.",
