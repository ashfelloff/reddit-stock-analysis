They've got trillions squirrelled away in unproductive assets, while US markets have the opposite problem:- 1929 levels of manic public participation, massive debt and a buffett ratio of 200%. It's had a good 15 year run but its time to take profits. A tree doesn't grow to the sky.\n\nIts a no-brainer for international investors. Only provincially-minded americans will be left holding the bag when the London currency markets are swayed and pivot to the East. China has massive cash-generating companies that are undervalued and unlimited upside. \n\nDon't get caught fighting over the S&P500's crumbs as the dragon unfolds its wings.",
