Most crimes, if you're going for a security license or in some type of trust and role, they have an expiration date. It's a little vague and regardless you have to apply but typically after 10 years as long as it is not a direct securities fraud conviction, you're fine, the thing is, 10 years, before that I'm reasonably sure every conviction has to go through some sort of review process. That's what I think would happen with Trump if they decide to get into this. He would go under review and then they would decide what they decide. He has kind of a wobbler because it is a fraud conviction but it's also not directly tied to securities. You could probably get some type of idea looking at someone who has committed credit card fraud or something like that and see if they have had any issues but that would require case research",
