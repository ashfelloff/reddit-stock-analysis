And the Fed has been trying to tank the real economy for the past 3 years, but they pumped too much money ($ 7 trillion) into the economy, hence the economy is still running relatively strong despite the Fed. Its Alive!\n\n**Irrational exuberance**\n\n\"Irrational exuberance\" is the phrase coined by the then-Federal Reserve Board chairman, Alan Greenspan (Fed chairman from August 11, 1987 to January 31, 2006), in a speech given at the American Enterprise Institute during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s. The phrase was interpreted as a warning that the stock market had become disconnected with the economy, and was extremely overvalued.\n\nMany have argued that the \"easy-money\" policies of the Fed during Greenspan's tenure, including the practice known as the \"Greenspan put\", were a leading cause of the dot-com bubble and subprime mortgage crisis (the latter occurring within a year of his leaving the Fed), which, said The Wall Street Journal, \"tarnished his reputation\". Yale economist Robert Shiller argues that \"once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed\". Greenspan argues that the housing bubble was not a result of low-interest short-term rates but rather was a direct consequence of high savings rates.",

These will get removed from the year over year number, and the year over year number will likely dip next month, and then go back up to high 2% or 3% by the end of 2024.

Market forecasters were largely expecting between 0.22% to 0.26%, so this was actually on the high side of the forecast.\n\n[https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1796279892423926260/photo/1](https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1796279892423926260/photo/1)\n\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240521a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20240521a.htm)\n\nFed likely needs core PCE month over month to come in at the most 0.20% (2.4% annualized) for at least 6 months before they can feel comfortable cutting. In fact, if core PCE month over month continues coming in at 0.20%, the core PCE will end 2024 at 3.0% year over year, higher than today at 2.8% YoY",
