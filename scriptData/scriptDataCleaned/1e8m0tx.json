  "score": 130,
  "selftext": "Nike's stock has plummeted from $177 to $72, a 60% drop. This was due to overestimated growth expectations; as revenues and net income flattened, so did the stock price. Key issues include reduced demand in North America and China, rising competition, and unfavorable currency exchange rates. The CEO forecasts a transition year with mid-single digit revenue declines early in the fiscal year. Although Nike's P/E ratio is double what Adidas's was during its downturn, Nike remains profitable with a strong global presence. Buying during temporary struggles might be smarter than buying at a peak, but I'm unsure about Nike's future due to unpredictable fashion trends.",

I’m not saying they are like Umbro or Fubu, but their lack of innovation has damaged their brand value in consumer eyes and people are not willing anymore to pay as much for Nike as they used to do.\n\nAnd for this problem there is no easy solution. You cannot just throw a bunch of money at it and hope things turn around. Once the consumer looks at you a certain way you need to change that narrative.\n\nIt is possible though, look at Abercrombie and Fitch",

But the reality is it moved a lot of people to consider other sneakers. I've bought Nike's for almost every shoe I've owned for over 20 years. Just on autopilot. Now I don't. And once you try other shoes, you are likely to stick with them, or at least mix it up.\n\nI'm not advocating a position in the trans debate, but Bud light makes a good analogy. Many people just bought bud-light on autopilot. It was their go to swill. Analysts kept speculating that people would calm down and go back to Bud light when the bruhaha dissipated. But if you search the news, recently, it actually dropped from 2nd most purchased beer to 3rd.\n\nSometimes, when people change a habit, they just stick with the new one. In truth, all those crappy beers taste the same.\n\nNo matter the reason for people shifting from Nike to other brands, the question is whether Nike figures out a way to get them back - better shoes, lower prices, cooler designs, etc. Otherwise, people just sort of stick with what works for them now. Just talk to someone who buys New Balance or Asics or Saucony. They probably just buy the same shoe over and over again. People need a reason to switch brands, or they stay with what works.\n\n[Exclusive | Bud Light Slips to No. 3 Best Selling Beer After Boycott Reshaped Industry - WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/business/bud-light-slips-to-no-3-after-boycott-reshaped-beer-industry-e4e9a102)",

Nike is an equity investor in the WNBA, make all of the uniforms, and a lot of its other branded merch.\n\nI just bought my kid the New Sabrina 2s for basketball season. Finally started making them in kids sizes. And you *know* Clark is getting her own shoe, which will mint cash. WNBA is a fun league to watch, and they'll just keep getting bigger.\n\nCaitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, and Angel Reese are legit superstars. The fans they've brought in, along with the degenerate gamblers from legal online betting represent a lot of eyeballs.",
