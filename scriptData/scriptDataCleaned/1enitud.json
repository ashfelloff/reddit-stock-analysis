          "body": "TQQQ's leverage resets daily. Look at the chart — it still hasn't touched its ATH from a few years ago (also look at TSLA x3 — it's going straight down)\n\nIf you buy on margin, this isn't an issue for you\n\nFor example, QQQ drops 20% today, so TQQQ (QQQ x3) falls 60%. The next day QQQ recovers 20%, so QQQ is at 1.2*0.8*100% = 96% of what it was in the beginning. TQQQ recovers 60%, so it's at 1.6*0.4*100% = 64% of where it was. Ouch.\n\nIf you buy QQQ on margin, your loss would be 100%-96% = 4% multiplied by the margin amount (e.g. 3x margin would be 12% loss). In TQQQ however that would be 100%-64% = 36%. Not to mention how long it would take to break even\n\nSo margin means you're directly following the underlying asset's price movement; it's just multiplied by margin amount. Leveraged ETFs however reset their leverage daily, and that makes them very dangerous (it's often advised not to hold them for longer than a few days, and only buy them if you want to profit from predicted volatility)",
