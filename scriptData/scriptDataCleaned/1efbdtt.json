They wanted to end that kind of access altogether, ostensibly for security reasons. AV corps, back in 2006, threatened to sue, claiming it created an unfair advantage for Defender. But also, they could have just updated their software.\n\nMicrosoft may or may not have been attempting to unfairly damage the competition when they tried to make that change, I don't know.

The recent drops are sentiment based, however Crowdstrike is still valued quite highly and only barely profitable, and only recently.  The loss in faith will hamper their future growth potential alone, even if current customer retention is sticky.  Trying to convince old, tech-illiterare c-suites to jump on your product after causing the single largest tech outage in history is probably not going to be an easy task.  Crowdstrike had an advantage of no bad news, and an easy check-mark for budgets. Now, there is going to be a lot of scrutiny on future contracts.  For a company which only recently became profitable, this is not good news. \n\n\n A potential large scale lawsuit, however, could potentially wipe out their earnings for several quarters, and if there is a pile -on effect, then it only gets worse from there.  Now add on the headwinds from reduced future growth potential, and it's basically a double whammy.  If pile-on lawsuits happen, then they are going to be entrenched in the legal system for *years*.\n\n\nThe drop last week was more or less with sentiment being \"the worst is behind them\".  The drop after hours is more like \"the worst may be yet to come\".   It only just netted $41 million this last quarter, after all. It's not an entrenched, long-term company, but rather a recent player.  However, they are still priced like they are looking at significant growth.\n\n\nOr it might reverse tomorrow, who knows.",

CrowdStrike is in the same position, they have 299 out of the top 500 but are only barely profitable, and somehow this justified an 500+ p/e because of their \"growth potential\"? Growth into what? I suppose if all of their expenses were fixed costs that would work out for them, but that probably isn't the case, and we now know they're barely spending the minimum on their internal IT so it's not like they could cut deeper.",

Any shift on their end in the future is going to cut into profit margins, and this is coupled with lower potential growth from client acquisition (it's about as bad of press as it could get, and they are now marked forever in a bad light to new clients), reduction of fees and subscriptions to appear their current clients who stay on board, potential lost revenue from those clients who may choose to migrate away, increased insurance premiums on their end, and potential lawsuits.\n\n\nI'm not saying they are going to die out and go bankrupt, but the winds are incredibly rough for them for the relatively short to medium term, and their profits and growth for the next few quarters are likely to get chewed into hard.",
