  "score": 28,
  "selftext": "As expected, Apple's (AAPL) Q1 shipments dropped this quarter. This has led to supplier stocks also suffering.\n\nAAPL itself is down a little, but has been trading in a range of $165-$175. I expect it will remain in this range until their earnings report, and then take off as WWDC approaches. \n\nMy advice would be to wait to accumulate more AAPL shares. While I believe AAPL will go higher in the long term, there could be some bumps in the next couple weeks. It's probably best to hold off on new purchases for now.",
