High growth plus high margin makes for high valuation compared to others who have low growth and lower margins. High margin is literally one of the best indicators of value for a business. You came to the internet and started trying to seem smart quoting simple metrics without the context of more important ones and then rebutted with “hopium”. You come across as someone who thinks the share price is wrong and bad instead of someone truly asking to understand. Any way, good luck with your thought process guy. ",
