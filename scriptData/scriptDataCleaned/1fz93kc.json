  "score": 148,
  "selftext": "I recently saw Netflix analyst upgrade and I looked at the market cap of 300 billion+. Is it really worth that much? I know they recently increased prices and they increased kdrama in their catalog but was there anything else? They aren't going to report about subscriber numbers anymore either. Another thing I noticed is that most entertainment companies had a negative or relatively low ytd increase, just Netflix was the outlier and had the highest one with 48%+. Anyone have any thoughts as to why it's valued so highly? ",
