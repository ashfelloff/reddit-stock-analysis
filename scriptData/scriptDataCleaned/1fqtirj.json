          "body": "The +2% pump then -5% dump you see were results of a very dramatic ruling party’s leader (and essentially prime minister) election day. \n\nJust right before Nikkei day time trading session ended, result from first round of voting came out with candidate Takaichi taking the lead. Dovish right wing lady. Stock market liked this a lot, so Nikkei pumped and ended the day time session at +2%. \n\nHowever, at the second and final round of voting, candidate Ishiba surprisingly won. Hawkish left wing guy who supports rising everything: rates, consumption tax, capital gain tax… Market said boo; Nikkei futures gapped down -3% at the beginning of night time session; circuit breaker to the down side was triggered.\n\nThe way I see it, it is less of a carry trade unwinding situation that affected US stocks like August 5th, but rather a correction from false expectation of a dovish PM. However, I would look out if USDJPY tanking below 140, as there are speculations that only half of the carry trade positions had been unwinded.",
