  "selftext": "Alright, first post fellow regards! My first DD is on Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA). Strap in and tuck in those Wendyâ€™s napkins cause this baby is about to get wet ðŸ’¦\n\nThere are only two key ingredients that are going into this centuries-old Dutch recipe. \n\n1. A gobsmackingly undervalued midstream oil company\n\n2. The best strategic tailwinds in the U.S. oil market since 1945\n\nCompany: TLDR: PAA is a midstream provider that transports and stores crude, natural gas, and other refined oil products. They make money primarily from the Frac Spread which presents a golden opportunity to dive in now. \n\n(more on this later)\n\nFinancials: Three points:\n\n1. Consistent revenue growth over the past three years, with total revenues increasing from $29.28 billion in 2021 to $33.14 billion in 2023, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.1%.\n\n2. PAA has maintained strong profitability margins, with a gross margin of 17.8% and an operating margin of 9.6% in 2023. Through a complex macro-environment for midstream players \n\n3. Balance sheet has total assets of $34.72 billion and total liabilities of $21.84 billion as of December 31, 2023. The companyâ€™s debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.08, indicating a reasonable level of leverage, especially given capital intensive Midstream business model.\n\nU.S. oil is about to have the decade of its life\n\n1. U.S. oil production is at record highs, due embargoes on Russian oil, and sanctions enacted by the Biden administration.\n\n2. Biden has his hands tied because in order to reduce inflation (fed looks at core) he needs to continue drillingâ€” which will further position the U.S. to become a crucial and reliable supplier given extremely high geopolitical tensions.\n\n3. Trump re-election is seen as a potential wildcard, with expectations of heightened demand for oil and increased premiums, prompting strategic longterm investment to capitalize on market dynamics\n\nThe kicker (frac spread)\n1. Currently, oversupply in NG depresses its prices, while NGLs maintain better demand and higher prices. PAA benefits from this spread by purchasing NG-based NGLs at lower prices and selling them at higher NGL rates. The wider the spread, the greater PAAâ€™s profit margin, making its operations more lucrative. Factors affecting the spreadâ€™s future include NG pipeline capacity and LNG export capacity. The â€˜fatnessâ€™ of the frac spread depends on whether natural gas pipeline capacity can keep up with demand growth (IT CANâ€™T)\n\n1. My plan is to ride this up all year with weeklies and transition to synthetic calls once valuation becomes more rich. That said, calls are essentially FREE at current prices (especially further out you go) Iâ€™m deep in with April 19th calls @17.50 for 20c apiece \n \n ",

Some dumb fuck bought a 2026 $20 call for .95 when they could have bought a $25 call for .30. Since this stock has low volume trades like that can skew the price but regardless you would want to stay true to the philosophy. Buy low, sell high. Buy as many contracts as possible via a ticker that is close to the current strike. \n\nExample during the SPY dip today i loaded up on $523 calls instead of something closer like $518 calls. Why? i was able to get more contracts with my money. i just need spy to go up tomorrow or the next day. Does not need to hit $23 to make a profit since SPY has so much IV you can make money off focusing on buying a lot of contracts at a low dollar amount and selling them again when demand is up",

Looking at the Chevron purchase of Hess, Exxon purchase of Pioneer, and the Chesapeake/Southwestern merger as the basis for that call. US oil and gas is having a great time right now and it looks like the biggest players are looking to bulk up their operations.   \n\n\nCRK is my LNG play since it has a long established record of stability and ok dividends. The gamble is smaller LNG companies will get the itch to follow Chesapeake and start a round of mergers. PR is a play in the Permian Basin assuming that since the largest targets have already been eaten up, anyone looking to expand in that field will naturally have to choose smaller companies. PR is a decent target given that it too has completed a major $4.5 billion acquisition just last year and has managed to keep a solid balance sheet beyond it. Your write up makes me think that this may be a good option play to compliment my equity purchasing. I'm new to options, but this seems like less regarded analysis than you see here.",
