      "body": "I think anyone can make money on crypto but also anyone can lose money on crypto.\n\nI actually did a challenge of aggressive trading and within two months I got from the starting point of 10$ to  587$. Then I got greedy cause I wanted to round it to 600 and I caught a bad trade.\n\nBut overall, a lot of crypto coins have 15 min candles that make a movement of 2 or 3%. Aggressively trading with a leverage of 30x means you can really easily make 5 to 10% per trade.\n\nWithin the two months I actually didn't have a single losing trade, until the point where I got greedy and pushed my luck. \n\nThen I tried another time, and this time being more confident in what I was doing, I got from 20$ to 400 withing two weeks. \nAnd then I got really nervous and didn't feel comfortable opening a trade and I just decided to lose it all. \n\nOverall I feel like you can make money on crypto as long as you're seriously disciplined and stick to the rules you created for yourself. And you don't get greedy chasing 50% in a day.\n\nNow, it's worth mentioning I'm an idiot and don't truly know what I'm doing, and I had some experience with futures trading but I always traded with 1 to 10$ just for the fun of it. And things went bad only when I stopped following the rules I set in place",
