  "selftext": "Every single coin toss I made has somehow gone wrong\n\nStarted on options with 10K ahead of NVDA earnings. We all know how it went. \n\nMissed DLTR's drop, was temporarily staying away from trading in my NVDA loss cope. I really would've gambled on Puts if i hadn't missed the news on Dollar General amidst my cope\n\nDecided to call on AVGO, since there weren't the sky high expectations of NVDA's as long as it performed decently, it wouldn't dip. It did. Decided to ride the momentum of AI's bad week over the weekend with outs. But the AI sector opened and closed higher for once\n\nDecided since AI wasn't too hot rn and every other related company got whacked, decided to put ORCL. And whaddya know! It pumped.\n\nLong story short, I'm down to my last 1K. And I've made every possible wrong move. With CHWY's pump, hopefully WOOF will follow suit. All in bruvs cheers and see u guys never I'm gonna be so broke after this earnings. OR...... this could finally be my salvation. If i'm right and i live through WOOF's earnings it's gonna be ADBE calls.\n\nEDIT: after chatting through the day, ADBE is a bit too hot for me and I'm shit poor. I will probably see what after-earnings play are up there for me.\nAlso I'm spreading $3 Calls & $2.5 Puts. Only way I get fked is a sideways trade. Let's go get fked\n\nEDIT 2: Wow, I really am getting fucked in every way imaginable. A sideways movement. Both calls and puts got cooked\n\nEDIT 3: Sold too early haiyaa... ",

              "body": "Oof.  Decent earnings report but as soon as Joel spoke, the stock gave up all its after hours gains.  Sounded like the CFO had a much better handle on the business.  Joel read off a script and just didn't sound confident.  \n  \nMore importantly, they still think merchandising is their area of greatest cost saving opportunity, which translates to gross margin.  At the same time, they said the business--absent a rebound in discretionary product sales--will not get back to 42% gross margin.  Sounds like there's only room for 1 or 2 points of margin improvement.  Definitely disappointing",
