  "selftext": "Hello folks,\n\nI'll be quick. Carvana (CVNA) is up 288% in the past 12 months. That's more than Nvidia (NVDA) that all of you jerk off too, but less than Abercrombie (ANF) which I'm also shorting by the way ([you can read an update in my WSB post from a few weeks back](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d3ti7t/update_on_my_anf_short_position_the_show_goes_on/)).\n\n[Used cars, generic clothes, then AI revolution](https://preview.redd.it/2c31u2ebjqcd1.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=97fe29453e965d8a0467bf73f71781038615d2f1)\n\nBack to Carvana. Last earnings, there's been numerous posts on WSB, stating how CVNA's profit margins smell like fraud because Carvana claims they make $5000+ per car, while pretty much any other used car seller in the country ain't able to do the same. (WSB post for reference from a dude claiming to have worked in auto sales for years: [I’M CALLING BS (Carvana)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cj986j/im_calling_bs_carvana/))\n\nPutting fraud and Carvana in the same sentence, should not come off as a wild dream, given that the father, Ernest Garcia II, of the current Carvana CEO, Ernest Garcia III, pled guilty to a felony bank fraud charge back in the 90s. It's literally one of the first things that pop up once you google his name.\n\nIn the past month, CVNA went up 40% from $100 to $140, for no apparent reason. Meanwhile father Garcia continuously sold his CVNA position. He held 1,177,500 shares on 2024/17/06, and was down to 187,500 shares on 7/09/2024. That's 84% of his CVNA position sold off in the past 3 weeks. [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/garcia-ernest-c-ii-30875](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/insiders/garcia-ernest-c-ii-30875)\n\nCarvana as company still has negative equity (meaning the amount it owes to its lenders is higher than all of its assets), and reported $28m in profits on $3.06b of revenue (0.91% net profit margin).\n\nNot to mention that selling used cars is not a proprietary business, and can be easily replicated by numerous other Carvana copy cats and dealerships. Garcia Senior probably understands this too, hence why he's selling his CVNA shares and I'll join too by first borrowing CVNA shares (cause I don't have any) and then selling it into the open market just like him.\n\nBasically PTON at $150, SNAP at $80 and SHOP at $160 story but for used cars.\n\nThank you for reading.",

This thesis was true when it was at $40 per share, $80 per share, when it spiked to $120 per share after last earnings, and now at $142 per share. People have been shorting it since much lower prices and are now getting squeezed. You might be right but it might only go down after this ultra bullish market first squeezes it to $250 per share. Shorting \"overvalued\" companies simply because they seem overvalued has been the doom for many people in the past, so be patient and wait. If you miss it, then oh well, move on.",

Root's share price and volatility has increased since then, increasing the value of the warrants, but I don't see how they could justify using the value of the Root warrants on some date other than the end of the quarter just to suit themselves.\n\nThe real question though is - what is the fraud?
