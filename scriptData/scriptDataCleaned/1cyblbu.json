Nowadays, it's more accurate to say students learn libraries to do said AI research - like PyTorch or JAX - that rely on CUDA under the hood. So needing to know CUDA is abstracted away.\n\nCUDA programming is for those trying to squeeze performance out of the GPU and more so an engineering problem than a research problem, which is a very different skillset. That being said, there are rockstars working at OpenAI and such who can do both.",

You could buy AMD for cheaper but the amount of software issues with drivers and random crashes was a very apparent thing. \n\nAnd now I just realized I'm replying to the goat you personally inspired me to get back into the game and begin selling options and using margin.

This is more simply referred to as \"advanced packaging\" and is needed to create the complex final products and TSMC is the only game in town (unless you want to give Intel a shot, which no one is willing to do right now).  Then you get into the required memory, HBM3 and HBM3e used in the AI accelerators.  There are three suppliers in the world, Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix.  Nvidia has bought all of Micron and SK Hynix's supply through early/mid 2025 already.  Samsung apparently can't pass Nvidia's validation to become a supplier to them, but Samsung does supply AMD (so AMD has lower quality standards?).  \n\nSo the reality is, for the next 12-18 months, there is little to no capacity for any competitive alternatives outside of Nvidia and AMD, because you can't access the manufacturing or acquire the necessary memory.  And Nvidia simply has an entire ecosystem that they've thought out and can deploy en-mass with a robust and mature software development suite.  \n\nAnd if we FFWD 18 months, because of the head start Nvidia got and the lack of any competitive alternatives, Nvidia simply becomes the market leader and no one is going to stray from that with so much established capacity in place.",

There’s a reason even consumers are often forced to grab nvidia over competitors because the software they are buying the hardware to run literally requires a nvidia device.

Walmart has a net profit margin of under 3%. Apple is known for having the best financials with a net profit margin of ~26% (and due to that, making up a large part of legendary investor Warren Buffet’s portfolio). Many companies have a profit margin that goes no higher than 20%, and only the best of the best usually beat it. Nvidia had somewhere under a ~15% net profit margin less than 5 years ago, and they’ve raised it almost quadruple that. The AI boom has raised Nvidia from a little-traded regular large-cap, to the third most valuable company on the planet behind other mega-cap companies Microsoft and Apple.",
