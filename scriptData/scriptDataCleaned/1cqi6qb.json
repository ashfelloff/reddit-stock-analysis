It's like every block here has at least 1-2 houses on the market, or just sold. I've *never* seen that before\n\nNot sure if it's quite as bad as the pandemic bonanza where it was buyers waive inspection, waive contingency, all-cash offers, 30% over asking bidding wars. Waiving inspection and contingency was the norm for awhile (and really fucking stupid!), so I hope people stopped doing that. But it's not far behind.\n\nIt's strange how many houses are selling en masse here but also still sky high prices. Either people are still buying all-cash offers or have so much money that the interest rates don't matter??",

Your landlord could raise rent on your type of unit by $1,000 but if you have 11 months left on your lease, it wouldn't affect you.\n\nThis invariably creates a lag in the rent portion of the CPI - And the same lag is evidenced as rents drop.
