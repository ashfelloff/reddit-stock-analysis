  "selftext": "It seems the market today shrugged off hot inflation and the bull run continues ! 3.5 percent inflation , nobody gives a shit!\n\nThinking about it, why is the fed so insistent on 2 percent inflation anyway . Do you regards feel like US could start adjusting to the new normal of higher inflation but still have high economic growth ? Higher inflation is quite common in developing countries like India at the same time as high growth . \n\n",

No one has to vote to increase taxes, we don't have to cut programs, we just watch our debts decrease by 2 to 10% a year.  What's our national debt right now?  32 trillion?  5% annual inflation rate means that the real cost of the debt decreases by 1.6 trillion a year.  Not a bad deal.

In point of fact, I have yet to figure out how the 3.5% number showed up when, when you dig into inflation numbers, all the components that contribute are higher than 3.5%.  Remember - they change how they calculate inflation and the CPI year over year to minimize the reported impact.  They can make similar replacements.  For example, one year beef prices skyrocket so they swap with chicken.  Next year beef is stagnant at the new price while chicken skyrockets, so they swap to beef.  CPI and inflation are lower, but both prices went up extensively.",

It's also bad for countries using treasury notes for reserve which means they'll start dumping the petrodollar. The petrodollar only work(ed) for a number of reasons, one being that we'll ruthlessly and insanely bomb any country that doesn't use it (cough Libya) or stage a coup if they try to buddy up with someone else -- so its backed by military and intelligence forces (combat might). But the primary reason it works is inflationary stability (economic might) in that a dollar is going to have roughly the same value/desirability in the future.  \n\nAlso program costs go up with inflation which means having to spend more and money money on them (medicare, ss, VA, food, national parks service, etc) so it just means programs (which have a fixed budget) get more starved and worse over time.\n\nMost of the US debt is one that it owes itself, that is, we print money and give ourselves an IOU that we'll totally pay back bro.

You have no understanding of our monetary system at all.\n\n  \nFirst of, if tax revenue is increased or decreased, same with bond revenue (more or less), it doesn't effect TGA (treasury account). So tax revenue doesn't fund our spending account, nor does bonds. National Debt is basically a misnomer. It's a better term to describe A) when a country takes out debt in foreign currency, or B), the federal interest payments. As in the interest payments are closer to a \"debt\" than the actual \"national debt.\"\n\n  \nThat number that we call the national debt is really just money the govt left in the economy to serve as growth, and has yet to tax back yet. So if there's $100 in the entire economy, we tax $25, there is now $75 (liquidity). Govt needs to spend $25 to get back to $100. Except if we only spend $25 to get back to $100, inflation is tearing at the value of people's savings (retirement savings). So how can people save for retirement? Besides, our supply chains are always increasing, our population is always increasing, our productivity is increasing. That is to say, the economy can handle more money in the system as it too grows.\n\nThe Fed gets a bond, with interest (which they return to Prime Banks). Then at bond maturity, they simply move money from one of their accounts (connected to US Gov), to another. like moving from a checking to a savings. \n\n  \nPeople get scared of big T numbers, but the US Gov often redeems up to $120 Trillion worth of bonds with no issues. US owns the currency, so it cannot default. It's more like the bank in monopoly putting money into the game for the users to continue to use to play.",

When such a feeling is pervasive the response could cause a sudden collapse in demand across the board. That then triggers a sudden halt in growth and it's a self-perpetuating cycle.

Name any metric to measure by and the dollar is strong! The shutdowns were to avoid the spread of a disease that cojld've wiped out a significant portion of the population which would've caused even more economic decline as people were stricken with panic. You can cry about the stimulus, but it worked. Keep lying to yourself. The Lockdowns worked. The Stimulus worked. Every developed country is surprised at how fast the US Economy rebounded.",

The side effect is high inflation.  It was the Feds job to see the stimulus  and counter act the inflationary trajectory to create a stable economy. Instead the Fed decided to do their own thing and wait for the stimulus to take effect. That is why inflation got away from them. However, if by complaining about inflation means it is massive then you have a lot to learn. The inflation was bad, but not massive. \n\nLockdowns didn't cause inflation, that's not even logical. Lockdowns would cause deflation: Demand drops + Supply stays at same level => Prices drop. Instead, it is when Supply Drops + Demand Stays Level => Prices rise. No, it wasn't lockdowns but supply chain disruptions that added to the inflation, but that part was transitory. Especially, since the gov't did a great job of tackling those disruptions before they became overwhelming.\n\nYou should spend more time understanding basic economics, so you don't make illogical statements. It makes it clear why you blame the wrong people for things, that are simply not their fault.",

This is all macroeconomics - statistics and educated guesses, but unless someone figures out a better solution it's the current consensus that most of the world agrees upon.\n\nUSA is not a developing country so there's no point in comparing with India. Their higher inflation rate is, as far as I know, a byproduct of rapid growth. We're talking about hitting above 5% yearly GDP growth most of the time.",
