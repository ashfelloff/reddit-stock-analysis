  "selftext": "Am I trying to pump this stock? Maybe. Does Drake have a daughter? Allegedly \n\nBut for real. Reddit is the 3rd most visited website in the United States. It's market cap is only at $7 billion. CAVA, a company that sells albeit, pretty good mediterranean food bowls, has a market cap of $8 billion. \n\n\n\nWhy is Reddit worth so little, when similar companies like Pinterest and Twitter are worth 5X that? \n\nBecause they haven't historically advertised as well or as much, and don't have other successful cash generating products like premium accounts and marketplace platforms. \n\n\n\nHow much of the traffic is bots? \n\nLet's gamble and find out. \n\n\n\nWhat's the upside?\n\n1. There's so little downside to taking the risk. The company's not going to drop that much below it's current market cap. \n2. The company is easily one of the most influential platforms for the foreseeable future. The opportunity to build cash generating products on top of it are endless. \n3. Google search engine recently updated it's algorithm to promote user generated counted, increasing Reddit's traffic exponentially. \n\n  \nWhat's the downside?\n\nThe only thing I don't like is that Reddit's Executive Team owns a large majority of shares. I think this will be a barrier for allowing Reddit to innovate and monetize. \n\n\n\nPosition: 40k at 44.5 a share",

That however would require a higher level of knowledge to do safely. I would recommend doing it via VPN to your home network, that is easier and safer. Running a public facing DNS server is something only actual experts should do.\n\nThere are ad blockers for mobile, but naturally enough they rarely work at an app level.\n\nI despise \"engagement\" myself.

I'm an old internet guy and I've run similar projects for similar companies.  Reddit will figure out how to monetize better -- it's just a matter of time and multivariate testing.  You can't engineer a community like this -- it's organic and defies competition.  It's deeply and broadly valuable, and Google's recent refactoring reflects that.  It's hard to see when you're here every day, staring at the flaws, but I've made that mistake before.  I was an avid auctionweb/ebay user in 1996 and 1997, and it was a total hack back then.  I think the servers may have been in the back of Pierre's closet.  When they went public in 1998, I didn't participate because I couldn't imagine that \"normal\" people would be interested.  I was wrong.  Very wrong.  We're here and we're also not that unusual.",

By accident they seem to be about the only place to get a reliable opinion on anything since AI and affiliates have ruined the rest of the internet.\n\nImagine if Zuck got his hands on this. High earners, too ugly for insta or indeed leaving the house. So instead of just losing your money on 20:1 leveraged bets because one of your gamer hermits said ‘trust me bro’, you could spend that money meeting hot milfs in your area?\n\nNo way Meta could get away with buying this, but surely somebody will - I can never get over how many times I get served an ad for printing software solutions, I’m unemployed, don’t even know what it means, but have never in my life even thought of buying a printer. \n\nOP is spot on tho. Crazy traffic with user generated content. I don’t go on political forums - but honestly can’t recall astroturfing - pretty hard to game the upvote downvote system. One of the world’s biggest websites, at $8bn makes it ranked 1500 in the world.\n\nAnd crazily, they have 150m MAUs in US, but only 14% are logged in DAUs. That ratio is 75% at moron catnip Facebook. Just enshittify the site with Moronic pop ups and walled content and watch RDDT fuck\n\nAnd Facebook gets $300 ARPU. Reddit gets $30 per logged in user. You don’t even need a fucking algorithm. We fuckwits literally list all the shit we are into and even write 1000s and 1000s of words that tell our whole life stories, in the exact tone and style we speak in. \n\nEvery company ad feels like a 50 year old trying to get down with the kids. Can’t believe WSB isn’t crammed full of get-rich-quick shite.\n\n“Join our free* course on what the government won’t tell you - how to turn cum rags into gold!” \n\n*not free.\n\nIn fact I’ve just talked myself into buying some of this shit tomorrow. Then just gotta wait for Ackman to strap on his BBC dildo and get new management in to 100x this, albeit(!) trashing the site its users know and hate in exchange for more gullible simpletons who will be buying “how to pray for gold in your zip code” books like there is no tomorrow.",
