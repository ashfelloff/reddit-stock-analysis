  "title": "$100K to invest in GOOGL long term (stock, options or both?)",
  "score": 371,
  "selftext": "I think GOOGL is very cheap right now, trading at a multiple less than the S&P 500. They have $100B in cash on the books and have a FCF of $44B. And yet, their P/E multiple is less than the S&P 500 average P/E. Do we really think GOOGLE is just an average of the top 500 large companies in the US? Hell no. So I want to invest $100K into it. I currently own about $10K of leaps for Jan 2026. Wondering if people would recommend $80K in straight GOOGL (or GOOG) stock, then another $20K in long term options (leaps) ranging in strike price from $140-$225? What would be your split? What type of strike prices would you target for options?  \n\n",

Here’s what ChatGPT says:\n\nWhen a company undergoes a corporate action like a spin-off, merger, or split into multiple companies, the handling of long-term options (LEAPS) is governed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). The specific treatment depends on the nature of the corporate action. Here’s how LEAPS might be affected if a company splits into multiple companies:\n\n### **Scenario: Company A Splits into Companies B, C, and D**\nIf Company A splits into three separate entities—Company B, Company C, and Company D—your LEAPS (long-term call options) would generally be adjusted to reflect the new structure. Here’s what typically happens:\n\n1. **Adjustment of Options Contracts**:\n   - The original LEAPS on Company A would not disappear. Instead, they would be adjusted to reflect the ownership in the new companies (B, C, and D).\n   - The strike price and the number of shares covered by the option might be adjusted to account for the new distribution of shares.\n\n2. **Creation of New Options**:\n   - In many cases, new options will be created for Companies B, C, and D, and your original LEAPS might be converted into a package of options that cover all three companies. This is known as a **”package”** or **”basket”** option.\n   - For example, if you originally held 1 LEAPS contract on Company A, after the split, you might hold an adjusted contract that represents a certain number of shares in Company B, Company C, and Company D, combined.\n\n3. **Contract Symbol Change**:\n   - The ticker symbol of your option might change to reflect the new companies and the adjusted terms.\n\n4. **Strike Price and Number of Shares**:\n   - The strike price of your LEAPS might be adjusted downward to account for the distribution of the new companies.\n   - The number of shares the option controls could be altered to maintain the equivalent value before and after the corporate action. For example, instead of 100 shares of Company A, your option might now cover 50 shares each of Companies B, C, and D.\n\n5. **Expiration Date**:\n   - The expiration date of your LEAPS would typically remain the same.\n\n### **Example**:\nSuppose you held a LEAPS call option on Company A with a strike price of $100, covering 100 shares. If Company A splits into Companies B, C, and D, and each new company trades at $40 per share after the split, your original option might be adjusted as follows:\n\n- Your option might now give you the right to purchase 100 shares in each of Companies B, C, and D at a proportionately adjusted strike price.\n- Alternatively, you could end up with three separate options: one for each new company, with adjusted strike prices and share amounts.\n\n### **Important Considerations**:\n- **Notification**: You would receive a notification from your broker about the specific adjustments made to your options contracts.\n- **No Action Required**: Typically, as an options holder, you don’t need to take any action—the adjustments are automatically processed by the OCC.\n- **Value Preservation**: The adjustments are designed to preserve the intrinsic value of your original options, ensuring that you’re not disadvantaged by the corporate action.\n\n### **Conclusion**:\nWhen a company like Company A splits into multiple companies (B, C, and D), your LEAPS will be adjusted to reflect the new structure. This adjustment ensures that your options maintain their value relative to the new companies. You’ll receive a detailed explanation from your broker regarding how the options have been modified, but the core idea is that you’ll continue to hold a position that reflects the new corporate structure.",

Right now, it's all shares.\n\nHowever, I was thinking that I'd do better with a bit of leverage and instead buying LEAPs, or half LEAPs, half shares or something like that.\n\nHere's my question about LEAPs:\n\nLet's say that I buy 50k worth of LEAPs in GOOG with a strike price of $230 and the LEAP expires say Jan 2026.\n\nThe big worry that I'd have, would be if late 2022 happened all over again, and Google somehow plummeted back into the $130's or lower.\n\nMy question is..... Let's say this happened later this year because of some black swan event or something... Just as a hypothetical. Would there be any chance that the stock could rally back enough in early to mid 2025 that I'd be able to get most of my money back, or would I be toast on the 50k?\n\nThis is basically what I don't understand about options. I know it's the theta or whatever. It's the depreciation of the value of the contract due to time passing, and the price not being where you want it to be at that point.\n\nCould I buy the same type of option, but instead of Jan 2026, it'd be Jan 2027? But of course the cost of the contracts would rise exponentially.\n\nEhh... I get an ice-cream headache thinking about this stuff, that's why I just stick with shares.",

                      "body": "LEAPs could offer a way to leverage your position in Google, allowing you to control a larger amount of stock with a smaller investment compared to buying more shares outright.. They do come with their own risks though, particularly related to theta decay that you mentioned. While LEAPs have lower theta decay than short-term options, it's still a factor to consider. If Google’s stock price drops significantly, sure, the value of your LEAPs could decrease. However, if the stock price recovers before the LEAPs expire, the value of your options could potentially increase too. It's a gamble. Opting for LEAPs with a longer expiration, such as January 2027, would give the stock more time to recover, but these options are more expensive due to the longer time value (which you also mentioned). A mixed strategy involving both LEAPs and shares might balance leverage with stability..",
