One electric car company among others. And the brand is nothing special either. \n\nWhy buy a Tesla if you could get BYD, Nio, Porsche, VW? \n\nSome simply prefer Chinese cars (due to price, better localization or patriotic reasons).\nThose who want a luxury foreign car can simply go for Porsche or Mercedes. \nWhat niche does Tesla fill? \n\nI live in Europe and drive a Tesla, but honestly I don't see how in todays marketTesla has a superior product. It's good, but others are good too. I think my next car might very likely not be a Tesla.",

Tesla does compete with its domestic counterparts like Ford, Chevy, and GM when it comes to fit and finish. \n\nTesla does still have an advantage with its charging network, highway assist, and mobile app support. Plus it's great in 0 to 60, but that novelty wears out quick for the most part. \n\nOnce the Koreans and Germans get EV factories in America, Tesla will have an even MORE difficult time to convince consumers to choose their brand over the other guys. \n\nOh and Elon Musk is an absolute deranged man at this point.",

Plus, if you're a luxury brand you don't want to have cheap models as that dilutes the value of the luxury brand.\n\nTesla was a great thing when it came out, it was way ahead of competition and they pretty much alone are responsible for the push towards electric in the last decade (whether that is good or bad is irrelevant).\n\nBut today major manufacturers have mostly caught up, and Tesla really doesn't have much that makes it stand out no matter what parameter we look at. It's not a luxury brand as Mercedes, BMW etc.. offer more luxurious EVs. It's not a cheap brand as chinese companies offer cheap EVs, along with traditional manufacturers like Renault.

From a safety perspective, their lower density lithium phosphate batteries are actually a game changer (and Tesla uses them as well). And now, they (BYD) are working on sodium batteries which will NOT require blood minerals anymore.\n\nAnd, let’s face it: EV’s are basically batteries on wheels (although some people claim they’re computers on wheels).\n\nIf you focus on “batteries on wheels”, you get affordable electric cars (like BYD’s Sewgull). Unfortunately, Tesla is focusing on the “computer on wheels” idea and that’s not what the market needs. \n\nMost people use the computer that they carry (cell phones) in cars for navigation and music and it’s a matter of time before manufacturers link up the car’s parameters from the CAN bus to display things like tire pressure, climate settings etc on to the phone.",
