It won't be the fanciful world some envision,and frankly I see it being a lot more \"boring\" than anything else, but boring is where money is made.\n\n\nIn fact, the AI craze seems eerily similar to the 90s era internet.  A novelty to most, however with infinite potential to the broader economy and world.  Finding the winners will likely reap good rewards, and that is likely to mean focusing on companies that are currently proving the ability to properly capitalize on the technology.",

CRM with thousand of duplicate entries and a general lack of incentive for sales people to probe client history across different region all with slightly different set of tool. \n\nLooks like we are trying to do something with copilot in the Microsoft suite. Now when we book appointment or enter in new order. We get prompt if the same client/ company has reach out to multiple sales in our company, their appointment with us etc and even lay out it out in clearer term. Client A has schedule meeting with sale 1 and sale 2 both in the same week and sale 2 has a quotation that is 3x the revenue of sales 1 with same requirement etc. \n\nPreviously without ai, CRM still does does this but it was a lot dumber in comparison. For example they can prompt you if you have duplicate entry but it would not be able to differentiate that common name. Having 100 Susan Wong in the system without differentiating that they all work for different companies. Things like that. \n\nMost consumer won’t realize these thing. The biggest huddle with using AI for business need is the requirement for privacy which is what mega corporation want control of when they “invest” in AI\n\nLong term result up for debate at the moment. But IMO the market havnt really look at AI outside of consumer usage",

They will also lower their price to be competitive and Nvidia will have to follow. They will no longer be able to sell a 2K$ GPU with more memory 100K$. They will have to sell them maybe for half the price or less. That's still good profit, but that mean like you need twice the unit for the same profit.\n\nBecause actually contrary to what people think they all know how to do it. Apple, the various GPU makers for android phones, AMD and Nvidia. This is just that say AMD focussed on providing the CPU/GPU on the playstations and xbox, Nvidia focused on that niche market of server scientific computing and the other focused on the much bigger market of smartphones. Counting that most high-end smartphones already have specialized AI units. They have been there for years to help the siri/ok google, do the instant modifications on your photos, provide chips for cars and so on.\n\nNow that the server market is maybe 10-20X bigger or something like that, everybody will invest there.\n\nOn top it is now illegal for Nvidia to sell their most powerful chips to China. And as such China and the Chinese government plan to catch up with their own chips. As they have no choice and this is ideological, they will not care and go all in, even if they lose money. And more importantly, they have a market that most likely US companies can't touch as guaranteed income. But China will try to sell its chips everywhere.\n\nAll these actors may not be as good as Nvidia being late a few years to the party but they will simply sell with standard margin or even at cost to create a market share for themselves. Nvidia will have to reduce their margin and will make less from each unit sold.\n\nAnd in a time frame of say 5 years, it is hard to be sure an alternative design could not win. After all Nvidia did replace 3DFX that was the leader at a time. In tech, this kind of things happen.\n\nAnd all of this is relevant only if the demand keep up. Chances are the investment levels we see know are because everybody need the gear. Later they will replace it as a reduced peace.",
