          "body": "I would take a look at small caps stocks. Find a company that is down the line from a larger one. For example: Bitcoin…needs mining companies. There are several that have done well. They work for the most part in tandem with each other. Since Bitcoin trades 24/7, monitor on futures exchange and you will have a ruff idea of how its trading upon opening.  CLSK I know like the back of my hand and buy calls mostly when it dips below a certain dollar value. What’s nice is the stock is not that expensive hence the option contracts are not expensive. Anytime I hear Bitcoin was coming I by a call or put. Mostly I focus on after Bitcoin dumps and then load up on CLSK calls. I then put an expiration date a month out…if the. Was is good and the stock jumps, which it normally does by 4 to 7 bucks, I sell out. I can sell all my contracts or keep one and let it ride for awhile longer but the Greeks come in and start messing up the values so be smart.\n\nIf you need any other advice hit me up. I am pulling on average 500 to 1500 profit I. Each contract. It’s not hundreds of thousands but for me it is a great, safe amount I can build with. \n\nCheers",

The odds makers made her 15/1. The Oaks runs Friday and odds continue to change right up until they spring the latch (open the starting gate). Standard disclaimers apply, LOL.
