It’s simple, you’re not doing rising doji handle cup astrology. \n\nYou’re just saying hey for a year you have this defined uptrend. It broke above that trend. The top of the trend it broke above should act as resistance. If it breaks below it it could go all the way down to the bottom of the old trend. If it breaks below that it’s fucked it’s in a downtrend. \n\n\nBc you’re just drawing lines from higher highs and higher lows. The higher highs and higher lows define an uptrend\n\nIf you started making lower highs and lower lows you’d be in a downtrend\n\nThere’s nothing crazy going on here it’s totally reasonable. I don’t advise trading solely off TA like this but if you wanted to buy NVDA this is a very good spot, from a TA standpoint, to buy it",
