With colleges charging $60k+ just for tuition, the time required to reach parity with a non-college degree is significantly longer. \n\nAnd add in the fact that there are some really decent paying jobs that don't require college degrees, the math becomes even worse. \n\nAnd don't get me started on how long it takes to pay off if you get some regarded degree like art-history or philosophy. Colleges should literally not be allowed to charge the same for that dumb shit.",
