      "body": "If beef goes up 150%, they just ignore most of it and say everyone will now eat the cheaper alternative of chicken, which only went up 3%. Hence meat inflation is only 4%. They systematically reduce the weights in the CPI calculation of items that went up a lot and increase the weight of items that went up less or went down. In other words, the government says \"if you just decrease your quality of life, inflation isn't that bad\".",

You‚Äôre seeing that happen now from grocery stores to fast food restaurants. They‚Äôre all advertising ‚Äúdeals‚Äù for customers now üôÑ",
