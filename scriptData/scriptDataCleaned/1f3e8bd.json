  "selftext": "The 10y/2y yield curves have been inverted since the summer of 2022. It appears today will be the first day it uninverts during intraday trading AND closes uninverted. Seems unlikely it inverts again during the present Fed rate cycle without something catastrophic coming along to make it do so.\n\nThis will have been the deepest inversion for the longest period of time in America's history. There is no playbook for this. During the period of modern economic and fiscal policy we live in, however, a yield curve inversion and uninversion has preceded every single economic recession on record.\n\nWhat happens next as we head into the most unknown waters I have personally ever experienced fellow regards? Do we sink or sail from here?\n\nMy personal belief is we're fucked. But hey the memes have been real!",
