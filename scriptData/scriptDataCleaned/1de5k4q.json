  "selftext": "Hey all together,\n\nMy favourite stock is ZIM.  \nlet¬¥s take a look, why:\n\nZIM pays 50% of the EBIT as a dividend. (look company policy on the ZIM Homepage)  \n30% each quarter and the other 20% per year.\n\nActual situation:  \nthe global Container price Index is the most important factor for earnings and EBIT.  \nIf we take a look to the drewry Index we see:\n\n[https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry](https://www.drewry.co.uk/supply-chain-advisors/supply-chain-expertise/world-container-index-assessed-by-drewry)\n\nthe container index was 250% higher than 1 year ago.\n\nbecause of the Suez crises the index is on an maximum in the moment.\n\nZIM needs a freight rate near by 1.400$ to be profitable.  \nThe freight rate index increase over 250%.\n\nQ1 was the first profitable quarter since Q1 2023, and there was a dividend. (0,23$ per share).  \nBecause the global container index influence the freight rate from ZIM with a time shirt, the sales volume of ZIM will increase in Q2 2024 extremely.\n\nZIM needs near to 1.4 billions per quarter to be profitable.\n\nIn Q2 the sales volume will be over 2 billion, so that ZIMs EBIT will be over 600 Million.  \n300 Million will be dividend (180 million directly, 120 million at the end of the year). There are 120 million share, so the dividend will be 2,50$ per share.\n\nThe markt cap is today by 2 Billion, so that the profit of 1 quarter is ca. 30% of the whole market cap.\n\nThe actual situation for the freight indexes is growing because of the conflict in Israel the Huthi shot on the vessels and they are not passing the Suez kanal.  \nBecause of this the vessels need 14 days longer to drive over south africa.  \nIn the moment there are also trouble in Chinas harbours and the container index increase.\n\nSo the price will be increase more and more.\n\nWith increasing Container freight indexes the EBIT of ZIM increase parallel.\n\nIn my Opinion ZIM is a no brainer.\n\nIt is also Shorted over 20%... so there is another chance to increase.\n\nwhat do you think about it?\n\nPS: sorry for my bad english, I am a german guy ;-)",
