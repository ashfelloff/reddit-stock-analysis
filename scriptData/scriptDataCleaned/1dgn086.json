With the XLK etf rebalancing the odds of NVDA going up next week are massive so I decided to gamble a little bit and see if I can take a quick Profit on Monday. \n\n  \nThe plan is to sell the shares at open if NDVDA is up by any decent amount and let the calls run at least for the rest of the day, based on how well we are doing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7ppg0dswsr6d1.png?width=3220&format=png&auto=webp&s=7404b82d37cae11b0311ea1496f26c8da0789cfe\n\n",
