  "score": 606,
  "selftext": "Coming out of the Great Financial Crisis, Apple was a stock that was criminally undervalued, despite being a massive brand already. Over the years, there weren’t any groundbreaking inventions (outside of expanding their services), yet the stock still managed to significantly outperform the market. Even Warren Buffett, who bought in later, snagged it at a great valuation.\n\nNow that the Fed seems to be normalizing rates and the economy has shown resilience, I’m thinking about which companies might be \"hiding in plain sight\" today.\n\nA lot of people are betting on AI related plays, with many pointing to TSMC and ASML as indirect winners. I get the logic, but I believe that, no matter how successful they become, these companies will still trade at lower valuations compared to their U.S. counterparts. Money just tends to flow into U.S. equities first and foremost.\n\nPersonally, I think Meta is the best positioned among the \"Magnificent 7.\" The TikTok threat has mostly passed, and it could even be a net positive for Meta not to be viewed as a monopoly anymore. Plus, I don’t think their AI and AR/VR investments are fully priced into the stock yet.\n\nAmazon is lagging the other mega caps in terms of valuation, but there’s still some uncertainty around how well Andy Jassy will perform in the long term.\n\nAny stocks you guys are eyeing? I’m particularly interested in established companies with consistent growth that still seem under represented.\n\n\ntldr: Apple was once undervalued despite being a massive brand, and I'm wondering which companies today are in a similar position. AI stocks like TSMC/ASML seem popular, but I think Meta is well positioned due to AI/AR investments not yet fully priced in. Amazon also lags but could be worth watching under new leadership. What are your hidden gems?",

Meta - 18 months ago. RKLB or ASTS may 100x in 10 years - but they’re still tiny companies not making money yet. LLY isn’t cheap. My answer - beats me.",

Navitas is currently the only pure play in this field, but any company shifting to it will do. That and silicon carbide. \n\nWhy? All the amazing things that google, meta and the rest of the magnificent 7 are working on is truly that... Amazing. Except for the fact that these advancements have surpassed the limit in which traditional silicon chips can supply power economically. There are almost no options out there for consumers to drive the next generation of GPUs. Silicon produces too much heat and is not at all efficient at delivering power while switching at high rates. \n\nGallium Nitride will be the pick and shovel industry for the next generation of technology. At a third of the size of Silicon based PSUs, GaN can provide higher throughout (3x worth) at lower heat. A smaller form factor means you can scale more in a data warehouse that is tight for space. Companies will save millions on cooling only. Electric vehicles will be able to charge in half the time or less without melting their connectors. Solar panels will be able to convert and store energy more efficiently increasing power collected and driving down cost. \n\nIt's like the rest of the world created the fastest engines ever but the tire industry is just starting to develop the technology needed for those engines to go full speed. GaN is already showing up in many places including hundreds of smart phones and mobile charges. EVs and solar is moving towards it. \n\nI expect a lot of these companies to be acquired honestly but if you're excited about where GPUs and machine learning is going, keep an eye on its biggest handicap right now, and that is power consumption and our inability to deliver it. We're still in the euphoria stage of ML discovery but when it becomes fully integrated in our lives, it will drive the price up of these companies drastically.",
