They’re alright at $170 even if AI goes nowhere. Meanwhile Nvidia is selling at 60x earnings, and AMD is selling at 178x earnings? It’s hard for me to buy any semi stock other than QCOM at this point. Can somebody explain this? ",

Furthermore, they have increased their capex for almost 2 years now and it's probably getting to a point where they need to slow down and observe the results of their investments, especially when their revenue growth YoY is starting to decelerate.",

I’m not as familiar with AMDs products so I wouldn’t personally touch that, but if it has skin in AI scaling, take it.\n\nThe thing is, we are in a tech war with scaling gen AI systems with the biggest, most profitable and cash rich companies. They have not seen a slowing of results through scaling, and none of them can cut back on spending while the others are still spending. If they do, they will fall behind and may never catch up. In fact, even more players are continuing to enter the race.\n\nThis will not end until some other resource depletes and gates scaling. Right now it’s silicon, next will likely be energy. Utilities, batteries, etc.\n\nOr, when scaling AI systems shows decreasing returns. But this is hard to define because a small increase in neural net size (relatively, say 10x) for say 100x the cost SEEMS on the surface to be a poor investment. You get 1/10 of the scale per unit of cost. However what matters is capability, and then application of that capability.\n\nThis may go on for several years, or more.

Snapdragon X surely offers ARM as first for Windows, but we will need to see sales before concluding them the winner. Intel's Lunar lake more closely copies the M chips from Apple. Meanwhile, sales have slumped for Apple on the M series as the upgrades becomes less and less, while there is a big chunk of upgrades for Windows, similar is expected but with more competition. QCOM is big in mobile, but again, many competitors with recent Huawei ban, Google's chips for Pixel etc. catching up to speed, QCOM is not market leader at the moment, etc.\n\nI think QCOM was a great buy before people started to discover it when NVDA went amok, I think they are decently priced now with potential upside, just not sure how high an upside and whether we will see the chip market slump a bit before taking off again.\n\nCurious to hear other's opinion and analysis.\n\nEDIT: Brooos and the event I had not expected, a lot of talk about it, but still sounded a bit unlikely - Apple has dropped QCOM for cellular chips due to in-house efforts.

Company I work for will never use ARM laptops, I am absolutely sure about it. It would require supporting tools for two architectures for absolutely no gain whatsoever.

Battery life is great and the high performance for office related apps are the most important. I see your point in many Windows user also using prof software that is currently not running on ARM. But with the performance of various video editing software etc. on M chips, I would hope prof software moves to ARM soon enough. But the vast variety offered for Windows with AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, etc. chips, it makes the transition hard or even impossible.

It just so happens that ARM has a flexible licence that did not constrain Apple in terms of manufacturing. Intel designing and manufacturing their CPUs meant that once they fell behind in one area, the whole product is not very compelling. Only recently did Intel removed that constrain from their product team - they are now allowed to manufacture their designs externally. \n\nWhich leads us to what you've mentioned in your first post. Intel is going to introduce Lunar Lake soon, which is an x86 design specifically built for battery life and efficiency in mind. What's important is that they will use leading-edge TSCM nodes for production, as well as simplifying the power delivery design to make them easier to deploy in a predictable manner by their partners.\n\nMost probably this will make Snapdragon X Elite completely redundant three months after release.",
