However, it pales in comparison to the numbers who will just stick with the status quo - either from not knowing how, being afraid of getting caught, or just not worth the hassle.\n\nNetflix has proven that most people don’t care enough to cancel and pirate the content instead. And that is exactly as it should be, because if too many start pirating you won’t have the content in the first place.",
