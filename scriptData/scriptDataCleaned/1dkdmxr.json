  "selftext": "I have 4.5 shares of ULTA in my portfolio atm, and I can't wrap my mind around why the stock keeps going down. I bought after the CEO made his stupid comment, thinking the market over reacted, and bought more right before quarterly reports, and again today. \n\nBased of quarterly reports it seems like the stock is still pretty good, I think it was over inflated before but after reports released it seems clear that the company isn't in any real danger. Not to mention it seems like every news article I see on ULTA is positive weather it be them teaming with doordash, or all the articles saying its a good buy right now, yet stock price keeps lowering. Does anyone have an explanation?\n\nP.S obligatory this is not financial advice, just me being confused why the numbers aren't going up.",

I took a very deep look at ELF vs ULTA, as well as luxury and foreign tickers that all kind of get lumped together.\n\nIf you're not a person who wears makeup, follows all the influencers on youtube, and all the rest you're definitely going to struggle when it comes to picking a winner here.\n\nULTA could turn this around and you're smart to be holding, or they just keep sliding until you give up on it. You're the only one who can decide what you do, but I declined to buy it and only didn't go big on ELF at 160 or so because it was lower down on my plays and I noped out for other options. In my eyes it was a sure fire buy and hold, and ULTA was a hard pass.\n\nTo answer your question its basically because ULTA is losing low income / price conscious customers to bigger retailers who undercut their prices, and they're losing higher end value customers to Sephora.  You can find most UTLA-level product at places like T J Maxx and Kohls for a fraction of the price, and going with people who are shopping at ULTA comparatively - in my personal experience alone - sucks. That helped me say no to ULTA because I'm not a woman, and I don't like makeup.\n\nBrands like Urban decay and Fenti are at Sephora too, and ULTA sells a lot of ELF stuff. But what about Rare by Celina Gomez as just one example? L'Oreal or Revlon or whatever else just aren't going to bridge that gap for the majority of makeup consumers. May as well just go to Rite Aid for Physicians Formula bronzer at that point, which again, most people seem to love a lot more than what they sell at ULTA.\n\nIf none of that made sense you're definitely in over your head on understanding beauty brands as an investment. \n\nI'd buy ELF because it has knock off brushes at a fraction of the price of high end studio brand stuff, and whatever the putty primer stuff they sell is beyond nuts. They started selling product next to the charity candy in plastic tubs at places like CVS and are now a massive industry powerhouse. They print money on the average American.\n\nSephora can't be bought, but charges $150 for glitter in colored chalk, honey smear for your face, and the staff loves taking the clueless bf's and husbands down a peg when they go to buy gifts, yet  people buy that stuff so fast it sells out like Taylor Swift concerts. They're an aspirational brand to a lot of people, but \"I pay more to guarantee I look good\" is their moat and  ULTA just doesn't have that. Literally every other cosmetic vendor has a leg up on them with the exception of \"ULTA has a lot of brands\".\n\nHave never had a good experience at ULTA, and no one I know who is serious about makeup shops there.",

      "body": "Ulta has more than a few issues imo. Mary Dillon was on a mission to create 1700 stores. Kinda like Starbucks, one on every corner doesn't guarantee success. In addition to too many locations, they don't or won't buy enough skus to give decent minimums in store. They might get 2 or 3 of something, and that sells out immediately. It takes 2-4 weeks to replenish. They miss sales regularly because they don't have the products. Their answer to this is a store to door option. Order at the register if they don't have it, and they ship it to you. At this point, they have started making locations shipping or fulfillment stores. Filling orders on products that are sold out online and in a particular store. I think people forget how long some products sit on their shelves, which is why some store are now fulfilling orders. They don't transfer dead stock to other locations to sell. It just sits and collects dust. \nThere is also the pay issue, up until recently they were paying people $8.50/hr in certain states. They are on a mission to underpay their people and get real funny when their employees express frustration. This year is the first year they are offering more than $10/hr. I'm in Texas for reference. The m.o. is to cut payroll when brands send representation into stores to educate and sell. They use the brands to support their selling floor. \nRight now, there are a combination of things going on that point to them not doing that great. \nOne indicator they are suffering right now is the back to back drops on coupons that cover the entire store. It used to be one 20% coupon would drop quarterly, July saw a tiered coupon giving 10%,15%,or 20% depending on your rewards level, and right after they dropped a $10 or $20 off depending on how much you spent. I repeat, these coupons were good on the entire store for a one-time use encouraging those to fill their bag. \nThey also made payroll cuts, leaving some store with 2 people staffing the entire store. Needless to say, theft is HUGE in quite a few locations with minimal store associates. These cuts coincided with the direction not make testers until the quarter was done. The quarter is wrapping up. This direction is in direct conflict with the brands that have contractually agreed that the stores are to make testers from stock. This left stores and brand representatives asking why they couldn't offer a tester for customers to try. \nIn addition to the 3 things I mentioned, Ulta has also been adjusting store hours in places. Anything from 8pm closing, to try opening at 9am instead of 10am. They have also canceled their education meetings this quarter for their teams, trying to cut payroll. If anyone is familiar with Ulta, they have one of the least brand educated staff. Education is secondary to sales. The goal is money, not a brand experience for their \"guest\".\nThe last thing I'll mention is the forced brand eventing. Ulta behind the scenes is leaning on brands to conduct in-store events. This means plugging in dates to the Ulta system for brands to event every weekend, Friday-Sunday.  These are selling spaces that force feed customers one brand all day. The goals are anywhere from $1500-$5k depending on the brand. Ulta is pushing these in store productions to help drive sales using the brands to do it. Brands are buying their sales, having to hire people to make the needle move in stores. \n These events used to be a special occasions to meet the brand essentially and learn more about their offerings. The goal at these events is to sell as much as possible. The brands are complying and conducting these insincere meet and greets. They guy that runs the peach and lily events here will lie straight to your face and tell you the brand cures cancer just to hit his goal. It feels more like a used car lot than a beauty store. \nHope you enjoy the insight.",
