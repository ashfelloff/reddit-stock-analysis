They relied for the most part on the former Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe.[284] According to him, Epstein's activities as a spy served to gather compromising material on powerful people in order to blackmail them.[285] There is also a possible connection to the Mossad via Ghislaine Maxwell, whose father Robert Maxwell is said to have had contacts with the Mossad.[286] Epstein's victim Virginia Giuffre also alleged Epstein to be an intelligence asset, linking on Twitter to a Reddit page, that alleged Epstein being a spy, running a blackmail operation.[287]\nAs US Attorney in Florida, the later US Secretary of Labour Alexander Acosta reached a settlement with Epstein's lawyers (including Alan M. Dershowitz) in 2008, which allowed him to receive a very light prison sentence. Acosta later reportedly stated that he was told that Epstein \"belonged to intelligence\" and that the issue was above his \"pay grade.\" According to Acosta, he was pushed to give him a good deal.[288]\nFormer diplomat and current CIA director William J. Burns met with Epstein three times. According to a CIA spokesperson, Burns hoped that Epstein would help him \"transition to the private sector.\"[289]",

During the Persian-Gulf War, Saddam launched Scuds (ballistic missiles) at Israel and Bush asked Israel to not respond as it would have interfered with the coalition the US formed. Try to imagine asking a country to not respond to ballistic missiles attacks without some promises to unconditionally have your back.\n2. Much of the military aid that goes to Israel is coming from weapon stockpiles that would age out and need to be decommissioned. While the nominal value of the weapons sent may be high, the incremental cost to the US might be very little.\n3. Israel during the 1980's was developing its own airplane the IAI Lavi. The US exerted massive pressure on Israel to cancel the jet, so as to not compete with the US military industry. Again this comes with promises from the US.\n4. In general, Israel has very sophisticated systems and the US exerts a lot of influence on who Israel trades technology with. Again, if the US will not provide military support for Israel, Israel will have an incentive to pursue partnerships with China or other countries that will end up risking undermining the US's technical superiority.\n5. US has long put lots of pressure on Israel to use passive defenses and when engaging aggressively to use precision (expensive) weapons in order to keep the region stable. If the US shows that its military support is conditional, then Israel cannot rely on US promises of support to pursue engagements mostly passively. Obviously the recent conflict is very different and is frustrating for the US in terms of how it wants Israel to conduct itself, but to go back on the promise of unconditional weapon transfers has long-term implications that may not be in the US's interest.",
