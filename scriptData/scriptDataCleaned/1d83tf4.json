  "score": 246,
  "selftext": "Mistakes are no stranger to me, but I like to think that I learn from them. I'm guilty of shorting NVDA and losing 15% of my IRA, but I believe I've learned my lesson about betting against the market. As a reformed üåàüêª I no longer believe in shorting the market because \"stocks only go up,\" right? I believe the market is presenting a chance to redeem myself (and more) as a üåàüêÇ with GRND.\n\nAllow me to introduce the stock.\n\nGrindr probably doesn't need an introduction, but in case it does, check out their website: [https://www.grindr.com/about](https://www.grindr.com/about)\n\nIt's the biggest and most popular social networking app for gay men. They went public a while back at a $2.1 billion valuation.\n\nTake a look at the 12-month chart:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/6e6dmanrhl4d1.png?width=686&format=png&auto=webp&s=727d735f17ec19c44ba3fca0114e42eb8e8c500c\n\nHere are the highlights from the latest earnings call:\n\n* 33% YoY growth\n* Profitability continues to be very strong, with industry leading margins\n* They expect even higher revenue growth into next year as the monetizaton strategy pays off\n* Company is focused on growing both top and bottom line.\n* The world's not getting any less gay\n* High user engagement with the recently launched \"Grindr Weeklies\"\n* Large investments are being made in adding additional new features and improving existing ones.\n* Strategic executive hires to lead AI division as well as engineer hires to work on AI.\n\nExpanding on the last items, I watched these interviews with the CEO from last September and November where he discusses how AI will revolutionize dating:\n\n* [Grindr CEO discusses how AI will revolutionize dating](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXR20BJ4gh0)\n* [Grindr CEO: Matching Is a Big AI Opportunity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-14/grindr-ceo-matching-is-a-big-ai-opportunity-video)\n\nGrindr has been very successful since IPO and is planning to roll out new AI features soon which should serve to draw eyes to and whip up market excitment about the stock. Speaking of this, Grindr is hosting its inaugural Investor Day at the end of this month, on June 26th. This means we'll hear directly from the CEO about their AI strategies and growth plans. In the past these events have led to the stock to jump and I'm betting the same will happen this time.\n\nCompared to its peers, Grindr's revenue growth rate and monetization strategy suggest that the stock is currently undervalued. It's trading around $9.50 right now, but I believe it has the potential to reach $15-$20 in the near future, specifically at the end June. I've already taken a position by purchasing some July 20c and June 15c.\n\nLastly, the short interest is sitting at $18%. True short squeezes are a flash in the pan, few and far between. I don't know if this is *necessarily* a squeeze, but it is possible, especially if the gay bears rally to support Grindr.\n\nRegardless I see many reasons to be bullish on Grindr at this valuation, and the stock has plenty of upside in the short-term and long-term. Long term I see this stock 5xing as it grows into its market. As CEO George Arison stated in the Q1 ER: \"We are excited about the opportunities ahead in 2024 and beyond as we execute on our long-term vision to build the ‚ÄòGlobal Gayborhood in Your Pocket.‚Äô\"",
