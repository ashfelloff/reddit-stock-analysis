      "body": "SWN stock is currently trading at a 2% discount to CHK. An FTC announcement that it wonâ€™t intervene should close that gap. But those shares are going to be exchanged for CHK shares at closing, so not sure if your SWN leaps will get exchanged as well. I wouldâ€™ve done this using the CHK shares. \n\nWhat sucks about this combined entity is that their entire business platform essentially has to be put on hold until:\n\n1) The Permian Basin slows natural gas production\n\n2) LNG terminals come online sooner than 2025. \n\n\nNeither of these options are happening any time soon, so a 31% run up by this coming January is unlikely, barring a major cold snap that drains our domestic gas inventory, or an LNG terminal starts operation sooner than expected. The Permianâ€™s gas production has *grown* over the past few years at a faster clip than oil has because of the different completion methods and acreage exploited. Permian producers have to pay pipelines to take the gas off their hands rather than sell it. \n\nThese days, Chesapeake makes bigger headlines by *shrinking* production rather than growing it. \n\nThe only saving grace might be an incoming Trump admin announcement that loosens ESG standards placed on E&P firms. Those firms have to keep their standards high by refusing to flare (burn off) worthless natural gas. If those ESG requirements went away, the Permian would be burning methane all over the place. So the planet would continue to heat up, but your leaps would more likely print",
