And, when one dancers is tired (funds exhausted), another one takes over. If the party goes on long enough, it's possible that they would have exhausted all the dancers, and even those dancers who had dropped out earlier may have gone for another few rounds of dancing. \n\nIf the party goes on long enough, everyone will be exhausted, and the party needs to stop. Furthermore, the music providers are also just playing the same old tracks, and enthusiasm (liquidity) is running dry. Dancers are less enthused (fully invested) and. Everything seems boring.\n\nSo the music provider needs to stop the party and figure out new music. He stops the party, counts up his cash and invests in new music.\n\nThis is the normal correction in a market. A chance for new songs to be sung ( about weed stocks, about bankrupt companies, about AI, about EV, about rate cuts).\n\nOf course, there are times when the music is forcefully stopped, it could be because the music provider provided fraudulent services (dot com/ 2008)  or because the music provider over invested in the music and everything else was lacking (no investors). \n\nWhen the former occurs, the owner of the venue will shut it down forcefully and demand a restructure before the party can continue (play elevator music). If the latter occurs, the music provider gets replaced by another music provider.",
