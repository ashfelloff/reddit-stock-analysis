It sounds like you have a very serious gambling addiction intertwined and fueled by mental illness. You're not investing, you're gambling. This $105 target or whatever for Nike is just another high and gamble for you. I bet every time you do this, you think \"this is gonna be the one\". And you're the scariest kind of gambler; a rich gambler. So you're losses are mountainous.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not a doctor and you can't make assumptions off someones reddit posts. But I have OCD. All you're excessive posting on bankruptcy subreddits and things screams severe OCD. It sounds to me like your debts are putting so much crushing anxiety on you, that it's all you think and dream about non-stop. Your stock market gambles are compulsions. You feel the need to do something about your debts because it's so distressing. Right now, you probably think you feel OK. You have another gamble, another compulsion to bet on Nike now. Even if Nike were to magically hit $105 or whatever, it's not going to stop you from doing this again, repeatedly over and over.\n\nDo yourself a favor, pull all your money out of the market. Start cracking down on self-care, getting help with the gambling addiction and your mental health. Don't skip taking your meds, you need to take that shit consistently every day. Hire some lawyers and a financial advisor. It might be a harsh step, but I think you need to sign away your financial freedom for a while even. You're going to have to downgrade in life for a bit until you get a grasp on your debts and mental health.\n\nIt's sad, you make so much money with whatever your day job is. There was no need for you to even be trying to \"get rich\". You already are, or were anyway. I wish you the best in getting out of this situation.",
