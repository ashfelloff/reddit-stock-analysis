The reason Berkshire Hathaway doesn't buy them all is because they would represent a miniscule fraction of the company's holdings. He does not want to end up with a portfolio of 2,000 companies worth under $100m each. It's a major effort to keep track of an existing portfolio and do due diligence for each new acquisition. \n\nThe sheer size of Berkshire Hathaway means that he's looking for investment opportunities worth billions or tens of billions. The issue with that is that there just aren't as many of those companies to begin with, and far fewer that are undervalued. He would rather keep the money in cash than put it into companies that don't represent a discount on his fundamentals analysis. \n\nThe majority of his holdings are worth over a billion dollars in companies worth tens of billions of dollars. If he was to invest in six companies for $500m each tomorrow, his cash on hand would go from $168b to $166b. It's not worth their time chasing small fish. He's looking for a five or ten billion dollar investment. And they're just difficult to find. \n\nSeriously, I see a thread speculating that Buffett is predicting a crash every week.
