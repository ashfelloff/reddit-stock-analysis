I can’t post photos, but here is the link to the [X](https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1801084780035154058?s=46&t=Qir-pqFH1-Yy45Psug7OUA) post. \n\nI definitely did not expect both of these to pass with such a large margin, in fact it’s the exact same percentage as last time. 73% of the Tesla shareholders that have voted have voted in favor of approving Elon's comp package both times.\n\nI would be really interested to learn which larger institutions voted yes for this, do all institutions have to say what they vote for?

If it was just Elon's pay package being struck down it might have gotten a lot less attention, but the judge made a number of mistakes that pissed off a lot of Tesla investors and turned them against her.\n\n* Paying the lawyer in the case $6 billion dollars in Tesla shares, an outrageously high amount of money, which defeats a lot of the whole point of protecting shareholders from dilution. Elon at least did work to make Tesla shareholders rich, the lawyer didn't.\n\n* A ton of Tesla shareholders started sending in letters & emails to the judge after the $6 billion pay for the lawyer started looking like a real possibility, but the judge not only said she wasn't going to read any of them, she stated flat out to those people \"your opinion doesn't matter, you aren't a part of this case, only the shareholder who sued is\" (a shareholder with a mere 9 Tesla shares). This inflamed people even more, since the whole point of the lawsuit is supposed to be to protect the shareholders, so how can their opinion not matter?\n\nSo yeah, from the retail perspective this vote was very much a way of saying \"screw you\", and \"we do matter and we strongly disagree with your decision\" to the judge.",

What steps have been taken to ensure Denholm is suitably independant since last time? Is Musks influence on the board less undue than it was considered last time?\n\nThe court was very keen to get the Tesla board to identify a value with data to support and back it up last time.\n\nWelberger (A Delaware case) puts a requirement on a vote being fully and fairly informed in order to be considered by the courts.

I assumed the people who voted no,  bought the top only only have a few shares, or don't own any at all, and were just creating more hate for Tesla because Elon. It just goes to show you that reddit is a minority echo chamber and it's sad what this place has become, I never liked Twitter before and have loved Reddit, but Reddit seems to have gone downhill, especially towards Tesla, again because Elon. I get it. I don't like him either, but I don't constantly cry about him. It seems like the people who cry about him. The most don't own any Tesla shares or Car, which is interesting to me, so so many people wasting so much time and mental energy hating a company and a person.\n\nI bought a model Y in 2021. I love the car, I'm not a big Elon fan, but I definitely voted yes to both. I don't let one person who has no bearing or effect on my life dictate how I think about some thing. I test drove about 7 EVs before choosing Tesla and none of them overall, we're as good as the model Y. It was the best selling car worldwide in 2023, so as much hate as reddit gives them, it's obviously a popular car.\n\nMany people I know and online of course have said that jeeps are very unreliable and not to buy one, but I don't go around Jeep sub reddits or other places talking about how it's a bad car it's unreliable, etc. I've never owned one so I don't talk about it.
