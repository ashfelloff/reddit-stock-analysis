              "body": "There are multiple ways to answer this, but let's first go by definition. M2 includes money market funds, CDs, and other time deposits. If the monetary base goes up but people buy money market funds or stash away in reverse repos, it isn't really money in circulation and it isn't going to assets like stocks and bonds. It would be when the rrepo market is drained and when MMFs are sold to invest in stocks and bonds that it would look like M2 is stable or falling but stocks would be pumping.\n\nAs you can see in this chart, reverse repos have been falling hard since late spring 2023. This would lower M2 greatly, but is likely a source of liquidity for stocks and bonds to some extent.\n\n[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/RRPONTSYD)\n\nThe other practical way of looking at it is to understand that monetary base is the money printed (physically or digitally), and is then \"multiplied\" by banks through lending practices. If banks are held to a reserve requirement of 10%, the multiplier on the monetary base is roughly 1/0.1 = 10x. So M2 would be roughly 10x M0. But if banks decide they don't like lending choices at the moment, they may just buy bonds or other assets with that money instead. This would be pumping assets even though it could lower M2 through a lower \"multiplier effect\".\n\nThe last way to think about it, at least that I'll write here, is the very way the government \"prints\" money. With QE, the Fed is buying bonds, which very directly feeds into bond yields, most sellers of whom then buy stocks or other assets, not in any way spend within the real economy. This last year, with the BTFP, M0 shot way up because banks were taking out loans from the Fed using their bonds and MBS as collateral, with which they just bought more bonds and MBS. The net effect at least in the short term was equivalent to QE.",

Just keep prices stable.   \n\nMy fear is that now that the tide has turned.  Will the Federal Govt. continue to do the only thing they know to do to help the economy and continually deficit spend.
