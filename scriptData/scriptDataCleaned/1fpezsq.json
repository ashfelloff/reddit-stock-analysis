I actually did almost this exact same gain by buying and holding, but it was over the course of a few years. I had planned to take profits when my portfolio hit 150k and felt all I needed was just a few more months of gains, but of course those never came and I ended up riding it all the way back down. If I made that much in just a few days I definitely would have taken A LOT off the table, but since I had already been holding several years I thought what's the harm in waiting just a few more months? I'm already this close and it's worked out thus far. These days if something I'm holding does a 2-5x in a couple weeks I sell at least half. You just never know when it can end sometimes, especially when it happens that fast. Nothing goes up that quickly forever. You gotta take the money lol.",
