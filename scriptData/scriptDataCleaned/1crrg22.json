  "selftext": "Hi, again. Haven't posted due to getting pounded.  $HIMS beat guidance for the 13 straight quarter and raised again.  tldr 82% gross margin, 12% adj EBITA. 41% subscriber growth, repurchased 28million$ worth of its stock in Q1.But the best thing is the 85% long term retention rate because not only are they able to convince young perfectly healthy dicked young men to get boner pills, they're able to get them hooked. kinda like the oxy epidemic, except we all know that  getting hooked on dick pills is a net benefit to society (see previous post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/GoMVm2ejtu).  The negative is the CEO hes talked about the war unfortunately, but now with the run in memes it's would be pretty dumb to short a company like this just because you don't like the CEO lol.\n\nAnyway they have a shareholder meeting on June 6\nhttps://investors.hims.com/governance/Proxy-Materials/default.aspx\nPerfect time to address their plans to finally integrate weight loss pills/injectables\n\n",

There’s always been stigma around the issues their products target. But they’ve pushed right through that, and filled out a unique niche for themselves in the process, by applying some of that strong branding formula to something that hasn’t ever really had a strong and trustworthy brand behind it.\n\nViagra and Cialis have been things for a long time, but neither of them really had strong brand power pushing them. It was all strictly pharmaceutical, scientific, etc. The branding was restricted to the drug manufacturer, at least until they went generic. I.e. it’s not sexy, it doesn’t address the elephant in the room (ew dick pills?? Those are for old men! Ew hair loss? That’s for geezers!)\n\nI sort of relate HIMS to AAPL. They may not innovate as much, but they know how to understand a market, and develop a compelling brand around it\n\nI’ve got shares. Not doing calls because I think this sort of play takes a while to develop - but as long as the CEO reels in the hot takes it could be a strong brand play in the future imo",
