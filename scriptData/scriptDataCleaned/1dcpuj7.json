I can get anywhere I need to go domestically from my airport via Southwest, and my Chase credit card points easily transfer to them, so I pretty much only fly Southwest these days.  I never have any problems, except for having to pay for A group boarding, which is still cheaper than paying to check 4 bags on other airlines.",

They're pretty decent, I can't directy attest as I mostly fly delta, but I do hear complaints about cancellations mostly from friends.\n\n Free wifi on flights, free check bags from their credit card, and I get a free companion ticket every year for my wife from said card are all better perks for delta imo.",

Like saying moviepass was a great business because what it looked like from the end user viewpoint.\n\nIf SW can’t figure out profitability, all those things you mentioned are on a limited timeline and eventually you won’t have any of it.\n\nIf you think Elliott’s changes will be bad, you are significantly discounting how bad a group of lenders will shred this co in ch 11. Because in the long run that’s your two options.",
