  "selftext": "Elon Musk's net worth is estimated to have grown by tens of billions of dollars on Thursday, when Tesla ( TSLA ) shares hit their highest price ever. With Friday's trading volatility, his wealth is expected to increase even further.\n\nOn Thursday, Tesla reported mixed earnings, but the results were encouraging, with investors focusing on several factors including strong margins, earnings per share, net income, and the company's lowest-ever cost per item sold. This was Tesla's first earnings growth in seven quarters.\n\nMuch of this growth may also be attributed to Musk's new round of promises.\n\nHe predicted that Tesla will start offering carpooling in at least two states next year (California and Texas), where he plans to get approval from ‚Äúfully unsupervised‚Äù Fully Self-Driving (FSD) regulators. Musk also revealed his ‚Äúbest guess‚Äù for 2025 deliveries, which he said will increase by 20 to 30 percent, as Tesla plans to start selling more affordable models in early 2024. Tesla plans to sell more than 1.81 million electric vehicles in 2024.\n\nIn an earnings call with analysts, Musk said, ‚ÄúI predict Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world, and probably by a long shot.‚Äù\n\nMusk controls nearly 13 percent of Tesla's outstanding shares, but could buy more at a steep discount if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. He also owns a majority stake in SpaceX, which he leads, as well as artificial intelligence startup xAI and social media platform X (META) (formerly Twitter).\n\nTesla's gains on Thursday boosted Musk's net worth to about $270 billion, up $33.5 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The index is updated at the close of the New York market. The Forbes Real-Time Billionaires Index is expected to grow by $26 billion on Thursday to about $269 billion. Musk's net worth increased by another $3 billion to nearly $273 billion as of Friday, Forbes reported.\n\nThe second-richest person on the list is Oracle Corporation ( ORCL ) founder and Musk ally Larry Ellison, with a net worth of $213.8 billion, according to Forbes. He was followed by Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, with $207.7 billion and $200.5 billion, respectively.\n\nTesla shares were up more than 2 percent in regular trading Friday morning at about $266 a share, up 55 percent in the past six months. The stock is up just 6 percent so far this year.",

I don't speak bro.\n\nDo you mean I should buy puts or buy TSLZ or I don't have any balls?\n\nI did buy some TSLZ today but most of my cash is locked up in options at the moment so I wasn't able to buy as much as I wanted.\n\nSo, I guess I have balls, but they're tiny balls. You have emasculated me. Go tell your mom so she finally has something to be proud of you for.\n\nTSLA might run for a while though. Still seems to be a retail trader favorite. The OG memestock really.\n\nSo, please invest heavily in a car company that didn't make earnings by selling cars.\n\nMaybe you look at it like a government tax credit company? Or a company that sells pre-sales of things that aren't even approved to be products? From that point of view, they crushed it.\n\nI think they have better chances if they build off their power business. The car market is so gross right now. They just tightened lending too.",
