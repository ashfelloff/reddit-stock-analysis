  "selftext": "I lost my job in early January and decided to start gambling again heavily in March. I did multiple earnings plays that went belly up such as DKS, Ulta, FIVE, etc. and the final yolo was PVH Calls. I put my last 30k down on Calls yesterday expecting a top and bottom earnings beat and positive guidance. I really did my research on this company all weekend. I was aware of how Lululemon missed guidance and fell but i thought this would be different. This company wasn’t trading in the $400-$500 range. If i would have inversed myself i would have made a 10 bagger on puts. All my losses would have been wiped out on one trade! My calls were thanos snapped out of existence. I didn’t sleep at all last night and debating liquidating my IRA to live on now. ",

Technically, I was usually correct on where the stock was going to wind up but my timing was off because, while I was on the right track for figuring out a valuation range for a company I lacked experience in how the market actually worked - it often doesn’t follow valuation or logic. \n\nI cannot stress this enough - AVOID OPTIONS. They are very tempting but it is too easy to lose your money regardless of how intelligent you are.  \n\nYou need experience in the market.  Buy shares and pay attention to the market.  \n\nActually, some brokerages offer “paper trading” so you can trade shares or options using realtime market data.  That is the way to start out.  But just remember that if you do well early on with the paper money do NOT jump into using real money because you really need experience which only comes with time and learning.",

Much like a casino if more than 50% of people start to win they change the rules (i.e move cost to play up considerably).  This happens in REAL time.     \n\n\nThe interest in options, and especially short term options has been a windfall for wall street, and by simple math, bad for investors.  Look at JEPI.  They can pay an insane dividend because of the amount of losses being absorbed by individual investors on the calls they write.  Their strategy wouldn't have worked only a few years ago because there was a lack of buyers for this product (options)    \n\n\nI KNOW this to be the case, but have probably lost even more over time.

All of them are low key saying we got serious headwinds ahead of us and are tightening our supply chain logistics and reducing inventory to prepare. Nike and LULU most recently. PVH was for sure a puts play which has dragged the entire industry down in sympathy today. LEVI is reporting tomorrow AH. Listening to their q4 earning call, they reference these “headwinds” and also commented on wholesale numbers being down because raising outdoor temps = nobody wants denim in the summer. IMO, all clothing related companies this year are going to get rekt. I recommend reading previous quarter earnings transcripts to get an idea of guidance direction and plan accordingly with options.",

              "body": "Yeah I bought puts on LEVI. The fact that you’re asking this question while slinging around 80k is alarming, gotta say. But really it’s not a one part answer. Knowledge is earned by putting in time while NOT trading / getting that rush pressing the buy or sell button. You’ve gotta treat this shit like university / like it’s your job. Have you ever been paid to lose $? Treat your brokerage account like it’s your business. Businesses don’t gamble. At least successful ones. \n\nAs far as the resources for learning, it’s all at the tip of your fingers. Google “x company earnings report Q_ transcript.” Read it slowly as if you’re a god damn professor. Find where the CEO/CFO is adding fluff and where they are signaling where the winds are blowing. Mind you this is all for simple earnings plays which it sounds like you’re attracted to. There so much more that goes into making an educated assessment of stonk go up or down. \n\nI like to look at the earnings page of companies on Benzinga. For example: benzinga.com/quote/levi/earnings\n\nCheck out the “people also watch” section to find stocks that might belong to the same industry to begin your assessment of general industry sentiment. I like to use marketchameleon.com to view the options chain and check out the backtesting data. I like finviz.com for fundamentals and newsfeed. I’m sure there’s other tools out there that will help in addition to these. Ultimately you need to define your craft and refine your use of these tools before you sling $1k let alone $50k at a trade. Manage your risk moving forward. Don’t yolo like these regards.\n\nEdit: Do not execute another trade until you’ve spent at least 40 hours of research and effort in refining your skills and senses. Idgaf what any degenerate on here says you should ban yourself from trading until you’re actually disciplined. Be true to your risk management and for Christ’s sake my brother do not touch your retirement fund.\n\nSecond edit: do yourself a favor and setup watchlists. Literally write down your trade ideas and paper trade for the next month. You’re banned from real options trading. Backtest them (write down your theoretical entry/cost basis, then compare to your exit plan). Be it 0DTE or weekly plays, see if your senses align with the direction of the industry you’re trading. If you’re losing on PAPER then you shouldn’t be touching options. If you can establish your senses where your win ratio is respectable, then you’ve earned privileges back into trading with real $.",
