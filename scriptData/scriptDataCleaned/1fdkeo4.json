      "body": "TLDR\n\nCoca-Cola is involved in a $15 billion tax dispute, with Ireland at the center of the case. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims that Coca-Cola incorrectly allocated its international profits, leading to lower taxes in the U.S. The IRS argues that the company shifted income to subsidiaries in Ireland, benefiting from favorable tax conditions there, instead of declaring it in the U.S. Coca-Cola disputes this interpretation and plans to appeal, maintaining that the IRS misapplied tax laws. The company could face a liability of $6 billion including interest, though it is confident of winning on appeal",

      "body": "The mechanism works like, say Coca Cola USA sold a gigaton of cola in the US and made a net taxable corporate income of $10b. For illustration, let's say that the US tax law dictates that 40% of Coca-Cola USA's net corporate income gets taxed, such that Coca-Cola USA gets to keep $6b as profit.\n\nAn easy way to bend this law is to set up a \"shell\" company in Ireland where tax is much lower at say, 10% - we call the shell company Coca-Cola Research Ireland. \n\nFrom here, Coca Cola USA can \"cook\" their books by \"paying\" (in the most heinous of scenarios, this can just be a paper transfer) $10b in research & consultation fees to Coca Cola Research Ireland. So Coca Cola USA, with zero net taxable income, doesn't get taxed in the USA. Meanwhile, they only pay $1b in tax to the Irish government, saving $3b in the process.\n\nNow, it can get a bit grey because a \"shell\" company might not be as empty at times. Coca-Cola might be hiring real market researchers, product researchers, advertising experts, and 101 other function players in Ireland. These people are indeed delivering useful and impactful work for Coca-Cola. Just how much are the profits in the US can be attributed to the support functions happening in Ireland? That is the real tricky bit that lawmakers and enforcers have to manoeuvre.",
