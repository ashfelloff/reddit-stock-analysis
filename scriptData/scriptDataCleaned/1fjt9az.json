Just make sure you don't do frequent withdrawals and multiple trades daily because that can raise red flags for CRA especially if you're good at it and start making a lot of money. If you are going to do multiple little trades daily it must be done in a non registered account. Also common misconception but losses do not affect your TFSA contribution room, withdrawals do, so be mindful of that. I didn't touch my TFSA for most of my 20s (I'm in my late 20s now) so the contribution room was over 60k and I have some more flexibility.",
