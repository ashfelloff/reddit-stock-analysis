  "selftext": "$Wing is currently trading at $383, with a valuation of $11,270,000,000. \n\n\n\nShort Thesis: Wingstop is grossly overrated and trading at illogical multiples at these levels due to a high debt load and overvalued stores. \n\n\n\nEach McDonald's location is worth about $4,351,776, or 4.3 million. McDonald’s is an established giant in the sector and the largest in the world, calculated by its market cap/locations. \n\n\n\nWingstop’s is an astounding $5,640,000, or 5.6 million per location. \n\n\n\nThis means Wingstop stores are worth 1.3 million more than every McDonald's location per location. \n\n\n\nWell, then, surely Wingstop must have astounding revenue at each location. Wingstops average yearly revenue per location is around 1.59 million. (circa 2023) \n\nMcDonald’s, however, reports an average revenue per location of around 2.7 million per year. (circa 2023)\n\n\n\nMcDonald’s is seen as the leader in fast food and a known juggernaut, trading at a measly multiple of 21x earnings. Wingstop, with only 2,000 stores (39,000 less than McDonald's), trades at multiples of 136x. \n\n\n\nSo here are my thoughts on its valuation compared to its peers. Surely, Wingstop must have a healthy balance sheet to support these insane valuations. WRONG. \n\n\n\nA few KEY facts\n\n* -164% debt-to-equity ratio\n* 712 million in debt, all due in 2027 or 2029\n* 846 Million in total liabilities, with only 412 million in total assets\n* Negative shareholder equity\n* Debt not covered by operating cash flow\n* Pays a 0.2% dividend compared to a 2.4% industry average\n\n\n\nSo, we have incredibly weak financial statements that are being propped up by high-forecasted earnings growth. \n\n\n\nInstitutional ownership: \n\nWithin the past year, insiders have sold 20,763 shares and purchased 0. This lowered Insider ownership to a staggeringly low 0.295%. Insiders at Wingstop don't even believe in themselves. They’ve enjoyed a 100% rise in the stock over the past year and 50% YTD, and no insiders ever bought shares during this timeframe. \n\n\n\nIntrinsic value: \n\nFair value was calculated to be at $130 a share, implying a 65% decrease in the share price. (valueinvesting)\n\nIntrinsic value is a measly $87.47 a share, implying a 77% drop (Alpha Spread) \n\nLastly, Morningstar has fair value set at $152 or 60% downside.  \n\n  \nPosition: \n\n1/17/25 $250 Puts (4)\n\n",

      "body": "Wingstop is the EASIEST short of my 30 year career trading.  You brought up many relevant points and at the end of the day, the stock is grossly overvalued.  The food is at best average.  The valuation is absurd even if it traded at half its current price.  I shorted 20,000 shares at $410 and change and will add to the short over the next year on literally any move up that it gets- the volume is so thin and many of the big holders manipulate price with options and various other simple old school tactics Wall Street uses to artificially inflate prices.  When the sober institutional sellers show up it will be a swift 40-50% down and a race to the exits.  Like always, Wall Street over shoots to the upside and this will overshoot to the downside.  There is zero upside from here in a long position.  I spent almost a year looking under the hood and could write a book about why I will short any move up of 3% or more of this POS.  I would never give investment advice to anyone and you should do what you believe is best with your hard earned money, but I am happy to make this bet and have more conviction about this short than any of my other positions.",

But I think the market is pricing in Wingstop's significant growth in their valuation, so there might be less to your argument than you put forward.\n\nBe careful!\n\n(I have no position on Wingstop.
