  "selftext": "For the 5 people who still care and asked for a followup. Here's what happened. RDDT went up 16% post-earning but then pretty much fell right back down to where it started. Today it's back up again. \n\n**What the heck is going on you might ask?**\n\nWell no one really knows for sure. The drop could have been all the bagholders selling off after their bags got smaller - or could have been the those gosh darn hedgefund algorithms.\n\nBut one thing is for sure. Reddit SMASHED it's earnings, and is growing at 50% yoy with significantly increased traffic. Wall street increased price targets by 20%!!\n\n**What did I do?** \n\nIn true old man fashion, I bought the dip. About $10k more. And will continue to do for most major dips. Proof will be screenshot in comments. \n\n**But what about the -8 eps?**\n\nI'm only gonna say this once. That was from a 1 time IPO cost, real eps is basically positive. \n\n**What's my advice?**\n\nMost people can't make money short term trading. It's basically gambling and the house wins most of the time. I would highly recommend putting some spare savings into RDDT and letting it sit. Check in with every IPO and evaluate based on revenue growth and other factors. \n\nIt's really not too late at all. \n\nSeriously - they just started the path to monetization as the THIRD most visited site in the United States(check semrush and filter by United States). These are rough numbers of market cap with companies that have similar traffic. \n\n* Twitter - $50b(and they were a trainwreck)\n* Facebook - $100b\n* Instagram - $200b\n* Reddit - $8b\n\nI'll give an update to any curious followers each IPO, or if Reddit has any major news. \n\nOr just ignore me, and continue to gamble - you apes.\n\n",

              "body": "For sure, the challenges ahead are enormous and a lot of trust has been put into them. I do believe a lot of precaution should be put into risking money into this company. Personally I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. On the other hand they are doing really cool stuff. Specially with the reduction in cost of running complex ML pipelines.\n\nRight now I am working on a recommendation pipeline from Reddit interactions. It's nothing fancy, just vanilla RAG on llama3 + RDDT API, all in python and a remote server, I'm talking about no more than 100 USD per month.  \nThe pipeline answers questions like:\n\nDo you think that with the \\[InstantPot\\]. I will be able to cook carne de pastor.\n\nThe engine then answers:\n\nNot really, most people do pastor in a device like \\[this\\]., the instant pot is used more for a dish like cochinita\n\nSo maybe not the best example, but I hope to come the point across. An engine that queries and responds in a very natural way AND that ends up being useful for the user.\n\nIt's my line of work so I get pretty excited for these kinds of things. Nothing wrong with risking money on tiny pleasures.\n\nEDIT: I am too high to properly format reddit text. Please excuse me, there were supposed to be links for the stuff in square braces.",

It’s shocking actually that it is so low. I see it getting compared to SNAP and Pinterest, each of which is currently 3x Reddit. Traders just don’t get it. This is a big opportunity. No way it is lower in 5 years, but could 10-15x. How often does that opportunity come up?",
