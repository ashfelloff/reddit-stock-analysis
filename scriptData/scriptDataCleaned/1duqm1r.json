I am not watching a minute long Amazon ad in order to hear an AI voice read a Reddit post while some guy bounces from block to block on Minecraft. It was faster to switch to Reddit, find the post itself, read it, then come here to complain. SNAP is going to push its users to other platforms, and will lose market share if they start pushing 1 minute long unskippable ads.  \n  \nHow do I make money off them losing money?",

Advertisers already get the most value from advertising that they ever have with targeted ads and screen time thru the roof. Forcing users to watch minutes of ads may just be the thing that makes us go touch grass instead.",
