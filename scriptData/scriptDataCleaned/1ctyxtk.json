  "title": "Should I sell the TSLA shares bought 10 years ago",
  "score": 187,
  "selftext": "My first big investment into the stock market was about $2k into TSLA in about 2014-2015. These shares have split twice and are worth about $26k now, I’m wondering if I should sell and try to do something more profitable with the gains, or just keep holding. I had kind of been thinking of these shares as a retirement fund but now thinking maybe there’s something smarter I can do. Any insight is appreciated, thanks y’all. Edit: Should’ve specified this originally but I started with 10 shares at $199 a piece. This split 5x and then 3x so I’m now at 150 shares ~26k currently.  \n\nUpdate: I think what I’ve decided to do is sell covered calls with my shares for premiums in the meantime. I do want to keep holding long term, so gonna try to make a profit but still keep the strike price high enough so it’s unlikely the call gets assigned. Starting with $200 for just a month out. But if it moons and they sell then hey I’ll take it. Thanks for all your input. First time really getting some decent feedback on a reddit post so fr thank you guys",

Continued to go up and I definitely missed out on more money but then it started to retreat in 2023.  I bought back in about 10 months ago, and then the market tanked for about a month lol but now I’m up about 40%. my biggest loser because of the size of my investment is Tesla.  The EV market is so competitive, there are lots of companies that can do the exact same thing.  \n\nBUT, It appears that Tesla is not too far off from having cars that are fully autonomous in China.  if they are able to be the first company to manufacture cars that are truly autonomous and are legal than that stock will go nuts.   So, my advice is, I don’t know what to tell you lol\n\nThere is lots to be concerned about, but there is also lots of reason for optimism, but unfortunately, I feel like that company at this stock Price is kind of a coin flip.",

But I took that money and made 18k buy putting it somewhere else, instead of continuing to burn on the low embers of TSLA right now. \n\nNOW is the time to buy TSLA. Not up in the $2 hunnits.\n\nNot financial advice, OP, but consider this: your money isn’t working for you there in TSLA. It’s actually working against you. Every day you let it sit there stagnant is another day of gains you’re missing out on, elsewhere. \n\nGod bless you, and stay safe out there.",
