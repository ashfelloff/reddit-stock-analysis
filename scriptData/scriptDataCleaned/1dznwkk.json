  "selftext": "Today was the lowest full day SPY trading volume in history with a measly 24 million shares being traded. It seems that there are few buyers and no sellers in this market action and it will continue to chop up until Jerome makes a move. The Mag 7 are in rotation and the Ai stocks are looking exhausted from rallying for the past 16 months. Is this really the best time to be gambling your down payments and grant money?\n\nThis to me is the worst action I‚Äôve seen since pre-COVID.",
