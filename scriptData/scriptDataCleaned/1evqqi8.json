It is an income fund though, so one needs to monitor the net asset value And week by week fund performance. They do pay a weekly dividend, which is I assume an administrative nightmare but solid so far !",

I like the concept. \n\nI like it's not some crazy spec thing, it's selling synthetic covered calls on NASDAQ and S&P500 micro index (a micro index tracks the index but just at 1% of the price). The only holdings are extremely deep ITM calls on the actual index (not the micro index) and a small portion in a govt bond fund for liquidity and I think that is where they hold cash. Then daily they sell 0DTE calls that are covered by the long call position. They collect the premium, I assume that goes into the bond fund, they take their 1% somewhere along the way, and pay out weekly.  It seems too good to be true so I spent some time thinking about what could go wrong. \n\nThe big downside IMO is they stop hitting good numbers and people exit the fund, your principal will tank, maybe all the way to 0 when the fund closes. \n\nIf market shoots up and they get called over and over that could also tank it. That's limited a bit because then covered calls are on the microindex and 0DTE, and I assume their algorithm is hopefully good enough to adjust the covered call price to maximize premium each day while avoiding getting called (go more OTM or closer to the money).\n\nAnother downside is market dips heavy and their long call position dips heavy but that's kind of a built in downside to all investing. But their held calls are deep ITM leaps, which aren't affected as much from daily fluctuation, and I assume will get rolled.\n\nI also thought maybe if Round Hill goes belly up on riskier investments that could screw up this ETF. \n\nThese are literally the first 2 0DTE ETFs ever, so I wonder either if there's some downside I am not seeing or if this too good to be true scheme will blow up somehow. On the surface it seems like very low risk for high returns, irrespective of a bull or bear market.  \n\nNote the payouts are income so they are heavily taxed compared to cap gains. \n\nI am too chicken to go full port into it but will start building a position tomorrow. I had already put in my orders and then saw this post which further confirmed my view on these. \n\nAlso noting if you were worried you could also hedge with puts or calls on the index, if you have a giant position in this it might be worth actually doing some math on that shit. You can trade options on QDTE itself and hedge with a put on the ETF but there's no volume or options activity so I don't think that's a viable hedge at this time. I am not hedging because I'm not taking a huge position.",

The secret if you put a large chunk of cash such as 400k is to weekly drip one third of your weekly dividend indefinitely and you will never loose. If nav erodes, u get more shares each week that start accumulating new dividend and continue this weekly. The power of weekly compounding is massive. Even if it losses nav dripping one third of your dividend weekly, you will grow your nav and dividend. Play it this way and u are laughing 😃. Putting 400k will give you 10,500 usd monthly of course paid weekly. This us based on an average of 0.25 weekly however payments some weeks are as high as 0.57 and its average now is 0.32 weekky. So im being pessimistic. Drip 3,000 or 3,500 monthly into it on weekly basis. Even if nav erodes a bit, ur still beating markets and making a massive return over years",
