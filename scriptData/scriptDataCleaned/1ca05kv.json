And then even if sales goes up a little bit better due to lower prices, even if cybertruck schedule gets restored, whatever, the bounce continues.\n\nThe logical question to ask is what other negative catalyst can drop the stock further? car price drop, lower china sales, Cybertruck FUD, FSD price lowered, surplus inventory, layoffs due to lower sales.

The fact that Tesla is not far from its bottom, which we know was a momentary FUD and had nothing to do with fundamentals, despite earnings and revenue much higher than 2022, means it's objectively a better stock than where it was in 2022, and certainly a better bargain than MSFT, AMZN, or any of the magnificent 7 excluding Apple since it has a lot of negativity priced in already.\n\nYou want to squeeze in another 5% downside or whatever, go ahead. I'm not gonna claim it's not possible, but it certainly isn't worth the risk of missing out on 30%+ upside.\n\nBut remember the bears go bankrupt from being too greedy and waiting for another 1-2% pullback, and stocks can bottom and bounce from 0 positive catalyst.

If you wait until all the bad news are gone, the stock is likely 30-50% off its bottom. And you don't even need to buy at the bottom.

      "body": "That article really fails to nail down the central tenant of Tesla's fall. They allude to it, asking why a company becomes so overvalued but don't talk about the actuality.\n\nThe emperor has no clothes.\n\nThe public perception of Elon has gone from mythic genius playing 4d chess, to a privileged fool who spews ideas some of which his employees make happen.\n\nThe truth is likely floating around the middle somewhere, he is a clever man but like many clever people he's also fucking deluded on a lot of fronts. The Don Lemon interview was just painful to watch.\n\nTesla's over valuation was based on Elon Musk's involvement. Now his personal capital is so much less, it's multiplier affect on Tesla has reduced and so the stock price is deflating to it's actual value.\n\nTesla bagholders are the stock market version of people with a Kanye tattoo.",
