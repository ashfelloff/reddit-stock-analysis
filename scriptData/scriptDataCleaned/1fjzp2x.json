Rates have been high for awhile now, and yet home prices aren’t budging.\n\nWhy?\n\nMaybe because there’s not enough housing supply. Maybe the high mortgage rates are making it unaffordable for new buyers to buy a home, and unfathomable for existing owners to sell, who are locked into a 3.5% mortgage, and would immediately rebuy in at 6.5%+",

When you slowly pour in water, it fills the cup gradually, representing how lower interest rates can stimulate borrowing and spending, leading to an increase in demand. If you pour too quickly, the water overflows, akin to inflation rising when demand outpaces supply. Just as a careful balance is needed to keep the water contained, central banks must tread lightly with interest rates to avoid tipping the economy into excessive inflation.",

Because then a secondary free market would form that supplies kredits at a free market rate to fund investments. Furthermore, technologocal advancements will always make it easier to produce things lowering the costs (efforts not prices) of production. And I also see that effort based cost of housing production are cheaper now than ever. What is not are the prices. And as long as the effort based costs are lower than the selling prices then the investment has a positive ROI. So in my believe, even without the fed providing any liquidity investments will be made until ROI becomes zero, which means prises go down until cost of effort is met, which is continually lowered by technological advancements. As a consequence we would then have a deflation that is driven not by falling prices wrecking companies that had higher costs like in the great depression (1929 to 1939), but a deflation that is driven by falling costs like in 1870 to 1900 or 1950 to 1960.",

It will always respond deterministically to the same inputs with the same output, given the system has the same internal state. Meaning the system is fully deterministic. \n\nIn the laplace domain every 's' stands for a differentiation and 1/s stands for integration.\n\nso s*factor is speed. s^2*factor is acceleration and so on.\n\none way to characterise those systems is the step response. Meaning you apply a input that is 0 and then suddenly step it to 1 and observe the output over time.\n\nSo you could model for example an electric engine and apply a step input current/voltage. It does not immediatelly have its targeted rpm but slowly increases frequency firs overcoming friction and innetria, accelating untill reaching a saturation point at which acceleration slows down reaching the targeted rpm. Maybe it will even overshoot and osscilate around the target rpm. \nSee: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pt2+step+responses&t=fpas&iax=images&ia=images&iai=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FTorsten-Kuhlen%2Fpublication%2F3302434%2Ffigure%2Ffig8%2FAS%3A645364566745088%401530878311000%2FStep-responses-of-second-order-systems-PT2-with-different-eigenfrequencies-and.png\n\nSo you cannot just say the voltage/current/gas/throttle/etc. of an engine was high/low thus the speed was high/low because the engine does not react immediattly direct proportionally.\n\nSame for finance you cannot just say interrest rates were high/low and we had deflation/inflation at the same time and make your conclusion from that, because the market does not react immediatelly. The market has a delay to change, also different parts of the market will react slowly with a long slope to input change and others that will react quickly and oversoot or some parts that do not stop to change, or start oscillating.\n\nFor more information study the field of Signal and Systems Theory, Controll Automation Theory, Feedback Controlled Sytems or the like.",
