There is effectively infinite demand for cheap power. It’s also a big moat once they get approval. They can also expand internationally. The sky is the limit since every small fission plant they build is much more efficient and uses less space and materials than anything else out there (afaik), plus carbon neutral and so on. \n\nSo if Oklo is worth $10 billion then it can have a 100x upside in 10-20 years after that. Although there could be share dilution as well down the road if they raise more capital, so it’s just a rough approximation.\n\nAt $10 billion market cap it’s a 30-40x price/book (I forget exactly the number) so that’s basically an optimistic near term scenario. I don’t think it would run up to a 100x price/book since it’s just a crazy valuation.\n\nEvery futurist wants something like Oklo to exist, they just have to execute well and not get blocked by regulators.",

The huge need for more power with AI (the current grid literally can’t do it on its own), the Altman name and his personal investment in the company, and the fact that it’s very good tech.
