I’ve made most of my money selling options on BITX and BOIL this year, i’m switching my strategy up a bit and going for less risky investments like TQQQ, my exposure 400 shares to BITX even with the call I sold as reasonable downside protection was still keeping me up at night god for bid bitcoin has a 10% flash crash and sends BITX down 20% i’ve lost thousands. Especially when the volatility of bitcoin is extremely suppressed like it is right now historical data suggests that there’s either a massive move upside or downside and i’m not willing to take the downside risk so I just liquidated my position today and took a 1200 profit.",
