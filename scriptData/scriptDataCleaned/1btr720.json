  "title": "Microstrategy might be selling at double it's true value. Interesting short opportunity or am I just regarded?",
  "score": 15,
  "selftext": "After coming across this short report on yahoo news today I decided to do some DD as a followup:\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/m/763cb476-5dde-3f86-937d-5a20d4dcf335/microstrategy-stock-is-up.html\n\nFor those here who can't read (so everyone here including myself) microstrategy is selling at a huge premium to the bitcoin it has on hand. According to the short report I linked, microstrategy as of March 19 has 214,246 bitcoin and as of this writing the price of bitcoin is around 66,500 which comes out to a total value of 14,247,359,000 dollars. Microstrategy's market cap after hours is currently 27.8 billion.\n\nI took a look at their annual report to see if perhaps the business outside of bitcoin is worth anything on its own, and from what I can tell, it isn't worth much. The company basically runs at break even if not at a slight loss when you remove the impact of bitcoin, and this doesn't account for the debt on the balance sheet and that the company will have to pay taxes on any realized gain from any sale.\n\nThe IV on the options are insanely high so I'm strongly considering selling OTM call credit spreads. After hours option chains are always funky, but 5/17 expiration options in the 1700's range depending on liquidity were what I was thinking.\n\nAm I regarded or might this actually be a good idea?",

      "body": "You’re not wrong about the CURRENT value but stocks generally are priced for FUTURE value.  The stock has the upcoming halving and the parabolic run that’s expected after it somewhat built in.  So right now it’s expecting the value of MSTR’s bitcoin holdings to double after the halving in a short period of time.\n\nIf you expect downward pressure after the halving and through the end of next year, then a call credit spread makes sense.\n\nPersonally, I think between the halving, the more talks of a softer economy in 2025, but a strong finish to 2024, the best play might be a straddle.  It’s going to be volatile and move a lot but direction wise it can swap very quickly.  If I were to buy a LEAP i’d sell off the legs individually too as resistance levels are hit so both sides could be profitable.",

Even a shitbox company  you are likely to pay a low multiple of their holdings. MSTR is trading based on anticipated price gains for Bitcoin. With the major event of the halving coming up in a few weeks demand will likely keep up or intensify while the supply of new Bitcoin is going to be cut in half.\n\nPreviously this caused a drop in the price of Bitcoin followed by a slow and steady climb to new highs. But it is different this time with the direct demand driven by the ETFs acquiring ridiculous amounts of Bitcoin. I don't think we are going to see that same drop as a result and it will push the price higher.\n\nPlace your bets accordingly.",
