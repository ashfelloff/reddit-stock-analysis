Now, jobs have been revised upward, China is pumping money, oil prices are having a fit due to Israel, and Atlanta Fed GDP is 3.4%, so they sold bonds.

What they are saying is that in order to avoid the US government defaulting on its ballooning debt in the coming years or decade ( which is soon to be over 100% of GDP, with yearly debt servicing higher than total US military spending), the Fed will need to keep rates as low as possible in order to inflate the debt away.\n\nSo, structurally, inflation is under control. But these guys predict that it will be used as a tool to stay on top of debt so that the US bonds do not become worthless. The causality is important and it's a nuance that might help investors make better choices.\n\nThus, the bond market is pricing in a reinflation wave which will require cuts, but the Fed might be trapping the market if it is going to keep rates low. Thus, it's probably wise to stay away from fixed income/cash/bonds for the foreseeable future. Commodities, BTC, Gold/metals, equities is what is safe against inflation.",

Yet in the history of Bitcoin it’s never, not once proven to be an inflation hedge. It fell by 80% in 22 when inflation was feared to be rising uncontrollably.\n\nAnd the Nasdaq? Give me a break. He described a scenario in which the government raises taxes enormously and cuts entitlements. He goes on to acknowledge that that policy will create a recession. Do we really think meta Apple and Amazon will retain their valuations in a world with much higher long rates and taxes and cuts to entitlements?\n\nThe problem with taking your views from him is that he has competing factors. He’s a multibillionaire who runs a family office. But did you notice how he seemed very unsure when describing his own positioning? “I uh I probably have some Bitcoin and some Nasdaq.” He runs a huge charity and is trying to express his views without scaring anyone or pissing everyone off. \n\nI actually agree with him that long rates are incredibly mispriced given the situation we’re in but the idea that the fed can cut in the face of raging inflation makes zero sense. It’s politically untenable to do any of this stuff. You’d need a horrendous recession/depression to make getting our fiscal house in order palatable to voters.
