          "body": "I don't think they will. This flop of an attack from Iran led to no deaths of Israelis (or maybe one Israeli death; reports are a bit conflicting atm). In terms of public image, this is a big win for Israel. Iran looks violent and weak while Israel looks like they're successful defenders from them. The knife guy in the Sydney shopping mall killed more people than the government of Iran could.\n\nThis incident also demonstrates why a direct war between Israel and Iran just isn't possible. There are countries in between them. There is no way to attack the other without incapacitating those countries first, and no side could possibly gather enough public goodwill to do that. \n\nUltimately, this incident is a slight boost to public goodwill towards Israel that'll fade within a week or two. That's about it. Maybe a boosted aid package to Israel. Maybe some new sanctions or condemnations on Iran.",
