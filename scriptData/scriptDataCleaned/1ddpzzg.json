  "selftext": "I needed a win. I saw AAPL rising in the first 5 min this morning‚Ä¶ seemed unusual, especially for a company with this large of a market cap. \n\nI queued up a bunch of $197 calls, and hovered my finger over the buy button. I was so close to placing the order. But, I told myself‚Ä¶. ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been here before, and it hasn‚Äôt gone well. You need to wait for the first pullback and subsequent confirmation before buying. You need to be disciplined and follow the rules. After all, we‚Äôre only a couple dollars away from the ATH.‚Äù A simple ABCD set up‚Ä¶. Well‚Ä¶.. the pullback never came. Then, the stock traded sideways for quite awhile shortly after. ‚ÄúSurely the price will drop any moment, especially since we are literally touching the ATH‚Ä¶ and the stock has tried and failed to break past it twice in the last year. I should hold‚Ä¶.‚Äù Boom‚Ä¶ another run up. This time even higher. Then sideways, then another run up, then sideways. Past the ATH nearly all day. Each time I was sure a massive drop was eminent. So I stayed out until the rise at 1 pm. Pocketed $60 then dipped when I saw the drop happening around 1:20. Came back later to see the price was up another $3. Wtf!? How did I end up only making $60 on a $14/ share increase today?  A play that, had I done what my instincts were telling me to do at 9:35 this morning and clicked the freaking buy button, would have netted me near 10k. This would have been my largest profit by far since starting trading.\n\nSo now, I‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ ok so do I continue to follow the rules I have set, or what? I break rules and I lose money. I follow rules and I miss out on huge plays. What the actual frig, man.\n\nAnyway, see you all tomorrow. \n\n\nEDIT: I wrote this mostly to vent for a sec, and ended up coming off a little dramatic. Didn‚Äôt think it would gain any traction. Yes I have a cash account. No I don‚Äôt have a gambling problem. Yes I will be back tomorrow following my rules. Onward and upward!",
