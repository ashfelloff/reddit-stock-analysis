Huang himself said he’s worried and concerned that they’ll lose their edge soon, to the point that they’re forced to release a new product every year. \n\nHe himself sees the writing on the wall and it’s hilarious how people here think that companies are going to continue to willingly fork over billions to NVDA — the moment a competitor releases a product that, if even marginally slower and not as power efficient but at a far better price is when you’ll see a shift and NVDA will have to begin slashing prices which will not be good for the stock. \n\n> Founded in 2019, D-Matrix plans to release a semiconductor card for servers later this year that aims to reduce the cost and latency of running AI models.\n\n> Microsoft said it was using AMD Instinct GPUs to serve its Copilot models. \n\n> Intel, which was surpassed by Nvidia last year in terms of revenue, is also trying to establish a presence in AI. The company recently announced the third version of its AI accelerator, Gaudi 3. This time Intel compared it directly to the competition, describing it as a more cost-effective alternative and better than Nvidia's H100 in terms of running inference, while faster at training models.\n\n> AMD and Intel are both participating in a big industry group called the UXL foundation, which includes Google, that's working to create free alternatives to Nvidia's CUDA for controlling hardware for AI applications.\n\n> Cloud providers including Google, Microsoft and Amazon are all building processors for internal use. The Big Tech three, plus Oracle, make up over 40% of Nvidia's revenue.\n\n> Amazon introduced its own AI-oriented chips in 2018, under the Inferentia brand name. Inferentia is now on its second version. In 2021, Amazon Web Services debuted Tranium targeted to training.\n\n> Google is perhaps the cloud provider most committed to its own silicon. The company has been using what it calls Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) since 2015 to train and deploy AI models. In May, Google announced the sixth version of its chip, Trillium, which the company said was used to develop its models, including Gemini and Imagen.\n\n> Microsoft isn't as far behind. The company said last year that it was building its own AI accelerator and processor, called Maia and Cobalt.\n\n> Meta isn't a cloud provider, but the company needs massive amounts of computing power to run its software and website and to serve ads. While the Facebook parent company is buying billions of dollars worth of Nvidia processors, it said in April that some of its homegrown chips were already in data centers and enabled \"greater efficiency\" compared to GPUs.\n\n> The Cerebras chip, WSE-2, puts GPU capabilities as well as central processing and additional memory into a single device, which is better for training large models, said CEO Andrew Feldman.\n\nI can continue to go on and on, but you get the point. If you think NVDA will keep the AI market essentially *hostage* for the next five years, I have some tulips to sell you. I give them maybe two more quarters before their growth starts significantly getting impacted.",

It's a massive piece of the puzzle.\n\nI am long Nvidia and Intel. And if you really want to know, I am fed up with Intel right now with all their divestitures.\n\nAs far as other points, yes others (MSFT/GOOG etc can make their own AI chips). Solving driverless vehicles alone is far in Nvidia's court and is worth an insane amount to solve. Literally can solve all of traffic issues and movement with robotic vehicles. That's just one place.\n\n  \nedit. just also adding Blackwell cost $10b in R&D. \n\nMeanwhile Intel is selling off businesses to raise capital to build IFS, at first they thought it was going to cost  around $10b for fab, now it's looking like $30b per fab. They don't have that kind of capital.",
