In practice it wouldn‚Äôt do much to leave them open 24/7 anyways, you‚Äôd have the ability to open or close positions but the volume would be so low it would be like you were waiting for open anyways. Have you ever watched a ticker at like 7pm or 5 am that wasn‚Äôt nvidia or a meme stock?

For all intents and purposes the market may as well be open 24/7, you can do whatever you want aside from have orders filled on any brokerage platform and at least Schwab has a handful of nearly 24/7 securities I believe",
