You end up mostly paying yourself but stock price will then be pushed to your M&A/delist price. Also forces the end of short positions and puts.

              "body": "Everyone brings this up but they also leave out some very crucial information \n\nFirst this was a stock that did not trade on an exchange, it traded through OTC markets  AKA a shit penny stock\n\nNow what does this mean with OTC markets  you really do not have to publish your trades. There are not market makers setting buy/sell orders . Its really between two people\n\nSo imagine its like 1922 and paper stock certs are still a thing. If you have 10000 shares of a company I could give them to you for $1 a share and thats it you now own the shares. We do not have to report the sale or the price to anyone\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow imagine this, its 1922 and you have 10,000 shares of stock ABC and you think the shares are prices around $1 a share, you are now in Chicago .\n\nNow say in NYC the company announces a 100 to 1 reverse stock split. But its 1922 and there are not exactly phones or the internet so you have no clue the split happened. When they did the split they sent a letter but it could take 5 days to reach you. So you have no clue the split happened and you are still under the assumption you own 10k shares not 100\n\nAlso because pricing data does not have to be published you cannot exactly buy like a news paper and look at the price. If you could you might see the price rose to $100 and that might signal to you something was up or changed but nope, these are OTC and no pricing data needs to be published\n\nSo you and I meet in a saloon and I say \"So how about you sell me 10k shares of ABC, I will pay $1.10 for them ?\"\n\n(remember you do not know or got the memo the company did a 100 to 1 reverse stock split), you only really own 100 shares not 10k shares.\n\nSo we shake hands and agree to the deal\n\nSee the problem, you only have 100 shares to sell me after the reverse stock split, you do not have 10k shares but you just agreed to sell me 10k shares.\n\nYou deliver me the 10,000 pre-split shares, but I then say \"Not so fast , these shares are pre-split shares and really only 100 shares, we agreed on 10k shares\"\n\nNow you are going to say \"WTF how was I supposed to know they did a 100 to 1 reverse stock split, I thought I was just selling my own shares that I own?\"\n\nYou just failed to deliver . You just naked shorted.\n\nYou now owe me 9900 shares and I will bankrupt you trying to get them and will sue you and hopefully repo your home, car , and wife\n\nWho is the bad guy here, you or me?",
