  "score": 696,
  "selftext": "Boeing\n received orders for only four new planes in May — and for the second straight month, none for its best-selling 737 Max, as fallout continues from the blowout of a side panel on a Max during a flight in January.\n\nThe results released Tuesday compared unfavorably with Europe’s Airbus, which reported orders for 27 new planes in May \n\nBoeing also saw Aerolineas Argentinas cancel an order for a single Max jet, bringing its net sales for the month to three.\n\nThe dismal results followed poor figures for April, when Boeing reported seven sales — none of them for the Max.\n\nBoeing hopes that the slow pace of orders reflects a lull in sales before next month’s Farnborough International Airshow, where aircraft deals are often announced.\n\nBut the Federal Aviation Administration is capping Boeing’s production of 737s after a door plug blew out from an Alaska Airlines Max, allegations by whistleblowers that Boeing has taken shortcuts to produce planes more quickly, and reports of falsified inspection records on some 787 Dreamliner jets.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, delivered 24 jetliners in May, including 19 Max jets. Ireland’s Ryanair got four and Alaska Airlines took three. Airbus said it delivered 53 planes last month.\n\nIn a critical Support line. BA (BOEING) is Set see a 120 in these coming months. ",

In the UK, it’s fairly common for graduates to look for jobs outside of their university specialism, so naturally, he began to look for jobs in finance, banking and HF along with stuff that was actually within his technical remit. \n\nLo and behold, at every Finance and banking interview he went to, it would last less than 20 minutes, first round. At the end of everything, he was clearly upset that none of these institutions wanted to take him on and so he decided to talk to an alumni that had done quite well in finance. \n\nDuring the chat, the friend of his looked at my brother and said, ‘You know, my friend, I wouldn’t hire you for any banking or finance role, and you know why? *I don’t see greed in your eyes’.* \n\nSo take a moment to think through what was said back there; dude’s an engineer, and what corporate asks him to do is to act like the wolf of Wall Street in what he does. So remind me again of what happens when we have greedy engineers walking around society? Maybe two 737 Max’s nosediving to the ground and sending all onboard to the afterlife? All Make sense now?",

      "body": "Geez you really have no clue about the industry at all. The backlog is 5600 airplanes! New orders means fuck all. You have cherry picked the past 6 months bad news and disregarded all the good news much like news outlets in general are doing to Boeing these days. Obviously you’re short / put options wishing for a 120 price when fair value today sits at 200-220!\n\nFirst of all, the FAA production cap of 38 Max planes per month has no meaning at all, it is political. Boeing themselves has produced and delivered less than that since January because they have self imposed strict quality assurance guidelines and wants to send the message that they’re taking the matter even more seriously (of a blown out door due to one mechanic missing 4 bolts, on an a plane with an American operator - Alaska Airlines, which is why the outrage even started in the first place. “Can’t happen to Americans attitude”).\n\nIf you have ever listened to any statements by the company they say they will deliver and produce less than the FAA cap willingly the first six months of this year then scale to 38 per month by new years or q1 next year, so the whole FAA cap until then is moot! What it literally means is cash burn these 2 first quarters and on full year a small net cash burn. \n\nThereafter the FAA cap will be revised and possibly become more planes per month or remain the same. This is why they’re doing less to show an even greater compliance than asked for at the expense of a hit in short term patience from investors that can’t see past 6 months or even listen to the company at all. \n\nSecondly it is correct that most orders come at airplane fairs / air shows except for the irregular orders coming in irregularly all through the year. But before next months air show no new orders means fuck all. But the backlog of 10 years + makes new orders moot unless it is for a full year calendar which will NEVER happen!\n\nThirdly cancellations thus far has basically not come and the few that has come has NOTHING to do with the door plug incident. It has been either airlines defaulting or not affording their order. All in all this first half year net backlog has grown substantially! \n\nWith all this in mind. What it means is Boeings recovery has been postponed for a full year! What was meant to happen this year will happen next year and all their plans are postponed. What was looking great in free cash flow last new years is now on hold and looking great again new years between 2025-26. And the company is aiming for financial stability on the same time frame 26/27.\n\nFourth if you even looked at the quarterly earnings report it showed that defense (that was last years drag on earnings was finally profitable again) which means when commercial, defense and space (which mostly all three have had costs for apparent reasons the past +5 years) are all spinning again it will be back to a money making machine. \n\nSo your DD is entirely false, not forward looking at all like a DD should be and overlooks all key points as to why EVERY single analyst out there has a price target of 220-300 in the coming year. But I will admit that is too high! Fair value today is about 200-220 like I said and 1 year forward barring huge complications it’s 250-260 at best and the same 200-220 at worst!\n\nShit like this post is ridiculous and brain dead bull with no insight into the industry at all, just hopeium you will influence people to hit your 120 target short",
