There are a few trades where it doesn't look look it's going my way, usually 10% max loss before I close. There were a few times where if I held it would've been profitable later in the day. But, there's a chance it could never reverse and lose even more. I take 5% gains, unlike this one, where it continued in my favor greatly and rapidly to where I took the 24%. \n\nI only do one or two trades a day at most.
