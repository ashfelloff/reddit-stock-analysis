  "selftext": "Amazon Inc. shares fell on Monday, following a rare analyst downgrade that cited concerns over margin trends into next year, which growth in the cloud computing business is unlikely to compensate for.\n\nWells Fargo Securities cut the stock to equal weight from overweight, with analyst Ken Gawrelski becoming one of the few analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesnâ€™t have a buy recommendation on the stock. He also cut his price target from $225 to $183, one of the lowest on Wall Street.\n\nAm I the only one that thinks AMZN is still undervalued? ",

They would be smart to simply perform a layoff because then at least the company would have the choice of who gets shown the door, versus this pseudo-layoff where only the people with options (aka top-performers and higher-level engineers) are going to leave. \n\nAmazon will then have to pay out-the-nose for the talent it needs to bring on and offer flexible work environments. Or they will pay a lesser premium (but a premium nonetheless) for middling employees who are willing to tolerate Amazon's work environment. \n\nI'm even more Bearish on Amazon long term because of their recent Prime Day stats; [the spending by Millennials was actually net-negative by 1.3%, and Gen X only had 1% growth.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-07-25/amazon-s-prime-day-sale-loses-a-bit-of-appeal-for-millennials) Standard jokes abound about Millennials not having money, they're actually starting to enter the age where they do actually have some money. Most Millenials are doing far better now than in the early to mid 2010's. But Gen X is entering their prime spending years, and Amazon is only seeing a net growth of 0.3% among these two age groups?

RTO will have some effect on the margins, but plenty of engineers want to work for Amazon, at least for a few years to get the experience and bank some cash.  This is how they've always run things, and they have been able to keep staffed with talented people.\n\nThe effect of promotions fades over time.  Black Friday sales used to be a huge driver of sales; now it is just another holiday on the promotional calendar; similarly, Prime Day isn't a big deal anymore.  Amazon doesn't need to raise its brand awareness like it did earlier, so they are cutting back on the deals, letting prime day become less important, and getting customers to buy when they want at regular price instead of training them to only buy when they get deep discounts (which is something that stores like legacy department stores have become reliant on, to their detriment).\n\nYou can't evaluate a company based on a single annual promotion.",
