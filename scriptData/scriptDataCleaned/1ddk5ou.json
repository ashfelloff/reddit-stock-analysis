Initially, Musk offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion in April 2022. However, he later tried to back out of the deal, citing concerns over the number of fake accounts on the platform.\n\nTwitter then filed a lawsuit to enforce the agreement, arguing that Musk was obligated to complete the purchase as per the terms of their contract. Facing a strong legal case and the likelihood of losing in court, Musk ultimately proceeded with the acquisition, finalizing the deal in October 2022. So while he wasn't literally forced, the legal ramifications made it highly advantageous for him to go through with the purchase.",
