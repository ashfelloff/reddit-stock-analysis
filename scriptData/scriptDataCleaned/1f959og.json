Also benefited TSMC by the channel of the equipment suppliers, informations flows both ways. \n\nBut Intel's main issue were trying to push DUV past its breaking point. Initial 10nm design goals were more agressive than what TSMC ended up with for 7nm for example. And they tried to implement other innovations like cobalt interconnects at the same time as DUV was pushed to its limits. \n\nThere was simply to much that could go wrong, so as a result something did go wrong.

They missed with Lunar Lake back to school and they are so far behind in AI. And the process node advantage is a nice quote from Gelsinger. I wouldn't just repeat everything he says. I don't think that they will be competitive against TSMC for the foreseeable future, but that's speculation.\n\nWhat I want to talk about it Step 2: Dude, have you completely lost your mind? Didn't you read an earnings report from the last two years? Xeon is dying. Yes, they still sell about 70% of all data center CPUs, but their ASP is far behind Epyc. There margins are shrinking every quarter. They are only selling so many, because the transition is very slow in that industry, but it has started and won't be stopped for a very long time. Epyc will take over >50% of total market share within the next two years (my personal assumption). \n\nAnd that's exactly where AMD is making money and Intel is not making enough money.\n\nPlease, please don't believe everything that Gelsinger says and don't believe that a superior process node will magically solve all of Intel's problems.",
