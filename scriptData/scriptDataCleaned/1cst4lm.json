I got in after hours on Friday, it just checked off too many boxes of mine from my limited experience with the smaller vertical jumps in 2022, all the same social media users rattling off about short interest and moass, etc etc. it had been quiet for so long, this new uptrend was not a one off. Then my suspicion was confirmed when DFV posted his meme of the guy leaning forward, game on! Watched dumb money for the first time that night, got my girl to download the app and trade this play with me, sent her money, we both hit big enough and sold the top, premarket on Tuesday. I made back more than what I sent her to trade with, she made more than I originally sent her too! Now I think she really enjoys trading, what a cool win.
