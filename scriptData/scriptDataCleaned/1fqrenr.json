  "selftext": "I took a break from trading for a while and transferred out most of my gambling account after my run in Q1 & Q2‚Ä¶ got a bit of an itch again this week and saw that I had $600 left in the account. Figured the Russel was set up to move upwards as it was retreating the last week a bit, and with interest rates starting to come down my theory was that small caps were due for some market rotation. I timed my bets as 1DTE‚Äôs focusing on the jobs reports Thursday and Core PCE today.\n\nNow I just need to repeat this 4 weeks in a row and I‚Äôll be on my way to retiring!",
