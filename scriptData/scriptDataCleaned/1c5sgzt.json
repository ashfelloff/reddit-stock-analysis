I grabbed a few shares myself just because I love the product & the risk reward at this prices just makes sense, but the reality is pretty ugly. Within the next 3 years, RIVN either declares bankruptcy, gets a bailout (public or private), issues a large amount of new shares â€” which would result in significant dilution â€” or gets bought out (part of me thinks Apple or Amazon should buy them, but thatâ€™s just a wacky intrusive thought). \n\nDo you have a thesis behind this yolo?

People think of Amazon as an online retailer (and AWS, but leave that aside for this) when the correct way to think about Amazon is as a logistics company whose profits on retail are dependent on how efficient they can move goods from point A to B. Part of the reason Amazon will see its profit skyrocket the next couple of years is because their logistical efficiency is increasing rapidly. In any case, going back to RIVN, Amazon's sole interest in building their own vehicles would be if doing so would enable them to improve their logistics sufficiently to make it worthwhile.",

Elon was able to save Tesla, but Elon is also not human and was operating in a very different environment under very different financial circumstances. Point is, thereâ€™s a small chance Rivian succeeds, and if they do, the payoff will probably be pretty substantial given their IP.",
