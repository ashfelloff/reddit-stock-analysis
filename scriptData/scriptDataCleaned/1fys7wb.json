              "body": "Yes, this is especially clear from the fact Jensen can now afford a tie.\n\n\nGoing forward, to keep track of the progress of the AI boom, we should keep a keen eye for any further wardrobe changes to Jensen. \n\nWe should also remember that we cannot see what he wears at home in private - it could be that he needed to stretch for the tie, resulting in burlap sacks as housewear. This would suggest the AI boom is mostly smoke and mirrors.\n\nIt could also be true that he has a ball-pit-esque containment of ties in which he bathes regularly, pretending to be a car going through a washing station. This would be incredibly bullish for the AI boom story.",
