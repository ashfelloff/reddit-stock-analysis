I live in austin too (just signed a lease for a retail space) and it’s been insanely difficult to find a solid retail space in a decent location as national chains have started flooding in to open locations here among other factors. I think businesses closing may be a function of the underlying business being poorly run/bad, or being located in a subpar location, not necessarily an indication of weak retail CRE demand",
