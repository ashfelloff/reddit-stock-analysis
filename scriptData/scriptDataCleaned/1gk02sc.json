Ask me anything.\nMcDonald’s workers + pizza delivery age 16-18. \nTechnician + food buffet server ages 10-23.\nCommunity college age 23-25.\nMechanical engineering bachelors age 25-28.\nBootstrapped business ages 28-32.\n\nAwaiting December of this year to receive 275k back from treasuries. Allocating another 50k for a total 300k of investment into palantir for a 5-10Y hold. \nKeeping 100k for business operating expenses + collecting 4.5% interest via Wealthfront.\nUnsure where to allocate the remainder 100k.\n\nThoughts? Goal is to pull the 300k worth of palantir when it is at 474 share price in 2034. Cash out $3.3M and pay 1.3M in taxes. Have $2M liquid and hope to have finally + kid. Ask me anything ",

Previously I was holding calls for February 2025 as the expectation was phase 3 clinical trial results for their primary drug COMP 360 would be announced in December or January. However, due to enrolment delays they announced that phase 3 results won’t be released until Q2 2025. So unfortunately will have to wait a while longer. I’m rolling my calls over into May 2025 probably. The plus side is it’s dirt cheap right now, under $5. I’m doubling down and will throw 10k at it, going to pick up some shares too.

At that time the internet was a new thing. Even though we had a 38k dial up modem - and it was slow as heck, we all knew the future was going to be related to the internet\n\nAnd so people were pouring their life savings and earnings into company like CISCO, Intel, Oracle, Research in Motion and yes we had Amazon at that time. Amazon wasn’t as hugely successful at that time since they were an online book seller. We also had other internet companies like Pets.com and Geocities. Even in 1999 companies like Microsoft and Apple were already a household name that everyone knew about. \n\nBecause of the internet mania people were buying up stocks to very high PE values since it was a new growth industry and “PE doesn’t matter cause the internet is gonna change the world”\n\nAnd so when the stock market crashed in late 1999 and 2000 people lost everything. I knew white collar workers, mind you they were older people who lost everything and one guy he ended up ending his own life.\n\nAnd here’s the thing - the internet DID change the world. We do everything online now. So many new apps and companies are dependent on the internet - but it TOOK almost 20 years before the internet has become a dominant force that it is today. The companies that SURVIVED that mass extinction event became the dominant companies we have today\n\nThat guy who I said ended his life - he bought stock in Microsoft and Amazon and Pets.com. He was wrong on Pets.com that company vanished during the internet dot com crash. But if he had lived he could have bought the entire neighborhood with his Microsoft and Amazon stock. But it’s going to take 15 to 20 years before he sees the fruits of his investment \n\nSo the take home message is this: AI will very likely revolutionize our world just like how the internet created new industries and businesses. \n\nI would even go as far and say that crypto companies and Bitcoin have the ability to change the world - but it’s still so early. \n\nThere’s gonna be a crash one way or the other and THEN the AI companies that survive that corporate extinction will go on to dominate the world. \n\nPalantir ain’t bad. They’re reporting consistent profit now and it’s growing EPS and I actually sort of like both Alex Karp and Peter Thiel. \n\nBut unless you bought Palantir when it was $8 to $9 dollars a share I would be very concerned that this AI bubble is just like the internet dot com bubble. \n\nJust so you know I bought stock in CISCO back in 1998 and lost serious money on it in 99. But I was young and as painful as it was I could work and I recovered \n\nPersonally I do like Palantir, but we’re still early in the ball game. It may take 10 years to really see how AI impacts the world. In the mean time buckle up for a wild ride.\n\nBest of wishes!",
