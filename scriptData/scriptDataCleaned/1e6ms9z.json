  "selftext": "**Thesis**: Crowdstrike is not worth 93 billion dollars (at time of writing).\n\n\n**Fear**: CrowdStrike is an enterprise-grade employee spying app masquerading as a cloud application observability dashboard.\n\n\n**OBSERVATIONS**\n\n* The 75th percentile retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoftware Engineering‚Äù, and ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù.\n* The median ‚ÄúCyber Security Analyst‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù\n* The median ‚ÄúSoftware Engineer‚Äù has a tenuous grasp on ‚ÄúCyber Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúCloud‚Äù\n* The median retail investor has a tenuous grasp on ‚Äúmarkets‚Äù and ‚Äúliquidity pools‚Äù\n \n\n\n**CRITIQUES**\n\n* Corporations could buy CrowdStrike to spy on their own employees.\n\n* CrowdStrike‚Äôs utility is limited- they simply collect all of their customer‚Äôs data and display it on a dashboard. \n* CrowdStrike is dangerous in that they have root access to every device(i.e. endpoint) across thousands of firms.\n* CrowdStrike customers sign up to get their firm‚Äôs data added to a bank which CrowdStrike then has license to use for ‚Äúcorrelation‚Äù\n* CrowdStrike is a sitting-duck datamine for the FBI/NSA to subpoena. \n* CrowdStrike could potentially behave as a propaganda arm of the US government by creating ‚Äúfake hacking stories‚Äù which are un-disprovable.They are able to do this due to information asymmetries in society.\n* Properly built ‚Äúcloud applications‚Äù have security baked in by virtue of separation of concerns in the \"software supply chain\". (e.g. containerization engine developer is different than the OS developer is different than the Cloud Infrastructure Provider). \n* CrowdStrike‚Äôs Falcon product contradicts their own guiding principle of ‚ÄúZero-Trust Security‚Äù.\n\n\n**COMMENTARY**\n\n* CrowdStrike‚Äôs product includes a ‚Äúclient‚Äù which runs on every \"customer endpoint‚Äù (i.e. company issued laptop). Activity on the company issued laptop is reported to an internal dashboard which only an IT guy + a C-Suite admin have access to. They ALSO offer observability into each component of a business‚Äôs own ‚Äúcloud application‚Äù.\n* These are 100% different lines of business which can be easily conflated.\n* CrowdStrike admits that they collect all of a business‚Äô ‚Äúendpoint data'' and they compare it to other data they have to \"draw insights\"; this means that every company that hires CrowdStrike is part of a DATA COMMUNE.\n* It‚Äôs prohibitively hard to hack into a ‚Äúcloud system‚Äù due to few possible entry points\n* Exfiltrating data at scale is difficult; employees of the company pose a bigger threat than \"threat-actors\".\n* *Containerize Everything* + *Microservices Architecture* hampers \"lateral movement\". \n* Is CrowdStrike compatible with companies that run their IT systems on premises?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*The CrowdStrike Story So Far‚Ä¶*\n\n\n\n**2020**\n\n* ‚ÄúUses cloud technology to detect and thwart attempted cybersecurity breaches‚Äù\n\n* ‚ÄúRuns on your endpoint or server or workload‚Äù\n\n* ‚ÄúSignature based technologies don‚Äôt go far enough‚Äù\n\n* ‚ÄúWe collect trillions of events‚Äù \n\n* ‚ÄúThere hasn‚Äôt been a salesforce of security‚Äù \n\n‚Äî  FAST FORWARD ‚Äî \n\n**2024**\n\n* Palo Alto Networks(100% different business line) is being pitted against CrowdStrike in the media. \n* Crowdstrike allegedly offers a poorly differentiated suite of generically titled products: **(Falcon Discover, Falcon Spotlight, Falcon Prevent, Falcon Horizon, Falcon Insight(EDR), Falcon Insight(XDR), Falcon Overwatch, Falcon Complete(MDR), Falcon Cloud Security)**. There is no way to confirm unless you schedule a meeting with their team though.\n* I spoke to a ‚ÄúNetwork Engineer‚Äù at CrowdStrike. He said that he ‚Äúmostly tries to get bug bounties‚Äù. \n* ‚ÄúCrowdStrike —Åustomers: 44 of 100 Fortune 100 companies, 37 of 100 top global companies, 9 of 20 major banks & 7 of the TOP 10 largest energy institutions.‚Äù  This makes it a threat vector.\n\nMisleading videos on their site: \n\n* https://vid.crowdstrike.com/watch/P4xk1x3PaH1D6rR4MiW2F5? \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x7eiznCfAg \n* https://www.crowdstrike.com/platform/cloud-security/cspm/ \n\n\n**My Position:**\n\n* CRWD $185 Put, 11/21/25 expiration date,.\n* 5 contracts @ $7.30, up 16.85% since 06/11/24 \n\n\n\n*First Draft/Final Draft: June 11th/July 18th*\n\nEdit: [Gains](https://imgur.com/a/Q09o7iY)",
