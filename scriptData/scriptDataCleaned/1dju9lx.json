  "selftext": "People who call leveraged ETFs like SPXL a 'wealth destroyer' are just too impatient.\n\nHere, I simulated SPXL all the way back to 1935, because the real SPXL only started in 2008. From the *log* chart, the ETF seems reliable over the long term, while vastly outgrowing SPY. It 10x'es every \\~18 years (ignoring dividends), so put 10k in now, and be a millionaire in 36 years. With reinvesting dividends, it's 10x every \\~16 years.\n\nWhy not do this?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/m857xcmtil7d1.png?width=1882&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d5ce86865debd8681a7b1fac5c520f85d500694\n\n",

It’s a moot point to compare the top performing tech stocks in a vacuum against ETFs that encapsulate more stocks. But isn’t that the whole point of investing in funds like this?

                      "body": "I feel you, but it's all oversimplification in here. The ETFs under discussion are the leveraged ETFs TQQQ and SPXL. Typically you'll buy (not option) an ETF to militate against draw down when the market falters. But leveraged funds amplify drawn down. So why invest in a leveraged ETF long term if doing so risks a larger draw down and longer time to recovery? One answer to this question is that you're diversified elsewhere and accept the risk for the potential upshot for this section of your portfolio, presuming you think your exit window won't fall during a recovery period. Okay. But long term you take on more risk on the presumption a downturn will happen again, which I'm suggesting undercuts the value in the upshot given the increased recovery time. As an alternative, I suggested you buy into the major stock holdings of the ETFs in question, which are currently MSFT, AAPL, NVDA. One could buy more, like the top 10 holdings, as shumy-doc above suggested. And of course you'd want to re-balance as necessary, just as the ETF you're partially tracking would. So you're not picking the right lottery numbers after the draw, you're tracking and following market sentiment about what's valuable for the most part.\n\nIf you did this in 2022 just before the market tank, VOO would have held more value than your stocks, but they would have held more value than both SPXL and TQQQ and recovered quicker and out performed VOO and the leveraged ETFs by now.  \n\nThis I think is a defensible rational for approaching the risk present in leveraged securities over the longer term.

All the while being much easier to manage in case of volatility compared to options. Just manage it like you would a normal etf, only with more leverage. If you can handle 0dte volatility you can handle 3x lmao\n\nOP is 100% correct, impatient regards are okay being -75% in a day or a week while losing sleep and braincells, but a 75% dip in 1 year (out of how many years of green) where you somehow bought the top but can still DCA into it and will breakeven and into the green not long after is \"stupid\"? Like huh? That's assuming you're not already bought into it much earlier, at that point it's not even that big a dip.\n\nAnd if you're already up big after a long time but start to get shaky just trail your shit then, buy back in when you're confident assuming some big crash happens and you get stopped/trailed out, I would consider even Higher levered ETFs on bigger corrections and capturing the recovery then scale out, don't even need to touch the rest, it's not that deep.\n\nEdit: Obviously high concentrated/weighted LETFs like TQQQ are much riskier, still it's just about patience and DCA. People bitch about bull market and no dips, and when one comes they pussy out, lock in losses and ![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224) to keep buying, then complain and get frustrated during recovery.",

I'm still up 150k.\n\nPeople who say never hold this shit over night are morons. People who say they are \"expensive\" are morons. You make all that back anyways on divdends so it's a wash.\n\nIt's pretty simple really if you are looking to buy and sell. Maybe sell some CC's...buy some puts to hedge when shit goes on a rally.\n\nBut I've literally had at least 100k in those stocks for years now and it's perfectly fine so long as you understand what you are getting in to.\n\nWould I buy them with every penny I have right now and just watch them? Definitely not.\n\nBut if you wait for a nice downturn you can absolutely throw shit in when markets are down 10-15% and just wait. Anyone who went TQQQ after it's 35% drop two years ago would have made bank. (btw the 3x did not drop 115% either so that's a plus with how that actually works)\n\nHonestly with how WSB trades I am surprised these etf's are not a bigger thing around here. You can play the actual markets and make bank. If you wanna make \"bets\" then what's better than 3x.\n\nI think people who think these decay or some shit don't know what they are talking about. Your charts prove that. They don't even understand how our markets work. If these fucking decayed then that would mean our economy would basically be collapsing (or in a extended downturn for decades). At that point you got bigger problems.\n\nAnd in that case I'd much rather risk losing 1/3 of my $$ to make the same amount with the rest in cash than watch it all burn. \n\nThink about it this way. You have $300. You literally could have put $100 in 3x (tqqq) and $300 in 1x. Markets drop just like they did. 35% in 1x and 80% in tqqq.\n\nAt that point you have lost $80 in TQQQ out of your $300 so you sitting pretty at $220 left with $200 on sidelines. Your 1x just lost you $105 and you sitting on $195.\n\nNow you throw an extra $100 into TQQQ to ride the wave back up. You still are fully invested in the 1x but you still have $100 in cash sitting on sidelines in the 3x.\n\n\nOn July 28 2023 your 1x gets you back to even ($300) whereas your 3x has got you sitting at $425 total. Ride the wave till today? 1x at $360 while TQQQ at $642.\n\nIt's pretty much simple common sense but so many people talk so much nonsense they can't see past the noise. You can risk far fucking less to make just as much money while also losing actually less money because of that in a downturn (any 3x greater than 100% even better so once 1x crosses 33% uou saving even more) and then if you continue to deposit that extra cash into the 3x when it finally does turn around you make bank.\n\nI'm telling everyone because I've done it. Even through one of the worst bear markets. Trade the volatility for free $$, risk less, don't be scared to hold and be ready to reinvest cash when shit is low. ",

It's probably much worse if the bear market frequency is more common. we had a very long bull market in the 2010s decade.

Let me elaborate my current understanding of it. \n\nAs opposed to a normal leveraged position, you do not pay overnight costs. (Overnight cost is basically interest on the money you've borrowed to make your leveraged position). \n\nFor a leveraged ETF, you do not pay the interests yourself. Rather, its incorporated in the expense ratio. Meaning its basically deducted from your earnings. So rather than having to *pay* interest, you *earn less* to pay for interest. That's incredibly different. It costs me nothing for the market to be down a decade. \n\n\n\nI appreciate your concern, but it might be wise to take a more constructive (read: less hostile) position in this discussion. Thanks",

You dont avoid costs by day trading (and you would get annihilated by T-costs & also most of the best S&P moves happen overnight IIRC).\n\nThe interest is not incorporated into the expense ratio. you are wrong. It is embedded in the price of the underlying swaps/derivatives used to get the 3x exposure. The methods may look different but, as there are no free arbs, the outcome is exactly the same.

Look at LTCM for example. in the debt market the whole thing was essentially a case study in leveraging risky assets to magnify gains (think: The Big Short). \n\nThe inherent problem with leveraged equity returns as that when you MOST want to leverage - is when you are least able to. Of course, if you believe you can time the top thats another thing - but we're talking about the long run here. \n\nLook at QQQ vs the Nasdaq - its only just back at parity starting at \\~2017 and we are back at all time highs.
