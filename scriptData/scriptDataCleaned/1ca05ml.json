If you additionally consider the failure rates and the complete lack of dealerships as they sell direct to owners, in an effort (and a smart one) to offset any associated costs of franchises and dealership arrangements - this means owners have little choice but to also sell their models to an unsuspecting new owner.\n\nTesla do have other revenue streams in battery tech etc, true, but they are not (to my knowledge) using or offering flow batteries (newish battery type which is better than lithium ion variants) and so, they are (again, AFAICT) behind the curve on that with older battery tech).\n\nYou might think your Tesla is a great car - and good for you, but I would think those that have lost value from their Tesla car due to horrendous resale values, would not return to buy another Tesla in a hurry.\n\nThat's just logic. Total number of people who would buy a Tesla has been hit, like he has a ceiling to his potential owners, if you see what I mean. Once you buy a Tesla, you do not buy another one in a hurry, and, without a dealership network, all competitors are quick to offer trade-ins, and thereby off-load the burden for the owner, losing a sale.\n\nResales and trade-in deals are a big market (ask Carvana) and this means Tesla cannot maintain a continued relationship with a car that has lost a lot (and I mean a staggering amount) of its value after a short period of time.\n\nTesla also are in the habit of selling their vehicles at a lower price, making owners pockets hurt even more if they have just bought one of the cars they sell, only to find it got discounted a week later by 30% or something nutty.\n\nThe pandemic was a weird moment in history for companies, but now we are dealing with other major financial problems and Tesla is gonna get shorted into the ground.\n\nIf I am right, of course...",

Rather EV play was some notion that we'd actually build out massive infrastructure, and most of all, *MAINTAIN IT!*  Something we're not doing even now.\n\nThere's some grants to install charging stations but no money to fix them if they get vandalized/clips break/whatever and we're already seeing chargers breaking rapidly and staying broken for months.  if they even exist at all, probably something like 90%+ of America by land-mass still doesn't have good access to chargers. Likewise, most of our grid is still from coal/gas and has seen marginal increases at absolute best (and regression in some states!).\n\nThe EV play was also coupled with rising gas prices and the idea as we enter an age of declining EROEI (essentially peak oil but less 2000s blog terms) that we need to move toward more electric non-gas vehicles. And to be entirely clear, gas prices *are* rising but we're suppressing it through various machinations such as dumping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on the market and pumping the Permian Basin as fast as fucking possible even though it's already going to be peaking very soon. The end of <$5/g gas is rapidly advancing, maybe not this year or even the next, but this decade easily.\n\nIt's definitely a case of the cart coming before the horse, just like VR.\n\nThat said, the initial EV stock bubble was definitely crazy no matter how you slice it; however,  I don't think there's anything wrong with EVs in a vacuum and still are *ultimately the future* (also they're hella fun to drive just zipping off like a rocket to the moon) but everything needed to support them basically doesn't exist except for tiny enclaves of upper-class Silicon Valley workers",

      "body": "This is pretty spot on from a historical viewpoint, but Tesla’s valuation was never about car sales. No car company would ever come close to this Apple-like market cap. It is more about battery factories, the solar energy, the power-wall stuff & the charging network. The charging network is the biggest single advantage that Tesla has and positions\nthem well in the future. But 1) Fuck Elon for ruining the brand, 2) Fuck him for holding Tesla hostage to pay for his Twitter mistake & 3) Tesla was always ridiculously overpriced based on the imaginary future that Musk built up. I think Tesla will continue to hold a large portion of EV market share, and can thrive if Musk will let it go (which I doubt). I don’t own shares in Tesla, because I just can’t see its market cap going up from here. If I shorted stocks, this would be the one I’d short.",

If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen and buy index funds or ETFs. Better yet put your money in bonds with no possibility of creating generational wealth. I'll put my money in Elon Musk's hands. No risk, no reward. However, in my opinion there isn't a lot of risk by investing in Tesla. I sleep fine at night with my large position.
