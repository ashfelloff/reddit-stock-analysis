Especially one like today or whenever that bench warmer Kashkari talks (mofo doesn't even have a vote but goes out of his way to talk hawkish).\n\nAt the end of the day, the Fed knows inflation is mostly slayed and the next action will likely be a cut. JPow knows it. The voting members know it. Yellen knows it. Biden knows it and literally said it on the campaign trail. And the market knows it. \n\nFed just talks hawkish cause it's a free rate hike they don't have to do. It keeps the market controlled from bubbling too hard, it pushes down yields/gold/btc that are anti-dollar trades, it gives each greedy corporate suit 1 less reason to hike prices or shrinkflate their product, it gives real 🐻s a chance to cover their shorts while 🌈🐻 jump in like the clowns they are, and it spooks out regards like OP while wiping out 0DTE/FD idiots even as it gives investors a chance to [\"buy the dip\"](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fp3zsbgoq24821.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3De2261d054ba87d25fde96d3fc4b39a2e14aeebf8)\n\nIt's truly a freebie for everyone.",
