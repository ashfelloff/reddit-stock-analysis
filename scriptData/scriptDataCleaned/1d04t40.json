That’s 400k each between two kids after tax. Are you saying that a 40% deposit isn’t enough to get you a mortgage?  \n\nThere’s also the property ladder. Start in an apartment which is way way cheaper than buying a house. You don’t need a million dollar home out of the gate. \n\nAlso the UK is more than just London. \n\nYes it’s hard. But it’s not impossible. \n\nIf you really care about buying a home, stop gambling on crypto and save.",
