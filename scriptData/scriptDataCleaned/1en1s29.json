The other account had roughly the same loss.  \nDespite knowing the common-sense rules and statistics of the stock market, I've been a prime example of sheer bad luck and poor decisions, repeatedly losing my entire account to zero over the past 20 years, an overall loss of about half a million dollars, more than half of which came in last 9 months. Despite knowing that it is an inflationary decade, similar to 80's and a bit of roaring 20s, I shorted the market against my common sense and knowledge. Yet, I've persevered, rebuilding my accounts time and again pouring all my paychecks into the markets and losing them over and over again. From stocks to futures, options, bonds, and currencies—I've dived into them all. From watching the Lehman Brothers collapse live while invested in call options to shorting the volatility during the crash of covid induced panic and shorting NVDA and AVGO during AI mania, I have experienced all sorts of pain - while on a fixed paycheck. Ask me anything.  \n  \n",

          "body": "Thank you. I'm sorry, but I will not be able to comment on Intel specifically because I've shifted from individual stocks to focusing on macro trends, primarily dealing in indices futures. For instance, the Nasdaq followed a perfect cup and handle pattern and met its targets. I expect gold, which is following a similar pattern, to reach $2600 and eventually $3000 after the current correction. I believe, this correction might bring some pain and lead to a series of rate cuts by the Fed, sparking the final leg of our current bull run, followed by a prolonged deflationary bust period over the next 2-3 years.\n\nI do not think that the current mania of triple-digit returns in weeks and months is sustainable. On a macro level, this echoes the patterns of the 1920s and 1970s-1980s. History may not repeat, but it certainly rhymes. I plan to add to my indices futures gradually and carefully as the market corrects, as I believe the markets are not completely done with their upward run yet. Owing to recent economic data indicating a possible recession and it being an election year, the next couple of months will likely be volatile and continue a downward movement until the Fed announces something, or the economic data rules out a possible recession and confirms a soft landing. These events may spur a turnaround. This is just my personal view on the markets, and of course, I may be slightly or completely off—what do I know?",

I made some money by buying in at 21 and exiting at 40, but it’s nothing compared to what I lost over the last nine months. I still believe UVXY has potential for another run after pulling back to the 40s since touching 69, but I’m currently looking at other opportunities.

In fact, I almost recovered a large part of my losses in a single day with a perfect trade. One of those moments was on May 6th, 2011, during the flash crash—a day I remember vividly. I had bought a lot of Apple put options right after the market opened, around 9:40 am. The stock was steady for a couple of hours, but then my manager called me into a meeting, and I decided to close my position because I wanted to keep a close eye on the movement. When I came back an hour later, my position would have been up by $10k. I felt terrible. Another hour later, it would have been up by $25k. Then, around 2:20 pm, the flash crash happened, and by the end of it, my position could have been up by $110k. That was nearly my entire loss up to that point. I could have recovered most or all of my losses that day. When it was all said and done, I was trembling with that event knowing I had missed a golden opportunity to recover years of losses in a single day just because of that fateful meeting. There were a few other close calls, but this one hurt the most. That’s why I said luck never seemed to be on my side in the markets. And yes, I have faced losses so consistently that seeing red has almost become second nature to me. I absolutely have regrets of not investing that money in real estate instead.",

      "body": "Hey dude, I rarely ever comment on anything (long time lurker) but just wanted to add my two cents here. Don't listen to the bullshit in here about you being a gambler etc, from what I can see your clearly a smart guy with a good grasp on macroeconomics, lots of experience, and very logical trades, HOWEVER, the key issue is your timing. Just because you have come to the conclusion that the market will eventually change direction, i.e. predicting a turnaround (buying calls) in 2008, you were too early and didn't wait long enough for the market to fully realise/panic, further, hoping it was a soft landing, when this is very rare. Hope is not a strategy. Had you waited another 6-12 months (depending on your expiration dates), when VIX calmed down slowly in early 2009, bought then, allowing for longer expiries, you would be significantly in the money. Shorting AI mania is very logical, however the market will continue to be delusional until the tide turns, which takes a long time. Think of your trades as an s-curve, it starts with an idea, then it takes time for mass adoption of the idea. Look for the acceleration of the idea, which happens quickly. Just because you are right, it always takes longer than you think for the market to realise or accept they are wrong. For example, Michael Burry was very early in 2005 shorting the housing market, despite being very logical, the amount of shit he had to put up with for 2 years was astonishing, to eventually be proven right. If for example he didn't allow for enough time, the premiums on his positions could have bankrupted his fund (if his investors kept withdrawing funds). Other investors who were very late to this trade also made significant amounts, because their timing was much better. Try to learn the art of patience. Learn to sit quietly in a room full of people who are wrong, without saying anything, just wait for the optimum pricing on your bet, place your bet, allowing enough time, and find a hobby to keep yourself busy in the meantime. I like your gold bet, very logical, history is on your side, don't be too early. It's not like the fed has ever been delusional about a soft landing in the past right! Rate cuts are inevitable, but allow for extra time for the cuts to happen. Thanks and anyone who disagrees with me can suggon deeznuts",

          "body": "Finally, a thoughtful comment with useful ideas instead of harsh judgments based on half-baked perception and incomplete understanding. You’ve accurately grasped my situation and mistakes, and I completely agree with your conclusions and suggestions. Indeed, one of my biggest issue was timing the market. Unlike Mr. Burry, whom I admire, I didn’t have access to a large amount of capital when I needed it. Back in 2008, I was still new to the markets and made the mistake of buying short-term options which went to zero emptying my account. I learnt my lesson and switched to play spreads or LEAPS since. This time around, I made another mistake by not setting stop losses in a euphoric market. I ran out of liquidity and had to cover my shorts just a month before everything started to correct. If I hadn’t been forced to cover due to margin calls, I would have recovered more than half of my losses by now, a good example of the saying \"The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.\" Unfortunately, luck hasn’t been on my side. I held my nerves for over a year, but my boat sank in shallow water, so to speak. Being a computer engineer, I'm logical and analytical, and most of the time, I've made money on my trades. However, one big loss from one or two bad trades wiped out the small profits from several successful ones, which is a direct example of the saying, \"let your profits run and cut your losses short\" which I failed to do. I appreciate your mature and insightful comment. Thank you.",

Buying puts means you can be wrong small, and forces you to come up with a reasonable timeframe, be it 6, 12 months say, and factor in IV. If you can't generate 10x+ returns on your BASE case, that frankly isn't good enough upside to make the bet. Sit in cash and wait. Implied vol calmed down in July-Aug 2008, RIGHT before shit got real. At the time, there was rapid rising unemployment, interest rates coming down, significant weak spots (I.e. subprime loans etc), yet the hope was \"oh everything will be fine\". Calm before the storm. If at some point in the next 12 months markets appear to \"calm down\", even if unemployment is accelerating (not just rising but accelerating), that's complete complacency, THAT'S when puts are cheap (downside low upside high)",

A few years later when I had recovered financially, seeing everyone around me making money from my advice and technical charting capabilities while I was sitting on the sidelines made me return. I re-entered the market in late 2019, only to face the COVID crash. I couldn’t have predicted how the market would react since no one knew how bad COVID would be. I shorted volatility when it reached to an outrageous level during covid crash, without an inkling that it was going to multifold from those levels. Call it a mix of stupidity and bad luck with the timing of my reentry? My biggest mistake was not having a stop loss.
