Yesterday, Ukraine reportedly arrested an FSB cell planning arson attacks, and French authorities arrested a Russian reality TV personality they had been monitoring who was allegedly an FSB asset planning destabilizing events in Paris for the Olympics. Russian atheletes of course are banned from the Olympics for doping violations and France's PM has been talking a lot recently about escalating military support for the defense of Ukraine.
