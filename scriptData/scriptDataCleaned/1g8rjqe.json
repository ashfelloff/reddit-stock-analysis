Gotta pump those red numbers up kid.\n\nI recommend pulling the \"the Elon\": fire everyone including the engineers and coders, then find out your site doesn't run without them, then begging for them back at higher wages than before, and then pay even more in consultation/contracting as there were a large segment (most likely the best ones) refuse to come back even with higher wages. Those engineers/codes didn't return even with the higher wages because they either got snatched up immediately by competitors, found different jobs already, didn't want take Elon's BS, or already had poachers on them but stayed at twitter for whatever reasons be it liking HR/culture or liking the mission prior to Elon being there. I understand Elon wanting to cut HR #16, useless guy #69, that girl who makes Tiktoks about how she doesn't do shit besides eat/drink/yoga for free at the office all day, the DEI head, or even the mods (why would you pay billions if not to tell the mods to kiss your ass?). But he fucked up firing the coders and engineers. They actually do real fucking work and manage the product.",
