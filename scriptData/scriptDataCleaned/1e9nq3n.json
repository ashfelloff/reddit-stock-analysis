Red or yellow-coloured ones are the go (they're sweeter) and not the green ones but hey, maybe some people like the green ones for this dish so you adjust to your taste. I recommend using a mix of beef stock and tomato passata sauce (equal parts or more to your liking) to cook your peppers in (fill the pot to like, halfway or a bit more) and spoon that over your cooked peppers when serving so it's very saucy, which makes all the difference. Make sure you cook them long enough so that the rice is cooked and the peppers are soft. I even added a different stuffed vegetable this time (it's not exactly zucchini but similar) and stuffed them too as I had stuffing leftover and that tasted nice too.\n\nMashed potato is a good side to go with as well as a dollop of sour cream. I had brussels sprouts so I made them as another side.",

Customers using the firm’s security platform were locked out of their Windows devices. While details are still emerging, CrowdStrike’s initial response emphasized that this incident was not a security breach and the faulty update has been rectified. We find some credence in this response, considering that within hours of the outage, companies with operations affected by CrowdStrike’s update have been able to gradually resume services.\n\nInvestors appear to have been spooked by recent high-profile security incidents and sold CrowdStrike shares Friday, with the stock dropping more than 11%. We think this reaction is overly punitive, especially considering the update doesn’t represent a breach of CrowdStrike’s security apparatus. While the stock still trades in 3-star territory, we think the pullback represents a good buying opportunity for long-term investors looking for high-quality security/software exposure.",
