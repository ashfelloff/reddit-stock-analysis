  "score": 97,
  "selftext": "Hello:\n\n4 Days ago on Saturday, I posted we were possibly headed down to fill a gap at around $505 and Monday morning premarket, we hit a low of $507.90 because of the Yen Carry Trade Unwind. Wall Street is going to get us down here whether we like it or not. This would imply an approx. 12% correction if we hit $500, fairly normal for a bull market. Coincidently, the 200 Day MA is currently at $500.80 as shown by the red line. It is acting as a magnet in my personal opinion.\n\nToday, lot of people were taken by surprise but if you saw it, there was a bear flag that was setup and have enclosed that chart as well. The high of today was $531.59 around 10am and barely on top of the flag pattern. For the next 45min, we tried to get above the bear flag but could not push through and the breakdown officially started around 11:10ish and well, the rest is history and momentum was significantly to the downside.\n\nSo, where do we go from here? Honestly, SPY/QQQ Puts will print or sitting on cash, being patient and waiting for the bottoming process before jumping back in. If you caught the breakdown today with Puts, well done and I don't see it being over. We will continue getting some relief bounces and rallies, only to be sold off later in the day or the following day so have to be agile with playing Calls and take profits when presented to you.\n\nWe may get the gift of a lifetime for example on Nvidia at $86 where there is a potential for a gap fill. Have to remember the correction took approx. 3 months last year and we haven't even been in this for a month. Being an election year, might be looking at volatility a little less than 2023's timeframe but still omnipresent upon us.\n\nGood luck.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7pmvkojskbhd1.png?width=3423&format=png&auto=webp&s=a54c7b9da928dddafa8995da4da46a7cd18c2030",
