So if you predict or want Elon to be out any time soon, you shouldn't be holding any $TSLA in the first place. And if you want him in, you might want to also vote for the package. So I'm not seeing a scenario where a rational $TSLA holder would want Elon out currently. They might bet that Elon will still stay even if he doesn't get the package, but that's a more difficult calculation.\n\nBut there may be significant fear at play that is currently decreasing the stock price if there's fear that this package won't get approved, that could also tank the stock price, because probability of Elon leaving would still increase. And even if it's just probability, it still has influence on the stock price.\n\nStock price is unlikely to fall if the package was approved, because the approval of it shows confidence in Elon and the company by shareholders, so shareholders for that reason would also be incentivised to approve the package, even if they hate Elon and the company and it's just a stock play.\n\n\n> Constant promises not kept and spouting dangerous rhetoric is not something all investors want from their CEO.\n\nIf that was a problem for them, they would've sold long time ago. Anyone who is currently staying in $TSLA has had years to sell from those Twitter rants.\n\n\nSo by natural selection, whoever are current shareholders would be the ones who would likely believe the package gets approved and they would also want to approve it, because if not the better decision would have been to sell the stock before hand.",

EV has now caught up, so only realistic reasons to be in the company is if you believe in Musk's promises about FSD.\n\nAnd even if you like the car, or have undying brand loyalty, it doesn't mean you have to own the stock.

As significant stakeholders in Tesla, we cannot endorse a pay deal that rewards such behavior.
