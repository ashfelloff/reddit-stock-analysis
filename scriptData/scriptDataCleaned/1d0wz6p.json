  "selftext": "They always say we will do the necessary actions according to the data but they interpret data as they wish, previously Pow said rate hike is very unlikely but recently members said it is possible, the language they use is never conclusive or leading, on the contrary, they are unpredictable, like, what the hell changed in a few weeks? Even wallstreetbets are more perceptive & forward looking about the next few months.\n\nI never trusted them about anything but their stance is never stable so you can't even bet against them, neither bet on them. Market investments' outlook are depending on them also so you kind of at least take heed what the hell they will say and try to guess.\n\nIf they rely on data so much, they should just shut up and release a spreadsheet every month about their rate decision. \n\nThey don't make any sense because they are just talking verbose & never say anything meaningful.\n\nI'm not an expert but it seems like it doesn't matter if you both can't predict the next month's outlook and change strategy every month and manipulate at every speech.",
