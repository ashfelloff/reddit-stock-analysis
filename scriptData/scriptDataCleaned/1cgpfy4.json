They will generally use it for convenience, gadgets, etc. while Europeans will generally resort to more DIY approaches for a lot of things. This is all big data stuff, it's how Netflix knows how much they can increase the price in each region to increase profitibility before getting people to drop off.\n\nAt the end of the day, an American will spend his entire $90K income, while a European will still probably save some of the $30K income, usually by living with family well into adulthood, buying cheap/old cars and maintaining them, exclusively cooking at home, etc. and that makes up a great difference. It's not the $5 Netflix increase that makes a difference, it's everything combined. Even myself, here are some subscriptions I pay for:\n\n-Netflix\n-Youtube Red\n-Amazon prime\n-Google storage\n\nThis amounts to a large amount of money, and I'm not even the worst case. I know plenty of Americans with many more subscriptions, on top of interest payments of CC debt, car payments, mortgage/home payments, etc and poof the $90K is gone despite being near top 0.1% of median world-wide income, and somewhere in the above-average range for US income.\n\nAt the end of the year, European and American overall standards of living are about the same, maybe even higher for the European, except the European made 3x less money.\n\nAnd I know the US is a bit in crisis-mode these days, and Americans are complaining.. and the only thing I see is that.. well, you guys are about to start living like Europeans again and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Eventhough people cancelled subscriptions, the total amount lost from cancellations < total amount gained from increasing price in NA. Also i'm sure the revenue is also being driven by people having to get their own netflix subscription due to the \"household\" rule they've strictly implemented in late 2023 / early 2024.\n\nMy prediction is that Netflix will continue to increase prices as long as the total amount gained from increasing price > total amount lost from cancellations atleast in NA which will continue upwards trajectory. \n\nIt would seem that Netflix has competition in places like APAC, EMEA, etc. so we might not see price hikes / as steep price hikes as the US",
