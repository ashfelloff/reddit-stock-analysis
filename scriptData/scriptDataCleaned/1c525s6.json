Why pay for shitloads of diesel/gas and monthly maintenance for company vehicles that do 100 miles a day? Just charge them overnight, and 300 miles will be more than enough for the vast majority of businesses. \n\nI drive a fleet car and have been preparing for this shift for a while. I started tracking my mileage just to see if it could work when my company inevitably switched to EVs. I drive several hours every shift and I very rarely top 200 miles. My company recently started offering long range model 3s as an option and I have literally never once had a single shift where that range wouldn't be enough. \n\nTl;dr fleet are a massive overlooked market where EVs absolutely 100% will dominate",
