  "selftext": "I decided to sell naked calls on CMG assuming it would go down with the backlash it was facing. For reasons unknown to me, I completely ignored the fact that they are going to split next week. And for more reasons unknown to me, I kept watching the stock rise, my loss multiplying into -500%, thinking it will come back. \n\nNow the calls are in the money and I'll be assigned a ton of CMG short stock with a negative value over the weekend\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/e08u08rb4n6d1.png?width=2432&format=png&auto=webp&s=3f0219f9039230de2aa4997e5868b022f929d337\n\nWondering if I should continue to be regarded or see if there's a way to recover from this before or after the split",
