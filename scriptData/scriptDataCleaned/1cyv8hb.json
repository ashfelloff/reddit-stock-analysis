  "selftext": "Very simple thesis here which is that people are too short Novavax ($NVAX).\n\n\n\nNovavax, which stands for “VAX that NObody wants,” just closed a 1.2 Billion deal with Sanofi. $500m of that is due up front and right off the bat is going to make the company profitable for the first time ever. The price tag has the opportunity to be higher because Novavax receives royalties on all vaccine sales. Even if you ignore the short interest, I don’t believe this has been priced in.\n\n\n\nShort interest in the stock was at 33% on April 30th. The activity following the announcement spike makes me think that people have not closed their short positions. Rather than see several spikes, like what happened with other squeezes,  there’s just a relatively steady increase. Fidelity should update their info in the next couple days and if it’s anywhere close to 30, I think there are a lot of people who are on the brink of being forced to sell.\n\n\n\nTL;DR: I don’t think the Sanofi deal has been priced in to NVAX and I still think a ton of people are short.\n\n\n\nMy position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0nvi3qn1072d1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=422ba623421cf1900a040cca553905234b656d7d\n\n",

So they didn't profit much with the covid vaccine that they spent money developing. Then they doubled down and spent 1.7 billion on covid/flu combo vaccine.
