  "selftext": "Hi everyone,\n\nA small-time rookie here. I'm looking for a long-term investment opportunity (3-4 years at least) that promises solid gains. While I aim to maintain a diverse portfolio, I'm considering allocating a substantial portion of my capital to a single company.\n\nOne company on my radar is Boeing. Despite the safety issues and incidents they've faced, I find it puzzling that their stock value remains significantly lower than its pre-pandemic levels, especially given the current surge in travel and vacationing among Americans. The demand for air travel is hitting record numbers.\n\nWith the public scrutiny over safety issues and the recent leadership shakeup, I'm hopeful that these problems will be resolved and Boeing's stock will return to pre-pandemic levels, offering a substantial gain.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Do you think the aviation sector is poised for upliftment or if AI-based companies are going to take away all the capital and any chances of upliftment. Also, what other companies should I be looking at?",

      "body": "Pre-COVID stock price was overhyped due to a decade of Boeing spending $43b on share buybacks. Today, every commercial production line is on literal fire and can't procure parts to actually meet current production rates, let alone continuously ramp up as the executives want.\n\nBoeing's largest labor union is also looking for a big contract this year after a 16-year contract (with 2 terrible extensions) - a strike is likely and honestly the company needs one to let suppliers catch up a little. During the MAX grounding and COVID, the company let the top end of its work force (mechanics and engineers) walk with early retirement instead of hitting the bottom seniority with big layoffs, as would have been typical. However, the company didn't bother to capture and transfer that knowledge and experience, and has been begging many of those people to return temporarily ever since. The blue-collar workforce is now very young compared to its historical value despite the 100+ year history, and a ton of basic issues have popped up in production due to the lack of experience. When I hired in early last decade, most of the people around me were 20+ years. Now? Most are 5 years or less...\n\nDefense is running negative margins on basically every recent product because they're mostly fixed-price contracts, and the company can't engineer successful anymore. Everything is running one or more billion dollars over the expected development cost, which the company has to eat.\n\nI can continue all day on random tangents but idk if it's a good investment. 0% of my 401k is in company stock, though I am putting 1% into the new(ish) ESPP for the meager 5% discount. IMO, the company only offered it to inject employee's cash back into itself, lmao. I think they're holding $50-60b worth of debt now, since 2020.\n\n-Source: I'm a current employee of more than a decade.",
