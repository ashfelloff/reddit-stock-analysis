Every time people read about small module reactors and how data centers will need nuclear is forgetting that there is currently none in commercial operation. The timeline it takes for SMR to become commercially operable is unknown. And the building of a large reactor takes decades. No new construction has even been approved so far.\n\nSo the true demand is 20+ years away whether it be small or large reactors. And in that period of time, many things can happen.\n\nI learned this lesson by being a bag holder of Cameco for 10+ years. Bought after the Fukushima lows around 10 bucks and sold recently for 5x. My thesis was exactly that the world needs nuclear and the demand will pick up. I was right but still at least 20 years early. If it weren't for the Ukraine war and Cameco being the safe supplier for North America, and the datacenter hype. I don't think uranium would have pumped this hard.",

Even the regulatory permitting and approval process takes 5+ years and we (edit 'we' as a country, not just my utility) have nothing in that pipeline as of right now. From there it takes 15+ years to get online. \n\nYoure also right to say that tech is energy agnostic. They don't care where they get it from, although they do have net/carbon neutral goals that mean they prefer to get a mix of their choosing. \n\nBut now we're in the spot where demand will outpace supply by 2030ish. There are legislators pushing back against data centers in fear of energy scarcity and we still don't have enough generation coming online. \n\nSolar is not it, and they know that. It's cheap but even paired with grid scale batteries (whole other debacle) it's not sufficient and comes with a slew of complications. These tech companies have vast amounts of capital and they want the biggest bang for the buck. SMRs are nearing a tipping point where it looks like they will be feasible in the next 5-10 years. This is their play. To meet energy needs and their carbon goals. \n\nIn my opinion, the federal government is going to give a little on green/renewable, allow for the construction of NG generation as a stop-gap, and hope that that buys us enough time to see nuke play out (again).",

No, it's not going away and if anything it is wildly undervalued. Bitcoin is a decentralized, ever increasingly secure, fixed supply monetary network that is essentially a black hole of value absorption. An ever increasing money supply / inflation will continue to push Bitcoin higher over the long haul.\n\nIs crypto a bubble? 99% of altcoins are purely speculative. The vast majority of these projects will not stand the test of time. Can you make a bunch of money with them? Yes, but you can also lose all your money with them. You'll see that as rate cuts occur and liquidity increases, lots of altcoins will pump and they become a game of bag holder hot potato. They are the definition of a bubble.",
