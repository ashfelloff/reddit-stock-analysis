My problem with shorts at open is you're essentially playing FOMO and jumping into a play right after the play already happened. There is no thesis for downside continuation after a 1000 point sell-off outside of \"maybe it'll continue to go down?\". On top of that, the premiums for short-side contracts are going to be extremely jacked after a move like that, so if you're not already in a position it'll be difficult to make money even if you were right on direction. Lump all that in with the people that were already in a short-position over the weekend looking to take profit at open, and you've got a better chance for a bounce or a chop than a significant continuation.",
