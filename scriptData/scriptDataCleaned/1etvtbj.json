Currently work as an Oncology Data Specialist but I have worked in staff rooms with physicians and in multiple specialties and the biggest complaints from doctors are charting, dictating, ordering tests (has the patient already had xyz), pt being poor historian, ins not covering this or that and we don’t know because the damn insurance companies are hard to navigate, records not coming with the patient… on and on. When electronic records first started and we were training docs a lot of them just flat out retired. Many of them say they work too hard on all the paperwork and its not even worth what they get paid. I’ve see all sides of it. If CLOV can do what they say they say, eliminate redundancy and streamline healthcare- that will be a major draw for providers to sign on. I don’t quite get it all yet but what I’m hearing is good plus the founders parents were doctors so he knows the gaps and where to fill them.",
