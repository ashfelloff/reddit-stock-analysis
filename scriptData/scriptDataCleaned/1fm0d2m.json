The point was if Intel declares bankruptcy; it will wipe out the shareholders but the business continues operating but many here don’t believe that. \n\nPeople who had GM shares prior to 2008 got wiped out as in lost all their money.  GM issued new shares after the bankruptcy and the there are new holders.\n\nSo if you have Intel shares NOW and they declare bankruptcy, you will lose all your money even if they make a comeback over the next 10 years.",

Intel still has been around for 40 years, they have plenty of R&D and estate value. And relating to 2008, it would take a massive US downturn to bankrupt Intel along with many other tech companies.\n\nMerger/Acquisitions of Intel seems much more likely to me than bankruptcy \n\nJust my opinion but the government stepped in last week, to me that's a good sign of steps in the right direction. If it wasn't for that then their trajectory would be less certain",

That would only happen if tsmc builds enough production capacity in the US and of course also the high tech stuff they keep in Taiwan. Still, right now politically the propping up legacy national businesses is en vogue so it would look bad if Intel fails. \n\nSo realistically it would look like this: Intel keeps doing terribly and holds on to their various parts too long until they have to fire sale them and by then it will only be a fraction of itself trading at a fraction of its current share price and that for a long time until the very much smaller and different future Intel shows promise of higher revenues and profits. I actually believe that won’t happen, there must be competence left at Intel to turn ship around and innovate again to find a profitable niche.",

I remember a blog post I wrote from almost 20 years ago that was critical of Craig Barrett, former intel CEO.  Mr Barrett was an electrical engineer but he acted like an accountant and was quick to blame his people when intel management was making really bad decisions based around short term thinking.\n\nIntel turned their nose up to the iPhone in 2005/6.  “It will only see a few hundred thousand copies.”  What a freaking mistake.\n\nIntel turned their nose up at graphics.  All the while, nvidia became the graphics company.  What’s graphics good for?  Beyond graphics, it’s secuity algorithms.  That leads you to crypto.  Those same algorithms are good for ai.  Nvidia wins again.\n\nApple had used Intel for the brains of their macs since 2005/6.  Apple shipped a buggy skylake processor and Intel wouldn’t fix the bugs.  And then Intel tried to go cheap in their shrink, which didn’t work well.  Apple got tired of deal with them for their cous.   Apple did buy their mobile communication chip business a few years ago.\n\nAnd now Intel is dealing with this voltage issue and big time returns on their 13 and 14th gen high end cpus.\n\nNone of these are good stories.  The worst case is that some private equity firm buys them out.  That’s the death knell for them.\n\nI wouldn’t be opposed to Qualcomm buying them.\n\nIf lunar lake comes out good and Intel can grow it in multiple generations, that good.\n\nI think Intel needs to push their graphics capabilities with that xe engine, or whatever the name is, and its subsequent generations.\n\nI think they need multiple people out there knocking on doors asking how Intel can help them.  Sure, do it in Silicon Valley, but that should give them a view of what is happening and how Intel can help.  That will also tie Intel in with a bunch of companies and financially stabilize Intel.",
