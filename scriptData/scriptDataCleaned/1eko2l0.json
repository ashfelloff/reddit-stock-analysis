  "selftext": "Outside of an emergency fund, do you have 100% of your brokerage account invested? Whether it‚Äôs 80% index and 20% bonds, is it all invested?\n\nI have been slowly starting to continue DCA in these red markets, I have about 25% of my Roth IRA sitting in cash at 4.9% and maybe about 30k in cash amongst some short term options. \n\nMy question is, should I just go balls deep and continue DCA everything into VOO? I am 28 years old, so I don‚Äôt think I want to do bonds. I currently have an awkward split between QQQ, VOO, and VTI. Not sure if I should consolidate them into one. Should I have 100% of my brokerage invested, just so long as I have an emergency fund outside of that?",
