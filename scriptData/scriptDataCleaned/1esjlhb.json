Personally if I can’t do my own estimation for a market cap then I won’t buy but if I can come up with a fair value range I will definitely sell. This one is a very interesting company that I cannot value but there still might be a play here. For me there’s indicators that value has peaked so the question is the potential for LTV worth the risk? If so sell side of puts is a nice trade…. I wouldn’t mind selling that dude the $10 Jan/25 after looking into a few things",
