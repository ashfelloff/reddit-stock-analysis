Ive lost around +$3k too and stopped trading since year and half because i realized that it was draining me mentally, physically and financially im already broke so i used to take the little i could have on the side and trade lol instead of regular ppl going take that little to go out, buy something they want, some clothes shoes, just about anything me i was taking that and trying to trade it took me a while to get to that loss but that was all i had even tho its nothing to most ppl here it was ALL i had. Right now im doing the same since a year and half but instead of trading with that little change i invested instead and right now im up about $85 haha after a year and half the account hit $1900 today. Its very slow i couldve got close to 10k if i had started by investing from the beginning ( since everything was cheaper haha ) instead of blowing it up trying to hit one cool gains. Just stay focus and respect your rules i bet you could make big cool profit if you can make 3400 in a day just respect your rules and youll be fine. And to add one of my advice is to not play heavy ( all in ) and withdraw profit if you can ( a little reset )",
