When things are going well, you just let them be, even if the effects are minuscule, because they will slowly compound.

You know in the 1960s, when dudes with a high school diploma owned houses in California, bought new cars, and provided for 3 kids? There were peasants in Maoist China who had one shirt to share between their entire family. That kind of completely lopsided global wealth distribution is what made America great, to paraphrase Trump.\n\nIf Americans want to get back there, we need to hold a quarter of the planet's wealth again.
