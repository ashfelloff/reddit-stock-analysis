The shorts haven't covered yet because sentiment hasn't caught up with the positive results in the most recent earnings!\n\nThis is the perfect match that can lead to a squeeze. Large short float plus sentiment looking for a spark to reverse. 20% of the float is shorted, and the shorts are doubling down.\n\nCurrently at $10.70, and has been known to run to $25 easily.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/875e41xp542d1.png?width=488&format=png&auto=webp&s=c500c91db662849158d254163a82408fbd3b0352\n\n",

      "body": "I’m obviously bullish on Rivn but saying it can run up to 25$ easily is not true.  I’d say it’s likely only up from here but unless big news comes thru it won’t hit 25$ until  2025 if they become gross margin positive \n\nthat said there is an investor day on 6/27 which could have some big news drop.  \n\nshort squeeze unlikely as you don’t know when most of those shorts got in they could be mostly big in the money shorts where a short squeeze is unlikely until it gets back up a lot higher than now\n\nMy personal price target is $13 by end of June and $20 start of 2025 because I think the stock is way undervalued considering that the sentiment is overly negative and good news is likely coming across multiple catalysts.  Not financial advice as you shouldn’t trust what some rando dude says online\n\nwhat are your positions op?",
