I know for a fact that in Indonesia, you can make $500k a year as a top engineer with 10 years experience. This kind of pay is extremely rare in the US for a 10 year (30's yo) engineer.  Heck I know guys that went to stanford, then MIT for masters and PhD that work in top gov propulsion labs making a paltry $180k/yr! Just think about that, they spent 10+ years at top tier schools and worked their ass off to make...$180k/year?
