Its a very common case in todays mega corporate world, where at a glance, the c suite looks decently appropriate, but then you realize almost all were on executive/management track before even being engineers for any amount of time.\n\nIts really why US is slowly crumbling imo. I remember reading an article that in Asia, one is much more likely as an engineer to work there way up to management than US, and also pay levels of top engineers is more or equivalent to top c suite positions. I know for a fact that in Indonesia, you can make $500k a year as a top engineer with 10 years experience. This kind of pay is extremely rare in the US for a 10 year (30's yo) engineer.  Heck I know guys that went to stanford, then MIT for masters and PhD that work in top gov propulsion labs making a paltry $180k/yr! Just think about that, they spent 10+ years at top tier schools and worked their ass off to make...$180k/year? May as well become a manager at mcdonalds, you dont need 10+ years, and you could probably reach $180k salary before they even finish their masters let along PhD",
