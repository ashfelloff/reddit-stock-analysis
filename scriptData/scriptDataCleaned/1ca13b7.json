You can't just say \"well it's bigger than 1 so I'll say it's a percentage\"; you weren't working in percentages, you just magically got 16.\n\nSecond, why is P(B) equal to .5^6 + .5^6? Don't answer that, you'll only make yourself look even more stupid. P(B), assuming P(A)=.5 (which it isnt), is just .5^6, or 1/64. Then, applying Bayes' theorem *correctly*, we have...\n\nI just reread your comment halfway through writing this. You write that P(A) is the probability of a red day. Then you write that P(B|A) is the probability of 6 red days, given 7 red days. Now, you correctly identify that the probability you described in words is 1, but completely miss the fact that that is not P(B|A).\n\nGet the fuck out of here with this shit, you're barely literate.",
