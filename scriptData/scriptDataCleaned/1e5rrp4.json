It‚Äôs possible to profit, but rare to walk away from the casino with ‚Äúenough‚Äù.\n\nI took two months of losses away today, and expect to lose it‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs fucked, I know.\n\nAlso, if you‚Äôre going to stand a chance in the casino, I suggest not gambling (options trading) around short term predictions like robotaxi or whatever else you mention. My 300% day came from the pricing of the options, what I was willing to loose and the contract itself. I wasn‚Äôt aware of any news or robot taxi thing.\n\nDon‚Äôt know what happened to tsmc either, but damn did those contracts jump. 10x‚Äôed at their peak. That‚Äôs the shit that keeps me addicted‚Ä¶\n\nGood luck out there. Or, run‚Ä¶ I would if I were new.",

And less people employed doesn‚Äôt  necessarily show weakening economy as immigration these days can have huge factors. Like it‚Äôs very dependent as who‚Äôs not employed if it‚Äôs smaller businesses who can‚Äôt sustain themselves anymore, it has basically no relevance as monopolies will take their market share but also be able to trade internationally and grow more which is more beneficial to a countries gdp than a small businesses who can only trade within its own economy. For example every time someone in the UK uses Amazon or Uber , money and tax go to America and there will be people living in America employed there responsible for what happens in the UK.
