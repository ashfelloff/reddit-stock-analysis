Remember there are unreliable but cheap cell networks already, and consumers hate them.  You need to beat 99% reliability at $15/month\n\n\nI'm a bull on the potential long term, but have serious doubts the current launch will yield anything worthwhile to the mass market.  It wasn't until last year that they made A call with unmodified phones.  1 call.  Lots of work to make it reliable on the scale of millions, 24/7.  ",

In addition to Africa, there is still a \\*ton\\* of value in having supplemental coverage from space.\n\nOne cell tower costs roughly $100k to build. Some $ per year to maintain.\n\nOn the edge of a city or town, you might have a few thousand people going in and out of a 300+km² area. Not a lot, but enough as a mobile operator that you have to have *some* coverage there to say that you have \"the most coverage in the nation.\" Now you might need or have a few dozen or even hundreds of these unprofitable/low margin assets per large city. You'll need a couple for small cities/towns.\n\nOne ASTS satellite costs 20 million. In aggregate once the constellation is up, each satellite will replace *far* more than a few hundred low-margin cell towers on the ground. They will literally be money printers in space. Plus, AT&T and Verizon can now up-sell another plan: Introducing \"The Ultimate Coverage Plan: No Dead Zones Planetwide\" for possibly $20-50 more in rich countries like the US. Have you ever driven a car and your signal goes out on the highway? There will be no more of that too with ASTS.\n\nIt's not going to replace dense urban cell towers, but anywhere a cell tower doesn't or barely makes economic sense (which is a lot of areas), ASTS coverage is invaluable. That's why it's worth 7 billion. The potential is just that great.\n\nLook at American Towers if you want another example of why network operators would want to pool resources for low density areas and don't want to care about the infrastructure: it's basically ASTS on the ground. At much lower margins, $AMT is worth 100 BILLION dollars.",
