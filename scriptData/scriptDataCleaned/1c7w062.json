  "score": 388,
  "selftext": "The fact that so many people are posting asking why the market is down 5% from the highs it hit this year\nprompted me to take a minute to explain. \n\nThis is what you call \"mean reversion\".\nIf you flip a coin 100 times and it falls heads 100% of the time, it's still a 50-50 chance on the next flip to be either-or.\n\nBut if you flip that coin an infinite amount of times, it will be closer and closer to 50/50 with sometimes landing on the side.\n\nIf your expected average on the stock market is 8%, it doesn't mean that it will be a flat 8% return. Some years it'll be up, and some, it'll be down.\n\nIt can even have decades above or below that.\n\nIn the short-term, sentiment matters a lot, but in the long-run, fundamentals are all that really matters.\n\nIf earnings grow at a pace that justifies the increase in prices, the market will hold, but at some point they won't.\n\nTLDR: Don't panic, this is normal. There's always a way to make money, just figure out where the flows are going.\n\n",

A ponzi scheme can still have underlying assets that the con artist shows you, but its value is nowhere near what he’s selling it at.
