This just means that demand is lowering while the price continues to increase. More often than not these playout and you get a drop in price. I would honestly advise caution in opening macro long position on overpriced stocks such as NVDA, because there is an increased probability that we are at a (local) top. There is also a chance we get a third push (Triple drive/triple div) before we go down. This is not financial advise and I'm not saying the recession is here, just saying that a bit more care should be taken in the following weeks.",
