  "score": 54,
  "selftext": "\n> The Biden administration, facing pushback to its chip crackdown on China, has told allies that it’s considering using the most severe trade restrictions available if companies such as Tokyo Electron Ltd. and ASML Holding NV continue giving the country access to advanced semiconductor technology.\n\n> Seeking leverage with allies, the US is mulling whether to impose a measure called the foreign direct product rule, or FDPR, said people familiar with recent discussions. The rule lets the country impose controls on foreign-made products that use even the tiniest amount of American technology. \n\n> Such a step — seen by allies as draconian — would be used to clamp down on business in China by Japan’s Tokyo Electron and the Netherlands’ ASML, which make chipmaking machinery that’s vital to the industry. The US is presenting the idea to officials in Tokyo and the Hague as an increasingly likely outcome if the countries don’t tighten their own China measures, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\n\n> Those rules have had a far-reaching impact. They’ve taken a quantifiable toll on Chinese companies such as Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., making it harder for them to get key supplies and equipment.\n\n> Applied Materials Inc., Lam Research Corp. and KLA Corp. — the three biggest American makers of chip equipment — have been pressing their case in a series of recent meetings with US officials, according to people familiar with the situation. They have argued that current trade policies are backfiring, damaging American semiconductor companies while failing to halt Chinese progress as much as the US government hoped.",

All these bogus rules do is result in either goods being rerouted through an intermediary (but end up in china anyway) or those 4090D china gpus which are basically the same and just made to appease the regards in Washington. \n\nUntil I see engineers moving from the US to China I won't be concerned. Currently it's a one way flow to America. And actually, to win this battle the focus should be on making America a more desirable to live. So maybe focus on better and affordable housing to attract the worlds best talent instead of these bogus trade restrictions.",

Most already ethnic Chinese obviously but not all of them, even a lot of them born here, there have been some articles on that recently, even a term in Chinese for the millions of overseas Chinese (mainly in the US and Canada) going back to China, or to nearby countries. And a lot of Americans moving out of the USA due to the very reasons you mention, living cost just getting way too high on cities, too expensive housing and healthcare and too expensive college. This is making America much less attractive that we used to be to skilled workers and even some of our own people born here are moving out when the American dream just gets overflowed by so much debt for housing, college or healthcare bills.",
