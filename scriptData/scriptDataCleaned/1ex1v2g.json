But it is possible to beat the market overall, meaning most years you beat the market, and your average return is higher than the average market return.\n\nWhile statistics show that most people do not beat the market, there are some people that does beat the market. You have to understand that this number is from a very large number as the number of investors account of all investors. It is actually quite hard to find the % of people that beat the market, as from Googling I can see only the % of fund managers, which in my personal opinion it is way harder for a fund manager to beat the market, than a regular investor that is managing their own portfolio. This is because a fund manager has so many restrictions that he has to abide by, but an individual does not have all of these restrictions.\n\nIf you go to various investment board, you can also find people that have consistently beat the market, regular individuals, they have reported their portfolio for years, on a monthly basis, and have created a following. These people often beat the market by a huge margin.\n\nI do not think that beating the market by 4% will make you one of the greatest investors and the reason why is the statistics itself i think is a bit broken. Investing statistics in my opinion is like the statistics of restaurants.  A large number of restaurants fail, but the real reason is mostly because the restaurant business is one of the easiest business to get into. You do not need business education to enter this business, no special knowledge whatsoever. But because of how easy it is to enter, it is filled with people who have no business knowledge and therefore making lots of rookie mistakes.\n\nThis is the same with investing in stock. If you look at all of the investing subreddits, its filled with people who are investing, but have no clue what they are doing. These people contribute to the statistics of investors that do not beat the market. Most of these people do not have business education, dont know how to use a PE ratio, dont know the difference between gross margin and net income, dont know the difference between fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Off course these people fail just like the similar group fails running a restaurant.\n\nFor those that have the knowledge, the experience, it is actually not that hard to do. In fact, it is very easy. The hardest part of investing, is not the actual investing, its about controlling your greed and fear. If you can control these two, AND have the ability to do financial analysis, you would shoot up to the top 5% easily as basically 95% of investors can't even control their own greed and fear, even when they know the golden rule not to sell during a downturn.\n\nI am not sure if I will continue to beat the market, but I have beaten the market in the last 12 years with a CAGR of 25%, I sure hope it continues using the same strategy. I have read many people who have better CAGRs (and are retired) than mine with proof. It is not impossible, you just have to be go against the wisdom of the average. When you have expectations that 22% is surprising when the market does 18%, this is the wisdom of the average.",

In statistics, something that is within 1 standard deviation from the mean, is considered \"common\" and \"expected\". When something is \"expected\" it is not \"surprising\" lol.\n\nTake for example, if you read a poll that said Harris has 45% popularity with +-5%. When the actual voting happens, and she gets 49% popularity, this is not surprising, as this is expected. This is not a direct comparison, but it is similar. The S&P500 return has a standard deviation of 15% from the mean of 8-10%.

Bought a few weeks ago because it had a high financing cash flow and ROIC, meaning there was a high chance of rapid earnings growth. It went up 20% the next day. (I expected it to beat the market but not by that much.)\nOn the other hand, there's ASTS. Heard about them super early on, right as the big rally was starting. Didn't buy because they were still way down from their ATH and the name sounded like a pump and dump, and I thought it would end up like some pump-and-dump microcaps which I'm not going to mention (that was the rule-breaking part of my original comment) (ASTS had a much larger market cap than the others but it had all the other indicators of a pump-and-dump. I now know that large companies don't pump and dump as quickly and they keep their momentum for longer.) Then it reached an ATH and I no longer thought it was a pump-and-dump but I did think I had missed out on the big gains. Then it kept going up and then on Monday, I bought £100 worth and it went up 25% before crashing 10% yesterday and hitting my trailing stop loss, making me a 10% profit overall. I then moved the money into LUNR and am up around 18.5% on that so far. But that profit wasn't surprising because I was just riding the momentum. What was surprising was how much profit I would've gotten if I'd bought in when I first heard about them.  \n\nEdit: Also QFIN. Bought because they had a very low EV/EBIT ratio. Went up 15% the next day.  \nMost of my [growth stocks](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/ey3upU4Z/) and [value stocks](https://www.tradingview.com/screener/P0LDalCD/) weren't that successful.",
