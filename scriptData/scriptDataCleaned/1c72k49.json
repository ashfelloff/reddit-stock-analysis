I have been saying this for ten years, algo trading needs to be banned, you want to run a hedge fund then you need to employ actual human traders, that you'll actually need to pay money and benefits to...

How many on here have bought a security only for it to never go back to the price you bought it at? Like instant drop, which of course is always a possibility, but happens time and time again, not even one time to account for blind luck, it's orchestrated.  \n\n I knew/know a Wall Street insider too that I didn't take advice from when he literally told he has almost never bought an actual security on the open market because they're all crooks and con artists...

They are democratically self-governed, and for all practical purposes their own country, though China tries to say otherwise and seems hell-bent on the idea of taking the island under their rule someday. TSM only relates to China in that Apple is their largest customer and hasn’t been moving many phones in the Chinese market lately but they are not a Chinese company. It’s like saying don’t touch Toyota because they are geographically close to China and sell cars to Chinese people or don’t touch American companies that are dependent on Chinese manufacturing… The picture is a bit more complicated than that, isn’t it? Or is it? Maybe it’s very simple. Stock market goes down, tech goes down, TSM goes down.",
