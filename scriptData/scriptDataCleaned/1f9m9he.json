The market is irrational, stupid, and nothing makes sense. Whenever I see a buying frenzy and the price of a stock surging I almost never buy shares or calls because I truly do not see the value. Everyone is just greedy thinking everything will go up, etc. I saw some guy YOLO 100k into ASTS on here at an average cost of $36/share. That’s what I’m talking about. Just be cautious, don’t follow the crowd, don’t follow the hype (unless it’s NVDA calls before earnings lol). One bit of bad news and it’s enough to spook everyone. Also never do short term expiration for options. Always a minimum of 2 months preferably longer.",

I am building up my position with them because they have the results of their phase 3 clinical trials coming out in December for their psilocybin based drug for treatment resistant depression (COMP 360) and then in early 2025 I believe the phase 3 results for  their drug for eating disorders are to be released. The results will almost certainly be very positive which will likely send the stock up. Biotech is generally risky and I would advise you to stay away from all companies in the mushroom/psychedelic medicine sector except for Compass Pathways. In particular don’t touch a scam company called Mind Medicine. Compass is maybe only one of 2 or 3 companies that will actually commercialize a psilocybin based treatment, and if they are successful, a larger pharmaceutical company could very well acquire them. Also if I’m right and the stock surges after positive phase 3 results take some profits, don’t hold everything indefinitely.",
