  "score": 113,
  "selftext": "Alright, strap in, fellow degenerates, because the stock market just did a +0.42% boogie, then dipped a whopping -0.05% after hours. Yeah, a whole nickel on the dollar—basically the financial version of watching paint dry. But trading volume? Up by 10.6%! Big money is moving… or it’s just us piling into meme stocks like a flock of lemmings.\n\nHere’s the deal: every last crumb of \"scared money\" has yeeted itself out of the market. The only ones left are the brave, brain-cell-challenged lunatics who’ll double down when they’re down 80% and call it \"buying the dip.\" These are not ordinary people; these are the enlightened few who think risk is just another word for \"fun.\"\n\nSo, what’s next? Expect the market to jiggle around like a squirrel on Red Bull, with every dip being gobbled up by hopeful bagholders who swear they “like the stock.” Once the election results drop and we finally have a winner, expect every couch-cushion penny that’s been “on the sidelines” to flood back into the market, triggering a glorious rally for all of us true believers.\n\nTL;DR: Don’t worry. Buy the dip, HODL, and hope for the moon.\n\n",
