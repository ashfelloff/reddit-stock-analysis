  "selftext": "https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/nike-sees-gold-rush-with-summer-olympics-driven-website-visits-sales-2024-08-07/ \n\nNike has had a standout performance during the summer Olympics, with a notable increase in both website visits and sales. According to Similarweb, Nike's direct-to-consumer site saw a substantial boost in traffic, particularly after Simone Biles won her seventh gold medal, leading to a peak of 2 million visits on July 31. In contrast, competitors like Adidas and Hoka experienced declines in web traffic.\n\nNike's strong performance can be attributed to its significant investment in Olympic marketing and product launches, such as the popular Jordan 4 Retro SE and Alphafly 3 shoes. \n\nThis successful engagement with the Olympics is a positive sign for investors, as it suggests Nike is effectively leveraging major global events to drive sales and enhance brand visibility, potentially leading to continued growth throughout the Games.\n",
