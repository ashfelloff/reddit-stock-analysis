Although, I'm pretty sure it wasn't an attack, because it was so damn easy to fix. it was essentially a mild to moderate inconvenience on an absolutely MASSIVE scale.

If an attacker got access there, they could absolutely wreak havoc, but there were no attempts of lateral movement, account creation, drive encryption, etc. It was just a bug in one file that made microsoft devices BSOD on loop. Safe mode > delete the file, and we're good. It also happened directly after the patch was pushed. \n\nI'm not saying you're absolutely wrong, because hell, anything can happen. I guess an internal malicious actor could push a bug on purpose. This would just be a very, very weird attack. It's almost like it would be a prank that went way too far, lol.
