Come to find out some asshole firm set a price target of $15, was waiting for it to go down since last time it was overbought and dropped down to a reasonable amount, but it keeps going up, this morning it hit $21 since they just did some other bullshit or whatever. The worst part was this was a company I was super excited for and wanted to hold, but my autism kicked in and like Icarus I thought I could manipulate my position. They IPOd in may and can’t release projections or whatever till the 26th so I figured I was safe till then",
