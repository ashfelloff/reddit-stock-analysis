  "selftext": "I know we all like crayons, but I think this works just based on its simplicity. MCD is extremely consistent at bouncing off and rallying from its 50 monthly moving average, and even more so from its 200 weekly moving average which both happen to be at 250.\n\nMcDonald’s is a strong stock. Since they went 95% franchise/5% corporate, their revenues have been growing steadily since their decline from 2016-2020, but more importantly margins are up, and current estimates put them at a 9% CAGR per year not including their 3.5%+ annual divided.\n\nI don’t really care about the dividend and CAGR, but the point being, *people do care*, and McDonald’s is more than likely going back to 300 again this year.\n\nThe downside risk here is that the only times McDonald’s has broken below the 50MA monthly, which was the 99/08/20 crashes, it dropped another 25-30%. So if you’re getting in, just buy some 200-220p for the length of your trade so you can cover the cost of your trade.\n\nPositions:\n\n164 shares @ 253.8 avg\n10 June 25 2025 300c @ 5.6 avg \n15 Aug 18 2024 200p @ .3 avg",

Best case they'll flatten and won't see any up or down. Also the free refills thing going away won't help the situation.  It's not McDonalds fault, it's just the hand they've been dealt.

So there aren't a lot of other great options at their level.\n\nMcdonalds is selling pretty much the same thing as a lot of other places. What used to set them apart was their aggressive pricing model, which seems to be waning. McDonalds used to be a place where you can take the kids on a Saturday for a birthday party or lunch and get a good value and let them play in the Playplace. Now, most stores don't have the playplace anymore, and a happy meal is $6, and if you have a 10 year old you need the upgraded one which is $10. So, 2 adults and 2 kids is a $40 to $50 trip to McDonalds. People aren't necessarily going to go somewhere else in my opinion, it's going to go back to the way it was when I was growing up in the 80's...an every now and then kind of deal. We only ate out once or twice a month on average back then. Most people ate mostly at home, that's bad news for all restaurants,  especially McDonald's.",
