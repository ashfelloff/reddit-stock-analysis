I am also new to options and i now understand why people tell to stay away from them. Lesson learnt. Right now my options are worth 0.01 cents. And i am posting here to get some advice. Can I do anything right now? I was reading about roll over but not sure if it will help me. Any advice on what I can do here apart from just taking a big loss. Please dont put mean comments - I have learnt my lesson. TIA",
