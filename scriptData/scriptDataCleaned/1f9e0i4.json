Do you think ASTS is going to hand over power of their satellite in Asia when they demand for it? Cause that's one of the first requirements to even provide infrastructure and services for most telcos there. In addition, every telco needs to pay billions of dollars annually for using the spectrum, is ASTS going to pay billions for every single country they sell their services to?
