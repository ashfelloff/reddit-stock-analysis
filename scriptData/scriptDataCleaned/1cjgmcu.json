                  "body": "Quick lesson: I‚Äôll assume you understand how calls and puts work. I‚Äôll also use round numbers to make the math easy for you regards.\n\nIf $NVDA is at $900 and I think it will close somewhere around there by the end of the day, I can do four basic things. There‚Äôs so many other strategies that could be used, but here‚Äôs the basics:\n\nBuy a $950 put and sell a $925 put. (A)\nSell a $850 put and buy a $875 put. (B)\n\nBuy an $850 call and sell an $875 call. (C)\nSell an $925 call and buy an $950 call. (D)\n\nAll four of these are called vertical spreads because the options are the same expiration date, same type (call or put), and differ only in the strike price (one above the other, hence the name vertical). Each one has a $25 difference in strike price.\n\nI‚Äôll start with (C) because it‚Äôs probably the easiest for crayon eaters to understand.\n\nGenerally you want to buy low and sell high if you‚Äôre long a position. Or, conversely sell high and buy low if you‚Äôre short.\n\nIf I buy the $850 call that means I‚Äôm buying the stock at $850. Obviously that‚Äôs a good deal because the stock is already at $900 and I think it will stay there. Since the stock is at $900 and I‚Äôm buying it for $850, the intrinsic value of the $850 call is $50. But obviously someone is going to want me to pay them a premium for me getting that kind of a $50 off deal, and that premium gets added on based on a lot of things: how long until the option expires, the volatility of $NVDA, etc. That extra premium is what makes the $850 call cost more than $50.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo to offset that cost, I‚Äôm going to sell someone my stock that I bought at $850. I will do this by selling them an $875 call. Just like the $850, the intrinsic value is $25 because whoever buys it from me can buy my stock that I sell them for $875 and sell it at $900. But they‚Äôll have to pay me a premium as well, so I‚Äôll get more than the $25 to just flip the stock. Since I‚Äôm selling this option, I will be getting paid. I won‚Äôt get paid as much as what I had to spend on the $850 call, but I will at least have something to offset my cost.\n\nThis difference in what I paid and what I get paid is not going to be very much. But, if I‚Äôm willing to risk the $25 (that I could potentially lose if $NVDA drops to $850 and my call option becomes worthless), then that means it‚Äôs like free cash. I‚Äôm buying the stock for $850, selling it for $875 and only have to pay (hypothetically) $24.50 for the deal.\n\nThere is a certain type of person to whom this will appeal. Risking $2,500 to make $50 probably doesn‚Äôt sound appealing. But if I‚Äôm x% certain that it‚Äôs going to close around $900, then I don‚Äôt really think about it as ‚Äúrisking $2,500‚Äù so much as ‚Äúrisking 100-x% that an event y will happen at time z.‚Äù\n\nEither way, this is a debit spread because I‚Äôm paying $24.50 for the deal hoping it will be worth $25 by the close.\n\nOn the other hand, with a strategy like (A) I‚Äôm buying the higher put and selling the lower, and just collecting the premium difference between the two prices (maybe it‚Äôs $0.35). If $NVDA explodes to the upside those puts I bought are going to lose value much faster than the ones I sold, so I could end up having to buy them back for the max difference of $25. But if it doesn‚Äôt, then I just get to keep the $0.35 (x100) for selling the spread. This is why this is called a credit spread rather than a debit spread because I‚Äôm not paying the $2500 up front (although your broker would almost certainly still hold it in the liability that it did blow up and you lost everything).\n\nThe other two strategies are similar, and which one you deploy depends on the implied volatility pricing that goes into calls vs. puts, which ones are the best deal, and the probability that the stock might actually move up or down away from $900.\n\nThis is an income strategy because it‚Äôs not purely dependent on the direction that $NVDA goes in but will be profitable either way; it‚Äôs very popular with stocks that are lower volatility because they‚Äôre more predictable and don‚Äôt move as much, but also you get less premium from it too.\n\nObviously it can go very wrong very fast if you‚Äôre risking something like $25,000 to make $500 on a consistent basis, so risk management is key.\n\nSeveral good strategies for this usually begin about 45 days out and then close the position 20 days away from expiry.\n\nIt can also be deployed on a daily basis with SPY 0dte options which lose value very quickly later in the day. Usually you would want to close the position out after a p% gain rather than hold them to the end of the day, but if you don‚Äôt get bothered by some of those sharp late day moves then you can hold it for the full premium, but statistically your risk goes up when you do.\n\nTLDR: There is no TLDR. If you can‚Äôt read and understand this in its entirety you belong here and don‚Äôt deserve the wisdom I‚Äôm giving you.",

If you see a good spot to get in on a call or put, stock up on cheap contracts and count on the price action to move the price of the contract maybe a few bucks. If you get in cheap enough, those few bucks could mean a very lucrative swing/day trade. If you get lucky, it goes up/down a LOT in your favor, but don't count on it. Honestly *most* of the time I buy options, I'm not anticipating my strike price to be hit. \n\nI see the point you're making, and if you plan around your strike *actually* being hit, my approach would be foolish. If you just want to skim some dollars from the momentum in the underlying moving the option prices *at all*, there's opportunities all over the place.\n\nFor the record, that 10x play I mentioned above was only a $60 position when I bought in. 20 calls at $3 each. Sold shortly thereafter for $30 or $31 each because the stock went up a few bucks, and my calls were still several dollars out of the money. I saw a huge dip to the downside figuring there'd be a correction, so I got in dirt cheap. I didn't even ride MOST of the wave that day since I do all of my trading before getting ready for work.

I'll admit that I had a very foolish greedy mindset where I thought I could profit $10k+ today, especially when many people were going to get puts. Seriously thought there was going to be a short squeeze and people closing their puts, especially on a Friday. This led me to using a huge amount of my account. Thought NVDA would break 900 today after a long time. So I went with 920c. Buuut NVDA turned me around, fucked me very hard and slowly, and said, \"Nah. I'd win.\" \n\n\nI'll just be going back to QQQ and leaving NVDA alone.",

I would always check the 'Magnificent 7' stock news such as earnings or anything dramatic, especially NVDA. I read any world conflict news like Israel-Iran, China, etc. Then, I check for any upcoming inflation data reports by looking at an economic calendar. Also checking for any upcoming Fed speeches. \n\nI don't follow chart analysis because that shit doesn't work a lot of times. \"Based on the chart, a V is going to happen so it's gonna go back up!\", but because the news are all negative, QQQ dips down and continues to dump throughout the day. I actually laugh at chart patterns because that's also stupid. Otherwise, we would be making easy money just off of chart patterns. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that news and events are way more extremely important for SPY/QQQ than stupid chart analysis with so many indicators and lines blah blah blah. And I would argue about this a lot. \n\nToday, though, I was really stupid with NVDA. There wasn't any dramatic news to drive it up. I was just really gambling and thinking it would break 900 quickly. Well, it did today, but it took so long that my contract was pretty much useless by that time lol.",

Lots of news dwell around QQQ every single day. Even world conflicts like breaking news on Israel-Iran will cause QQQ to pump up a lot or dump like crazy. Fed Speeches that happens during market hours could cause QQQ to spike up or dip so much just like Neel Kashkari (apparently he's speaking on Tuesday, 5/7 at 11:30am EST so that's one thing to add to a list of events). \n\nTake advantage of Jpow speeches on FOMC meetings. His next FOMC speech is on June 12. It's always at 2:30pm EST. I made $1.67k from his speech as you could see in my photo, but honestly, that would have been $14k+ if I held on longer while he's speaking. But, I'm used to just taking 20-30% profit and walking away. \n\nA lot of those profit days in the photo could have easily been $1k+, but like I said, I take 20-30% and just stop trading. Using those profits the next day, repeat, repeat, repeat. Today, I just gambled like a moron without thinking properly because of greed. No dramatic news for NVDA to cause it to go up. Lesson costed me 72% of my gains, leaving me with only $1.5k profit besides my account fund. \n\nSo yeah. I take a lot of time reading news and preparing for events. Check the US stock market economic calendar. Upcoming inflation data reports, world conflict news (mainly wars), Fed speeches, Magnificent 7 earnings reports, Jpow's speeches on FOMC days, etc.",

NVDA options have so much volume.. almost every strike price has decent liquidity.. but when you miss on 0dte options..it hurts.. cause NVDA buy/ask spread is like a dollar at times and really fucks the option value",

Honestly dude, look at the charts, it wasn‚Äôt ever going to go to 920, you could tell by 10:15; sometimes $NVDA does NVDA things, but you have to be able to recognize it. Both call and put volume were only 30% of the 15 day average too, it was never going to happen. Yesterday was Tim Apple‚Äôs day.",
