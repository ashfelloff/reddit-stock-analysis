  "selftext": "Tesla was one of the heavily shorted stock in June, '24\n\nAnalysts had dropped Tesla from 'Mag 7' and reduced the list to 'Mag 5' : Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon\n\nWhile an average retail investor was distracted by meme stocks, it was Tesla where the rally triggered massive stop losses on short positions. The stock has rocketed 51% since 10th June.\n\nBut the underlying problems facing Tesla still remains:\n\nChinese competition,\nSlower consumer spending, \nThinning profit margins\n\nHedge Funds and other short sellers may have been burned in June but come 23rd July [earnings call] another shorting opportunity may present itself if Tesla fails to get its act together.",
