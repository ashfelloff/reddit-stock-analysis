So I saw Visible was running a $10 off per month promo if you switched from Tmobile...literally the promo code was byebyetmo...and I took it.  If I put my Apple Watch on Visible it only costs $10 a month vs. $17 a month on Tmobile too.\n\n  \nWho knows though...maybe people are idiots and just don't notice how expensive Tmo is or the likelihood they'll fuck you over in 12 months.",
