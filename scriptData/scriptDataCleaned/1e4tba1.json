  "title": "Recent Intel Gaming Chips have >50% Failure Rate",
  "score": 424,
  "selftext": "It has been known for months that Intel's consumer desktop chips of the 13th and 14th generation are widely affected by stability problems. It was thought that these issues were caused by motherboard vendors pushing the chips above the voltage intended by Intel and this was what was causing the chips to fail. [Source](https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-addresses-instability-issues-with-13th-14th-gen-core-k-series-cpus-in-latest-statement)\n\nLast friday some investigative journalism by the youtuber [Level1Techs](https://www.level1techs.com/node/2958) revealed that these issues are not caused by running the chips out of Intel's specifications. He has failure reports from multiple cloud gaming providers which use the relevant chips in large numbers and well within spec. His aggregated data shows a failure rate of 50% per week of continuous running.  [Source](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/13th-and-14th-gen-intel-cpu-instability-also-hits-servers) , [Further Reading](https://semiwiki.com/forum/index.php?threads/intel-13th-and-14th-gen-core-i9-stability-problems.20614/)\n\n\nI'm mostly making this post because I have not seen this being reported on outside of niche tech circles. Couldn't this mean a huge recall operation for Intel? A company already struggling to profit losing (tens-hundreds of)millions on a recall that also hurts consumer trust. I mean, as far as I understand the findings, this means all high-powered consumer chips Intel has sold for the last 2 years are slowly degrading and a lot of them could fail. [Call for a recall](https://www.techspot.com/news/103797-developer-alderon-games-intel-actually-selling-defective-crash.html)\n\nWhat impact could this have on the stock? (Disclose of relevant positions: AMD, NVDA, MU)",

Intel is switching to a new node with 15th gen, after squeezing the living shit out of the old node for 12, 13 and 14 gen. This squeezing is probably whats causing the issues (though i dont have a deep understanding of the issues, i have watched the linked videos and some commentary on them). Will these issues carry through to the new gen? I would be surprised if they do but its not impossible. \n\nIf there is no effect on the new gen things should balance out somewhat, but there will be some short term pain to go through. Before the medium term pain of not having their own fabs making their own chips. But surely theres no long term pain coming right? Right?\n\nGood thing i bought NVIDIA, AMD and Intel together back in 21. The other two more than make up for the losses in the black sheep",
