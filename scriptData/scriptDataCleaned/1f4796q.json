So had I received that split... it would have gone like this... counting all thes splits:    400x2x2x2x7x4 =89,000 shares.  89K x 225 = $20,025,000.   But .... that is not how the story went.  Life happened, there were ups and downs...anyway, continued to work there until 2022... Stopped selling 10 years ago.  Doing fine, could never have expected to not sell.
