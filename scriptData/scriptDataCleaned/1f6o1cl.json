After 2 rounds of Chips Act funding the government is making this company seem like another too big to fail operation. I’d buy it at $10. I could see Berkshire jumping in to grab that grandma money",

Only intel had a bunk set of chips, much more serious (financially, making planes that crash has less finical downside until entire airlines go down lmao). They’re fighting for their life and people are speculating on a short term bounce. Maybe, but that upside is a long time away, with lots left to bleed until they catch up with their competitors (a big if). Way better long term bets on the market.",

Not mining itself but his father invended and patented sort of  three-head-drill which gave drilling an incredible advantage.

Their manufacturing, we have been told, 18A is coming along as expected. That was the most difficult part of the journey.\n\nIf Intel nail their packaging goals and 18A, they will be competing for the best chips once again (yes on par with TSMC) and with High NA EUV, and a full year lead (or more) on that technology, they should have the clear lead in manufacturing again.\n\nWatch the glory that is Lunar Lake.

They can fit 16 full performance cores in their desktop chips without doing P and E core bullshit. And while the 9000 series from AMD seems to be more about power savings and feature parity (AVX etc) with Intel, jury is still out on its performance. Still though, AMD is at LEAST two years ahead. They also don’t get bogged down by running their own lithography.\n\n“But if that’s the case why are both chips close in performance”\n\nIntel turned their chips into space heaters. They’re running their chips by default at the VERY edge of the envelope. Which I suspect is why the 13th and 14th generation have that big hardware failure scandal. Once their chip burns out, that’s it. And there’s no fixing it. They have updated microcode, but all you can do is dial back to not overload the part of the chip that is failing. \n\nThere’s also things like branch prediction and whatnot, but this is supposed to be a rough summary for the idiots in WSB. \n\nIntel will eventually right the ship.
