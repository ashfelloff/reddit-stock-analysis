  "score": 51,
  "selftext": "Redwire already supplies Rocketlab with parts, a contractual agreement which started in May 2024. The also supply NASA, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Blue Origin and many more.\n\n* They are currently working with $LLY on 3D bio-printing organs in space, which they’re making great progress of.\n* They acquired Hera systems to increase the dominance for national security space customers.\n* They were selected to provide advanced RF payloads to a leading defense contractor.\n* They have joined the US-U.A.E council where Danny Sebright stated “Redwire’s pioneering advancements in Space Infrastructure showcase the very best of American innovation and ingenuity. As a member Redwire joins an elite list of member companies at the forefront of almost every industry.\n* They signed a MOU with NASA’s REMIS-2 mission to provide Spaceflight hardware, ground hardware and software, engineering services, payload facility integration and more.\n* Selected to provide a critical onboard computer system for the European Space Agency Hera Mission, Europes flagship planetary defense mission.\n* To supply Solar Arrays for Thales Alenia Telecommunications product line.\n* Selected by (SCA) to develop, build and deliver advanced thruster technology nicknamed the (Valkyrie Thurster) designed for reliable, high-volume production for the surge in national security space programmes.\n* Awarded Darpa Prime Contract to be the prime mission integrator for the development of revolutionary air-breathing satellite that will demonstrate the use of Novel electric propulsion in very-low earth orbit (VLEO).\n* Awarded Contract by the European Space agency to develop a Robotic Arm to support the landing for the International Lunar Exploration Mission.\n* Selected by Rocketlab to provide Antennas and RF hardware.\n\nAnd those are just some of the latest contracts & advancements Redwire has made. They’ve been prolific aquirers since going public and continue to aggressively expand their footprint across all space sectors.\n\nIt’s why their CEO goes by the Moto of “If space wins Redwire wins”, a confident statement backed by their foundational success of becoming the “building blocks to space”\n\nYet it’s currently one of the cheapest and most undervalued Space stocks there is. Trading at a P/S of just 1.58 compared to Rocket Labs 11.5. A market cap of just $450m vs Rocketlabs $4.28b & ASTS $6.73b\n\nThis isn’t about who’s better, it’s about Redwire being drastically undervalued and under the radar of most growth investors.\n\nI shared my thoughts on Rocketlab 3-4 months ago after scooping the October and January calls.\n\nSince then people have finally started to realise the potential in the company. To sit are similar valuations based upon growth and income, Redwire would not to hit approximately $42/share. At this point it would still remain once of the cheapest yet most advanced space companies out there.\n\nWhy now?\n\nStocks move in themes, every success trader from here to Timbuktu will tell you that. It’s caused by the excitement and willingness of investors to take on risk on what they believe to be innovative and early stage Giants. The recent news of SpaceX, the parabolic run in ASTS and Rocketlabs 50th successful launch, all set the stage for a new theme and fomo rally to emerge.\n\nJust like when EVs moved thanks to the hype in Tesla we saw the entire sector move.\n\nJust like when $AI started the AI run and others such as NVDA (plus plenty of others) took the button and ran for 12-18 months.\n\nI see the Space sector as an emerging theme and names such as Redwire could potentially take the baton and garner worldwide interest.\n\nFor me, I see the worst case, bear case, as Redwire being a $1bn+ market cap by Christmas, which still represents a 100% move. Best case I see buyers stepping into calls of which market makers are drastically under-positioned for, creating a substantial over the top rally.\n\nPlease note: I haven’t a fucking clue what I’m talking about and none of this is advice.\n\nMy calls for December posted below.",

Redwire does more than provide RF and Antennas for RKLB's SDA satellites, they are also base lined into York and other providers platforms.\n2. Rocket Structures. Something that alot of people dont know is that Redwire is also helping X-bow systems with the SRM production by supplying the company with structures for their bolt family of rockets.\n3. Moon & Mars. Redwire has lunar and martian optionality, they have multiple different lunar contract like MASON with NASA/tipping point which is for building landing pads and roads using regolith & VSAT which is a partnership with the company astrobotic where Redwire is providing ROSA arrays of various sizes to provide power for the lunar surface. For Mars Redwire has been [awarded a study contract for Design Reference Mission (DRM) 3 of NASA’s Mars Commercial Services program](https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/planets/mars/nasa-selects-commercial-service-studies-to-enable-mars-robotic-science/), which outlines a commercial imagery mission to support lower-cost, higher-frequency missions to the Red Planet\n\nThere is in fact even more I could talk about too but ill cut it here, thanks for the post and the visability into a great company.",
