  "score": 64,
  "selftext": "MU beats estimates (earnings per share exceed by 24%, revenues by 110M, +17% sequentially), but the stock plunged by 7%.\n\nIt will most certainly drag a few other semiconductors stock in its downfall, especially AMD.\n\nNow my question : was the stock overpriced (experienced a +70% share price within 6 months) and is now corrected to its accurate value during the off-market. Or could it be a good entry point, expecting the retail investors to make the stock rebounds against the traders' new valuation, as it happened to a few tech stock already?",
