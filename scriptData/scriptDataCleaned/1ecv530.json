In one week he can buy them back for $1520, locking in a profit of $1680. \n\nMultiply this profit by 40 weeks (because the weeks after earnings are crazy volatile, so you don’t want to sell calls) and you generate $67,000 annually, or 7.4% profit on the entire position, but since you’re only utilizing $226,000 the renturn on capital is around 30% annually. \n\nWith stocks like NVDA, it’s a hella money maker.",
