Chinese laws favor international companies sharing their intellectual property (except for trademarks) with manufacturers, in fact it used to be *mandatory* until fairly recently, and it‚Äôs because otherwise everyone will just use China for cheap labor but not actually help Chinese industry grow. And not only that, but they may use their intellectual property rights to keep local companies from developing their own products (e.g., tying them up in court when they invent an improvement to a product they‚Äôre manufacturing). So setting the standard at sharing intellectual property helps Chinese companies compete even within their own country when otherwise they likely wouldn‚Äôt be able to, and this is a huge reason why China has been able to shoot forward development-wise so quickly. This is actually not an uncommon standard across the developing world either. IIRC there‚Äôs over a dozen other countries in the developing world with similar or even more strict laws/standards on this, most following china‚Äôs model after it worked so well for them.",
