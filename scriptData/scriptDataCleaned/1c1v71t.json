Options are also time dependent so the closer to the day they expire the less likely they will be exercised and the less value they have.\n\nWhat this guy bought were call options considerably higher than the current selling price expiring tomorrow. He bought them for $0.40 per contract and he got very lucky in that the price went up very quickly in such a short time (AAPL went from $168 to $175 today) and the contracts went up in value an additional $3.70 giving him 1025% return on his initial $8000 premium purchase.\n\nIt’s very likely that this guy was only expecting a small price increase and a modest gain but as it went up he waited out the price action and came out very lucky.",

According to RH it will cost me $177 to buy 1 contract. \n\nNow if AAPL gets to $185 or higher before that date, my options will be worth quite a bit more than what I paid. But if AAPL stays stagnant or goes down, i’m basically out the $177 that I invested, or I can close my position and sell for a loss. \n\nOften times options expire worthless cause you wait for the expiration date hoping the stock price will go up, but it doesn’t and the closer you get the less your option is worth.
