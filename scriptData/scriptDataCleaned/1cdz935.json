  "selftext": "Greetings brothers and sisters,\n\nAre you about tired of week after week of losing your closest relatives' land and property making random bets in the stock market? How are those TSLA puts and META calls? I feel your pain, my friends, and since I've felt your and my pain I'm making this DD because I've realized a once in a decade opportunity is upon us. \n\nI wanna start out with a little back story. When I was in 3rd grade back many years ago, we would have this thing where everyone would bring a treat when it was their birthday. There was this one girl named Karly K (omitting last name for respect, she is now dead from diabetes and premature obesity). Anyways, Karly K and her family absolutely loved donuts. And every year she would have her mom bring the most delicious dish. It was Krispy Kreme donuts sliced in half, buttered, seared in a skillet, then they put a juicy hamburger patty on them. \n\nKarly K brought these to school every year until she graduated. Not only did she bring them to school, but her and her family were actually selling catering for this dish. It had become extremely popular in the region of Canada I lived in at the time. \n\nKarly's dad was a custodian at the school and her mother a full-time stay at home mom. They probably lived in the dumpiest home I'd ever seen when she was in 2nd grade. The roof was caved in and when it got cold the only blankets they had were made out of food stamp certificates and Wendy's coupons knitted together that had been passed down for many generations. \n\nWhen she graduated this family was probably the richest people in Canada besides Drake. They had a swimming pool, chandeliers all over the place, and Lamborghinis. \n\nNow, it doesn't take a genius to realize this money was made by their catering business. And that brings me to my main point I want to make today -- DNUT closed the week with a sly 2.16B valuation. McDonald's has about a 200B valuation for comparison. \n\nJust a few weeks ago these two announced that Krispy Kreme donuts would be sold in pretty much every McDonald's in the US, probably a lot of the global market too, by 2026. \n\nSo do the math with me, guys. If DNUT gets the footprint of a company about 100x bigger than them, does this add value? Yet, today DNUT is just a little bit above where it was before this incredible deal was announced. \n\nThis means to me, that DNUT can probably grow revenue about as fast as NVDA did in the last two years in the next couple years. Possibly even faster. Donuts cost almost nothing to make and people will take out installment loans to buy them, so there's a lot of pricing power and margin in this business that can be exploited AFTER these donuts make their way into these McDonalds restaurants. So conservatively say their revenues and profits expand about 75x in the next 3 years, does this only justify a mere valuation of 1% of McDonald's? Nay!\n\nIndeed, I highly suspect DNUT is worth closer to $150 a share today just on the outlook. And when the macro gets better and interest comes down and stuff, more people will use their credit cards to buy donuts with hamburgers in them at McDonald's. They will command about a 120-150 billion dollar valuation in 2-3 years. This would equate to a share price of about  $700 from today's $13. \n\nThis is why I will be full porting my current Robinhood account and additional money I generate behind the Wendy's dumpster into DNUT stock and long dated call options. A 10,000 dollar investment will be worth like 600k in a couple years if everything works out as I've calculated. \n\nI've made my decision,  but what do you guys think? D-do or D-not, DNUT?",
