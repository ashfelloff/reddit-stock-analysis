Putting money in VOO is an excellent long term option, assuming the money you are putting in you absolutely don’t need anytime soon. So what you said above is a little confusing, but I assume you just mean that you are not saving for anything in the short term (3-7 years).

They were rapidly expanding in a hot industry, had very low debt, excellent leadership, and are a small cap company in a climate of interest rate reductions. I bought at $15 the same day that China announced their stimulus plan because it seemed like a solid long-term hold.\n\nIt spiked to $25 in less than a month while short sellers were closing positions in a panic. The stock should never have reached $25 (at least not yet), and I completely closed my position, netting roughly 65%. It's now back to $19, which is more realistic. I could buy back in, but it's not as attractive at $19 as it was at $15.\n\nI had no other really interesting stocks to buy with that money at the time, and it's still sitting in a HYSA at 4.5%.",

That account is up about 130% YTD, 400% over the last 3 years, and if I lost it all tomorrow, I would be OK with that.

              "body": "Every answer you’ve received has been conventional wisdom.  I’ll give you something different to consider that’s maybe more in keeping with your comment above.\n\nAs you describe, you trade wild with maximum risk and nimbly selling quick gains.  \n\nInstead of interest-level ETFs, live on the edge and go UVXY. \n\nAssuming that times when you have sold are when your stocks have notched short term highs, that could align with times when VIX has been drifting lower and thus UVXY will be near a channel low, so you’ll get a decent unit price.\n\nAnd assuming the pattern of cyclical ups and downs of the last couple of years continue, that UVXY will have a sizeable pop in the near future.\n\nWhen that happens, you can scalp some gains from the UVXY move.  And since UVXY generally pops in conjunction with equities are hemorrhaging, you’ll be well positioned to use the proceeds from selling UVXY to purchase whichever equities have pulled back to attractive prices.  \n\nRinse and repeat.\n\nThis is not a retirement planner strategy and not for the meek.  It’s extra risk and if it goes wrong it can erode your portfolio.  But you mentioned you didn’t care.  \n\nWhen it works, it’s a powerful tactic.  \n\nFor reference, whenever there’s a newsworthy selloff, UVXY tends to pop 10-30%, sometimes more.  I find it a nice hedge seeing that bright green on days when the market is all red.  I’ll book the gain and have cash to deploy into whatever seems to have sold off too much.\n\nHow this doesn’t work is if the market goes for long periods without fear volatility, and then you decide to take out your capital.  Funds like UVXY drain your capital on a daily basis.  A sustained and uncorrected bull market will shrivel your stash.  You basically need to have conviction that a vix-spiking event will happen in the coming months and that you’ll be quick enough to recognize it and sell.",

This is the account that I would more closely relate to my casino money. I enjoy swing trading, following rumors, day trading etc, but only after securing my retirement in traditional investing strategies. The account isn't huge, and a lot of that 400% that I mentioned has been transferred over to safer ETFs for my future. I'm just wondering where people hold their liquid when there's no super appealing buy available.\n\nThanks for giving me something to look into!",

So swinging capital from that into something else, you’d typically be doing so near a peak.  VIX tends to be inverse, so it’s cheap when you need it, and when it spikes is when the equities you want to trade should be on sale.",
