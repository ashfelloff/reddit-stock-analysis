Slowing down growth, more than expected, means that we are reaching its ceiling. Like last time. Nvidia dropped because of slowed growth. The Q before that we have a pump because of stock split. Basically the only reason. Now. We have a new chip, maybe already with enough revenue from, so we might see. But the market is expecting again increase in growth. If that doesn't happen as much as expected, we might see another dip till the full production Q with Blackwell. So if you own stock, hold. If you don't, you can buy the dip and profit later. If you day trade, you gamble basically. Anything could happen. We all know nvidia will beat. How much is the question and the market expects by a lot over the alresdy really high expectation.",

                      "body": "I've been investing and watching earnings reports since the .com bubble (so almost 25 years now) and I currently work for an investment bank.\n\nThe market is not **nearly** as good at pricing things in as you make it out to be.\n\nFor the priced in logic to be true, most companies would be trading at a nearly identical PE and if the price falls after amazing earnings, it would imply that the stock was incredibly overpriced pre earnings and is still overpriced post earnings, directly contradicting the idea that the market was as good at pricing things in as you think it is. There would also not be the 5-10% intra-week fluctuations on seemingly no news at all that we have seen over the past few months.\n\nNext, there is the issue of HOW to perfectly price in a stock. How far in the future does it price in earnings, 1 year, 2 years? Somehow, it seems that everyone knows that a stock is priced in, but no one can answer how it's priced in. You just have to have faith that it's priced in and trust in the process? People shit on religious people for doing the exact same thing. If a stock is priced in for 1 year in the future, wouldn't that mean that after earnings, they would price in the next earnings 1 year into the future, and the stock would rise still? Then there's also the question; **why on earth** would anyone hold a stock where all the upside is already priced in, but the downside isn't? Surely all the institutions would've dumped already. If Nvidia was so perfectly priced in, why did it climb to 140 in June and fall back down on no negative news at all? Did they make a mistake on how they priced it in June, but this time around, they're doing it right?\n\nSee how easily the priced in logic falls apart? I'm not denying that the market is pricing in a lot of stuff, but to go as far as to say all the positive is priced in and there's only down to go unless we get new positive news or that every bit of news is accurately priced makes absolutely no logical sense whatsoever.\n\nSomehow, the only people I hear saying things are perfectly priced in or make comments like \"all the positive is priced in\" are journalists and retail investors. I've worked in finance for 18 years and am surrounded by incredibly experienced and knowledgeable people, and I NEVER heard anyone say: \"Yeah, that stock is fully priced in\". Because they understand that it is nearly impossible.",

If AI projects flop, then they won't be buying tons of GPUs to scale, or newer GPUs to upgrade their models.\n\nThen also consider that Nvidia is investing in a lot of their customers as well, giving them cash to go around and buy their GPUs in what is essentially a round trip transaction.\n\nNvidia needs their customers to succeed for their investment thesis to work out long term. If AI flops, they essentially have a $100 Billion windfall that pales in comparison to their $3.5 Trillion valuation. Nvidia needs demand to continue growing rapidly to justify their valuation, and the only way that happens is if these AI investments work out well for their customers.",

Let’s say for example, META purchases $2 billion worth of NVDA’s gpu’s, and uses them in a way that doesn’t make META profitable.  Do you think they’ll reorder more of those expensive chips, or go another direction?  Now, suppose those same said chips makes META’s EPS go up 150% and their valuation skyrockets?  Get my point?  NVDA will DIRECTLY be affected with how their chips are used, especially by the big tech companies.  With that said, I do believe NVDA will help the guidance of any company who uses their products.  They are a bit pricey however, so smaller cap companies most likely won’t use them.",

Here's an example of directly benefiting vs indirectly:\n\nDirect benefit: Meta uses Nvidia AI GPUs to build a chat GPT, they sell a subscription and Nvidia gets a 10% cut. Nvidia is directly profiting from META's chat GPT.\n\nIndirect benefit: Meta uses Nvidia AI GPUs to build a chat GPT. They are able to make $4 on every $1 invested on AI infrastructure, they decide to scale it and buy more AI GPUs. Nvidia is indirectly profiting from META's chat GPT.",

I'd imagine, if they do beat and raise, there will be a new run-up to $150+.\n\nNow if it keeps going to $160 or more, I would see that as another over-shoot. That's the problem with NVDA - once the MOMO takes over, it ends up running too far, leading to an inevitable drop and long period of consolidation.\n\nI personally own shares. If it gets anywhere near $160, definitely selling near-the-money covered calls.\n\nEdit: I also see lots of people talking about how Mag7 will eventually slow CapEx - duh, obviously. The build-out will become more cyclical in the same way one doesn't upgrade their gaming video card every time NVDA releases a new series. Rather, you upgrade every 2nd or 3rd generation, because the cost/performance makes more sense that way.\n\nBut why do people think these are the only companies who wants AI GPUs?

Microsoft also said it can’t build data centers fast enough to keep up with AI demand. For the company, that’s justification for pouring more money into the buildout, even if that worries some investors. \n\n>Amazon and Apple earnings are next up. It would be a surprise to see either back away from AI spending. Amazon needs to defend its dominant cloud-computing business, while Apple hopes AI is the key to reviving growth in smartphone sales.",
