  "selftext": "Just a heads up if you own Etsy stock, you should be aware that they announced yesterday that mature content will no longer be allowed to be listed/sold after July 29. Full disclosure, I have a shop on Etsy (NOT mature content). I don't know how much of a dent that is going to put in GMS but it is going to hurt. There is a LOT of \"mature content\" listed and sold there. \n\n[https://mashable.com/article/etsy-to-ban-sale-of-most-sex-toys-explicit-content](https://mashable.com/article/etsy-to-ban-sale-of-most-sex-toys-explicit-content)",

So, their marketing is in clear and direct conflict with the actual customer experience.

They both seem alright, but something just feels off to me. Idk exactly, but something about their layouts and the photoshoots sellers are doing (most things look very \"stock photo\")... it all feels too clean and professional, cheesy even. I understand sellers wanting to make their stuff look as nice as possible, but I just can't shake the feeling that I'm being deceived by a corporation that's actually behind it or even just some sneaky sellers who are putting low effort stuff on there. Definitely saw a lot of print-on-demand looking crap T-shirts on Makerplace... Taking a peak at the women's clothing section has some much more legit looking handmade stuff though, and I guess that's kind of a statement on the market and demand for handmade men's fashion goods.\n\nEtsy, despite all of the garbage that's flooded it, I can still find real, cool handcrafted stuff that looks like it's being sold by a person and not a company and doesn't look generic or cheesy.\n\nI guess another thing is that Etsy has the userbase that's grown over the years so there's lots of weird, fun, novel, niche stuff on there still (like kaliedoscopes, A/V synthesizer, lighting apparatuses, and more), not just stereotypical \"arts and crafts\" stuff, which is mostly what I'm seeing on the other platforms. This could also be just my perspective though since those are the kind of things I look for on Etsy; cool, novel and nerdy stuff, not grandma's Sunday arts and crafts lol.\n\nAfter looking through Go Imagine more, I like it a lot more than Makerplace. It has less of that stock photo corporate feel lol and here's some pretty good looking handmade jewelry on there.",

These listings must be tagged as \"mature\"; can't appear on public places of someone's account like a user's avatar or shop home; the first thumbnail must be \"appropriate for general audiences\"; and depictions of genitalia or products in use must be removed or censored.\n\nSo it honestly sounds less like they're anti-adult products and more like they simply don't want to be an involved intermediary for things that people put inside themselves.",

Oh, and anything tagged \"mature\" is only going to be visible to shoppers who are signed in to Etsy. If you're listing that kind of product, you'll now only be seen by people who already know about you, REALLY know what they're looking for, and/or REALLY know how to find things.",
