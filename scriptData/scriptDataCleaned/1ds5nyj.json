  "selftext": "I don’t see it talked about very frequently (probably because it’s listed in Japan) \n\nFrom what I’ve researched many people stay away since Japan’s stock market is terrible and has been stagnant for 30 years. This could eventually change though, maybe not anytime soon since Japanese economics are complicated. \n\nThey are positioned very favorable in the gaming landscape especially compared to Xbox and Sony at the moment. If they don’t fuck it up with the next system in 2025 then they’ll likely be golden. \n\nI’m more curious about them expanding out into other entertainment ventures, such as, theme parks, movies, etc. owning 1/3 of Pokemon is also quite lucrative. It just appears like the stock never moves.\n\nI own a small position and would like to keep adding to it as I’m also a huge fan of the company but, some of the factors are tilting me away from wanting to add more to the position. \n\nWhat does everyone else think? I’d like to hear about other companies other than Nvidia and Apple all the time.  \n\n",

      "body": "Nintendo takes a wildly different approach to gaming than publicly available Sony and Microsoft. Xbox is a smaller part of Microsoft's portfolio and it's hard to quantify their performance relative to the rest of the company. Similar story at Sony. This makes Nintendo the only pure gaming hardware company.\n\nI've had success with Nintendo as an investment in the past, about halfway through the switch life cycle.  Microsoft has taken an investment approach where they purchase established studios and see what they can get out of them. That didn't work out too well for EA until very recently, so I doubt it'll show major returns for them. Sony has a lot of newer and non japanese talent that they've built from the ground up almost like start up investing. They have a formula that works for them.\n\nI say all that to compare to Nintendo, which takes a very different approach. Where Sony and Microsoft tend to compete on a raw output, Nintendo produces novelty. They have a talented pool of game developers they've curated over 40 years. They've recently disclosed their current strategy to mitigate rising development costs with smaller \"AA\" sized games.\n\nThe problem with novelty hardware is you have no idea if it'll be a quick gimmick or massive hit. The Wii was genuinely revolutionary. The Wii U was a total flop. The Switch was revolutionary, what will the next console hold? It will be hard to say until it already happens. I wouldn't expect an official announcement of hardware to be too massive of a swing in either way. Ideally it'll be as easy as it is now for 3rd party developers to add it. Whether or not their next thing moves consoles is important and not a guarantee. More interesting I think is their pivot to smaller games.",

When Nintendo had their perfect storm moment (both the Wii U and 3DS had terrible launches), they kept calm, prioritized the welfare of their employees, increased their focus on customer experience (Ambassador Program, etc.) and began planning for their recovery with the Switch.\n\nNintendo has excellent management that understands their customers (their real customers, not the vocal minorities) and respects their employees. This means they don't squeeze money out like American publicly traded corps, but they have a very stable and disaster-resistant business relative to competitors in the same space.",

      "body": "I like reading these comments as it gives good perspective. Nintendo is 10/10 gaming company, no one comes close to what they do for themselves. While Microsoft, Sony, Valve, and all other rely heavily on 3rd party titles, Nintendo does not. I am 99% convinced if no third party titles ever released on Switch, the Switch itself might have only sold 5 million less out of the 150 million sold.\n\nLookiny at other comments, my biggest concerns as a stock: Protecting IP, Console concerns, lack of third-party, and aging developers.\n\nNintendo protects their IP so much that after the original live-action Mario Bros, they never released another movie. They started scratched on Metroid because it wasn't to their quality. If they wanted to make a quick billion, they could release Fortnite skins. Nintendo will not, probably ever. Not even on their own console as exclusive.\n\nEvery 6 years they release a new console. While the Switch was fantastic and amazing, they eliminated 2 consoles for one. Back in the early 2010's, Nintendo was flying high with a handheld and console. With that, they are very hit or miss with consoles. For every Switch, DS, and Wii they have had Virtual Boys and Wii U's. The Wii U almost removed Nintendo from the console space... and in the next decade, I am convinced apps will take over consoles.\n\nThird-Party, all I am saying is that no new big entry Grand Theft Auto (or similar big ip) has released on a Nintendo console. That would be a big opportunity for them, but they never seem to build those bridges.\n\nIn many ways, the brainchild of Nintendo is aging. A lot of the creative minds that established these IPs Mario, Donkey Kong, Kirby, Metroid, Zelda, Pikmin, and others are aging. With very small amounts of new IPs to show beyond 2005, will a new generation be able to keep this show running? That in my opinion is similar to thr conversation with Birkshire Hathaway, they have leverage, but without the big guns in charge will it strive?",
