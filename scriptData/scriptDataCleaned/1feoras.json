  "title": "Trump Media Stock Takes 15% Hit Post-Debate Amid Investor Concerns Over 2024 Campaign",
  "score": 545,
  "selftext": "Following the recent debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the stock of Trump Media & Technology Group (parent company of Truth Social) experienced a significant decline of over 15%. Investors appeared unsettled by Trump's political performance, which has historically influenced the stock's value. Since Harris replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee, Trump Media’s stock has plummeted by around 60%, reflecting growing uncertainty about Trump’s political future.\n\nInvestor sentiment is increasingly tied to Trump’s election prospects. His involvement in the 2024 presidential race has led to fluctuating market reactions, particularly as political debates shape public perception. Analysts believe the stock’s value could be impacted further depending on Trump’s ability to regain political traction, which is currently under scrutiny after the debate.\n\nThe drop also highlights broader market concerns about the viability of Truth Social in an evolving media landscape. Investors are questioning its long-term profitability, especially as political shifts create volatility in Trump-affiliated ventures.\n\nThe post-debate decline signals that Trump's business interests are deeply tied to his political career, and investor confidence is wavering based on his current standing in the race.\n\nSource: [https://verity.news/story/2024/trump-media-stock-suffers-postdebate-dip?p=re2631](https://verity.news/story/2024/trump-media-stock-suffers-postdebate-dip?p=re2631)",

TBH if you want to lock anywhere near the profit in he's got you'd probably be better off 25%+ OTM and even then normally I'd say well he'd never sell before the election but then again it's Donald Trump. It could literally dive to a penny stock with one headline.  So if he sold 15 strike weeklies he's still only looking at max 200 profit plus the credit for turning it into a spread if it's called away.  Whereas right now those contracts have far more value than that.\n\nWe all can pretty much agree it's going to 0 and I'd say January of next year is a fairly safe bet that it will at least bleed sub 10, ironically I'd get the hell out of the play before the election because the only scenario I could see him actually holding it is if he loses.",
