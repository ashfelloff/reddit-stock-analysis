  "score": 39,
  "selftext": "So I've been watching Intel/INTC for a while looking for a breakout, which happened today thanks (at least in part) to an upgrade from Melius Research, per several news outlets I read today. \n\nHowever, the analyst upgrade isn't yet reflected in the Analyst sections on Finviz, nor Yahoo Finance, nor Seeking Alpha, Webull, etc. I've checked a bunch of them and no one has it yet.\n\n*Not looking for opinions on Intel* (that particular horse has been beaten here many, many times already)\nSpecifically I'm interested in knowing: where would one go to get these Super Hot Market-Moving analyst upgrades, apart from reading the headlines generated by them? Would I need Bloomberg or something?\n\nEdit: added qualifier \"at least in part\" to the first paragraph; as a few commenters have apparently assumed I'm unaware of the universally understood fact that multiple factors can affect stock prices. Mostly wondering why the headline writers can access these analyst upgrades when I can't, or whether I'm just looking in the wrong place.",
