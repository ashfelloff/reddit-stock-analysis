  "title": "Regard Amazon Third Party Merchant ",
  "score": 121,
  "selftext": "I chose the dumbest industry 10 years ago and became an Amazon third party seller\n\nWhen we started, all of our sales were 100% organic without any ad spend.\n\nNow we are at 50% ad spend from sales and spending close to six figures in ads a month. In the Amazon world we are a tiny merchant. \n\nSince that bitch ass Andy Jassy took over, He's been squeezing us harder than a 18-year-old squeezing titties. Just making up new fees and costs and penalties as he goes along. \n\n- inventory placement fee - basically forcing us to pay them a fee just for our goods to enter the FBA Warehouse  - new shit this year\n\n- shipment penalties when you don't deliver on time, whether it's early or late, it doesn't matter  - new shit this year \n\n- charging us a fee just to put our products on sale during the big discount days - new shit this year \n\n- charging us a bigger fee to get on the regular lightning deals and best deals. - been around \n\n- forcing us to use their logistics services which fucked everyone for quarter 4 because the warehouses are overcapacity and now blocked everyone from sending in more inventory. - new shit this year \n\n- CPC just constantly rising due to the amount of new merchants buying ads mindlessly - been happening for years \n\n- consistent yearly increases in fees all around - been happening for years \n\n- storage fees for high inventory count, Even a fucken fee for not having enough inventory. - new shit this year \n\n- and guess what, Americans love to return shit bought from Amazon and Amazon actually makes a big fucken fee off that. \n\nAnd to top it all off, All those fees are hidden away in dozens of different reports. Making it really difficult for anyone to even check.\n\nFor these reasons. I'm buying calls for Amazon earnings because they're going to report some sigma numbers for e-commerce. AWS and other businesses are expected on the high end as well. \n\nJassy is a shrewd business man and is definitely a way bigger dick than Bezos when it comes to screwing their partners \n\nNot financial advice.
