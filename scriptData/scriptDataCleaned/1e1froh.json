  "score": 138,
  "selftext": "To give the context, no clue what I‚Äôm doing with options, back in 2023 bought some TSLA calls that was up about 2/3k then went to 0 or it expired. Yes I was regarded on that one. \n\nI don‚Äôt have the best track record taking profits, would appreciate advice on how I should play this out. Not really in need of any cash so, happy to keep things in the account and growing (hopefully)\n\nAt one point I think last month these calls were worth close to 20k, but obv I didn‚Äôt do anything hence why I‚Äôm here. \n\nAppreciate all the feedback ü§ù\n\n",
