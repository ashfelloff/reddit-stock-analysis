I was very impressed by earnings and still maintain my PT of 162/share to fully exit (around a 4T valuation). Plan still stands to sell 1/3rd at 140, 150, and fully exit at 162.\n\nIMO the market hasn't fully priced in blackwell revenue. As per Beth Kindig (a popular twitter poster), based on the number of estimated servers to be produced, the revenue run rate for blackwell ALONE is 200B between end of 25 and FY26. These numbers are still just speculation based on the amount of supplies that are being ordered and reverse engineered. But I can't imagine NVDA, Micron, and TSM all ramping up just for fun. I believe it's to fulfill a demand to deliver GPUs. Obviously my thesis is mine alone and yours could be completely different. Until Meta and MSFT start cutting back on their budgets, the path is clear for NVDA",
