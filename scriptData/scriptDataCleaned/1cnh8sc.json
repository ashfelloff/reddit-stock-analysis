SHopify is a website builder nothing more nothing less they shouldn't be shutting down shops if companies aren't breaking laws. They've made a pattern of this and people are leaving for big commerce because of it, Big Commerce actually markets themself as being for Shopify refugees and will write into a contract they wont boot you and if they do theyll give you 6 months or a year to replatofrm where as Shopify will shut you down one day and then never respond.

The “loss” is not an operating loss, it’s a GAAP loss due to investment mark to markets - company is doing amazingly. They also have $5billion in cash and a whole pile of free equity investments in partners like GLBE. Those have to be marketed to market every quarter and go up and down. This quarter they went down $323 million.  Hence huge operating profit but a GAAP loss. It’s bullshit and why ARKK bought $30million yesterday. I liquidated everything and put it all on SHOP.
