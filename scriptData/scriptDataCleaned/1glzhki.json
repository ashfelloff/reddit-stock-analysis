If the adjusted financials (or if they can get a firm to sign off) are fine then it may not be a problem refinancing at a higher rate and it may not get delisted at all. Nothing could happen as well and this is all bullocks but they don't have the cash on their balance sheet to pay $1.7B, but they do assuming they can fetch market value on their receivables and inventory. \n\nUsually these types of things are fear mongering but it could very well be true, what happens will be dependent on the extent of the fraud. I'm not extremely familiar with the situation but if it was something like revenue recognition and the results would have indeed been reflected eventually in an accurate manner then it may not be so bad. If it's a blatant lie and there's non-existent orders then it may be very bad. \n\nOne thing I'll say is I think if AI demand is truly insane then this could perhaps be a generational buying opportunity, I don't own stock or like speculating on stuff like this but I'll definitely be watching.",
