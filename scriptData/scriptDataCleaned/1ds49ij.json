And other stocks like Aurora and Tilray have had little surges. \nIs Cannabis a good place to be in as we approach an American election where it will be on the ballot in some states?\nOr are you still staying away?

They want to bleed the market dry but do absolutely nothing to support it/enforce laws that do (see: lab shopping, lack of self-distribution options, big players backdooring product to NYC, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if regulators in NYC and CA are time-sharing the same single brain cell. There's a lot of reasons I've lost faith in humanity, and the way politicians have perceived and regulated cannabis is high up on that list. The combination of prohibitionist fears based on anti-science \"what about the children\" propaganda and a lack of basic economic comprehension, deliberate or otherwise, is a one-two punch of \"I just can't do this anymore\".

Personally, I would not start a new investment in cannabis stocks at this time. I would wait until they’re really really really beaten down because they’re running out of money. They can’t stay profitable with the 280E taxes they’re paying which will go away after schedule 3, but in the meantime, I believe it’s dead money. The people running these businesses do not know how to make them profitable under current conditions and they just wait for the stocks to pop then issue more stock and dilute existing shareholders. They need to raise capital and without any institutions willing to invest in the sector, they keep diluting their shareholders and continue hemorrhaging money. Too much money is pouring into AI and leaving cannabis stocks. Now the IRS comes out this week and says they will not issue refunds for 280E so I expect to fall even further. Especially with Joe Biden‘s poor performance at the debate you could see someone like Trump getting in office and changing all the good things that the Biden administration has done for cannabis just because. Conservatives, like Ron DeSantis are anti-cannabis they don’t understand the science behind it they’re  pro alcohol but anti-cannabis. It makes no sense, but for some  it is tied into religious beliefs, and you can’t undo stupid. If conservatives take over this is the last sector I would touch. Finally, I would say when it is time to invest in cannabis stocks that you do not touch the Canadian ones such as the one you mentioned. They have no chance of competing with the MSOs alreadyin the United States, like trulieve and green thumb once legalization moves forward.",

      "body": "I worked for a canna tech company for a while but the major issue was that us operators (ie: dispensaries) are competing against the black and gray markets, which don’t pay taxes, don’t have to deal with red tape, and often can sell higher thc products at lower prices, often via convenient delivery services especially in areas where legal options don’t exist. \n\nThere has also been a huge decline in wholesale cannabis prices. This means weed that used to cost $100 now costs $75. Again for the dispensary this is a huge problem, because they are generating less revenue, while their costs for everything are rising.  \n\nAt the same time, cities and municipalities have failed to issue cannabis licenses to storefronts. This props up the gray and black markets. \n\nOne final issue is that due to federal prohibition, each state must have a vertical supply chain. This means that you cannot sell a product grown in New York State in New Jersey. This means that brands haven’t been able to develop. There is really no anheuser Busch or Marlboro of cannabis because these brands can only sell their vapes and gummies and weed in the states where it was grown. Brands need separate facilities in every state, it’s hugely costly to do that, and the landscape feels very fractured. Like you cannot build a large single production facility in California and then export those vapes and gummies to all states. So right now every state has different tiny / smaller / unrecognizable brands. \n\nOf course if there was a path to federal legalization these stocks would surge\n\nBut for now everyone is hemorrhaging cash and the deep pocketed cannabis investor funds are completely dry.",

While the legal Canadian companies (Canopy, Aurora, Tilray) are. The Canadian companies are not as strong on paper, but the liquid exchanges makes things interesting sometimes. I don’t often jump into the Canadian Cos & definitely won’t hold them long term. Of course there’s definitely been some scammy pumping and dumping in the sector. And there’s definitely been a rocky road toward legalization in 17/18 in Canada and now in the US. All I really know is I feel comfortable having a fair bit of my portfolio in the US companies waiting for this legal stuff to run its course.
