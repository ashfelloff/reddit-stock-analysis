  "selftext": " Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\nNews: [Fed’s Higher-for-Longer Stance Hits Firms That Expected Rate Cut](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/fed-s-higher-for-longer-stance-hits-firms-that-expected-rate-cut)\n\n**TH-** US Government agrees to terminate a services agreement with the company’s migrant programming partner in early August.\n\n**AAPL-** WWDC was yesterday, saw AAPL release some new AI software features. Ultimately the market didn’t find it that interesting and the stock sold off yesterday. Will watch at the open to see if we rally.\n\n**NVDA-** Still watching both the $125 and the $120 level today. Beyond that I don’t see any major catalysts for the future until earnings.\n\n**GME-** Still worth watching based on offering news.  They disclosed Q1 results on Friday, but they could add new information so good it’s good to know that if you’re holding a position into the close today.\n\n**SAGE-** Phase 2 SURVEYOR study for Huntington’s disease treatment met primary endpoint, spiked higher premarket. Worth watching to see if it trades higher at the open.",

Their RSI is a bit high now and over bought, but you never know when the train leaves the station again.\n\nI started buying GME last week and have dived in head-first on DD… as you know the media hasn’t mentioned the MOASS, which is what Roaring Kitty is up to. Everyone else in reddit knows that MOASS is the ultimate goal. Get in now, because I believe in RK. I also see the amount of naked shorts this time around. 2021 was nothing compared to this.\n\nWas about to buy AAPL before yesterday’s events. Not sure if EVERYONE wants to upgrade this year, but might be a possibility. I don’t believe in Tim Cook over the long-term though.
