  "selftext": "Carvana just beat earnings expectations but its supracompetitive profit margins compared to peers seem to be from loan sales, not cars. Those loans? Sold straight to Drivetime, run by Ernie Garcia II—the CEO’s dad and an ex-con who’s also Carvana’s major stakeholder. Family ties like this don’t belong in a public company.\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2017/12/18/how-an-ex-con-became-a-billionaire-from-used-cars/\n\nMy speculations are based on this letter 8 months ago  https://www.kerrisdalecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/CVNA-Auditor-Letter.pdf\n\nI know this is some time ago. But current price doesn’t justify such governance risk. Even if it beats earnings, if it’s messing up with its accounting, then… yall know what happened to SMCI. \n\nIm just a degen who gambles with options. So invest at your own risk. \n\nPositions\nCVNA 2P @190 1/17/25\nCVNA 2P @210 6/20/25",

I never seem to find the ‘top’ when deciding to place any short position. Fingers crossed, maybe this time will be different. I purchased these 5 puts for $5.50/ea. & at the end of trading Friday (11/1) they were printing at $9.40/ea. My thought was to either sell them soon before theta decay eats up profits or to roll them over into a further expiration date. Advice would be appreciated.![img](emote|t5_2th52|31224)",
