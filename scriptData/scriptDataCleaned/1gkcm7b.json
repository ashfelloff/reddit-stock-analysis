  "selftext": "Listen closely regard, you're in the red, your wife is about to divorce you and go with 14in BBC Jamal, even if she gets back with you that smelly fish basket will never be tight again, you can't afford to mess this up. Heed my call. \nPosition: 311 nov 15 $2.50 calls\n\nLucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.\n\nEDIT: I WOULD RECOMMEND GETTING AND HOLDING STOCK NOT OPTIONS. We need more stock holders for the short squeeze front with the low float. Options are at a high premium now after I posted this but the stock is still about the same price.\n\nFeel free to reserve your Lucid Gravity SUV on Nov 7th. That would help tremendously for the stock. Plus \n\nEdit: MAKE SURE TO MAKE YOUR STOCKS UNSHORTABLE BY PUTTING THEM ON A HIGH SELL OFFER LIKE $50 OR DISABLING BORROWING.\n\nUPDATE: \nIf you bought calls and want to sell them please buy stock. Most of the regards shorted bought stock at $2.20 with 33% shorted. Let's squeeze them out. This stock still has a bunch it can run.",

An expectation to 10x your production rate is already priced in and leaves a lot of space for disappointment. They aren’t the first $80k electric SUV. Rivian talks about the R2 coming in at $50k will really push up their sales numbers. \n\nThey are currently losing over $100k per car sold and are counting on huge demand for their Gravity to fix that. I don’t think anyone knows what a Lucid is. You can now buy an electric Chevy, Cadillac, Hummer, Volvo, Acura, Kia, Genesis, Rivian, or Tesla SUV. I don’t know why people would go crazy over this.",
