And with the political instability, the supply chain is taking a massive hit.\n\nAI-applications are fully dependent on robust infrastructure. As companies cut costs and expensive Silicon Valley salaries, the innovation slows down. Less innovation, less reliability. The expected value of AI applications on a global scale is projected to reach [$126 billion by 2025](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/ai-infrastructure-market-report).\n\nThen theres AI-LLMs and Algorithms like OpenAI, Microsoft and IBM:\n\nLarge language models need immense computing power. Microsoft and OpenAI rely on sophisticated hardware and seamless cloud integration. Disruptions in chip supply delay training and deployment, slowing down AI advancements. The expected value of AI-LLMs and algorithms is forecasted to hit $67 billion by 2025.\n\nThese forecasts wont mean shit - Trump‚Äôs political moves have created a storm of uncertainty. With global tensions rising, the tech giants are facing massive disruptions. This isn‚Äôt just noise; it‚Äôs shaking the very foundations of the market",

Consumer cyclicals: down to flat (price inflation will keep the poor poor‚Ä¶ just like under Biden so no diff there)\n6. Drug companies up (big pharmaceutical companies not R&D): no brainer  there\n7. Banking up‚Ä¶ seriously, you gotta ask?\n8. Automakers‚Ä¶ : mixed - F survives, but should have died the painful death it should have had in 2008, just like AIG and so many others.
