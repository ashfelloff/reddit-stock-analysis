Showed my wife this screenshot, she saw the IRA bit and thought it is projected money at retirement, I did not bother to correct her.\n\nTop gainers:\nDELL Calls when it was under $100 (+$167k)\nNVDA Calls during recent dip (+$167k)\nNKE Calls when it was under $75 (+$166k)\na space stock (bought around $5.50 sold at $7) (+$112k)\nRDDT stock (bought under $55 sold around $70) (+$73k)\n\nTop losers:\nStock liked by a baby cat (fomo) (-$142k)\nEXPE (bought in Feb expecting future olympics to boost it) (-$25k)\nPANW calls when it first fell under $330 (Pelosi fomo) (-$15k)\n\nStory:\nIn 2018/2019 I was inspired by a regard posting $500k account he made by trading CHGG.\nStarted Robinhood in 2019 with $70k (total life savings) and made it $40k by the end of year.\nFunny story, I misunderstood that impeachment meant removal of president and yoloed into volatility etf and poof 50% loss.\nStarted SPY calls in 2020 and the account became $15k when COVID was first announced. Closed all positions. Withdrew whatever was left.\nStarted in 2021 fresh with $40k deposit, made it to $75k on TSLA calls. Then made the biggest bad decision in my entire life to yolo that into far OTM BB leaps expiring in 2022 and 2023. Poof all gone.\n\n\n\nDid not trade in 2022 and early 2023.\nBecame interested because I saw regards posting gains mid 2023.\nI had $50k in 401k with a previous employer. Rolled that over to an IRA and started trading.\nMade it $180k by 2024 (only stocks)\nEnabled options in 2024 and made to $1M\n\nGood luck to you regards!\nNot financial advice.\n\n",
