I know past performance blah blah.\n\nDidn’t the market crash in 22 after the meme craze? \n\nI’m expecting the same for end of 24 into 25 and here’s why based on FEELINGs.\n\n-Market is possibly in the worst position possible with stagflation headed to a heavy and dark recession.\n\n-Housing is about to hit a crisis for cost to enter the market with the sustained and increasing interest rates.\n\n-Cost of living is out of control and I think it’s getting close to a breaking point for consumers.\n\nNothing is affordable anymore end of story.\n\nMeme stock will be shorter lived and we will see a market crash soon after.\n\nTryst me in regarded. If I have the balls I’m selling everything out of my brokerage this week.",

      "body": "I’m beginning to feel that the word “crash” is a far fetched dream. \n\nThe biggest reason why I feel that such an event is unlikely is funnily enough due to political winds. \n\nRepublicans very much so understand that a crash would inevitably bring about a “New Deal 2.0” and could effectively amount to a shut out for years - this cannot be permitted if they are to have any shot of retaining political power. And this is the designed see-saw of a two party system. Republicans cut taxes so democrats can raise them. Democrats tax everything to pay for anything because that’s how they maintain a political base - rob Peter to pay Paul because you know that eventually republicans will come back around to rob Paul to enrich Peter. \n\nOn the other side of this is the issue of the Aging U.S. population. By 2030, the number of people aged 75 or older is expected to grow by 96%. Older populations typically vote conservatively in effort to maintain what they’ve “worked for” so to speak. The only two ways to offset this trend are either a boom in births (unlikely) or an increased acceptance and alignment on boosting immigration (also unlikely). \n\nThe very idea of a crash, is too untenable an idea between the aging population and republican governance - both of which do not like the idea of radical, systemic, change. \n\nI’d put my money on more helicopter money or money printing that kicks the can down the road as far as they can. \n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2021/number-of-people-75-and-older-in-the-labor-force-is-expected-to-grow-96-5-percent-by-2030.htm",

The best that could happen, from gambler's perspective, would be if game stock skyrocket and some sort of settlement was reached to not kill the bagholders, just like in the case of VW short squeeze. Anyone holding stock could sell for a very nice multiple of the current price and call holders would make a bank. Profits could be then rolled into  whatever went down because bagholders had to raise capital to cover, provided you're able to identify those assets.\n\nWhat OP is giving is a bunch of incoherent ramblings, without much connection to reality or to each other.    \"Everything\" went down with \"the stock\" mooning exactly once, when short sellers got caught with their pants down and many were closing all short positions they had. This was a short lived event and didn't really repeat on the following bounces. 2022 correction was completely unrelated.\n\nTL;DR you have a decent idea, OP is smelling his own farts",
