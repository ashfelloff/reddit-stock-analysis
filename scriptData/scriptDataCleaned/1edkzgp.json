      "body": "The issue here is that we are now in a period of distribution for the semis, including the leader NVDA. We had a massive inflation pre-split and it came for the $75-$80 range. I think it's fair to give it a premium over that valuation given the earnings that followed. So to me, $90 is a good level for base ... the chart is close as well. The problem for the upside is that now any significant non-catalyst driven rally could be sold by those entering during this churn. I still see a top between $140-$150 with good earnings. So, that's a big range with it sitting roughly in the middle. \n\nWhen buying outright longer dated calls, I always suggest treating it like a position trade. Break them up into 2-4 purchases to average in. If you went 100%, you now have no leverage to add more. You're gambling on a higher move now into what appears to be a lower market. It's a coin flip but the path of least resistance looks to be down in the short term, with a short term base in over the next week or two before earnings start to provide an upside catalyst.",
