  "selftext": "Intel Corp (INTC) is widely discounted and cast aside especially in this subreddit due to the hype around the fast booming AI stocks which you all know by now. However, I believe intel is a giant that has the technology and capital and all that is left is the speed to make a competitive move. Not to mention the current prospects that they may be a future supplier to everyoneâ€™s favorite AI stock, Nvidia. Anyone jumping on some cheap Intel calls? \n\nCurrent positions: Huge variability of Intel calls 1-3 years out with around ~10-20% gains.",

      "body": "hey so... you're wrong. The problem with Intel is they make computer chips. Nothing is really wrong with that, but it's a very competitive space. For a long time Intel dominated because in \\~2004 they figured out how to link to CPUs together to share a workload - called them \"cores\" - and so they had a nice run. They made a machine so big and complex that no one person understands it. Present tense is appropriate, because no one is allowed to understand it all completely. You see, if someone understood the machine, they could build a better one. \n\nNow the current problem with Intel: they are unable to innovate. Innovation is the opposite of optimization. Intel is really good at optimizing, and if they had a better product, that would be the way to success. \n\nHowever, AMD exists. AMD figured out how to link a bunch of incomplete-CPUs together - called them \"chiplets\" - and so now they make better CPUs than Intel. When only two companies make a product, the product quality and performance matters a lot more than the price difference or the business relationships or even the brand loyalty that exists in the marketplace. \n\nYour bet implies that INTC will be able to make a 'better' CPU than AMD in the next year, which they can't. I read an article that said Intel just bought a new fancy machine to make their newest chips, and that they are the only ones who can buy the machine for 2 years or something. Well, that means they are going to spend a year plugging the machine into the wall. The second year they will make chips that aren't as good as the ones they can make today, and in the 3rd year they will make something worth selling, but AMD will have spent 0 days figuring out how to use a new machine. AMD will have been innovating for 3 years. AMD is the play. INTC to $0 by 2035.",
