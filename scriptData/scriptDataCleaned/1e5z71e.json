                              "body": "I think they're incorrect in saying that \"...inflation didn't even budge.\" Inflation has come down from about 8% to about 3%.\n\nBut I still think the Fed has failed to reach it's 2% inflation target. Inflation is slowly getting to about 3 or so percent, and starting to level off at about 3%. Last week's PPI indicated that inflation maybe returning, especially in services.  The housing or shelter costs are still about 5% inflation year to year. I believe the housing shortage and housing inflation is going to destroy millions of middle class and working class people in the USA.  Lowering rates will make the housing affordability worse. A cyclical deflationary recession may cause both rates and housing prices to decline if there is a surge in unemployment.\n\n\nI believe this residual inflation and the housing shortage is going to bring on the next recession.",
