  "selftext": "Forget all analyses. Forget all fundamentals. Forget the fact that NVDA has earnings coming up. Forget the fact that they announced a new China chip.\n\nJust know these two facts: \n\na) Cramer said everyone wants out of NVDA today\n\nb) Cathie Woods doesn’t own NVDA \n\nThere are people who’ve made fortunes simply inversing Cramer especially when it comes to plays on popular stocks. Cramer said he was short NVDA during September 2022 (will post video link to this in comments). On July 9, 2024, Cramer tweeted out “Nvidia about to break out from the churn post stock split?”. The same week NVDA went from 135 to 127 and has been going down since. It will now do the opposite and I’m expecting a major pump already tomorrow on Friday. \n\nAs for Cathie, as everyone knows, she sold most of her NVDA holdings when it was below $15 per share post split. And yet somehow, she gets to manage billions. \n\nNVDA 130 C 8/16\n",

I got up to 5 before they started talking Trump Trade and then poof... My streak was over... I don't think it will start its steady climb again until after the election and if Trump wins, it will hurt NVDA.\n\nEdit: I was testing some pattern trading ideas I had. Stocks that close the week higher than they open. NVDA HAD a nice pattern going where it would peak on Tuesday / Wednesday then drop on Thursday, it would bounce back a little on Friday but not enough to make up for the drop on Thursday. Still closing higher than open on Monday. So if I bought on Monday and sold by Wednesday, I was making good money and was able to hit 5 weeks in a row with this strategy. I was dumping stock data out of yahoo and analyzing it with ChatGPT, looking for patterns in stock prices. It worked until it didn't. lol",

I just think they are wildly overvalued in the short-term. \n\nAMDs case is complicated, but it comes down to ecosystem. The simplest way to explain it is to say that NVDA's CUDA is the equivalent of MSFT's Windows or Apple's Appstore. AMD does not have an equivalent. They will be forced to compete as the value proposition. Nothing wrong with that. But companies spending 100s of Billions on AI are trying to outdo each other. They aren't looking for the budget option. The ones that are looking to save money, will expect to do so - AMDs profit margins will be rubbish.\n\nMU is less complicated - They are literally a part of a low profit margin, highly commoditized industry with numerous competitors, which have over the decades engaged in multiple races to the bottom. Their business model is literally the opposite of AAPL's. They will sacrifice margins in an instant when a competitor arises. They've done it before. They will do it again. I would be scared to go long. But that does not mean they won't profit in the short term.",

But it's not a flash in the pan either. It's a multi-year build out. The only companies even getting chips right now are the largest companies on the face of the planet. Once they slow purchases to a more staggered and cyclical approach, all the midsize companies (basically the other 493 S&P companies) will finally be able to buy.\n\nUse the info as you will, good sir! May you feast on tendies.\n\n---\n\nZuckerberg said on the podcast with Chang that companies are “making a rational decision” in their AI investments despite the exorbitant costs.\n\n“Because the downside of being behind is that you’re out of position for like the most important technology for the next 10 to 15 years,” Zuckerberg said.\n\n---\n\n[The Game Theory of AI CapEx | Sequoia Capital](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/)\n\nDavid Cahn, a partner at venture firm Sequoia, wrote in a blog post last week that the dynamic driving the spending is competitive and [follows game theory dynamics](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/), creating a “cycle of competitive escalation.”\n\n“The cloud giants see AI as both a threat and an opportunity and do not have the luxury to wait and see how the technology evolves,” Cahn [wrote](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-optimism-vs-ai-arms-race/). “They must act now.”\n\n----\n\nTesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/) said on his company’s [earnings call](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/tesla-tsla-earnings-q2-2024.html) on Tuesday that “demand for Nvidia hardware is so high that it’s often difficult to get the GPUs.” Musk said Tesla is focusing on developing its own Dojo supercomputer because Nvidia chips are so pricey and so hard to get.\n\n*″*I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for Nvidia is so high,” Musk said. “And it’s obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, **which is very high**.”",

They overhired after COVID because the market liked seeing growth. They all started laying people off because the market was concerned about margins. They all spent a bunch of money on AI because the market loved reading those letters on anyone's earnings press release. And if the market gets weary about all this AI spending without a clear monetization framework like your article mentions, they will cut back AI spending.\n\nThere are plenty of ideas that would be worth 10s of trillions if they actually came to fruition. Nuclear fusion, asteroid mining, carbon sequestration, quantum computing, a cure for cancer. Doesn't mean companies pump half a trillion dollars a year into those in order to be first.",
