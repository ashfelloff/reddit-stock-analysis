Had four bolts unscrewed in January (nobody is asking sabotage?), has self served even lower production than FAA prod cap 1st half this year (because they afford it) to ramp up to prod cap 2nd half this year. \n\nIt‚Äôs a damn dog and pony show. Calhoun hasn‚Äôt done a bad job but he inherited a mess in 2020! He‚Äôs right to go 2025. But he still wants to be remembered for being the guy that went all in on quality assurance. Which is what they have been doing this past half year! Also it has been about pleasing a disgruntled public and government all the while it‚Äôs still the safest decade ever to fly! People don‚Äôt seem to realize max‚Äôs are still flying everyday for years now since the no fly order was rescinded!\n\nDefense and space turned a profit last earnings after being what kept overall earnings red last few years mainly due to being stuck in old pre inflation income contracts with inflation affected costs!! Like the damn Air Force one and much more! Everybody missed that! \n\nServices turned a profit! \n\nBut now commercial is bleeding cash again but it‚Äôs damn self served!! If they had opted to produce at faa prod cap they wouldn‚Äôt have. But what it is all about behind the scenes is making sure they get spirit aero systems back because congress has to see it as part of quality assurance to literally become the monopoly again! Because damn global antitrust in the first place forced them to spin it off in 2005-06. Which is the damn reason bad politics created the problem in the first place! We lived in an era where globalist policies opted for outsourcing and chopping up a great company and then whined when consequences of said policies happened. Expected fucking consequences. \n\nSo if you want to play the blame game you should really blame the right damn part, yourselves, your parents and naive policies and electing stupid officials along with management 2000-2020! \n\nNow! The only reason that spirit deal has been postponed is still because literally Airbus doesn‚Äôt want to become a Boeing customer and need a replacement deal when spirit is Boeing again. You let Airbus and EU roll you over on the spirit chop up almost 20 years ago and still letting them dictate the pace of taking spirit back thus control of quality back! \n\nAlso why when Boeing asked for more lending after last earnings the order for 10 billion was filled in a day! You don‚Äôt ask yourself why? In 2020 Boeing got long term loans for 0.3% interest rates! The last batch of ‚Äúfunding‚Äù will be to stay cash positive this hiatus we are in but also to pay for the damn buy back of spirit!\n\nGeez fucking Louise\n\nMake this post after free cash flow is positive in 25 and growing 26 and 27 (the latter when also dividends is reintroduced) it has all been in the news lately and stated by management but hey nobody pays attention when there is hate in the air üòÇ",
