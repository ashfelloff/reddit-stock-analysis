  "score": 355,
  "selftext": "(Reuters) -Apple's shares rose 2.5% to a record high on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the iPhone maker's shares and designated the stock as a \"top pick,\" citing the company's AI efforts as a boost to device sales.\n\nIn what was seen as a move to catch up with Alphabet's Google and Microsoft-backed OpenAI, the iPad maker last month unveiled Apple Intelligence, luring customers to upgrade their devices to be able to use the new technology.\n\nApple's shares, which have jumped nearly 20% this year, rose to $236.30, giving the company a market value of $3.62 trillion, the highest in the world.\n\n\"Apple Intelligence is a clear catalyst to boost iPhone and iPad shipments,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\nThe new technology is compatible with only 8% of iPhone and iPad devices and Apple has 1.3 billion units of smartphones currently in use by customers, the analysts said, adding that the company could sell nearly 500 million iPhones over the next two years.\n\nMorgan Stanley, which previously expected Apple to sell between 230 million and 235 million iPhones annually over the next two years, raised its price target on the company's shares to $273 from $216.\n\nThe stock has an average rating of \"buy\" with a median price target of $217, and has outperformed the S&P 500 index this year, according to LSEG data.\n\nIndustry analysts expect Samsung and Apple to lead the charge in global smartphone market recovery this year given the buzz around GenAI-enabled smartphones.\n\nApple sold 45.2 million smartphones globally in the three months ending June, up from 44.5 million a year earlier, but its market share fell to 15.8% from 16.6% in the same period, according to IDC data.",

Who do they seriously think  are going to abandon Teams and Zoom for web meetings in favor of using a Vision Pro or Facebook VR product? Anyone who seriously thinks this is living in imagination land and needs to step outside of their bubble and visit the real world.\n\nThe only valid business use for VR/AR for businesses is training in certain niche industries, but IMO the cost of building said training in VR/AR would 95 times out of 100 be so expensive and/or change frequently enough overtime to make it too practical for anything that there's no safety issues with just practicing in the real world.
