Learned it from my ancestors, is meant to  distillate reason into your corrupted soul. \n\nThere are different reasons as why one succeeds or fails in the stock market but a widely underestimated one is the ability of being able to control one’s emotions. \n\nSon, the very principle of the stock market is to try and differentiate yourself from others. The goal here is to have somewhat of a new perspective on things in order to outperform your regarded peers. \n\nYou know one easy way to do dat ? You buy when they sell. You sell when they buy. It is the most basic yet effective way to go against the grain in order to fuck that little grain right in his tiny ass. \n\nCan this be applied in every and all situations ? Of course not regard, but it’s a good basis in order to begin somewhere. \n\nPattern trading is not a thing regard, day trading is not a thing either. Stop doing that. Do more of the thing that makes money : Investing. \n\nBelieving in one company that you study every possible aspect of, buy when it’s low, sell when it’s high. Hold when you consider it’s not any of the two. \n\nFOMO is your one single worst enemy. Fight it gay people or you will lose this war ",
