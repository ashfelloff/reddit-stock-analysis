Selling GPUs to themselves during the crypto boom.  Coreweave/SMCI/NVDA circular money glitch\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022-79\n\nCoreweave is basically owned by NVDA Blackrock Blackstone. Blackrock Blackstone and PE is lending money to Coreweave/NVDA so\nNVDA is selling billions worth of GPUs to themselves\n\nhttps://www.blackstone.com/news/press/coreweave-secures-7-5-billion-debt-financing-facility-led-by-blackstone-and-magnetar/\n\n\n\n“None of the founders came from the cloud space before starting CoreWeave. Rather, all came from trading energy futures. While Venturo and Intrator were working together at their hedge fund” \n\nSix months ago when SMCI was being pushed on to the public I said it was a scam to fleece retail, said they were going to be a ton of lawsuits and they’re all coming\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bw9c8l/goldman_sachs_and_morgan_knowingly_offering_scams/\n\nI didn’t know when the timing of the dump was but I said it’d be under $100 in the future before all the accounting fraud reports came.\n\nDigging around and talking with people in the field be very careful when Coreweave get offered, it may pump, even for a year but their numbers are going to be cooked.\n \n\nAnd as we see SMCI has the same circular money glitch selling/buying from his brother, wife’s company which are located inside the SMCI campus. So I don’t know the exact but it seems very fishy and makes me think PE loaned money to 2.6 billion to coreweave to pump up SMCI and NVDA revenue numbers and they are going dump on retail?\n\nhttps://hindenburgresearch.com/smci/\n\nI can’t put my finger exactly on it but there’s definitely alarm bells ringing",

So it was bailed out, they managed to find a buyer for it since it needed capital. \nWell sometime has passed since then and we just \"found\" out that the buyer used a loan from the airline to buy the company. \n\nSo think about it the guy bought the company with a loan taken from the company he was buying, so he got the company for free really. I mean might as well give the company to a homeless person on the streets with no knowledge since it seems nowadays you dont even need to have money to buy anything in the 1st place.\n\nTheres a lot more corruption and complexity in this case but this is the developed world of 2024",

In fact, this is great news for a startup that their services are being used by investing companies.  Such dogfooding is not uncommon. Even OpenAi has investments by Microsoft and others, and their services and IP are being used by Microsoft. They are growing really fast given the need of GPU services. They scaled from 3 data centers to 10 this year. \n\n\nAlso, just a cursory glance into numbers will be enough to debunk the conspiracy theory in the posting. Nvidia's net investment in coreweave is just 100 million - typical rounds nvidia makes for promising startups.
