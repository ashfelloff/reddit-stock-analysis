The automakers are biting their nails because Cleveland Cliffs would have monopoly pricing power if they got USS. Biden would rather have inflated steel and car prices than allow in a high-efficiency Japanese team that scares the union.",

But when you compare their output and bottom line to competitors they lag far behind. The blast furnaces they use are just too old and inefficient compared to electric ones competitors use. They're in trouble if the U.S implements a carbon tax or China or India start increasing exports. They can still keep chugging for a while but an acquisition is inevitable with the direction they're going.",
