What's worse, is that you can get much better performance per dollar from other chipmakers these days as Intel chips have only managed tiny performance bumps over the last number of models. Compared to other chips, they're more energy hungry for the same throughout. This energy has to go somewhere, which is heat. Running hot reduces their performance while they're hot--and shortens their life further. AMD and Apple Silicon are kicking Intel's ass and it's not going to be a quick fix for Intel. They've repeatedly doubled down on their increasingly problematic designs with little innovation. I'm not a CPU designer but I'm guessing they're going to have to do some major redesign to release competitive chips again. In the meantime, I'm guessing there's going to be a lot of nonrenewal of contracts--which might pinch their R&D budget. I hope they're not in the beginnings of an MBA-brought death spiral because we need competition in the space.",

          "body": "The real problem with intel is that they weren’t paranoid about keeping their fabs up to date. Way back when, Andy Grove wrote “only the paranoid survive.”  His theory was that in the semiconductor market, you had to continually invest in the next fabrication plant to be able to make the next generation of chips. \n\nIntel was so big that nobody else could have the same high end fabs.  Sure, you had ibm and Motorola but intel was right there at the top.  Especially compared to AMD.  Intel was so much bigger that they could invest in one plant and then do what they called “copy exact” so the second, third, fourth etc fab could just do exactly what the first one did, thereby allowing them to leverage their investment in the process tech. \n\nAlso, way back when, the fabless semis were always a slight step behind because the foundries of the world were always a step behind intel. \n\nBut eventually, intel slowed investment, a bunch of companies got out of the “you have to have your own plant” mentality and switched to using foundries, and foundries (tsmc) were able to out invest intel. \n\nNow, TSMC has world class fabrication plants and intel doesn’t. But intel is still burdened by having the old ones. \n\nAnd, to top it off, intel doesn’t have the volume to really compete the same way it used to.  TSMC is producing for and, nvidia, and many many others, while intel is trying to be able to produce just its own stuff. \n\nIt’s a death spiral, and the only way out is for intel to be able to either (a) pull off a miracle and get their fabs up to par AND get top notch silicon designs ready for market; or (b) suddenly become a fab for half of their direct competition. \n\nNobody is going to pay intel to be a foundry when they have competed against intel for years.  Way too much bad blood. \n\nSo, i guess there is a third option. Intel needs to break itself apart into foundry and fabless semi and then let the market decides what happens.",

Companies give 0 fucks about bad blood. They only care about value. Just look at Samsung and Apple. Apple is using Samsung displays.\n\nIntel fabs is at this current moment already installing the newest chip machines from ASML. The ones TSMC didn't want to buy because they were too expensive and then suddenly backed tracked on and bought them anyways.\n\nIntel and Microsoft recently struck a deal for foundry of 15bn. So, there seems to be a good case that Intel is making to get these deals done.\n\nIntel has been stuck on 14/10 nm for a loooooong time. However, they are suddenly managing to quickly move from new node to new node. The transformation is already happening as we speak. The value is just lagging behind because AMD is ahead at this time. \n\nThe reason Intel has been a shit company is their lack of innovation and pure focus on profits.
