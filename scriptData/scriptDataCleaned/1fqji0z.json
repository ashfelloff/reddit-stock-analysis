  "selftext": "COLLEGE PARK, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Â IonQ (NYSE: IONQ), a leader in the quantum computing industry, today announced that it has signed a $54.5 million contract with the United States Air Force Research Lab (AFRL). With a quarter remaining in the fiscal year, IonQ has announced $72.8 million in bookings year-to-date and reiterated its confidence in meeting or exceeding its bookings guidance of $75-95 million for the year.\n\nSource: [https://investors.ionq.com/news/news-details/2024/IonQ-Announces-Largest-2024-U.S.-Quantum-Contract-Award-of-54.5M-with-United-States-Air-Force-Research-Lab/default.aspx](https://investors.ionq.com/news/news-details/2024/IonQ-Announces-Largest-2024-U.S.-Quantum-Contract-Award-of-54.5M-with-United-States-Air-Force-Research-Lab/default.aspx)\n\nNot bad. There is a lot of potential. Only good news in the last months. If ion-trapped QC becomes scalable, we might have a winner here.\n\n+8% so far.",
