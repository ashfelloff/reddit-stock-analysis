Just look at the long history of pump and dumps with gold.\n\nBut also uranium futures are up like 50% for the year and is on the downswing now. Buy now if you like being a bagholder. 10 year average annualized return is like 1%, so buy later if you like losing money to inflation.",

If the stock is $50 you buy $51 calls or $49 puts unless it’s got a lot of room to drop but even so it’s more worth it to get the closest you can otherwise you might get the move you’re looking for and instead of making 100% you made 20%… you have over 4k that’s plenty enough to make back your money plus some. Keep trades under $250 per trade and stack the small wins. Once you figure out wtf you’re doing them you can size up. The best part about trading is if you start small you can always size up. If you’re trading with $100 or $100,000 it’s the same thing",
