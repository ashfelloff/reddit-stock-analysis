  "selftext": "THESIS:\nThe issue with snowflake is that they‚Äôre a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework. \n\nHowever, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex ‚Äúdata science‚Äù tasks because most data needs to be ‚Äòengineered‚Äô before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.\n\nThis post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:\n\n- Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose ‚Äòdistributed computing framework‚Äô or ‚Äòdistributed compute runtime‚Äô.\n- Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to ‚Äòspark‚Äô in benchmarks\n- Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data \n   - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:\n\n- ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlo‚Äôs Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~\n\n\n- My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility\n- Misleading promotional information for investors\n- My (limited) experience using the product\n- Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)\n\nDISCLOSURE: \n\n- I‚Äôve held a long short position(<$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move. \n- FWIW, I don‚Äôt hold individual stocks; my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts. \n- I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.\n\nMY CLAIMS: \n\n- Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers\n- Snowflake‚Äôs valuation should be closer to Vercel‚Äôs, in $5 - $10 billion range.\n\n\nThis Document Has All of My Notes So Far: \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1SKBHX8Mpbwk9odplmycmC6Bgtr70ipNuszSUGcNNz20/edit?usp=sharing\n\nPlease offer brutal criticism and ask (specific, technical) questions! I want your opinions!\n\n\n---\n\nedit: after thinking about it, there is a fair amount of value in the management/governance side of the product(e.g. logging every query & job with a clear indication of the cost). Also, being able to selectively restrict the data which various employees can see. Though, this puts a lot of power(maybe too much) in the hands of the administrators.",

              "body": "Many of the perspectives in this thread are from the Tech sector (ex. Machine learning, data science), which is an incomplete perspective. \n\nI am a Data/Solution Architect in the Healthcare sector. We are a very large consumer of RDBMS databases and our tech stack is in sync with many other industries like Finance. (Low tech companies with tech needs.) \n\nTraditionally, our sector has been very Microsoft SQL Server dominated for our on premise solution. The same is true for a number of low tech industries. For the cloud solution, everyone is swapping over to Snowflake.\n\nThis poises a significant risk to Microsoft because Microsoft SQL Server is one of their biggest products by Revenue. It is one of the biggest names in the ‚ÄúIntelligent Cloud‚Äù sector. \n\nIntelligent Cloud is much higher revenue than Personal Computing (Windows) and Productivity (Office). I suspect Microsoft have always used SQL Server to pad Azure numbers by pitting the two in the same category despite SQL Server mostly being an on premise product. \n\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2023-Q4/segment-revenues\n\nI‚Äôm a AWS Certified Solution Architect and as a requirement I pretty much need base knowledge of the entire gamut of AWS database offerings. \n\nSo I can speak with authority that all the AWS/Azure/GCP offerings are garbage compared to Snowflake. They are just lazy reskins of open source software (ex. PostgreSQL/MySQL to Redshift/Aurora, MongoDB to DocumentDB, etc.) \n\nThe UI is terrible. The features are terrible. And it‚Äôs embarrassing to admit (or maybe it shouldn‚Äôt be) but we are not big tech and our developers are not so competent to be able to finagle with their clunky open source command line solutions. That is why we were using SQL Server in the first place! \n\nAWS and Google may not care but, for Microsoft, a product is at risk that could be bigger than Windows. So it would not surprise me if they bought Snowflake (if FCC allows it). It‚Äôs an industry leading product and the spiritual successor to SQL Server in terms of use case.",

              "score": 11,
              "body": "FYI.. I am a Snowflake employee. Some clarification about What Snowflake can do and what Snowpark is.\n\nSnowflake is absolutely a data crunching platform. Data Engineering use cases are the top workloads across all the customer base where PBs of data is processed daily. Free Sample datasets that come with every account even have tables with 240 Billion row tables that you can use to query or perform data transformations.\n\nSnowflake is NOT Databricks or Spark, it has its own engine that can handle SQL, Python, Java & Scala in an automatically distributed manner which is much faster than Spark on most DataEngineering jobs including massive datasets and do it in a much more fault tolerant manner with far fewer failures, errors or manual tweaking.\n\n**Snowpark** is Snowflake way of allowing Data Engineers and Data Scientists to use their favorite programming language of choice(Python/Java/Scala) and stay with the same code syntax & data frames(PySpark & Pandas) they already are using.\n\nIt allows you to do two things:\n\nFirst, it allows execution of native Python, Java, Scala(with 3rd party libraries) & SQL languages directly on Snowflake compute in an automatically distributed manner without any additional coding , configuration or maintenance. (This allows execution of ML & AI models on Snowflake as well as any other custom Data Engineering functions that can't be replicated in SQL such as a Python function to extract text from PDF() or perform Web Scrape from a website)\n\nSecond, it offers a client side library for developers wanting code using their local dev environment via their favorite IDE(VSCode, PyCharm & etc.) where their code is executed remotely on Snowflake serverless clusters allowing them to build & execute highly complex code against massive datasets directly from their local machines.\n\nExecution & Performance of the code is identical whether you use the Snowpark Client side library on your local machine or code directly within Snowflake UI as the data is already on Snowflake environment & execution is done on Snowflake clusters with direct access to data files.\n\nBenefits of Snowpark:\n\n1. Code syntax is 90%  compatible with PySpark, so there no need to learn or modify existing code.\n2. Python/Java/Scala code being executed on Snowflake compute has number of benefits:\n\n* If using local dev environment, Your local Python Environment/machine has no impact on performance. Your code will run super fast against TBs of data even if you run it from an old laptop. Alternative is to develop on Snowflake WebUI & where the code is already stored on Snowflake.\n* Any Native Python/java/Scala Functions & 3rd parties libraries you use or create locally in your code will be automatically uploaded to Snowflake compute cluster and the function will be automatically distributed across all nodes within a given cluster against the data.\n* Unlike Spark, you are not tied to a fixed size compute cluster that the code starts it execution with. Using Snowpark, you can issue SQL commands to resize the current cluster size within seconds dynamically (XS 1 to 6XL 512 nodes) . This allows scaling up before a large job then scale down immediately for the next job that is smaller. ( Better unit economics & SLAs)\n* Much more efficient & faster as you no longer have to move large volumes of data from your DWH/Lake to process then move the final dataset back into a DWH.  Instead code gets pushed to where the data resides and runs on compute that has access to it.\n* Much better security & governance. Data never leaves Snowflake Environment to a developers machine & all access and jobs are audited and logged.\n* Basically it allows you do what you are already doing with Python and orher  languages but do it in a much easier, faster, secure & problem free manner without having refactor your existing code or learn new coding skills.\n\nHere is a video of running a previously PySpark code on Smartphone after it was modified to use Snowpark dataframes where 6 Billion & 10M row tables are joined, aggregated and written to a new 360M row table in 16 secs on a Samsung Phone running Python 3.9\n\n[https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-akincilar-3417945\\_dataengineering-data-pipeline-activity-7142282080792543232-o4A4?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=member\\_android](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nick-akincilar-3417945_dataengineering-data-pipeline-activity-7142282080792543232-o4A4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android)",

Even if the company's product offering may fall short at the moment, will Ramaswamy be able to execute a turn around?\nIf yes, then one may argue that Snowflake share priced at <160$ as of 2nd May, 2024 is undervalued!\n\nCloud based data storage, data analysis, data engineering/computing etc is likely is expand as more enterprise join the fray?\nSo isnt the potential customer base and order size for Snowflake likely to grow over time?",

They don't. AWS wants workloads to move from on-prem to the Cloud. Snowflake is a great way for customers to do that. What is the incentive for AWS to sink a lot of resources into Redshift when a customer running Snowflake on AWS means they still win the workload? I think of it this way. If AWS has 200 services, Snowflake plays nicely with 198 of them. Sure, maybe the customer isn't using EMR and Redshift, but they are still using EC2, S3, and a bunch of other services instead.",

For example, we use AWS Redshift, and one of the executives constantly pushes us to get positive reviews from a Snowflake PoC, even though I firmly say it's no better than what we already have. \n\nIn another company where I work, we have full stack AWS, GCP, Teradata, etc., and recently got Snowflake with a promise of reduced query run costs and bringing transparency into expenses. I am unsure if we realized the benefits yet, but I feel frustration from people as you're now under scrutiny by executives as to who is utilizing how much.\n\nOverall, I agree with your statement about what Snowflake does but don't underestimate the stupid executives in these big companies.",
