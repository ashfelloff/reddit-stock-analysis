But what should I put my money in to get maximum value out of this huge buying opportunity? Should I just play it safe and DCA SPY or potentially double my savings quickly by nabbing NVDA at crazy cheap?\n\n",

In 5 years we all of a sudden don't need Nvidia (which is market leader) chips anymore?\n\nThis is extremely naive approach towards estimating the valuation of a share. The correct question to ponder is that will companies continue to throw money in AI and related technologies increasingly or at least on the same level as they are currently in the future? If you think the answer is yes, then you have a chance to buy NVDA at discount. If the answer is no, then you should be cautious as we mostly likely are far from the bottom and it may take years or even decades NVDA to reach these market levels.\n\nIn my view current situation in big tech has more than few similarities compared to dot com boom era. Or even the times of 19th century Gold Rush! In those days companies making shovels made absolutely a bank while most actual Gold Rush participants didn't and during the dot com era companies manufacturing new internet era tools sold their products with sky high margins as companies and investors were throwing eye watering lumps of cash towards the \"new economy\". Companies like Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and countless of others thrived as did their share prices.\n\nThen the investments died, if not overnight, then in a very short period of time. And because the infrastructure investment was so over the top, it took quite a while when companies needed to upgrade their facilities which meant that sales and margins of these tech products plummeted. For example, Cisco is still here and doing well, but its share price hasn't yet reached the ATH of dot com bubble era.\n\nI can't possibly know what will happen, but I've seen this kind of shit, that is, bubbles bursting quite many times including the fabulous dot com era and current situation certainly looks like one too in many ways. In fact, I would be more surprised if tech spending we've seen recently even can continue very long. However, it doesn't mean that NVDA isn't manufacturing chips five years from now. Or that these technologies would just disappear or stop progressing. It is just that it may be that NVDA will have significantly smaller sales, margins and generally much more modest outlook of future performance. And if this is indeed the case, then I would be very cautious of increasing NVDA or other big tech companies in portfolio at this point in time. But you do how you want, of course.",

They are also one of the fundamental companies with a high market cap 170 billion~ they are investing in in potentially really high growth sectors and are a players in AI. Also they indicated a stronger guidance result compared to what Wall Street street expected still down around 20% from the the earning call if it stays at this price I’m buying like 2700$ all in.
