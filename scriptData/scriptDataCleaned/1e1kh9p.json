(I think they might have started to cover today)\n\nThese are 6 reasons im justifying to myself for my epic loss. Do your own dd kids.",

In addition (unlike the other meme stocks) they literally have the best and most efficient electric vehicles in production, multiple awards for car of the year, the Sapphire halo car, what will be the best EV SUV released in a few months, and the Project Midsize for 2026.\n\nThe best tech and highest efficiency also offer options for partnerships, which are likely only a matter of time. Just puzzling how low under the radar this company is flying right now. Not financial advice obviously, but it makes no sense to me how niche and inferior Rivian is at $18 with their insane cash burn and Lucid is at $4 today and $2.69 a month ago.",

It’s not possible for them to gain market share in the near term they can’t produce enough cars, and considering the difficulties of mass production I’d say it’s likely they’re going out of business at some point.

                      "body": "Yes, I have actually. Tesla is a rattly piece of shit with terrible suspension, awful build quality, cheap interior, absence of intuitive driving features (buttons and stalks), probably the worst paint on the market, and good luck sitting in those \"Model 3\" or \"Model Y\" seats without getting a backache within 10 minutes. On top of all this, the sound deadening sucks, the \"self-driving\" with current hardware will never be a thing, and the usable range is a maximum of around 225-250 miles. You are also buying from a company whose CEO is a right-wing nazi piece of shit who donates to trump, looking to be his advisor.\n\nAbsolutely no fucking thanks. Back in 2018 it was the best vehicle because no one else had one, and everyone thought that musk was saving the world. Today is 2024, and there are a ton of quality EVs that are equally as good, and often just across the board better than \"tesla\".\n\nLucid can absolutely produce enough cars (current capacity is 90k per year) but the demand for a sedan is in the numbers they currently produce. The SUV and Project Midsize will be their hot ticket items. Tesla's thesis is based on unlimited demand, but they are quite rapidly losing market share. This is why they cut prices to pad the numbers. Lucid may not produce 400k shitty EVs per quarter, but they may eventually produce 150k quality EVs per quarter. Tesla is fading, and this is okay. Maybe they need to refocus on R&D and technology investments instead of right wing tweets and ketamine infusions.",
