The average cost of a new A320 is $100m.\n\nEven if you value them at $25m apiece used, that's still $1.8b.\n\nEdit: They also have $150-200m in liquidity coming in through the end of 2024 due to a settlement with their engine maker + deferring plane deliveries through 2030 has freed up $340m in liquidity over the next two years.",
