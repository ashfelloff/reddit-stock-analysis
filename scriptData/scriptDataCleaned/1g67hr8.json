Mixed information coming out, some people say they'll need at least a week, others are saying weeks.\n\n[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-18/severe-storms-hit-south-australia-and-broken-hill/104487874](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-18/severe-storms-hit-south-australia-and-broken-hill/104487874)\n\nReminder: Uranium is in a 30mil/yr supply deficit using conservative estimates. At most 160mil pounds of supply/yr and at least 190mil pounds of demand/yr.\n\nProjections are also for demand to grow faster than supply grows. I'm wondering if this could be a 2007 Cigar Lake mine flood moment. \n\nDYOR, and buy uranium ETF's for physical uranium (SRUUF) or miners (URNM, HURA) if you buy. Don't gamble on jr. miner's, they tend to be scams. ",

There's a supply deficit of 30mil pounds this year, which grows every single year until 2029 when it finally gets reset to a 5mil pound/yr deficit. Then it ramps back up to a 30mil pound/yr deficit by 2034.\n\nThese estimates assume every single mine comes online on time and on schedule, which has never happened in the history of any mining sector. So this is overly optimistic, yet the deficit still is not plugged.\n\nThere's no way the deficit is priced in. If you want to do further research yoyu should build your own models for supply and demand. The sector is so small that it takes only a few hours. Demand takes a few minutes after you figure out how many nuclear submarines exist under mutually assured destruction programs.",
