We just need to get the nepotism out of SMCI and the problem is it's ingrained. \n\n*Having supplied and advanced the server market for 30 years, it is likely that Super Micro is suffering from a case of nepotism as its core issue. Nearly all of its top leadership is in some way interconnected on a personal level.*\n\n*While Liang and his wife Sara Liu are co-founders, Yih-Shyan (Wally) Liaw was forced to resign in January 2018 due to aforementioned regulatory and audit pressures.* [*Wally*](https://www.supermicro.com/en/about/leadership/wally-liaw) *returned in May 2021, having a stake in a 2CRSi Corporation that conducts business with Super Micro in the high-performance computing (HPC) market.*\n\n*Close family members all work for Super Micro in some capacity and across the company’s subsidiaries, from Hung-Fan (Sara Liu’s brother) and Shao Fen Kao (Sara Liu’s sister-in-law) to Mien-Hsia (another Sara Liu’s sister-in-law). The brother of Charles Liang, Steve Liang, presides over Ablecom as CEO, which is Super Micro’s subsidiary.* \n\n*Likewise, another younger brother of Charles Liang, Bill Liang, is heading Compuware together with his brother Steve. Both he and his wife are Ablecom shareholders. Compuware itself is 15% owned by Ablecom, per Hindenburg data. Even the sibling of aforementioned Wally has a stake in Ablecom.*\n\n*From this interconnectedness, it appears that purported misaccounting comes from sales to Ablecom and Compuware, who then might be selling gear back to Super Micro in a familial self-contained economy.*\n\n[https://tokenist.com/smci-impending-doom-or-a-massive-buy-the-dip-opportunity/](https://tokenist.com/smci-impending-doom-or-a-massive-buy-the-dip-opportunity/)\n\n  \nWhat a shit show.",

If they’re able to match Apple’s performance while simultaneously creating an ecosystem to rival x86, Intel could be in even more trouble. \n\nRealistically what Intel needs to do here is what AMD did two decades ago. Spin off its FAB unit and sell. The issues Intel are having are mostly created by the fact that their in house fabrication process has fallen behind in the era of EUV lithography. And then the US could offer some sort of “hey you’re the only FAB we have on US soil and are majorly important to national security” bailout package for said company. \n\nIntel CPUs coming off of the TSMC foundry are rumored to be competitive again.",

So if Intel was going to be taken over by any competitor, it would probably be one, that had not competed in that sector before. Even then there would likely be a ton of business parts to be offloaded, before such a deal would be allowed. At least when we´re not talking about a complete breakup anyway.\n\nM&A is clearly a busy corner for Intel right now. And despite their price having recovered a bit, they are still a juicy target. But I don´t think, we have currently anywhere enough data to evaluate a possible deal. Rumors have stopped the decline, but Intel needs a lot more than that to actually turn around.",
