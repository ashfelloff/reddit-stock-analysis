  "score": 764,
  "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon has a plan to reduce America's $35 trillion national debt—but it may not be welcomed by the country's wealthiest.\n\n\n\nAmerica's public debt is increasingly capturing the attention of economic experts who warn that Uncle Sam's spending is unsustainable and the economy simply isn't growing quickly enough to keep up with future rates of repayment.\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, administrations over the past five or so years have had to provide huge fiscal stimulus in the face of the pandemic and its aftereffects, but the fact remains that there is a bill to be footed.\n\n\n\nWall Street veteran Dimon has a dual-prong proposal to bring the deficit back into balance: Focus on growing the economy to bring the all-important debt-to-GDP ratio back into line and rebalance the tax system for middle-income families.\n\n\n\nDimon told PBS News in an interview released yesterday that it was \"doable\" for America to continue spending on the military while reducing its overall debt.\n\n\n\n\"I would spend the money that helped make \\[America\\] a better country,\" Dimon said. \"So some of it is infrastructure, earned income tax credits (EITC), military. I would have a competitive international tax system…and then I would maximize growth.\"\n\n\n\nOn a number of these points, Dimon has previously been clear about what he wants to see.\n\n\n\nHe cites geopolitical tension as the biggest risk to the global economy and, as a result, believes there is a \"growing need\" to boost military spending.\n\n\n\nOn EITC, the 68-year-old has also been clear, saying a shake-up would give “much-needed income to the individuals and communities most in need of it.”\n\n\n\n“I would pay for it by taxing the wealthy more,” he told the Bipartisan Policy Center in January.\n\n\n\nFollowing these investments into growth, Dimon continued, would be a \"little bit of deficit.\"\n\n\n\n\"You would maybe just raise taxes a little bit,\" Dimon added. \"Like the Warren Buffett type of rule, I would do that.\"",

The moment some sort of big audit is announced it would immediately be politicized and it will take so many years to get done that you would have to survive multiple administrations of both Republicans and Democrats fucking with it.  At the end of the day, all in audit is is someone looking at something that costs money and then making a judgment call on if it is a good use of the money or not. Who in this country can be trusted to make objective and non-partisan judgment calls on Wheeler something is a good use of taxpayer money or not? In theory that's what Congress is supposed to be and yet we can see where Congress has led us to. \n\n\nEdit- also it's an oversimplification to say that the left just wants to cut the military budget. The left is as hawkish as the right is and the United States has historically been bipartisan when it comes to foreign policy. There is extreme dysfunction in the Middle East and we are actively gearing up for a cold war with China. No one is interested in slashing military spending. \n\n\n What the left wants to do is pour money into growing the middle class, which will improve the economy and increase tax revenue which can be spent on paying down the deficit (in theory). The less money people have to spend on expensive healthcare the more money they have to spend on products and services which is good for the economy and good for taxation. When the government pays for huge infrastructure projects that create jobs, that means more income the people can spend on goods and services, which again is good for the economy and good for taxation. Conventional wisdom says that you cannot spend your way out of debt, however it's equally as unrealistic to think that tightening or belt will somehow lead to less debt. ",

The late 1990s Asian crisis and the shift from relying on the IMF to self-insuring in the region caused an explosion in demand for safe, dollar-denominated assets. This either needed to be absorbed by American households and private firms, or by the government. To keep things sustainable, the government has been forced to issue debt at vastly greater levels than in the early-mid 1990s.\n\n2. Because a reduction in public indebtedness immediately produces an increase in private indebtedness, government deficit reduction is *felt* negatively by everyone, even if it is *viewed* positively by many people. So governments that achieve surpluses in the USA are usually punished shortly after in elections, and by watching the next government spend away the surplus, as happened with Bush II.",
