              "body": "Margins cratering, from 35% to -110%, during the build-out of the Mowhawk Valley Fab pretty much.  With Margins came concern about liquidity surrounding the expansion - they'll have $1B in cash left with all said and done.  Add in an EV adoption slowdown and bankruptcy becomes a very serious concern.  Wolfspeed is priced as such.  However, such effects may be transitory if the Mowhawk Vally Fab is able to take over the Durham facilities production and they shut down Durham, which they are working to do, ahead of schedule.\n\nDon't take financial advice from me, or in general reddit, but I am selecting my options sets at $40/sh price for January if they get CHIPS and it will go higher if Durham is shut down this year, capping CAPEX bleed on an aged-out facility.  Margin should get close to 0 or just ever so slightly positive.\n\nUnderstand their margin was 35% when they had a $120/sh price.  The expansion they're undertaking is 35x Durham production at 60% cost reductions.  We're not even talking about 190% wafer yield increase going from 150mm to 200mm.\n\nThese guys are betting the farm to own the universe.",

HOWEVER, there are half a dozen other fabs, especially huge ones in Asia, that are coming on fast.\n\nIn 2022 WOLF had what looked like a 36 month lead and the EV market was transitioning to 800V batteries (that need SiC traction motors) so fast that it looked like a first mover market so people figured WOLF & Infineon would be the #1 / #2 suppliers .  Thus WOLF trading at $120+\n\nNow in 2024 the EV market has slowed it's move to higher voltages a LOT and WOLFs lead has shrunk to maybe 12-18 months. With the longer time until the demand arrives it's not even clear the demand will arrive in time for WOLF's production so the Asian fabs might be up and running and pushing prices down by the time the market demand arrives, sucking margins out for everyone even if WOLF manages to get high share which is no longer guaranteed.

I believe wireless charging is going to be a big part of infrastructure moving forward to drive wider EV adoption.

          "body": "Short Term - CHIPS Act funding. At the moment, what we're seeing with the stock price is the company being priced for bankruptcy. WOLF has been beaten down and heavily shorted due to their balance sheet taking on large amounts of debt so they can expand their Mohawk Valley and Siler City John Palmour facilities. Once up and running, the company which is already the leader in SiC will have an even greater dominance over the market. If CHIPS $ is granted at around $500m - and that is a big if - then the company is significantly less likely to go under. All CHIPS money must be given out by the end of the year.\n\nMedium Term - Greater utilization of their Mohawk Valley facility, currently only at 20%, coupled with shutting down their legacy Durham building. Doing so radically changes how things shape up on their balance sheet. At this point the company should start approaching fair valuation. Utilization of MV will increase throughout CY2025, shutting down of Durham facility as early as Q12025.\n\nLong Term - EV sentiment kind of low at the moment. EV's are currently the main application of SiC, Wolfspeeds product. SiC has multiple uses outside of EV's, and as applications for the technology are more broadly adopted and as EV's increasingly take over automobile market share, Wolfspeed stands to further its lead in the SiC space thanks to its gamble in 200mm wafer producing facilities. If the company makes it this far, it will be trading close to its ATH's. If the applications of SiC grow and demand is strong, it really could continue to rise. FY2027+",

Because they are grown in a controlled environment, they are nearly pure and because of their characteristics, they are far superior to regular Silicon. SiC \"boules\" are so hard, they have a lot of the same characteristics of diamond....except they are more pure. They have less color, more clarity, and less imperfections. You can actually buy diamonds made out of SiC but because they are so pure, most Jewelers would have a hard time grading them.\n\nAll of the highest end semiconductor uses in the world use SiC/GaN. This is the Military Grade stuff.\n\nAnd there was a flood in a Quartz mine in Spruce Pine, NC. This one quarry produces something like 70% of the highest quality of Quartz in the world used in the Semiconductor industry. But from what I have read, it looks like they will be able to get things cleaned up in Spruce Pine before there is a major impact on the supply chain. And this is for all semiconductor manufacturers.",

They have already spent about 70% of that money and they are at 30% utilization on the Fab in Upstate New York (making the chips.) They have the furnaces running in the John Palmour Fab in Siler City, NC (producing boules) but really have not flipped the switches yet to go into full production (they are still testing tooling and equipment.)\n\nCompany has said they should show positive EBITDA in the latter half of FY 2025 (which ends 30 Jun, 2025.) Based on one of the Covenants in one of their Debt Facilities, it looks like they should go cash flow positive between 30% - 50% utilization of Mohawk Valley and at the end of Q4 2024 (30 Jun, 2024) they were approaching 25% utilization. Their projections were for 30% utilization by Q1 2025 (which was 30 Sep, 2024.)\n\nCREE was a cash cow for 20+ years with the best technology in the industry (SiC), but never really utilized it to its full potential. Wolfspeed was a very small Division inside of CREE and when they decided to sell off the lighting and LED divisions of CREE, WOLF became the new entity and the largest pure-play SiC manufacturer in the World. The new Fabs were built to increase production by 30-fold at max capacity.\n\nCREE had (has) 2,700 U.S. Patents filed with the U.S. Patent Office and all of that technology came along with Wolfspeed. Since WOLF divested the Lighting and LED Divisions, they have filed another 382 Patents under the name Wolfspeed.\n\nThese guys are no joke!",
