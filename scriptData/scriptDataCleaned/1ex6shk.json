I got fucked with matterport when it was all over the news and than crushed, not much money but it still hurt, that's why I exited rocket lab. I got disappointed when the catch with the heli didn't work and I wanted to see way faster development SpaceX style wise. It's much but that's what I wanted to see. So this stalemate, plus the good headlines that it will be a 20 dollar stock till end of 2023 (matterport vibes), got me to back out. Had around 8K in, not much. I'm probably wrong but I really wanted to see improvement faster. Allocated my money to Tesla and got rewarded faster. So I'm really curious how the future of rklb will look.",
