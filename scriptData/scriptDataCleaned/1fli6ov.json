  "selftext": "Got an economics question for you all.  Sounds like Powell is satisfied with inflation moving sustainably to 2%, and was apparently (at least on the surface) so thrilled by that progress that he cut rates 0.5%.  \n\nHowever, looking at core CPI, it appears to still be stuck above 3%.  https://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/united-states-core-inflation-rates/\n\nGranted, headline CPI is more like 2.5%, but that factors in energy, which is notoriously volatile.  All we need is some nasty war, and oil can spike like it did in 2022.  For that reason, I had understood that core CPI is usually considered more reliable.\n\nFinally, I understand that the Fed prefers core PCE, and the difference there with core CPI is unclear.  Anyway, core PCE has been stuck at 2.6% for months too.\nhttps://www.investing.com/economic-calendar/core-pce-price-index-905/\n\nThat is, no further progress seems to be made, and Core PCE still seems considerably higher than the pre-2021 numbers, which were more in the 1.5% to 2.0% range even before the COVID disruptions.\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this inflation situation?  (I am not referring to whether you think the stock market will go up or down, but more whether you agree with Powell that inflation is tamed, or if I am missing something key about the trajectory of inflation.)\n\n",

(The home I'm living in, is made with the great technology of probably early-mid 1800's (the house itself is from 1950 maybe 40's) out of adobe (a clay like material, very good insulator), and apart from repaints and shit doesn't really have any problems that'd require fiddling with the walls. Bricks also tend to not go bad.\n\n-HOAs are designed to help boost home prices, but that's dumb as shit, if you just buy one and live there till you're old. I guess in this bucket could go the weird thing that some countries do where you buy a home, and it's \"starter\" home, and replace it later. So, people moving around can and should also put pressure on prices, as everybody want's (or need due to loans) to sell for profit.\n\n-From what I've gathered, fewer homes are being built, and the ones being built, are more expensive ones.\n\nNow, for those that'd say what do I know I'm not American, I invest my money in the USA markets as I think it's the best place to invest in (therefore i need to be plugged in with what's happening over with you guys), that doesn't mean USA is without fault.\n\nI genuinely hope that Americans will be able to solve their housing price problems, as I think it's totally fucked that you need to be a debt salve to a bank for 30 years if you want to buy a house. BTW same thing is starting to happen where I live, but we had 15% inflation give or take last year (well more but those are the official numbers)",

              "body": "No, you're actually right about a lot of that. If you look at the UK which is where most of America came from. A lot of the homes are far better designed. Slate roofs, Stone homes, made the last generations. The United States basically creates very nice garden sheds to live in with heating and cooling, oh and usually halfway decent plumbing. A lot of things in the United States are based on some very good idea 100 years ago. Even many of our cultural customs. So over here, when the country was first being developed, there is an excess of timber, it made sense because you could put up a stick built home really quick. The tradition continued and the profits have been immense for all the home builders. It's not really sustainable because a lot of the things that go into a home especially these stupid asphalt roofs don't have a long life and they use a lot of resources to create. It's also a lot of lost money. It takes more skill, more time, so on and so forth to build a European style home. America is basically a giant corporation and these are our worker quarters \n\nThe only thing you're a little wrong on is the HOAs. Those were actually designed to reduce the load on the local municipal government. It shifts the burden back to the homeowners to take care of the properties. So you create a board of unpaid people to manage how homes should look and cleanliness and other various tasks that used to be on the county government. This is not to help the homeowner, it's so the government can spend less on things that municipalities used to do",

In a nutshell, The system is designed to concentrate wealth to the rich by repeating the same cycle over and over. Print a fk ton of money, tell the people we need to raise interest rates to tame inflation so businesses can't afford loans and families can't afford to refinance their homes. This results in the rich buying homes for a discount and small businesses dying which monopolizes every sector. Because the purchasing power of the dollar plummeted from the printing, companies have to raise their prices and lay people off the regain previous margins. This leads to your money buying fewer goods and you having less to spend because you were laid off. Less spending as a consumer leads to lower margins for companies. This spiral continues until a recession. Then the fed prints more money to stimulate the economy and the cycle continues. All by design.",
