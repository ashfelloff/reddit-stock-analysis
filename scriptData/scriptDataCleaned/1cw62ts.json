      "body": "For anyone who wants a (relatively) quick explanation without any unnecessary conspiracy stuff: \n\nRobinhood tries to make trading as accessible as possible via things like instant deposit and overnight trading, even though they have to do a bit of witchcraft to make those things work. Their business model relies on low friction and getting a little piece of what you're up to, so they want you there, doing things, whenever possible, at a whim.\n\nThey pretty regularly have to swerve some dumb shit retail/wsb/apes are doing. Like when WSB found the infinite leverage glitch a few years ago, or when robinhood almost blew themselves up lending money to every ape that was buying GME in 2021, etc.\n\nIt seems their overnight market maker has rules to limit their exposure to volatility for stuff like this. For some reason the 2021-and-later crowd sees this stuff as evil hedgie manipulation and malfeasance instead of just laughing that they keep hugging the brokerage to death and causing executives and math guys in an office somewhere to panic.",

I originally bought in at $17 following DFV's posts about how much potential the company had to turn around. I played the squeeze, made some cash, and never looked back.\n\nFrom what I remember the key factor was mostly that Ryan Cohen being a newly appointed CEO would be revitalizing the company's day to say operations. There were shareholder presentations about making the business more PC facing and even turning up what looked like PC cafes in, or in addition to, their stores. It's been a few years, but the stores are emptier than ever. Last time I went to one was probably mid last year and the number of games they're stocking seems to be decreasing even further for more collectibles space. There's no addition to their business model that I can see, just stocking more toys. Most games are bought digitally and the collectibles can easily be bought in places that aren't physical GameStop locations so I don't really understand why anybody would seriously look at this company as an investment. Is there an actual, non-conspiratorial, bull case for the company?",

If you ask how they're going to stop the constant revenue bleed, they'll tell you that the company is becoming a holding company and doesn't need retail revenue.
