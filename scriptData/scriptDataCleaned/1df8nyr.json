This ecosystem creates a high barrier to exit for users who rely on multiple Adobe products.\n\n3. **Subscription Model**: Adobe's shift to a subscription-based model with Creative Cloud ensures a steady and predictable revenue stream, while also making its software more accessible and frequently updated.\n\n4. **Network Effects**: As more professionals use Adobe products, the more these products become standard in the industry, encouraging educational institutions to teach Adobe software and employers to require knowledge of Adobe tools.\n\n5. **Continuous Innovation**: Adobe invests heavily in research and development, consistently adding new features and improving its software, which helps it stay ahead of competitors.\n\n6. **High Switching Costs**: Users invest significant time in learning Adobe software, and businesses often have workflows built around Adobe tools. Switching to another platform would require retraining and reworking of established processes.\n\n7. **Enterprise Solutions**: Adobe's enterprise solutions for digital marketing, document management (like Adobe Acrobat and Sign), and analytics also cater to large businesses, creating another layer of customer lock-in.",

Know who uses Adobe products? All of Disney's subcontractors to start (including the guy that designed the Infinity Gauntlet), and that's just one studio. I don't think they'll take kindly to the possibility of leaks like that. If not for that, I'd mostly agree with you. So I wanna see how that plays out first. \n\nOn a slightly different and more speculative note. My main concern with Adobe in the long term is that they didn't actually create basically anything on their platform, they bought out the rights from the actual app creators. While that's not *necessarily* a big deal on its own, I feel it leaves them vulnerable. Add to that the fact that in the not very distant future, we'll all be creating our own apps with AI. How IP will play into that mess I have no idea, that's on currently non existent gov policy. I do believe that all these media and app platforms will have to actually be top tier to compete or they'll simply fall under the sheer volume of competition. The same will happen to all digital creation industries, it's just a matter of time. Why watch a Hollywood movie when I can just get AI to render my own better movie? We're obviously not there yet, but we're not that far off either imo. What do you think? Pie in the sky?",
