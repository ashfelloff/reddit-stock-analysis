  "selftext": "Boys, gather around for this wild ride. In July, I was down 50%—yeah, half my portfolio turned to dust. I was the embodiment of a Wall Street Bet meme: full of hope, only to see my portfolio bleed out like a stuck pig 🐷. Every day was pain. Just when I think Ive hit rock bottom, I was digging even lower\n\nFast forward, I start to claw back. A little green here, a little there—I'm nibbling my way out of the hole. By some miracle of the tendies gods, I break even. I'm staring at my account thinking, \"Is this it? Is this the light at the end of the tunnel?\" But nah, I wasn't even prepared for what happened next.\n\nLiterally ONE WEEK after breaking even, I’m checking my account... and I’m up 70%!! I legit thought there was a glitch, had to refresh the page like 5 times. But nope, it was real 🚀🌕.\n\nCall it luck, call it divine intervention, but the tendies came home.\n\nMoral of the story? Don’t give up, homies. The game ain't over ‘til it’s over.",

My most consistent and substantial wins are with long dated (low ext but high capital outlay) calls/puts when I have a well researched thesis on the underlying, or selling verticals in a higher volatility environment when I'm less certain.  ZEBRAs have worked for me too, the capital outlay is bigger for a one lot but you can get the most delta for the lowest buying power reduction, Vega, and Theta exposure with them in some circumstances.  \n\nWhen buying options, you have a lower statistical probability of success so you need to put yourself in the mind of the counterparty.  Who is selling you the option and why?  What do they know or believe that you don't, and why do you think they are wrong?  You need a good answer to take on that bet, especially if it is a significant chunk of your NAV or you are doing it repeatedly.",
