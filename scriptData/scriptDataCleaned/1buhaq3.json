  "selftext": "Reported by yahoo news that Amazon quit on the self-check out just walk out technology. Unable to find buyers but gotta love this passage from the article: “While the stores have no actual cashiers, there are reportedly over 1,000 real people in India scanning the camera feeds to ensure accurate checkouts.”\n\nSo 1000 people on India will be unemployed, maybe bullish on moving away form a waste full project.\n\nIt makes feel like technology sometime is more joke than reality. One day we will find out an army of Indian guys writing all those ChatGPT answers one day.\n\nLink to note: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-just-walked-out-on-its-self-checkout-technology-191703603.html\n\n",

          "body": "But order picking is an objectively stupid endeavor to occupy a human's time with almost arguably no alignment with any cultural role to fulfill that human's sense of purpose. \n\n'Here; we paid some other schmucks to take everything on this list and spread it out over 2 acres mixed in with everything not on the list. Then we let a bunch of white trash and their kids come in and shuffle it around a bit while you work. Some of it is only in the store for a few weeks anyway. Now go play Amazon warehouse but without any of the informed design. Good luck, text us if you can't find the right size' \n \nIt won't be long until baking in backend systems to make order picking more logical and cheaper than sending humans into retail space to cosplay kills all those jobs too",
