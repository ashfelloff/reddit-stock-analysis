Tesla is trying to drive in every possible city and outside of city scenario . Please do atleast 15 minute of research and then speak about facts and feelings . There are videos comparing FSD 12 to Mercedes self driving and Mercedes is a joke it had like 50 interventions where Tesla had 0 on the same road lol .

Then they said it's impossible for Go since the openness of the game leads to more plays than there are stars in the sky. Then AlphaGo smashed the world champion Lee Sedol who was considered an all time great 4-1 so fucking hard that even the 1 win he clutched out was him losing most of the game until he made an unexpected move that now gets collectively wanked by the entire Go community as shit like \"a God move\", \"a master piece of a game\", and \"divine intervention by god for humanity's sake\".

Tesla’s target audience is anyone who owns a Tesla and wasn’t already paying, so they rolled out FSD to them with the option to subscribe for free. We don’t know how many actually engaged it, but 2% continued paying beyond the trial period. It’s likely that a majority of people never even bothered to sign off and engage it.\n\nSomething like food delivery has a target audience of pretty much every household. Either going door to door, or a mailing campaign you’ll hit everyone in a neighbourhood or city. Of those, maybe 15% will subscribe to try the service and ~1% who continue paying is the golden number to be considered successful, at least in my experience. Similarly, most of the audience is just going to toss the flyers in the trash without ever trialing. \n\nFSD is a premium service to driving in almost the exact same way that food delivery is a premium service to grocery shopping, so I disagree there’s anything wrong with the analogy. And you’ve kind of hit the nail on the head with the last part. FSD is a beta product that isn’t even close to being fully operational. That’s where this conversion rate shocks me. It’s a massive monthly subscription for an incomplete product.",

Or people once again just being dumb and doing things like not wearing a seatbelt, speeding, or falling asleep at the wheel. \n\nThe number of people dying from a human driver who would’ve been saved if they had a lidar sensor and screen on board is a rounding error. The same is most likely going to be true with autonomous vehicles. Simply using cameras that don’t make all those aforementioned human mistakes is going to bring deaths to near-zero. Remaining ones will mostly be from unavoidable malfunction or safety violations. \n\nIf LiDAR gave the massive safety boost some people seem to think it would then it would’ve been a mandatory vehicle component decades ago. It’s not though. The major safety boost is going to come from simply replacing human drivers who don’t keep their eyes and focus on the road with a sufficiently advanced  autonomous system.

That’s why it’s such a big deal when we hear about safety-related manufacturer defects and the associated recalls. The blame shifts from a direct and personal responsibility to an unknown team in a massive department of a huge conglomerate. Without *someone* to blame, the public has much less tolerance for failure.",

Look up any FSD demo of a Tesla and look the 3d real-time model those cars can produce and display to the user, that's basically the advantage Huang is talking about in terms of visual capabilities. Such a system based on cheap cameras all around the car with tons of redundancy scales very well If It works, problem is just Elon is a liar and Tesla is still far away from getting It working properly IMO, but It doesn't change the fact they are ahead, and they are even flexing with It on the screen.",
