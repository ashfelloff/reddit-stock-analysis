This is literally what we think of girls when they ask us our astrology signs, except worse because at least their rocks dont cost them 12k in a fucking day. \n\nSir you give degenerates a bad name. Yes, quit options forever, you  have no self control or awareness. Most of the degens here know they are gambling. You seem to have thought \"i know every1 else loses money on their line charts, but i, an 18yo not even graduated highschool, know better than these degens. And then you went on to repeat their mistakes to a T. Next you'll lie to yourself you have self control and will think/play rationally and gamble responsibly, like almost every other person before you thought they would be and then failed again, but youll be different.\n\nPut 5% of your paycheck into a roth and retire a multi millionaire like a normie",

              "body": "by who wtf lmao. I know you can backdoor roth every year, but you'd go over the normal limit at a meager salary of 50k. Simply hitting the current roth cap every year of 7k will let you retire with 2mil in todays buying power (aka post inflation. 3m if you also adjust 7k to inflation every year). \n\n15% pre tax is definitely extreme overkill. You're significantly hurting your QoL pre retirement if you do that. I get you can take out the initial contribution to use for expenses like a normal bank account any time, but I feel that's not conveyed simply by saying save 15% of income into a roth. Especially in your 20s, you shouldn't worry about saving 15% or even hitting the cap of a roth. spend that 10% on shit. $2k a year in todays buying power into a roth will end in 900k in todays buying power. and that's the spy route. you can save increasing the payment till your 40s or 50s. Experts shouldn't be recommending people to live 5k+ poorer every year in their 20s when their salaries are at the lowest too.",

But, my philosophy was that I’m only 18 and able to take risks (living with my parents right now, going to college in the fall). I know this sounds stupid as I could have left it in stocks/etfs. Moving forward if I do continue with options it will be a much different approach and position sizing will be a huge factor.\n\nThanks for your comment.",

You are absolutely right about the revenge trade side of it, but it seems like you’re getting too much noise and maybe missing signals. The other comment about position sizing is spot on as well. My pitch would be to narrow your focus, pick a timeframe that you gravitate towards and get really really good with like 2 indicators. Maybe just pick one thing to trade as well, just SPY or just TSLA, and if you don’t see an obvious trade sit on your hands.",
