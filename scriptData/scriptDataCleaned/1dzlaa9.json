Then there are spin off subs like FatFIRE and LeanFIRE, which are different approaches/philosophies about it. LeanFIRE is about saving up the minimum possible amount to retire as early as possible, basically saying you just want to be able to survive without working. FatFIRE is the opposite and I'd argue not really about retiring early at all, it's just high earners deciding how much money is enough because they could all retire today if they really wanted to.",

If you’re picking stocks at random and throwing money at basically single stocks, I think many people here would consider that soft gambling. You’re still likely to win big (compared to gambling) but the bigger the prize, the riskier the business. At some point, you will reach a point where you’re basically working on chance and that is essentially gambling. Random stock you know little about but believe you can work out, cause you figured a system… \n\nThen there are the newbies going way over their heads, going for puts and calls and shorts with way too much confidence for their knowledge or experience. \n\nBut the worst are the ones that need to go big or go home. People that are taking out a mortgage to finance their stocks, cause they need a large payout soon to pay back the first mortgage. People who are asking what the best option to gain tons of money quickly are, cause they have medical debt piling up.\n\nPersonally, I believe if you can’t afford to lose the money, you’re gambling. That’s except if it’s in a reputable ETF or a 401k, but even then I think the money is better out of it than in it. But i also believe it means if you have 100k to screw with and want to throw it into a penny stock or Nvidia or anything really, you’re not really gambling. Unless you end up owing money that you then can’t afford to lose. Then you gambled. For example with shorts. Big wins, even bigger losses IMO",

They just take advantage of insider information that would get 99.999% of Americans in trouble. \n\nBut the game itself isn’t exactly rigged.\n\nI would even say it’s a fairer playing ground today than 20 years ago as the internet has brought a lot of things to people, essentially democratising the entire stock market. You can immediately buy a single stock at market value for insanely low cost and have mostly the same access to information as any razor sharp stock broker at a firm. \n\nThe idiots claiming it’s a rigged game are just sore losers and while I would personally really only advice ETF’s to anyone asking me for stock advice, I would also kind of encourage people to do their DD and if they lose, they lose. If they lose and blame the game, or worse; me, then \nI think they’re idiots for it. \n\nBasically, I agree with you in broad strokes, but there are cracks at the edges of the system that few people can even exploit and certainly not enough to effect the entire picture",

It just depends on the type of stock.\n\nThere are many accounts that aggregate interesting write-ups, or pitch their own. Or communities focused on particular themes. If you're into coal stocks (quite niche) like me, there is a lot of detailed back and forth debates on the dozen or so equities in this space.  Or another value investing guy sparked a months long discussion on a net-net canned vegetable producer.\n\nYou can  look up $[Ticker] on the search to find what is being said, and use this to find interesting accounts to follow. This doesn't work as well for megacaps or controversial stocks. Or often any stock that gets commonly lumped into growth with a big retail crowd. So if you look up $TSLA or $SOFI you'll get a bunch of crap probably.\n\nI'd avoid those 'macro' focused accounts though. They're really interesting for the first few months you read them but almost inevitably, they pivot to marketing their new fund or book or personal trading club which is always disappointing.\n\nI've also found /r/ValueInvesting is way more open to interesting DD than this sub.
