Sure plenty of regards make risky options plays having no idea what they're doing and lose it all, but the average user uses it just like you'd you any brokerage account and just throws their extra money at shares, and those accounts get bigger as users get older. Robinhood's real genius is in specifically targeting young, tech savvy savvy users with a sleek and stupid easy interface. So they bring on 20 year olds with $100 accounts that traditional brokers didn't even want to mess with a few years ago (come back when you have at least $3,000 plz) as loss leaders, and eventually many of those accounts turn into $100k+ accounts. (I'm one of those accounts)\n\nKind of hard to net lose money in the long run buying shares long as you diversify and choose decent, profitable, companies. \n\nHowever, this will certainly make them money from their users' predisposition to throwing their play money at something on a whim.
