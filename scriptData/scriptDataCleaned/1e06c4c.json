And this isn’t a new trend. They’ve consistently garnered a higher multiple than even most big tech companies do. Again, despite lower margins, lower return on capital, and lower growth. \n\nGave this same rant in 2022 and watched the stock fall 30% only to rocket back up 110% since then and reach even higher multiples, so maybe this comment will age just as poorly. But the bubble has to pop eventually imo. They’re not guiding for anywhere near enough future earnings to grow into this valuation.

I don’t deny it’s a fantastic business, but there’s literally no other examples of this kind of multiple expansion on slim margin, low growth company anywhere else in the stock market.\n\nComparable margin companies like Target or Kroger trade neatly in a PE of 15-20. Companies with high brand recognition like Walmart, McDonalds, Starbucks, Coca-Cola, etc normally trade at a premium and sit at PE of 25-30. \n\nCostco has been in a world of its own, trading at 30+ for years and is now at 55 for seemingly no reason.

This allows them to reduce costs and be their own supplier, continuing to provide the rotisserie chicken we all know and love for as little loss as possible. I don’t know if this is the case elsewhere or specific to Canada, but it’s a case study in the lengths they’ll go to preserve that margin advantage for customers",

The amount of growth this year alone is insane. \n\nAnd then whenever you question the stock, people just say “it’s a well run company, treat their employees well, and people like it!!” \n\nWhile I agree with those statements, that doesn’t mean 72% increase in a single year without the company making huge moves is normal. Why don’t we just multiply the stock price by 10 within one month for funsies because people like the place and it runs well?! ~Vibes~ about how people feel about a company shouldn’t be the cost basis of its stock. It can be a factor, sure, but that doesn’t mean it can be valued at any ole number. \n\nI love Costco but its current valuation just does not make sense. And I’m sure it’s only going to go up from here too. We are living in crazy times in the stock market.",
