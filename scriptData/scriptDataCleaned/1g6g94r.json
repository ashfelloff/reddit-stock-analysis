No-one is gonna wait around for SMR technology to be developed and go through ten years of regulatory hurdles and then scale up and go through another ten years of regulatory hurdles for implementation. They want power yesterday. They're sprinting for AGI by 2030.\n\nAmerica has basically unlimited natural gas, and better gas distribution infrastructure than power distribution infrastructure in most instances. How is Elon powering his $5bn cluster in Texas? With natural gas... Using standalone emergency generators, which are topped up by grid power from the natural gas plant down the road.\n\nNuclear is a meme which big tech ESG teams are distracting you with to green wash their plans to build their gas powered superclusters. How are Amazon data centres powered *currently*? With 'clean fuel cell technology' micro grids..... Yep, powered by natural gas \n\nMicrosoft and OpenAI and the rest will be forced to use natural gas just to keep up pace with their competition in the US who burn natural gas and their competition in China who burn coal.",

So between elon and bezos one IS big tech and the other is trying to BE big tech they aren‚Äôt the same. So who is trying to be what here exactly? How many nuclear power plants has elon commissioned to be build for his goal in carbon neutrality and clean energy? Just saying.",

That NFL contract also did not just sign itself. Took alot of innovation for prime to land that contract.
