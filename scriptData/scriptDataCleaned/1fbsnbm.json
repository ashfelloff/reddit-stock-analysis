Its never stated, but a social convention that is held steadfast.\n\nThe consequences of being caught dating is pretty severe. You could lose 60% of your fandom overnight and similar numbers in your revenue. It brings stock crashes, as well as disrepute to agencies managing these idols. The best advice the public can ever give to them is \"never get caught dating\" Simply because, these people would be nothing if they were dating. Their best recourse is really is be lie; date secretly, and have the best of both worlds.\n\nAlthough bizarre, this is the normal human response. Why would anyone monetarily support someone (whom without their fans support, would be nothing) for them to fuck around. Its a contract that simply says \"support my fantasy, I pay you\" just like in OF, but it seems like in the west, most men are just cucks who can't/refuse enforce their side of the agreement.\n\nIt really is just cuck fetish forcibly made socially acceptable. Do not support people who take your money but can't walk the walk.",
