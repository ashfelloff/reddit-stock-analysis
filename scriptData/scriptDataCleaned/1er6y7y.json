Modern-day keynesian economists interpret it much differently, which is what is taught in schools. I could not tell you which is right as there are a lot of factors that affect inflation. Though I do believe the amount of money in circulation almost certainly has an effect on inflation, among other things like supply constraints and the rate at which the money circulates through the economy(money velocity).",
