Even my laziest friends. \n\nThe one area that does seem genuinely weak is the amount of consumer debt - people are in debt up to their tits. Having been through 2008 though, $10,000 in credit card debt seems small compared to loads of bad home loans. I'm not sure what affect, if any, CC debt will have on the next stock market dip.",

Like, lower middle class Americans themselves are screwed, and have been for years now, but that hasn't stopped the stock market from moving up 25% in the last year. I'm extremely hesitant to bet on a recession - it's burnt me once before, and even being right, but getting the timing wrong, makes for a massive losing bet.

Money was printed daily and the notes would be bigger in amt. A loaf of bread would be 5,000 Mark's in the morning and 10,000 by the evening.  It all started when he showed me a small trunk full of cash Mark's his parents brought with them when they came to America.  I still have about 15 of those Bill's in my safe he gave me.

There's a lot, could be Commercial Real Estate, Auto Loan, Credit Card, anything related to debt especially that down in value, even Bank is still in major problem and only rescued by BTFP(essentially a bailout) that has been stopped so rate probably need to go down significantly next year to decrease the risk of Banking crisis. There's also the yen carry trade problem. There is also geopolitical risk that the escalation of war could happen anytime. That's why some people say this time is everything bubble because almost every asset class is overvalued.\n\nYou could also say AI is also a massive bubble. The  investors are rushing to burn money for data centers, when it is ready it would be price war, then they would also replace workers with AI that hasn't been mature yet, reducing the amount of consumers and consumer satisfaction. But the AI bubble wouldn't burst now, the AI services that use third parties like chatgpt probably would go down but AI itself would keep growing, become a bigger bubble, and burst when it becomes detrimental to the economy, that's why some people suggest UBI because a growing economy needs a growing consumption.\n\nPersonally, I think a lot of problems will unravel but the trigger would be the fed cutting rate and when companies earning are starting to go down. I think we're in a state where companies are trying to maintain their revenue and profit margin, some by saving off their own meat even if productivity is reduced by laying off employees or closing stores, this would put pressure for commercial real estates, residential properties, and consumption, this would be displayed by downturn in CPI , downturn in job openings, and rising unemployment. But the official data are hardly reliable so people probably just need to see if a lot of companies earning are starting to go down to see the weakness in consumers.",
