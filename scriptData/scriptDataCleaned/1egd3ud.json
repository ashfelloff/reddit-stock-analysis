What would be the expected outcome of that?\n\n  \nThis is WSB, it's not about right or wrong, bottom line here comes down to money and if lines go up or down or sideways; this isn't about ethics or what a stock should do.  Let's look at TSLA over the past year:  They have missed every earnings report, with each earnings being worse than the last.  They have no new novel technologies and no forseable avenue of growth.  But what happens month after month?  Line goes up.\n\n  \nElmo has a massive cult of personality behind him.  He has countless regards he can tweet at who will continue to throw money at the stock.  Ignore what should or shouldn't happen; in the stock market if regards keep throwing money at a stock: Line goes up.\n\n  \nI have $1500 in TSLQ because this company's fundamentals are so bad, it should start dropping; but I have no confidence in that.  Elmo has a cult of personality behind him as well as many billionaire friends ready to go to bat for him.  Tesla as a company is shit, with shit products and no room for growth sure, but it has a literal cult behind it with countless regards willing to throw their paychecks away because Elmo asks them to.  This company doing what it should, and fucking dying, is in no way certain, or even necessarily probable.  Elmo might be able to keep this monstrosity alive for as long as his heart keeps beating because he has a literal cult behind him willing to impoverish themselves in the name of Testla's market cap.\n\n  \nOne final thing I have never seen a DD starting with:\n\n\"Alright, you smooth-brained apes, buckle up\"\n\nThat paid off.  These DDs always lose money, I know I've been burned enough by them.  The only thing you've convinced me to do is sell my TSLQ shares at market open, cause from where I sit you've basically guaranteed TSLA's line is going to only go up from here.",

China has been pouring heaps of incentives and cash into the battery race for the last decade  and its paid off big time. All the while Ford and GM have been sleeping and spending their cash on lobbying to have tariffs and keep out Chinese competition. They're even making the completely regarded play to retool EV facilities to go back to ICE in NA, meanwhile China is goin to hit 40% new cars being EV this year... (BYD song is 30k for a nice car with 650 km range... It's a no brainer).   Democrats have been doing everything they can to protect Ford and GM as they are deep in each others pockets but it's a short term bandaid. They're fucked long term. China leapfrogged on battery tech making the planned battery plants here obsolete before they even started construction. Telsa is the only  mass producing NA car company positioned to have any success and they already have deals with CATL and maybe BYD for its blade battery. Elon is noisy because he knows all this and he's getting cocky. Plus backing Trump he knows getting rid of EV incentives will sewer Ford and GM and be a temp hardship for Tesla, but in time Tesla will walk away with more market share.
