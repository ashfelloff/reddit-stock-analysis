  "title": "$GES- DD, From underappreciated to Worthy Purchase ",
  "score": 25,
  "selftext": "As someone had posted on the subject of Guess, I started to get interested in the company myself. In looking at the financials of GUESS and the current market opinion, I have strong confidence in the stock being a worthy purchase.\n\nFinancial Information:\n\nRecently they had announced their earnings in which they had beat expectations. With an expected of 1.56 EPS vs a reported 2.01 EPS, and 856.64M expected revenue vs 891.05M reported revenue. This resulted in the stock popping up 20% from $25 to around $31.\n\nWhy Purchase Now?\n\nEven though the significant gains from their earnings has already been shown, the company now plans on making their investors happy. The CEO announced a special dividend of $2.25 per share and a $200 million [share buy back](https://investors.guess.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guess-inc-board-authorizes-new-200-million-share-repurchase). You might say, \"Cool, there is a special dividend, why should I care\", well you should care because of how the market is currently treating the overall company. According to [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ges?mod=mw_quote_tab) 26.39% of the public float is shorted, compare this to other companies like NVIDIA with only 1.26% shorted, or LULU which only has 3.15% shorted whilst having bad earnings, bad outlook, and being a clothing brand. This implies that the CEO intends for this to be a short squeeze. They are buying their shares back, making shorters lose money, making them in turn buy to cover their positions, and then driving up the stock. On top of that, owning the stock won't just have a chance for a dramatic increase, but the special dividend will pay any shareholder hansomely for owning before April 17th.\n\nConclusion:\n\nEven though there are some doubts around this clothing brand, the postition it is taking against those that are looking at the company's downfall is aggresive and interesting. Comparing GUESS to other clothing brands, this is the one to buy, even if it is just for the special dividend. I hope you guys like my opinion, and Id love to hear what others think.\n\n\n\nEdit: Here is my position \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/34d67w5a8htc1.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=599e5b912bd71f0bcc3a6092858e145b35d8047a\n\n",
