Your risk management team at Schwab, Morgan Stanley, would publicly execute a team/brokerage holding 57% on one play. As a private individual investor, you don’t have those rules which let you take big shots at the chance of big losses. \n\nNothing risked, nothing gained. There is not a “correct” answer as it comes down to your personal risk tolerance. Conventional investing reason would say to diversify. It’s one of those things where if it works, you’re a genius, if not, you should have known better and diversified. \n\nDiversification is there to lower your risk although at lower returns, generally speaking. When it comes to investing, your risk correlates with your expected gain. Index funds are the “I want to make solid gains but keep it safe and lower my chances to lose money via mass diversification”. Stock picking is the opposite. \n\nAre you comfortable with that risk? That’s a personal question. Are you comfortable sky diving? Two people will have two different answers. \n\nIf you’re well into the green it’s probably not a bad idea to cash out some gains and reallocate, maybe trim it from 57% to 20-30% for example. The biggest fortunes are made through concentrated picks, but it also presents great risk.",
