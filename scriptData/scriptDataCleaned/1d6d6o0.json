              "body": "Ok.  Iâ€™m gonna tell you, but you have to understand that itâ€™s more in the management, than the setup. \n\nThe rolling part:\nI roll at the end of the day from 1dte to 2dte.  The initial setup is at 20-25 delta, but it wonâ€™t stay that way after the first roll. When I roll I always roll for a credit AND to improve my position. If I canâ€™t do BOTH then it is time to pull out, wait for the market to settle down (a day or two) and then start over.  \n\nThe wings: I buy the 30 delta about 75 days out and roll and reset at around 45dte or so. I try to stick to the monthlies for liquidity. This is very expensive but it really stabilizes things. It often costs around $2k to roll, but Iâ€™ve rolled for a credit before after a big move in the market. \n\n\nMy daily credit is usually $300 to $800â€¦.5 days a week. My average p/l is more like $180â€¦7 days a week. I donâ€™t sweat daily losses so long as I can still roll for a credit WHILE moving with the market at least 5 pointsâ€¦even if the market moved 50 (this is key). When I canâ€™t do this anymore, then I get out. Most days are profitable and losing days are not huge losses. By the time I have to pull out, Iâ€™ve usually taken a $1500 loss that day. Thatâ€™s the worst it gets and maybe once a month. Itâ€™s more than made up for by the gains.  Itâ€™s very stable, really. You have to figure out the nuances of management for this to work. \n\nI could never get 0dte to work reliably because there is so little ability to manage it. This gives you way more ability to manage, and the theta is really not much less. My positive daily theta usually reads about $1k except over the weekend when it drops to about $300. I have about $4-5k tied up in the trade, and about $30k in BPR. Itâ€™s not cheap and youâ€™re not getting rich over night, but so far Iâ€™m over 100% annualized returns.",

                      "body": "I think a lot of people here donâ€™t understand how this type of trading really works. 100% annualized returns for an individual strategy is not unheard of. But it comes with the risk of 100% loss. Therefore you use at least a few different strategies and deploy no more than maybe 5 or 10 percent of your capital towards each one and no more than 40-60 percent of your total capital towards all your strategies.  Therefore you can never lose all your money. If youâ€™re doing very well, then your total annual gains on liquid net can be 30-40%â€¦and an occasional bad year. Anybody who deploys a 100% gains strategy with all their capital, year after year will eventually lose everything. \n\nTHE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH IS REFERRING TO ACCOUNT RISK MANAGEMENT. \n\nTHE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH IS REFERRING TO AN INDIVIDUAL TRADE. NOTHING I WROTE HERE IS NEW AND IS EVEN CONSIDERED COMMON KNOWLEDGE BY SOME. IF IT SOUNDS STRANGE OR UNLIKELY TO YOU, YOU NEED TO DO A LOT MORE READING ON THE SUBJECT BEFORE YOU LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY. \n\nItâ€™s called risk managementâ€¦look it up. I have less than 1% of my actual capital tied up in this INDIVIDUAL trade and a lot less than 10% of my capital at risk of loss FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TRADE in a worst case scenario.  And thatâ€™s only in a COVID panic type event. A typical crash would probably only lose me 1-2% OF MY CAPITAL FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TRADE. Iâ€™ve already pocketed gains over that FOR THIS INDIVIDUAL TRADE. My basis goes towards my cash position.  One good strategy is to bank half your profits and redeploy the other half. \n\nSome of the people with their snarky comments (yes, I know, this is Reddit) are really just showing their lack of sophistication on the subject.  They show their lack of ability to make good gains and/or how to handle them when they do.   Maybe, they should just buy ETFsâ€¦\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: I babied up the language with lots of redundancies to help those whose reading comprehension is lacking. Edits in capitals so that you can still see my post in its original form. I really donâ€™t know how to make it any clearer.",
