And Tesla needs to get as many new households as possible to even begin to justify their valuation; yes, even after the current drop it is still far overpriced if FSD doesn't materialize.\n\nNot sure if other EVs will have the same fate. Teslas used to be cool but are getting less so, given the almost non-existent model refreshes. \"Legacy\" has largely caught up and the only real moat is – to help OP's point – the charging network.
