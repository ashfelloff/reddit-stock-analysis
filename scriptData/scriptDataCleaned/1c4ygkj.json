Common sense shit for any commercial pilot.Â \n\n=>The lionair captain decides to let the FO fly while he goes through the emergency checklist instead, but fails to inform the FO of the fucked up handling characteristics. This is crew resource management 101\n\nÂ =>The Ethiopian pilots encountered an MCAS problem, and they knew they had an MCAS, but they didnâ€™t follow the checklist correctly and didnâ€™t manage their speed while improperly doing their checklist.Â \n\nÂ I donâ€™t mean to talk shit about these dead pilots, but their ability to hand fly a plane was basically nonexistent.",
