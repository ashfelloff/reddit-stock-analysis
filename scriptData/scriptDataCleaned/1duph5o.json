It doesn’t mean Joe Bloggs makes a steady 4% each YoY - it’s not only quite possible, it’s actually probable that if you just had a bear market and lost 30%, the following year you’d technically have a 40% gain (you still lost money, but on paper it was a 40% gain that year).\n\nSecond, and this is a bug-bear of mine every time someone mentions hedge funds in this context, they don’t have carte Blanche. It’s not like they just take the money and let it ride where they see fit.\n\nA lot of their clients are elderly and can’t risk a 40% drop in their life savings. A ton are pension funds which for the same reason can not afford big dips. Quite a few will simply be cautious and will opt for a greater split on non-securities. \n\nIn short, it’s not that hedge funds lack some kind of competency to beat the market, they aren’t even really allowed to try as a lot of their job is less wealth growth and more ‘wealth preservation.’\n\nAll this combined, means that being on par with an Index Fund for 18 months is… perfectly fine. \n\nDude isn’t incompetent, but the real data will only become available over several years and, IMO, one bear market.",
