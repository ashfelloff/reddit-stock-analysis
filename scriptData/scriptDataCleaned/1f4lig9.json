  "selftext": "\"Intel Corp. is working with investment bankers to help navigate the most difficult period in its 56-year history, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe company is discussing various scenarios, including a split of its product-design and manufacturing businesses, as well as which factory projects might potentially be scrapped, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\n\nMorgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Intel’s longtime bankers, have been providing advice on the possibilities, which could also include potential M&A, the people said. The discussions have only grown more urgent since the Santa Clara, California-based company delivered a grim earnings report, which sent the shares plunging to their lowest level since 2013.\n\nThe various options are expected to be presented during a board meeting in September, the people said.\n\nNo major move is imminent and discussions are still in early stages, the people cautioned. A representative for Intel declined to comment, while Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\"\n\nTLDR: Intel has no idea what they're doing and is freaking out. Grams continues punching air in heaven. \n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump?embedded-checkout=true",

The value of the corporation had dropped beneath the value of it´s assets. At that point sharks start circling. Intel is big, but there are Hedge Funds out there, which would be able to buy, break up and sell out. Another possibility is, that competitors have made offers to buy out certain parts of Intel to merge into their business, which Intel would want to prevent. \n\nI probably overlook something here, but the company has 206 billion in assets? Minus 53 billion in liabilities? That´s 153 net worth. It´s market capitalization is where? Approximately 20\\*4,276 billion. So less than 86 billion Dollar?
