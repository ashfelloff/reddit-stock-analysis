  "selftext": "went back to check out headlines from the cisco era. was struck by how similar the discourse is. food for thought. \n\n\n\nCisco overtaking Microsoft \"certainly validates the networked economy that Cisco is revolutionising,\" said Brian Goodstadt, an analyst with the Standard & Poor Equity Group.\n\nMicrosoft, while still a strong generator of corporate profits, generates much of its income from desktop applications and operating systems. While the Internet has boosted demand for Microsoft's products, Cisco, whose routers carry most of the traffic running over the network, is seen as a bigger beneficiary of its growth and its earnings gains have far outpaced Microsoft in recent quarters.\n\nQuite possibly, Cisco Systems, the biggest maker of equipment that powers the Internet, will become for the Internet what Microsoft Corp, the biggest software company, was for the personal computer.\n\nJudging by Cisco's market capitalisation, investors seem to believe that Cisco could become the technology standard bearer for Internet hardware. Microsoft, which was founded in 1975 and went public 11 years later, took 24 years to become the company investors value the most, but occupied that spot for less than one year. Analysts have said Cisco, which was founded in 1984 and went public in 1986, will likely remain top dog for much longer and has a shot at becoming the first firm ever to be worth $1 trillion.\n\n\n\n[source](https://web.archive.org/web/20130116101944/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/20000326/ibu26043.html)",

That's the wall that cloud CPU demand has been slamming into recently, just replacing 5 year old hardware to do the same work much more efficiently.\n\nYes there will always be some markets for marginally smarter AI at high marginal cost but much of the end market might be better served by a lighter weight solution that doesn't require a dedicated multi-billion dollar datacenter to run - someone has to pay for that shit in the end.
