                      "body": "Historically Intel's main advantage was that it had better semiconductor manufacturing than everybody else. Their lead there has been whittled down over the years and they're now pretty clearly behind TSMC and Samsung. They might pull off some shit with the next generation, but odds are it'll just bring them up to parity rather than dominance so I don't see a whole lot of reasons to be optimistic.\n\nIf you look beyond manufacturing they don't have a whole lot going for them either. They've pretty consistently failed to make in-roads into new markets over the last 20 years with their only clear success story being SSDs. Their position has #1 CPU vendor is tenuous at best without a manufacturing lead now that AMD have finally gotten their shit together and started shipping something worth buying. There's also the problem of ARM server chips starting to become more mainstream. ARM servers are overhyped, but they are a viable option for a lot of uses and the extra  competition is going to force the price of high-end server chips down in the long term. Intel are still the clear market leader and aren't going bankrupt any time soon, but expecting them to go up is delusional.",

                          "body": "This is a very mature and thoughtful response. Therefore, I upvoted you despite disagreeing with several of your points. First, parity will be huge for Intel. They have lost server marketshare for the same reason AMD was being destroyed on client all those years. Intel has been two generations behind and this has resulted in less cores, more power consumption, and various other challenges. \n\nParity on node gives Intel designers the ability to stretch their legs again. We can all already see core parity in Granite Rapids as well as rumors of more cache and other interesting architecture elements - primarily because Granite Rapids is in production on Intel3.\n\nBut... And this is a reason to be excited. Intel has already bought all of the next gen High NA EUV machines that will be sold this year. They have already built at least one and are the only company to do so. This immediately puts Intel in the lead for what comes next 14A, 10A, etc. They have executed on 5 nodes in 4 years. Everyone doubted it and mocked them, but it looks like they might just do it. PowerVia and Ferveros packaging are also really exciting technologies that Intel is clearly leading on. The only reason this isn't major news is because very few analysts even understand what it is or what it means for the bottom line. \n\nAnyway, it is different this time. I am a shareholder and have been for awhile, but this is a company getting its mojo back. It's not your 14++++++++ Intel.",

MSFT is the exception rather than the rule.\n\n3. You're not factoring the dividends in that graph.\n\n4. INTC is trying to pull off a turn around. \n\n5.

Many IT peeps who dictate CPU buying for those businesses follow the consumer side and have homelabs to mess around with.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/42-vz71hlJI at 1:08\n\nIntel within the PC DIY space has been really meh since AMD Ryzen, and the last \"stable\" gen was 12th gen (11th being Skylake+++++++++, and 13th/14th instability). Ironically for me the only notable plus from them is their GPUs, despite not being competitively performant for gaming cuz of AV1 encode. AV1 hardware encoding would save video streaming services like Twitch, YouTube, etc. so much bandwidth while being near real-time for live streaming. Currently AV1 hardware has been for the decode side, while live streams have been tolerating the paid royalties of h.265. VP9 (currently most modern AND most supported video codec) has no hw encoding that I know of.",
