Management was doing buybacks but they eased up a few months ago both to build cash and because the stock re-rated. I just don't see as much upside remaining vs. HCC because AMR is production capped. Sure, HCC is not doing the mega buybacks of AMR, but I'm willing to wait for them to finish their project. Then you get a double whammy of higher production and buybacks.",

Even though I can still see an easy double for HCC in the next few years, I think I'm happy with my holdings for awhile. So at $250/tonne, is there a 1 year payback on blue creek? That's insane for a mine! However, like you pointed out, at $250/tonne it actually makes some economic sense to bring more production online, especially if a hypothetical Trump administration eases restrictions....Even then, it will be a few years to bring supply online....\n\nSpeaking of low cost producers....I was looking at CNQ again as an oil/gas producer. Oil sands production is basically a large upfront cost followed by long duration assets and very cheap production. Their breakeven price on oil production is $35 CAD ($28 USD). They were actually even able to stay profitable during covid....I've seen more and more investors starting to take positions in CNQ. They also have new pipeline capacity coming online that will enable them to pipe oil to Canadian ports. Currently they have to pipe oil to the US and get west Canada Select pricing, which is a large discount to WTI. Interesting energy play o watch.",

But maybe it's only 3M tons at first, or maybe cost inflation hits a bit, so I think 1.5-2 years seems like a roughly accurate guess.\n\nSecond, as far as I'm aware there is no other company prepared to increase its (quality) met coal production in the US. If there is a supply shock induced by higher met coal prices, it's coming from elsewhere (Russia, Indonesia, China, Mongolia, etc.). At the same time, mines are being depleted around the world.

T Rowe Price All Cap Opportunities is another somewhat flexible fund that is largely growth-oriented but can dial up value if it feels need to. \n\n\"IBD: What's the fund's investment strategy?\n\nWhite: The T. Rowe Price All-Cap Opportunities Fund is very flexible. It can invest across the market-cap range, as well as invest in value stocks, core stocks, and growth stocks. And that flexibility is a big asset.\n\nIBD: How so?\n\nWhite: The way we describe it to clients is if I do my job well, you can own this fund and trust me to pivot around the market as the world changes. I don't have to be beholden to growth stocks like a pure growth fund would.\n\nLast year, for example, I would have been down a lot more (the fund declined 21.3% vs. a 29.9% dive for peers, according to Morningstar), if I wouldn't have been able to dodge (the downside) as well as I did. That's because we pivoted from growth more towards the middle of the market starting in late 2021.\" (https://www.investors.com/etfs-and-funds/mutual-funds/best-mutual-funds-manager-of-top-t-rowe-price-fund-is-still-pretty-cautious/)",
