Then adding delivery fees if you’re using those, a $5 combo meal is suddenly $20+ to get it to your door. \n\nConsumers are getting squeezed and looked for ways to cut corners. They’ll make their own sandwiches, and pack their own drinks. \n\nStarbucks could be the start of it hitting the middle class, but Starbucks is also fighting attempts of its workforce to unionize. Legal fees, shutting down stores because they prefer an empty store than union employees, has likely eaten into revenue and added expenses. \n\nI would want to see other more middle-class retailers getting hit than just StarBucks. \n\nThough might be a good time to get into grocery stores.",
