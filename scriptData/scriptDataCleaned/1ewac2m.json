  "selftext": "RKLB finally getting the attention it deserves.\n\nGreat vertically integrated space company run by competent management.\n\nNo matter where the commercial space industry goes, RKLB is gonna have a piece. Whether that's satellite building, space solar panels, space related software, etc... RKLB is planning on doing it all.\n\nLaunch is a low margin business that doesn't make any money and no-one wants to compete on launch. What is important is what being a big launch provider enables. And that is to be primed to grab whatever piece of the space economy pie that shows itself. Essentially, if something like space mining is shown to be viable, then whoever has launch capabilities can immediately pivot to that. You can already see the transition as the space systems (non-launch stuff like satellites) part of rocket lab is printing money and is quickly going to overtake launch as the primary revenue generator at RKLB. IMO, it's gonna be RKLB and SpaceX in the end and everyone else is just going to be fighting for scraps.\n\n[Edit: Added positions](https://preview.redd.it/xb850s9f8ojd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce0743f4a79d25012c3adc80f90e09c68fdc79b3)\n\n",

      "body": "Got 1060 shares a couple of months ago. It definitely is a high risk stock. But it has a massive potential. Rocket Lab is second to only SpaceX. In 2020, they had less than $50 million in revenue and this year they are on track to hit $400+ million in revenue (net loss is at $45 million and decreasing). The revenue growth is insane. Also, 2 thirds of their revenue is from building and selling satellite components. One third of their revenue is selling the electron rocket launches for $8.5 million per launch which is about 3 times more expensive per Kg than SpaceX. The real game changer will come once their new reusable Neutron rocket ($50 million per launch) will start launching successfully, first launch is delayed to mid 2025. My prediction is that if RKLB will successfully launch their Neutron rocket next year, $RKLB‚Äôs market cap will go from $3.3B to $6B + by end of 2025. \n\nBut there is also bad news for RKLB, and that‚Äôs competition. Biggest threat is Blue Origin. They are scheduled to launch their New Glenn rocket in September which is also designed to be reusable. Add to that ULA, Relativity, Astra, and all of them will be competing for SpaceX‚Äôs market share. In my opinion RKLB can take the biggest market share away from SpaceX because they already have 50+ launches to date, with the new reusable Neutron rocket their revenues will sky rocket (no pun intended) and a little know fact about them is that 30% + of all global satellites launched this year had RKLB components in them. This means that RKLB will benefit from competitors launching rockets. \n\nAnyway time to jerk off and go to sleep. Peace and goodluck for all the RKLB holders !",
