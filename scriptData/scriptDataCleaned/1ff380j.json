People make the decision to buy or sell based on what they think will happen to their money in the future.  That’s why prices are always forward looking.  The satellite launch was already successful, it’s no longer a forward-looking catalyst that will affect the price. Its history.\n\nIt’s not that people think ASTS is worth less as a company now because a launch was successful.  It means right now, on this trading day, more people that own the stock would rather put their money elsewhere than the people who want to put new money into the stock.  That’s it.

I'm considering selling when/if it breaks even & waiting for a dip to buy back in again. Am i being stupid in thinking it will dip again? Should I just keep what I have at that price & buy in whenever I have more cash? \n\nI'm about 95% portfolio in growth ETFs & buy in monthly regardless of the price. But with stocks like ASTS where I'm speculating/gambling a bit more, is it worth playing more with buying & selling to get a better price? TIA",
