Write them a blank check to be used for high ROI investments (capex, purchasing competitors, and/or making a bolton acquisitions). Leave them alone. \n\n2. Buy stock smartly.\n\n3. Be a lender of last resort during economic downturns. Charge a premium for the Berkshire name and because pretty much no company can move as quickly as Berkshire can with enormous capital injections.",
