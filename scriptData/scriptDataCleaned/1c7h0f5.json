  "selftext": "I bought these on March 8 when it dipped from $158 to $147. I felt like a boss buying 6 weeks out. What could go wrong right? It has to go back to $160 soon…\n\nEvery day I saw the value of my calls plummet. TSM dipped to $140 and decided to stay in that range for a whole month. Theta began fucking me dry with no lube but I still had hope. \n\nA series of unfortunate events began to happen. Taiwan was struck by an earthquake. I should’ve sold then but the factory turned out to be fine. \n\nThere’s still hope.\n\nThen a baldcel decided to crash the market because his order of Rogain from Amazon arrived late in the mail. I said to myself “it’s okay I still got a few weeks left” \n\nThere’s still hope.\n\nLater we got bad CPI or PPI? Numbers and the market dipped even further. At that point I was thinking of selling at a 50% loss but I said to myself \n“The monthly revenue should pump this stock up”\n\nThere’s still hope.\n\nThen Iran decided to fire missiles upon Israel creating fear of a new world war. The market tanks again. I say to myself “there’s gonna be a run up and IV pump near earnings”\n\nThere’s still hope.\n\nTSM has amazing earnings and good guidance. This is it, I can finally break even!!!!!\n\nTSM dumps 5%\n\nThere you have it folks. A series of unfortunate events in the span of 6 weeks. What a ride has this been. Never saw a bit of green while holding these calls. \n",
