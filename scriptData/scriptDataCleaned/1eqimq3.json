Regarding Tesla I did see that it was at 200 prior week, but seeing I was down around 1k today initially with that position, I just wanted to close once I was itm. I did a similar play last week and kept holding the loss hoping for a turnaround which led to a 2.5k loss for the day… so I was just trying to avoid that again. Also I only trade for the first 2 hours, I close before work starts… if not I’m stuck the whole day looking at stocks and don’t get anything done :)",
