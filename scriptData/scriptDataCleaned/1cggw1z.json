Most of their tests work with a capillary draw.  You only need to wipe away the first two drops of blood from the fingertip (or heel in a newborn).  The test needs about 350 uL of blood and you usually draw 1cc. The device works better with venous blood from a tube (3cc) and arterial blood from a syringe",

For instance, whole blood needs temperature-controlled storage in transit, which comes at a price.\n\n> As the authors of a new paper write, ‚ÄúCost-effectiveness is key in disease screening.‚Äù\n\n> These costs are an additional burden for developing countries and poorer regions, where many cancer cases are missed due to a lack of access to healthcare. Because of this, some experts believe that by 2030, 75% of cancer deaths will occur in low- and middle-income countries.\n\n> As part of their analysis, the authors assessed how many extra cases of cancer they might pick up using their dried blood spot system if it was widely implemented.\n\n> Currently, screening for colorectal cancer relies primarily on colonoscopy, pancreatic cancer requires computed tomography (CT scans), and gastric cancer is diagnosed using gastroscopy. These are all expensive techniques that require skilled medical staff.\n\n> In contrast, the authors explain that their approach ‚Äúcan achieve a high level of diagnostic accuracy, even when carried out by local health workers in resource-limited clinical settings.‚Äù\n\n> They estimate that undiagnosed cancer cases in underserved populations range from 34.56% to 84.30%.\n\n> However, if this new approach to population-based cancer screening was implemented in rural China, the authors estimate that rates of undiagnosed cases would fall from:\n\n> 84.30% to 29.20% for colorectal cancer\n\n> 34.56% to 9.30% for pancreatic cancer\n\n> 77.57% to 57.22% for gastric cancer",
