NVDA's main revenue source had always been selling data centers even before the AI gold rush, the cards used for data centers aren't even meant for the same thing as the consumer cards that's meant for gaming and display, plus it had always been way more expensive(The Ada cards in 202 were 3x-6x the price of the most expensive consumer card).\n\n>I’ve seen senior Nvidia engineer link Gronk to FSD on LinkedIn then called out by AI professors. Called the guy’s entire post-grad education a failure. Lol.\n\nAh yes you see some post on LinkedIn and took the side of the professor, a profession that regularly gets called out because they either only know the academics and can't apply shit, or they can't make it because the top 1% of the geniuses took the jobs that's in their field, so they can only take up teaching and make it their personality. Good one\n\n>Nvidia is not an AI software company\n\nIs that so? Then why do companies regularly praise their AI software and business client support despite the ridiculous price tag?\n\nI understand if people are saying it's overpriced, but your entire fake \"I'm a fan\" into nonsensical \"WHY NVDA BAD\"  examples just shows you're too dumb to even belong here.",
