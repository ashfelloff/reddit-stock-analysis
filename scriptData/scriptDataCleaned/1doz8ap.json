  "selftext": "[Investor Day Deck](https://investors.grindr.com/files/doc_presentation/2024/06/Grindr-Investor-Day-6-26-2024.pdf)\n\nGrindr is hosting today in New York its inaugural investor day as a public company, unveiling its plans to deliver on its mission to build the Global Gayborhood in Your Pocket. Presentations by Grindr senior management will highlight its industry-leading performance and user engagement metrics, the Company’s new product roadmap that is powered by AI, and a four-year financial outlook.\n\n“Grindr is unique because it was built by gay people for gay people. By focusing on our users over the past 15 years, we’ve achieved tremendous loyalty and engagement from them,” said George Arison, Grindr’s Chief Executive Officer. “Throughout our investor day, we will articulate the innovation we are planning in order to make our user experience even better and drive long-term growth. We are improving connection and casual dating, which have always been core to Grindr, through a suite of features called Right Now, while also creating new AI-first features to help users more easily find long-term relationships. We know our users want additional functionality to help them better access other types of social connections and to access curated, relevant information and services that will enhance the quality of their lives. Through new product expansions, we are creating ways for users to gain these experiences in the app.”\n\nGrindr will present a multi-year product plan to build out additional functionality in its app. This includes developing eight new products for users to engage with Grindr’s core use cases of connectivity, dating, and relationships, and Gayborhood expansion use cases, which are new partnership-based digital services typically found in physical gayborhoods. To bring this vision to life, the roadmap leverages AI in a variety of ways, including the Grindr Wingman product.\n\nToday, Grindr is increasing its revenue guidance for 2024 from revenue growth of at least 23% to at least 25%. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2024 of at least 40% remains intact. Looking out to 2027, with the Company’s new product plans designed to support the core dating business, Grindr expects to deliver 20-25% revenue growth annually through 2027, with Adjusted EBITDA margins in the range of 39-42%. Grindr’s expanded, partnership-based, digital Gayborhood services, including travel, wellness, and entertainment experiences, are not reflected in Grindr’s revenue outlook through 2027, though modest investments in these initiatives are factored into the company’s long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins.\n\n“Grindr has built a durable financial model that is delivering strong, reliable growth as we execute on our monetization strategy,” said Vanna Krantz, Chief Financial Officer. “Our 2024 revenue guidance increase combined with the longer-term financial targets we are announcing today demonstrate our confidence in Grindr’s continued strong revenue growth and Adjusted EBITDA profitability even as we invest prudently in our product roadmap and new use cases. We believe our plans set up Grindr for significant profitable growth, cash generation and value creation.”",

Just looking at social trends, the gays are going exponential. Those who identify as non-straight have doubled in the past decade to 8% of the population, and recent polls have found 20%+ of Gen Z identifies as something other than cis. Keep in mind most of Gen Z aren’t even adults yet, and there’s no reason to think Gen alpha won’t be even gayer. Grindr is the ONLY app actively leaning into this wave.\n\nI’m invested, and this feels incredibly reminiscent of Tesla’s early days as an EV maker. No one saw the industry shift coming and everyone thought competition would easily catch up.",
