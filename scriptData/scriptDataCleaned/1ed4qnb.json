          "body": "Was actively researching publicly traded disruptive companies that could experience high growth. Stumbled upon AST and their Business plan, partnerships, patents, etc seemed strong. So much of the world doesnt have internet, it seemed like a no brainer to invest atleast something even though there wasnt proven tech at the time. Not everything over the past 2 years was great, they diluted and missed some expected deadlines but they also proved their tech, got prepaid revs, worked efficiently with the FCC and much more. The fact that they are wanting to cost effectively offer internet to underdeveloped countries also gave me some satisfaction knowing it had a true positive impact.",
