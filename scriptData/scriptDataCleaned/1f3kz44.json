      "body": "Its because its a bubble i dont care how many downvotes this gets, even if the company has great fundamentals the companies buying the gpus for AI software cant grow their earnings that fast I mean seriously what consumer is buying chatgpt plus- not that many people.\nMy point is consumers dont want ai generated content\nMost of the ai generated content is ultra low effort like just slamming a script from ChatGPT to some Ai video generator.\nAlso OpenAI makes most of its money through ChatGPT API not from consumers (ChatGPT Plus), Adobe stealing art from their users to train their AI. Anthropic having a 60 billion dollar valuation but again not a lot of people are going to pay a subscription to get access to AI.\n\nWhat I want to say is the only way everyone makes money is asking money for it (subscription) which 99% of consumers are not going to pay right now and will likely not change in the next year or two.\nI know this comment is a bit confusing to read but there is a lot there is to say about how AI isnt worth that much and my comment is too short to cover up everything in detail.\nIts good to use AI to make work easier but definitely not to automate the whole process.",

People invested in it for a year, made their buck and are out now. \nIt will still be a good prospect for future, but won't go from $120 to $1400.
