NVDA is strong because they entered this GPU compute market early for PhysX (math libraries to do physics modelling in game engines) that later became CUDA, they were the first choice for scientific compute then and they've abstracted a lot into their processor architecture and their low level compiler is an actual propriety barrier of entry. This strong GPU compute is what lets them ride the wave on anything that requires a lot of \"math\" so crypto hype... NVDA win, AI... NVDA win...\n\nAll the major semiconductor designers are forced to take quantum computing seriously with the transistors getting so small and the frequencies getting so high, there are already quantum effects of election tunnelling through the chip and flipping random bits. Actual quantum computers will require a classical computer to do error correction or \"collapse the wave function\" (aka actually read a value of probability), so I am going on a wild guess here that NVDA will once again suddenly have the best calculator for the nerds to use.\n\nFYI the math libraries are called CUDA-Q: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/solutions/quantum-computing/)",
