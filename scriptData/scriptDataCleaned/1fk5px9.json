Ive definetly hit some big as percentage gains. My biggest being NVDA before the split. For instance i bough 3 $1000c for like two months out, when NVDA was at $400. I think they cost $30 a piece, and they went 2000% when i sold. (i normally play a date right before earnings or one after.) Its smart to pick a stock with some chance of pop or drop. I had a recent one with SQQQ 30c for like $12 a piece and i bought 3 and the expiration was Jan 2025 and i caught that Japan rate increase flash crash. I think i pulled like 600%. i wont go into detail about the loses because fuck those but yea they happen alot but the winnings have out weighed the loses.",
