Buying and holding the index would have made almost double his returns. This isn't even mentioning the type of positions. If these are all short term gains, they are getting taxed as income, so the percent is even lower. \n\nThis is why very few people can beat the market. You not only have to beat the benchmark index but also make sure your % return is higher post-tax. That's a very difficult task.",
