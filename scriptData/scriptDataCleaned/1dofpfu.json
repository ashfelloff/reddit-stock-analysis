  "selftext": "I‚Äôm new to investing. Been doing it about two months and overall have better returns than just leaving the money in a high yield savings account.\n\nOne of the first trades I did was buying TSLA at about 170. It ended up dropping to 165 or so and I sold to prevent losses. It dropped to the 140s but obviously now it is in the 180s. I accepted a loss when holding for not even that much longer would have made decent profit.\n\nAfter I learned a lesson about patience there, I‚Äôve been trying to hold, but a few choices I‚Äôve made don‚Äôt show signs of rebounding (SEDG is down 20% today and has been decreasing pretty steadily since I bought in).\n\nI‚Äôm still undecided if I‚Äôd like to cut my losses and try to invest in something that will give more returns in the meantime, or if I hope that the solar sector has a strong rebound in the (very) long term and just continue to hold.\n\nIn your experience, when do you cut your losses? Do you have any examples of sells that saved you money, or sells that you regret?",

It turns out I just got lucky and happened to have my coin flip land on heads 5 times in a row.  I don't think there really is such a thing as having a feel for crypto to be honest. If you want to invest in crypto you should only do so if you believe in the long-term future of it and you should buy it and rarely ever check the price.  That is the best advice I can give. What little Bitcoin I have remaining I plan to hold until I am in my seventies (3 decades from now).",

      "body": "It's always a bit of a judgment call. You can have technical stop losses and you can have fundamental stop losses. The thing you want to watch with technical stop losses is standard deviations. So a stock like Tesla has pretty large movements and cutting your losses on a $5 movement. That stop loss doesn't work. You would hit it over and over and over and over again. Like Nvidia is one that I'm a little more familiar with just simply because I won't touch Tesla one way or the other at all. With Nvidia there's no real technical stop loss That's foolproof because it has this habit of having 50% corrections every few years. Now on a weekly term what you can look at is what it's weekly standard deviation is if you're looking at this more like a trade and then stop at that percentage if it substantially breaks it. Here's the problem. That's still a wide range like what we just had! If you're fundamentally bullish on a company it's more of an accumulation point than it is a stop loss. How many people added to Nvidia the past day or two? Probably a few of you. \n\nTo be honest with you the best way I have found to manage risk is to just not buy junk or speculative assets and if I do, like I own some Bitcoin miners, I limit my risk with position sizing. 2% of the account, that's it. No more, no way. If you look at a high dividend bank like State Street. Trading 72. You buy it here, it goes to 68, you don't stop it you add more shares. Rate cuts come, it goes on a rally, it's $100, you sell it, you don't keep buying. Range bound but uptrending businesses like that are actually some of my favorite to trade because you can milk option premium both directions and you have a stable appreciating asset if you buy them at the right time",

Ask yourself, why are you expecting growth? Are you familiar with the sector and feel the company is good? Is there a particular catalyst event you're expecting to positively affect the price? Is recent price action making you feel it will go up? Any of those could be a reason why you think it will go up but it should be something more than \"I hope it does/I want it to\"\n\nAfter that comes establishing the timeframe. When do you expect this movement to happen and how long are you willing to commit to the position? TSLA is a good example because they're all over the place. It's very likely to open a position and end up red but it's also fairly likely that given enough time it will eventually go into profit, though that might come in a day or a year. \n\nLastly based on the previous two you need to set your position size and your stop loss conditions. How much money are you willing to commit to the position? How much are you willing to lose? How long are you willing to hold considering opportunity costs? How much loss are you willing to wait out and what's the point past which you're just better off cutting your losses even if there is a possibility it rebounds later down the line? \n\nDon't be afraid to set strict stop losses. Yes a lot of the time a position may close even if it would eventually go green but if that doesn't happen you might lose a lot of money. With stop losses you at least guarantee that your losses are small and predetermined. The only thing that you should really consider is the average range of movement. You don't want to be closed out of a trade from a momentary move so ideally a stop loss will only get triggered when the price really breaks away from your desired direction.",

In mid-late Jan, there was like a 10% drop - \"I am a f-ing genius, rushed in to buy the dip\"; by mid March-April, lost $300K and got out it.\n\nIt taught me a valuable lesson, max out retirement accounts with low cost mutual funds and save 15% cash of yearly income for emergencies, after that than purchase blue chips names and reinvest dividends.\n\nThen and only then develop a \\~10 stock speculative portfolio that you did a lot of DD. For me, more than 10 are difficult to keep current. Currently only have 6.\n\n**One of the most important things in investing (not gambling) is to have both a downside and upside strategy**.\n\nFor my downside strategy, it is simple - if I loses \\~15-20% of my original investment dollars, I am out and ask what did I miss or were there any over-riding events (war, terrorism, ..). I will continue to watch but rarely do I average down as I view this as throwing good money after bad. You need to remember if you lose 50%, the stock needs to double just to get to even.\n\nFor the upside (makes sure you have a price target based on your DD and actively monitor), I typically sell 1/3 or 1/4 if it grows 25-50% (no harm in taking profits). If it doubles, I sell half and let the remainder ride as I view these as \"free\" shares from my original investment dollars. They become part of \"hold and forget\" portfolio that I only tap if I need the money for a big purchase (car, home remodel, vacation...). Today, my \"hold and forget\" include HON (\\~$30), META ($19), AMD ($2), GE ($6), LLY ($60)\n\nSlow and steady wins the race.\n\nI retired early at 55 - 10 years ago.\n\nGood Luck\n\nPS: I was in SEDG after they purchased Kokam, but luckily got out \\~$240 range after it started dropping from $300.",
