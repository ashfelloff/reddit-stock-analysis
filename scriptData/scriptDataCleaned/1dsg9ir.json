Anyone know what happened? Was no one interested in their tech\nanymore? Did they screw something up? Sorry, been out the stockmarket for\nthe better part of 2 years.",

              "body": "Yeah no. Nobody uses Microvision lidars because they don't exist outside of some basic prototypes, and those prototypes have terrible performance. They may output a ton of points but the point cloud is fuzzy and they can't detect black cars. They have immense problems with pixel crosstalk (blooming). Range repeatability sucks. The intensity image is full of weird artifacts. The beam divergence is terrible due to the small aperture of the mems scanner. Tellingly, their website just doesn't show any actual data from the lidars and instead rely heavily on computer-generated artistic renderings.\n\nMicrovision pivoted from collecting royalties for their MEMS tech to automotive lidar, but none of the automakers are really using them. The only OEMs they \"work with\" had a legacy connection with the struggling Ibeo, which Microvision acquired. As a consequence of the lack of actually selling working products, Microvision's quarterly revenue is nearly nonexistent (five figures). \n\nNo idea why people are into this garbage stock.",
