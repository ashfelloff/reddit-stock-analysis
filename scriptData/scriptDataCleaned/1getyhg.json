                      "body": "Nvidia too big to fail confirmed???!\n\nIn all seriousness I feel as though this is kinda the reason buying or holding NVDA isn’t the wisest decision right now. Their total equity is $43B with a market cap of $3.48T. For comparison, AMZN clocks in at $201B in equity and $2T market cap. By every metric, the company is overvalued, and that isn’t inherently bad, but it’s only good if you’re predicting massive growth. They already have entirely cornered the market for GPUs and massive-scale computing. AI companies have already bought huge amounts of their products to set up data centers. \n\nI’d argue that they have already gone through the majority of the growth we’ll see from them, and that doesn’t bode well for a speculative trade that requires huge growth. This isn’t to say that they’re gonna tumble or fall apart, of course they won’t (AMD can’t figure out how to make good GPUs and Intel is, uh, Intel). Will they explode in revenue though? I don’t see it happening. I find the concept of a .com-esque AI bubble considerably more likely than huge NVDA growth. That being said, my IQ is single digit, so I may just be completely and utterly wrong.",

I got cold feet, got out, and a couple of weeks later it was rallying up and I re-entered at a higher price. I ended up still making money in the long run but it taught me that if I'm confident in an investment and I'm in it for the long run I just literally don't check the market price.\n\nMy biggest position crashed down 20% in a day a bit ago and I didn't even do the math on how much money that meant, I just moved on, by today it has pretty much recovered.\n\nI know I'm not some investment mastermind and I'm not saying anything new but precisely because I'm not an investment mastermind I don't make rash decisions based on short term market performance. I'm not here getting rich or anything but I'm up more than the SP average and that's good enough for me.",
