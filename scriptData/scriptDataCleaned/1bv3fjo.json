      "body": "Maybe this isn't the place for actual discussion but other than $BAK, I don't think there is a better oppurtunity for quick money to be made than with $PARA.  \n  \nIn January it was reported that Skydance/Ellison were looking to offer an all cash bid to take control of National Amusements, and then the second step would be to merge Skydance with Paramount. As time ticked by it reached $10 lows, and then other offers came in and muddied the waters and had acutal bear cases.  \n  \nThis time however, I don't see why the thinking is so pessamistic. Entirely putting greed and bias aside, there is a genuine hatred online for paramounts stock after so many have taken a loss and it's dropped so much in value, but if you have a cost basis after the dip today, or at $10 if so lucky, then the chances of profiting are so much higher. \n\nEven if the bid from Skydance is the same as the Apollo offer, there would be massive benefits. There is nothing that I've seen to suggest that this would be anything other than an all cash bid like originally reported in January at a nice premium to current prices.",
