Given the poor track record of her stock picking skills, is Amazon doomed to fail? \n\nAmazon has pretty poor track record recently. If you bought AMZN stock 4 years ago, and held it today, your investment would be in the negative. Had you invested in PM, a tobacco company, you would be up roughly 60%, after adjusting for inflation, and assuming you reinvested the dividends.\n\nCan Amazon survive the oncoming regulation hurdles, for example Google is now considered a monopoly? Approximately 70% of tech stocks suffer from a permanent 70% decline and never recovered. What are your thoughts. Can Amazon outperform the index going forward?",

      "body": "I wouldn't be worried about it. Look at the company for what it is and not who is buying. \n\nAMZN is a powerhouse. It's turning the corner in profitability and surprised on earnings massively. Free cash flow is set to grow immensely over the next 5 years. It's a leader in B2C ecommerce and B2B cloud computing and is likely to be a major platform for years to come. You get a company with the ability to deliver unique and powerful technologies at a historically low valuation. \n\nIn terms of regulatory risk, I see AMZN as the least risky of all the big tech. It isn't even really classified as tech and is considered consumer discretionary. The biggest risk I see with AMZN is the company has never really cared about returning capital to shareholders and it is so big now that I think there's more likelihood for wasteful capex spending. We saw that in its wasteful expansion into India that it has since walked back. Competition is also an issue - there are more ecommerce platforms out there now than ever before. Alibaba, JD, Temu, Coupang, SEA, etc. - all of them can eat at the consumer side, while MSFT, GOOG, BABA offer competition on the cloud side.\n\nStill, AMZN offers the best experience of all of them. I've been a prime member for a long time and it's just so damn convenient. Between AMZN and COST I can do all my shopping at get nice rewards with great customer service and convenience. I think they have a nice network effect working for them and they can point their prime members at entirely new markets, so I like that I get a company that is turning the corner in profitability so earnings will come to me, but it also has the ability to penetrate new markets, implement new technologies for efficiency gains, or offer new technologies as a service.",
