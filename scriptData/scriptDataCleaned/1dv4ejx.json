LOOK the speculators must be punished. Homes on my street were selling 100-200k above asking with bulky offers. Those people who forced other fiscally responsible people out of the market deserve to lose their homes. If you over paid for a stock the market will punish you. The same should be for real estate. Unfortunately the banks and the govt will not allow that to happen. The only thing that will crash the CDN real estate market is HIGH unemployment. (like 10%+)",
