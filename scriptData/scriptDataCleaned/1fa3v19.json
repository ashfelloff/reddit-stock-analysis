  "score": 1386,
  "selftext": "Seven & i Holdings Co. rejected a $38.7 billion takeover proposal from Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. as too low and fraught with regulatory risk while signaling a willingness to consider a sweetened offer.\n\n“We are open to sincerely consider any proposal that is in the best interests of 7&i shareholders and other stakeholders,” Stephen Dacus, chair of the special committee appointed by Seven & i’s board, wrote in the letter. “However, we will resist any proposal that deprives our shareholders of the company’s intrinsic value or that fails to specifically address very real regulatory concerns.”\n\nCouche-Tard and Seven & i disclosed the Canadian company’s approach on Aug. 19, but had not yet given details of the potential offer, which valued Seven & i at about $14.86 per share, indicating a market value of ¥5.55 trillion ($38.7 billion). While that represents a premium of 21% since the proposal was disclosed, it’s below a recent one-year peak seen in February. \n\nSeven & i told Couche-Tard that its bid does not reflect the value of its business and growth strategy. The Japanese chain also raised concerns about breaching US antitrust laws in the letter.",
