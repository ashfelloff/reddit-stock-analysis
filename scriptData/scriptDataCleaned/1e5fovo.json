                          "body": "Because if Intel fucks up 18A, they're dead in the water. TSM is building US/Japan fabs, and Samsung still does logic better than Intel in the mobile space while existing outside of Taiwan. TSM took Intel serious enough to pull forward High NA CapEx. That's a sign that no one is resting on their laurels. \n\nIntel is high risk, high reward. There's a reason that Intel is violently underperforming over the 5-10 year marks, and it's because it's a mediocre company. Boeing is another US darling and it has incinerated shareholder value by being a mediocre company. The US backing Intel means little in the long run. Intel is no slam dunk, and I would not go around parroting an uncertainty as if it's anything but that.",
