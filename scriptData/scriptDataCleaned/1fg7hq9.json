Every week bag holders have to try and pump Intel and I have to keep reminding them INTC is almost a scam investment.  I still don’t know how they fumbled the 4 biggest cloud computing, tech, semi conductor, QE rallies in the past 10 years.  \n\nThey’ve got a major problem that they seemingly can’t fix. Everyone is running away with better performance/watt and this was half a decade ago and everything I’ve tested is leaving them further behind.    \n\nThis is like Boeing getting gov contracts.  You suck so much the gov needs to keep you floating is NOT a good endorsement.  Just because some mom with 8 kids gets gov money to float her every month doesn’t mean it’s worth your time.  \n\nStill by far the worst performance/watt by far and there are now several players so far ahead of Intel.",

A 1.8nm node will be the most advanced node in the entire world.\n\nThis deal will probably use an existing node as they shift around production - not their 18a nodes.\n\nQuit repeating the same bullshit you hear from other idiots and educate yourself.

It's also hard to get contracts for equipment these days that use Taiwan sourced components, for obvious reasons.  I'm working on a prototype that has a Taiwan sourced board inside it, but that was because of delivery timeframes (48 hour delivery from US based warehouses vs 60-90 day lead time).  The end product uses a US manufactured board, but that one component literally costs 10x as much as the Taiwanese sourced board ($2k vs $20k).",
