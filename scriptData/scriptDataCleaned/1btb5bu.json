The moment is over now -- there was a point in time that it would have probably had people lining up to shank each other to get one, but not now.\n\nMost Elon superfans I used to know are soured and no longer believe in The Iron Rocket Man-on-Mars techlord which isn't a good sign. Tesla is quickly becoming the dirty pleb boomer car around here. Doesn't help that the CT is pretty much the laughing stock of the internet at the moment as well. I think sales are going to be bad.",
