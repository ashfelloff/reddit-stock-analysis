Personally, a plug-in hybrid makes the most sense for me. I think Toyota, which has remained committed to this philosophy, is quietly emerging as the winner. \nWhat are your thoughts?",

Their only option (for plug-in) was the Prius, which costed a lot.  We went to all other brands that were selling PHEV at that time (Kia, Hyundai, BMW, ...), and in the end bought the BMW 225xe, which was a no-brainer when put side-by-side with the Prius: better at almost everything, and also was cheaper.  The Prius was completely out of the league compared to the others...\n\nPersonally I always felt that Toyota didn't really believe in PHEV, their vision was always on hydrogen propulsion.",
