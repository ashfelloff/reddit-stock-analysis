Hold a number of patents, recently merged with another drone company, partnerships with the Canadian government, airports, airlines, mining, native reserves. Still testing but running successful flights and deliveries. If drone delivery technology is part of the future these guys seem posed to be leaders in that field, or get bought out by someone huge.\n\nWWT - Water ways tech, market cap $3.7M. stock price hasn't been doing well, though the company brings in revenue each quarter. The have farmers all over the world using their technology, providing water to plants as needed. Water and food concerns were what drew me to this and I'll continue holding as they continue to grow their business. \n\nEGLX - Enthusiast Games, $18M. stock price again hasn't done well, ownership and direction concerns. They still hold a bunch of big name video game products and I do still think Esports could really take off, but this is probably my least hopeful longshot small cap.",
