I've cashed out early plenty of times and missed out on gains.\n\nBut, come Thursday, I'm already going to have realized gains whether I'm right or wrong.\n\nAsk yourself, how are you going to feel if/when NVDA does anything except for rocket (high probability)\n\nNot sure how much better I can warn you but good luck either way, player.
