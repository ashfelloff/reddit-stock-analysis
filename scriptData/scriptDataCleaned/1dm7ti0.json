  "selftext": "How are we feeing about the upcoming split? Stock has basically cally doubled in price in the past year, and IMO every time a company splits the stock drops slightly at first. To me, seems like a good time for shorting chipotle for the 6/26 50 to 1 split. \n\nAm i the only one thinking this? Im placing puts, just wondering if im absolutely insane. Well… after 6/26, ill see yall here with wither a huge gain or loss. Good luck everyone",
