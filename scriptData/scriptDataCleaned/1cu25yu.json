      "body": "Thanks for your submission!\n\nr/WallStreetBets is ultimately a community about making money through trading, and our conversations should shift around that.\n\nPolitics are fundamentally intertwined with making money, and political actions almost always have an impact on financial markets.\n\nStill, we need to make sure that when we have these discussions, we're explicitly calling out the financial impacts of the politics we're discussing. Otherwise, the conversation can very easily veer off into flamewars and boring, unproductive, discussion.\n\nHere's an example of a political comment that doesn't offer any value:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. What a fucking idiot\"\n\nNow compare it to this:\n\n* \"I hate this new green policy from the Biden administration. It threatens the profit margins of oil companies because they will need to expand their OpEx. I have calls on Shell that are going to get decimated at open.\"\n\nThe latter is significantly more interesting and offers a great jumping point into market related discussion.\n\nPut succinctly: If you choose to start or engage in arguments about libtards or Nazis instead of making fun of their bad SPY long then you're in the wrong place and we'll show you the door.\n\nIf you're not sure if your content is political, it probably is, and there's probably a better way to post it without making things weird.\n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

Biden overspent after Trump already overspent. Inflation was guaranteed after covid but certainly Biden made it worse. Took too long to lower rates and tried to pretend like inflation was transitory... that was bullshit then and we all knew it. And a lot of inflation due to war in Russia. Biden has been shit for foreign policy. Afghanistan, Ukraine, now proxy war with Iran... all this added to inflation. Giving Biden credit for anything is kind of a joke. Even his green initiatives are shit. Billions spent on charging infrastructure, given to shit companies that have barely made any chargers. Could have given 1/10th of the same money to Tesla and had the same result but no, let's give the shitty failing charging companies money!",

You can put your original statement in there and it would mean the same thing, that‚Äôs what paraphrasing means.\n\nI was making fun of the original comment because whenever someone brings up low interest rates and $2 gas they‚Äôll counter it to say ‚Äúthe president doesn‚Äôt dictate the economy‚Äù. Which I agree with. I was just making fun of the people who think the economy is based on which party is in office which is what this whole post is trying to portray. \n\nI don‚Äôt think presidents or which party is in control has anything to do with the economy to significantly matter but it‚Äôs just funny when I see people flip flop depending on who they‚Äôre talking about. Anything economically good that happened under Trump wasn‚Äôt because of him but now those same people are giving Biden credit for a recovering economy which would‚Äôve happened regardless of who was in control.",
