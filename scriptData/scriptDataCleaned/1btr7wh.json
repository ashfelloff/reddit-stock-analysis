Couldn't even view the Navis model unless you were on-site hidden away. The labor wasn't the problem at this fab. Some of the top semi-conductor talent in the country were overseeing and involved in this project.\n\nSo many reasons TSMC had trouble but it definitely wasn't caused by the labor despite what they spouted off to the media. Most of the qualified hands were turning down the positions on-site because of how shitty it was compared to all of the other work available in the valley already.",

They‚Äôll most likely be limiting wafer starts to under 500 per week on the tools they have and let the partial lots sit while construction continues.  As a percentage of total volume, this fab isn‚Äôt going to account for more than 15% overall wafer outs, and that‚Äôs at max capacity which is still years away. \n\nThis isn‚Äôt a pivotal moment and is priced in since the schedule had some flexibility to it. Source - I work down the road for team blue.\n\nEdit - tsmc investors call two months ago cites 2027 or 2028 for the fab to be online. I also see that they might not install 3nm and would go 4nm, which would explain why they could pull the date in.",
