  "title": "What if ‚Äúvolatile food and gas prices‚Äù remain elevated?",
  "score": 54,
  "selftext": "Even if Fed policy works, and prices for goods come down they are not in a vacuum. The reason people might ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the pressure of a looming recession despite better inflation readings may be because essential expenses remain inflated. I wonder if deflation in the current environment (things becoming wayyy cheaper) would even matter if the majority of your income is going toward regular expenses. \n\nToday, I bought a bottle of olive oil that was 50%-300% more expensive than I have been used to in the pre pandemic era. Compound that on housing crises/bubbles, where people think they need to save every Penny to afford a home.\n\nThat feeling is enough to sway me from buying an 80‚Äù TV for $600 or even $500, and to consider such a purchase very frivolous. I find myself surfing Facebook marketplace place and thinking, man $200 for X, that‚Äôs way too much.\n\nCan this mindset become a self-fulfilling prophecy with respect to the recession? Could this lead to some sort of deflationary spiral? Have there been examples of bolstered consumer spending without having some meaningful deflation on essential goods?\n\nEdit: it‚Äôs clear I am conflating ‚Äúlower inflation readings‚Äù with disinflation. High food and gas and essential goods will remain elevated, but *should not increase* at such a high rate as per lower inflation readings. How do you think this will affect consumer psyche? How has it affected yours? I used to be a frugal consumer, and now I‚Äôm 10x worse because I‚Äôm reminded every grocery bill, how expensive it is to survive.",
