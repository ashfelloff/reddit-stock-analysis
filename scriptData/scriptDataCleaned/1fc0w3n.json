  "selftext": "For a long time I have believed that the AI hype was unfounded, due to its products being unprofitable. At the same time real estate is overvalued and thousands of homes are on sale for unsustainable prices. A move to AI is merely a cost cutting measure and will decrease jobs and thus spending power hurting the economy. Lastly the deficit is so high that a bailout is infeasible due to hyperinflation.\n\nFor these reasons I am $50,000 ALL IN on some sort of major market pullback.\n\n  \nupdate 1: (9:21 PM) futures market seem to be going up but barely\n\nUpdate 2: (7:45 AM) only up 0.8% I’ll live and hold till at least inflation data, maybe put like 5k towards oracle puts\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hfsla8vnwlnd1.png?width=886&format=png&auto=webp&s=f771e28420cf2e39b3ab440815fdb1d9ecdf154c",

Price pressure is happening, and we are heading into the season where inventory typically builds, however, the summer did not relieve any of the inventory, in fact it stacked at 100 percent year over year. Austin, TX, same way, Georgia is seeing inventory go up. Dallas, Phoenix, etc. All fo them seeing significant inventory levels.\n\nNow, is this enough to cause a \"crash\" that remains to be seen. However, let's not forget how the GFC actually went down. House prices rose rapidly under heavy speculation. Then around 2005-06 prices plateaued and inventory exploded. Those that coud get out were lucky, others got stuck with depreaciating assets. To the point that some people walked to conserve captial  instead of hloding to a devaluing asset. This caused a bunch of loans to go tits up on the banks. That seeped into broader financial markets. Then in 2007 it became known all the bad loans that were on the books. The stock market took notice. We did not need a widespread calamity to kick off a crash. All we need is depreciating asstes in the RE sector. Where do you think all this inventory is coming from? It is not from people who live in their house, it is coming from investors. They are trying to get out and not stuck holding the bag. \n\nThe only question is, did these speculative loans hit wall street? Yes they did. Through \"Private Label MBS\". Is it enough to cause headaches, it is possible since we have seen a major rise in Non-QM loans.\n\nIn short, there is a lot of downward pressure on housing right now.",
