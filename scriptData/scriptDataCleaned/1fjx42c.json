I took business loan and pay interest like all other business owners.\n\nNEVER HAVE I DEMAND FOR MONEY FROM OTHER PPL.

In return you should get your needs met. Too many honest people work 40 and keep falling behind while crooks at the top end up with a golden parachute. We keep trying to motivate for the 1% most successful while breaking the bottom 60%. The Waltons should be rich. They shouldn't control as much wealth as the bottom half combined. Elon can be rich, but he isn't rich because he's smart, more so because he is ruthless. I don't value that. We should all be aspirational, but also realistic.\n\nSure, it's OK for people to play the market and make money. Just don't act like it adds value to society. When the factories close, the community suffers. When the day trader quits, no one notices. I know where true value lies.",
