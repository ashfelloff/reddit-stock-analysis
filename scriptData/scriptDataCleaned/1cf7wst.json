Right now, they aren't taxing themselves hardly at all, due to their greed, but the whole thing will collapse on them if they aren't careful.

During the war, the English crown printed high-interest rate bonds like there was no tomorrow, and the baron deduced that when the war ends, these bonds will not be issued anymore. Basically he bought high-interest rate debt with enormous leverage and sold it two years later, when the debt reduction measures took effect: interest rates declined. He realised a then immense 40% profit on this single trade in a comparatively short time ( [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild\\_family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family) ).\n\nThe present situation is reminiscent of that time. It is one thing that government bonds are issued, but there are actually buyers for that debt, If and when debt reduction begins, countries will stop issuing bonds, the interest rate will decline.",

A moment later he was on his way to London (beating Wellington's envoy by many hours) to tell the government that Napoleon had been crushed: but his news was not believed, because the government had just heard of the English defeat at Quatre Bras. Then he proceeded to the Stock Exchange. Another man in his position would have sunk his work into consols [bank annuities], already weak because of Quatre Bras. But this was Nathan Rothschild. He leaned against \"his\" pillar. He did not invest. He sold. He dumped consols. ... Consols dropped still more. \"Rothschild knows,\" the whisper rippled through the 'Change. \"Waterloo is lost.\" Nathan kept on selling, ... consols plummeted – until, a split second before it was too late, Nathan suddenly bought a giant parcel for a song. Moments afterwards the great news broke, to send consols soaring. We cannot guess the number of hopes and savings wiped out by this engineered panic.",

The result of this very nice but misguided policy is engrained poor economic and productivity growth resulting in the current situation of a tax take deficit despite record tax burden levels and record low public investment.\n\nThe reality is that we need to let more people start fending for themselves again a little more and instead spend that money on building new schools and hospitals, fixing the roads and trains, things that are actually useful.\n\nNote this is nothing to do with current defence, school, police, NHS etc spending which have all remained pretty consistent at about 60% of gov spending). It's purely the cost of caring for people who can't or won't work that has skyrocketed.

This probably means we'll have to go back to trade blocs again but that's kinda happening anyway. My guess is we'll see these two changes over coming decades.",
