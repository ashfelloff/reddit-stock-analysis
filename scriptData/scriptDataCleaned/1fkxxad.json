  "selftext": "Mercedes cuts FY guidance by 25%. First of many profits warnings to come..\n\nMBG has cut FY24 guidance today at 9pm European time. Reducing FY24 guidance by over 25% with FY EBIT margin from 10-11% to 7.5%-8.5%. Main driver is weakness is China where MB gets lots of its profit.\n\nI think this is the first of many profit warnings we will get this September from Autos and Luxury companies. China is very weak and consumer to buying big ticket items globally. Autos is specially at risk from inventory..\n\nAs always germany leads the way on profit warnings given their strict reporting requirements:\n\nWhat other stocks could profit warn: Autos like VW or BMW. Semi aspirational luxury like Hugo Boss or Kering. Hermes and Ferrari probably ok for now.\n\nfull release from MBG below:\n\nMercedes-Benz Group AG adjusts full-year guidance for the year 2024 based on current market outlook\n\nStuttgart, Germany - As a result of recent developments, Mercedes-Benz Group AG today adjusted its earnings outlook for the year 2024 for Mercedes-Benz Cars and Mercedes-Benz Group.\n\nThis was triggered by a further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment, mainly in China. GDP growth in China lost further momentum amid weaker consumption as well as the continued downturn in the real estate sector. This affected the overall sales volume in China including sales in the Top-End segment. Overall, the sales mix in the second half of 2024 is expected to remain unchanged versus the first half, and therefore weaker than originally expected.\n\nAdditionally, the second half of 2024 is expected to be impacted by various valuation adjustments. Furthermore, the dynamic pricing environment is expected to continue.\n\nTherefore, Mercedes-Benz Group has updated its full-year outlook:\n\nMercedes-Benz Cars now expects the adjusted Return on Sales to be between 7.5% and 8.5% (previously: 10% to 11%). This implies an expected adjusted Return on Sales of around 6% for the second half of the year. The valuation adjustments are expected to have an impact of around 1 percentage point in the second half of this year.\nMercedes-Benz Vans’ expected adjusted Return on Sales (14% to 15%) and Mercedes-Benz Mobility’s expected adjusted Return on Equity (8.5% to 9.5%) remain unchanged.\nMercedes-Benz Group’s EBIT is now expected to be significantly below the prior year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).\nFree cash flow of the industrial business for the Mercedes-Benz Group is now expected to be significantly below the prior-year level (previously: slightly below the prior-year level).\n",

Personally I am wondering, if we may be in the midst of a global economic crisis, that just didn´t happen. Technically after events like the Pandemic and the Inflation/supply chain interruption, you would expect a recession after a while, when the aftershock and ripple effects fully come to bear (pun inteded). \n\nSomehow it would appear, despite all the problems we still face, we managed to avoid that result this time. China has opened significantly later and thus is hit significantly harder now though. Europe ground basically to a hold, but still has the head above the water. The US economy is strong. Britain got hit, but mainly from gnawing off it´s own leg through Brexit and it doesn´t seem to enter a full crisis either (the results are not in yet, given what a disaster in infrastructure and finance the tories left).\n\nIf we come out of this without a major global downturn, future generations will study, what we got right. And probably, how we fucked it up later somehow. But that´s a different book.",
