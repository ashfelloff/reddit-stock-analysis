The Indian team had hundreds of mockups, all the code written, and nothing worked properly or matched what the client actually wanted. They had about 100 offshore assets who spent almost a year on this project.\n\nI re-wrote like 80% of the code myself in a couple months. They fought me bitterly, and the manager of the project needed to override their \"technical lead\" a dozen times to actually get them to use the new code that actually worked. If they just hired one developer, one designer, one analyst from the US, the project could have gone from start to finish in about 3 months and been under budget. Instead it was like 50% over budget with all the cost savings of the offshore team.",
