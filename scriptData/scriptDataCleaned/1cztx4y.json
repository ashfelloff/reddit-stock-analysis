You can end up with a potentially random number for assigned contracts the next day, while any options you bought to cover are worthless, leaving you to the mercy of monday open. People have lost accounts and homes to shit like this, so just close the positions before close on any ATM expiry\n\n*Edit: it's not 4:15 I was confused with the index trading times for CBOE like XSP. Option holders have until 5:30 Eastern to excersize their options",
