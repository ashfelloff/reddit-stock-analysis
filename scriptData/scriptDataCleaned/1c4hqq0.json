      "body": "Alternatively nothing is really priced in, stock prices fluctuate independently of fundamentals for long periods of time as investors exhibit irrational exuberance or despondence over different stocks over-predicting their long term growth/decline, meaning reading minutiae of daily news is basically useless as the market could be completely indifferent to the news or over-react and correct in a week, and you can't predict what will happen in advance.\n\nWhen I read of the (now apparently finished) Iran-Israel... weekend war? What's that even? I had zero idea whether my portfolio would go up, down, or sideways on today's open.\n\nSo, efficient market hypothesis is not actually necessary if you need to justify to yourself spending time on WSB instead of, learning something about the companies who's 1DTE calls you're holding overnight.",

Fooled by randomness is still a favorite book of mine, but that guy lives in another universe of his own, and I don't mean that like a compliment.",

          "body": "Effecient market hypothesis says nothing about whether the information is priced in correctly or accurately or in the right way or magnitude -- just that it's known and priced in.\n\nIn other words, the effects of it, as judged by market participants, is already reflected in the price. Whether their judgment is right or wrong, and the magnitude of it is accurate or not, is an entirely different story. The hypothesis makes no claims on that.",
