In a word: taxes.\n\nBuffett thinks paying taxes now on the massive capital gain for Berkshire's Apple shares is a smart move.\n\n\"We are paying a 21% federal rate on the gains we're taking on Apple. And that rate was 35% not that long ago, and it's been 52% in the past,\" he told the audience in Omaha at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting. \"I would say with the present fiscal policies, I think that something has to give, and I think that higher taxes are quite likely.\"",
