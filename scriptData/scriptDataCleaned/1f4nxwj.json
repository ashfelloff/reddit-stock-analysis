Just opening this position and ignoring it would let me focus on life for 2 years. If I win, I win, if I lose I take it as a lesson and stick to index funds and term deposits in future.\n\nJust interested in people's thoughts, I am 99% likely to open this position and post it as a YOLO.",

So far the landing has been very soft. Japan has been floating along with much higher deficits and debt than the US for decades, without many structural and financial advantages that we enjoy. \n\nBetting on a crash that will make puts print over the next two years based on this or that indicator in the face of falling interest rates during that time is probably going to be a money-loser.",

              "body": "That's mostly the power of hindsight. You are going back in time, finding peaks, and then measuring performance relative to that peak. The problem is, looking forward, we have no idea when those peaks will occur. Sure it might be 2025. But it could also be 2032 in which case OP is screwed with his approach and will lose that options position, and all the premium, every year. The chance that OP would have timed 2000 or 2008 exactly right is very low. And there's a big cost to pay in options premiums as well as the position finishing out of the money every time you're wrong. So by the time it finally works he'll be deep in the hole if he even has anything left to invest.",

One significant issue is that many large companies derive substantial profits from international markets, which could make GDP a less relevant measure. \n\nAnother current concern is that a few dominant mega-cap stocks have driven most of the market's gains over the past 18 months. This situation implies that the indicator might overlook the fact that many stocks are still inexpensive compared to historical norms, while a small number are excessively costly.\n\nfull credit to the source: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e0wjbq/buffett\\_indicator\\_hits\\_historic\\_high\\_outdated/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1e0wjbq/buffett_indicator_hits_historic_high_outdated/)",
