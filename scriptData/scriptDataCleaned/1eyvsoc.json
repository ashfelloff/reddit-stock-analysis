They also had two major purchases from one of the founders Vivek, and they are signing up accounts for SaaS through their Counterpart Health platform. \n\nKind of seems like institutions are jumping on board. Also short interest has dropped dramatically in the last two weeks. Went from 35 million shares down to around 23 million.",
