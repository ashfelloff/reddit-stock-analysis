Look for that to be a growing business segment. Then when you want to train the AI for the robots to move and think that's all Nvidia. So for robot stocks Nvidia is well positioned.\n\nARM is well positioned because for all those Jetson Nano's they are built with ARM chips and ARM chips is also crucial to robotics. Can't have your robot getting hot. \n\nDirect sales robot stocks you probably won't see fruits of labor that are commercialized until end 2024 - end 2025.\n\nIf I could get into OpenAI right now I would sell my wife and kids and put everything I have into that. But you can't. Figure AI is another great company. Tesla is making Optimus but it's wrapped in a horrific car company right now so...\n\nOptions are limited but there is Nvidia. And ARM.",
