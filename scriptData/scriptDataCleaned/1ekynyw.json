At the time, CA was the only state who had a market. Also Tesla got two rounds of buyer incentives (or was it 3... i cant remember) even after they ran out the 1st time. They also received buyer credits from the state of CA on top of it. They also received various grants.\n\nPoint here, is that this was the 1st mover advantage. Its doubtful that Lucid will get similar treatment from anyone at this point in time. They need to rely on Saudi funding which is not a grant, but rather it comes in the form of debt or more dilution on shareholders.\n\nAlso the GM building was most certainly not empty. It was an operational factory and Tesla got the equipment for pennies on the dollar. If memory serves me, they only bought part of the factory while Toyota bought the other portion. They then entered into a deal with Toyota to make stuff for them. Later Toyota sold their share of the factory to Tesla, also for pennies on the dollar.",
