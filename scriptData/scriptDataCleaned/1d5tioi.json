  "selftext": "We know some smart investors do quantitative analysis, and they just barely have an edge. Most can't even beat the S&P500.\n\nAs a person whose job isn't related to finance, I want to ask, do we really have to go deep into the company's finances? I don't want to read balance sheets 12 hours a day (let's assume I can understand) so 55 out of 100 of my stock picks succeed. The big money (I don't want to say smart money) already takes advantage if there is an opportunity to arbitrage. This is not an \"everything is priced in\" post.\n\nI think intuition is the most important thing when picking a stock. You don't have to dig so deep either. Everybody knew what Tesla was in 2015. The company was not profitable back then but people could see the potential. I even considered investing but I was broke back then. According to the quant gang Tesla was overvalued and all, even back then. The people who have followed their gut feeling and stay invested have won. The same thing happened with NVIDIA recently. People who could see the AI opportunity first jumped on the train. I couldn't. Technically, the moment people learn Gen AI is powered by NVIDIA GPUs, the opportunity is up for grabs. Some knew that earlier, some people later. It depends on one's expertise.\n\nBasically what I'm trying to say is, I want to ignore all the noise and buy the companies I believe in. Some experts say \"Don't fall in love with the stock\". Well, why not though? We work for a company for decades, people own companies for a lifetime, what's so different with stocks? I think that's a trader mindset. I don't want to buy a stock that I don't want to own for at least a decade. I want to own the company at that point.\n\nEdit: There is a reason I used the word intuition, not \"feelings\". I am talking about the ability to recognize the catalysts beforehand. That's why quantitative is useless at that point. Because you are investing in the possibility of the catalyst, not the financial sheets. Also, that's why I gave Tesla an example. For quantitative analysis, Tesla was a fruitless company that may or may not break even until it did.\n\nEdit 2: Someone in the comments implied I meant research over intuition. Research is not just quantitative analysis or technical analysis. You can and you should know about the business, the sector, and the market conditions, global conditions. Without knowledge you can't have genuine intuition. I just wanted to point out that overglorification of quantitative analysis is useless and in this decade tens of thousands of smart people does it professionally and even for them it may or may not work out. At this point, having a good intuition about a business to do well in the long-term is more important. Not just a certain company, it can also be a leader (like a CEO) or a catalyst or a sector. Not just stocks, it could also work for commodities, oil and precious metals.\n\nEdit 3: Either I couldn't express my thoughts as I should or some of you lack of comprehension abilities. Druckenmiller's first success is literally his intuition when he bought oil&defense companies after Shah of Iran went under. You can find good opportunities using your intuition, the moment it reflects to the balance sheets it is already too late.",
