  "title": "PayPal Back From The Dead?",
  "score": 35,
  "selftext": "Paypal was at one point down 83% from it's all time high in 2021. And let's be frank it deserved to come down like every other over-valued tech stock. At one point it was trading at 67 price to free cash flow. Just absurd.\n\n\n\nFrom the huge decline to now, the revenues of PayPal have consistently grown like clock work.\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the year their Free cash flow started growing like crazy. And sure, it's already shown up in their price a bit. Maybe this is priced in already.\n\n\n\nBut I doubt it because it's trading at the lowest multiple it's probably had in its entire history.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3y899qe371qd1.png?width=2336&format=png&auto=webp&s=69226731267662cd8ce8a63108f5eb6ab073d15d\n\nThe stock appears to be undervalued, even as its revenue continues to climb to all-time highs. With the new CEO focusing on improving operations and reducing stock-based compensation, there seems to be a renewed effort to create shareholder value.\n\n\n\nThe last point I'll say is that even though their stock has gone up like 30% this year it's still trailing far behind free cashflow growth and Q4 is a big one for payment platforms.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/aq9o1hr771qd1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea8badf99c44b0421bdec6288d5113868cde51d9\n\n",
