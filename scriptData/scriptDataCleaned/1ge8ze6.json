  "score": 628,
  "selftext": "NVIDIA and Elon Musk's xAI are ramping up their colossal supercomputer, *Colossus*, to an unprecedented 200,000 Hopper GPUs—doubling the current 100,000 GPU setup in a scale never before seen. Leveraging NVIDIA's advanced Spectrum-X Ethernet networking for seamless data throughput and zero packet loss, Colossus has already set records, becoming operational in just 122 days. As xAI’s Grok large language models expand, the additional 100,000 GPUs will enable faster, more efficient AI model training, accelerating xAI’s generative AI solutions for consumers and enterprises alike.\n\n[https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/spectrum-x-ethernet-networking-xai-colossus)\n\n",

This has been proven many times in academic papers.\n\nThe main takeaway here is that AI cannot reason through situations that do not follow previously trained patterns.\n\nThe people leading tech companies are not computer science PHDs. They have MBAs, or are college dropouts that founded their company. So they are making huge decisions on AI investment without understanding the underlying science.\n\nAi has some valid uses, but the business world is vastly overestimating it's potential. They are mostly just copying each other trying to compete for as many gpus as they can order, kind of like how 3-4 years ago they went on a huge hiring spree competing for talent. Eventually they will cut back to trim their losses.\n\nSpaceX is also only afloat because of government contracts, btw. It is not profitable.",

Musk has shown countless times that he will cut ties with anyone that disagrees with him, and surrounds himself with yes men. By praising Musk and appealing to his narcissist personality,  Jensen is ensuring a good customer relationship and securing even more future sales.\n\nIf Jensen said that Musk was a moron that doesn't know how to use their products effectively, he would risk losing one of their largest customers. Why would he do that?",

He sold the maximum he's allowed to sell by law under the trading agreement he filed. He literally cannot sell more without filing his intent to do so(which could crash the stock)\n\nif I was in his position, I would not sell much at once, as that can cause alarm and crash the stock. way better to sell a little bit at a time to avoid causing any panic and moving the markets.",

With the price action shortly after that the net value of his holdings was about the same since the stock price rose.\n\nPoor people aren't going to rationalize the habits of billionaires.
