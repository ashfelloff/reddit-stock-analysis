Now that the calls are fucked and the puts have stacked up it's time to screw the puts and either stay flat or if the mms really wana trigger some people we go back to ATH on friday after all the paper hands sell their calls.\n\nASML bleed into tech was overreaction. Probably not going to 500 or 498 on nasdaq but 494-495 tomorrow/thursday. If TSMC and Netflix both hit we actually may see tech ATH, but very unlikely both beat hard enough to do that.",
