They sunk a lot of money into that cancelled car project, their VR headset is vastly overpriced even by Apple's standards and they lag behind on the AI hype train. Now that last part may not matter in the real world where AI is mostly being used for shenanigans but it may be enough to spook investors who fear AAPL may fall further behind.\n\nOh and then there's the lawsuits that the US government proudly boasted they'll win for sure. That could cost AAPL a fair bit of money and investor confidence.\n\nSo what are your thoughts?",
