I put some options on Tesla because I KNEW they would miss by a mile (but then I thought, if I know this everybody else does too) so I closed out my put ooption and look the profit I already had this morning.\nTelsa did miss their earnings by a mile, BUT went UP!  I would have been wiped out!\n\nI'm sure some novice investor is out their pulling their hair out.  Thinking WHY WHY WHY.  Things are so bad at Telsa why did the stock go up!  It's because it was already priced in!  I fell ya.  I've been that guy plenty of times.",
