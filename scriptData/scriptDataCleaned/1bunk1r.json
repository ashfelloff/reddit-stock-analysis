But with the policy in place it helps ensure that some competitors will make it.\n\nKeep in mind that the commercial space industry is still very very early days. If Varda and others can make zero G manufacturing work or lunar He3 mining takes off then the demand for launch could quickly outpace supply. There's a geographic constraint on launch sites (must be on a coast not near houses, preferably an east coast for efficient launch) that we could easily reach if commercial space works.\n\nTo your point, if only LEO constellations work and nothing else then every space business which can't build and run constellations is probably going under.",

In my view RKLB is a stock you buy every week at whatever price and in 10 years it may be worth a lot more.  Throwing 160k at it in hopes to be rich is just gambling and you did it to yourself.
