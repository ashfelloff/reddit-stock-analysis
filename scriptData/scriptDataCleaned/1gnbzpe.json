Boy, have I got news for you. \n\nAs a whole, though, Palantir does have a bunch of annoying issues, but it‚Äôs a pretty decent platform on the whole. \n\nAs a tech nerd, I understand the hate and feel some of it myself on a daily basis when using it (debugging can be super annoying and the IDE sucks ass) - the same things can mostly be accomplished for much cheaper if you know what you‚Äôre doing with other platforms / technologies. But a lot of tech people don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing, so Palantir makes shit work pretty well and relatively easily. As a practical business person, I see the value. Particularly in government where they are fast to deploy in high security environments.",
