  "selftext": "Ford Motor came in well short of Wall Street’s second-quarter earnings expectations, while beating on revenue, due to warranty issues that have plagued the automaker for several years now.\n\nHere’s how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:\n\nEarnings per share: 47 cents adjusted vs. 68 cents adjusted\n\nAutomotive revenue: $44.81 billion vs. $44.02 billion\n\nFord’s stock is up about 15% this year, as pricing in the automotive industry has remained more resilient than expected.\n\nBut as the industrywide transition to electric vehicles takes off more slowly than anticipated, the automaker has adjusted its product plans to focus less on all-electric vehicles and more on hybrids.\n\nMost recently, Ford last week said it plans to expand production of its large Super Duty trucks to a Canadian plant that was previously set to be converted into an all-electric vehicle hub.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/24/ford-motor-f-earnings-q2-2024.html",

I was calling out how the Ford (and GM) hype made no sense several years ago when people were hyping up their EV segments.\n\nNo one was ever able to give me a straight answer as to why Ford and other automakers shifting their sales from ICE vehicles to EV's would make them more profitable. Everything about how they could make more money in the future (like by shifting to sell software upgrades/subscriptions) can be done just as well in an ICE vehicle as an EV.\n\nIMO a lot of people are still seriously underpricing the risks involved with Ford and the rest of the auto market shifting towards EV's overtime.",

Consumer demand can shift in favor of EV's a lot faster then Ford and other automakers can shift their lineup from ICE vehicles towards EV's. It takes multiple years for the automakers to bring a brand new car to the market, and if you look at the charts of EV growth YoY you'll see that it can grow a lot in just a few years.",
