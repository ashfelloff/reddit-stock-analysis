  "selftext": "Today we currently having a bull market (or a deadcat bounce) but it doesn't matter because the mouse will fuck all your puts. Here's why:\n\n* $DIS currently at 2014 levels, which is around $90 with no news due to the mass global sell off for 3 days\n* $DIS has massive insider buying when it falls off last 2 month, everyone in Disney seems to trust their companies is more than current price,\n* The Forecast EPS is around only $1.20, which we have already beaten last earnings, so unless these 3 months, the mouse didn't do shit or else they will rise. In fact, they have done \"Deadpool & Wolverine\" and they get $800 million after 2 weeks of release, which is a positive sign.\n* Today, it seems that Disney increases the price for the Disney+. This can attract the user because they will think that it's just couple bucks more to get fully bundle with Hulu, Disney+ and Max.\n* IMPORTANT PROOF: We learned from our past, and WSB has the line : \"Don't fuck with the mouse\".\n\nRisk:\n\n* Management change, or no dividends like INTC, which has the probability of happening relatively low\n* Some bears want to fuck the mouse, so let's see.\n* HIGH RISK: I am regarded and eating canyons.\n\nPositions:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xmuargih13hd1.png?width=1542&format=png&auto=webp&s=66056e10117beeac268601e6b67dab2e1edb7b51\n\nI also have DIS 105C 08/16 x 25 (around 500 bucks cost basis) in RH for a little gambling. Mouse and I will fuck all the gey bers tomorrow morning (or I will post loss porn)",
