The news that came with it and how institutions will position themselves from now on. This will definitely change the sentiment on the institutional level. It was a massive intraday sell off.\n\nThese guys don’t think on a daily basis, like retail. They position themselves for the quarter. All of a sudden you have a bunch of funds going short, then more of them get on that trend, and they are the ones moving the market, CTAs, and that’s how you get a correction period, which doesn’t last a day, it lasts weeks, because they need time to sell their massive positions.",
