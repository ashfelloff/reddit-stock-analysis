I was bullish when I started buying at around 700 ([see comment here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/213bTdOp3L)) and as it went higher my conviction became greater and greater. I bought more as it went above 1000 and bought more when it split. The most shares I bought were at 130 post split as the momentum was just so great it seemed unstoppable but my opinion began to change in recent months as the momentum has dissipated. I sold about half my position when it dropped below 100, but as it regained momentum I bought more back at 120 and 130. I felt for a minute there the stock was back and it was full steam ahead but with the recent loss of momentum I’ve once again become less optimistic, and if this continues I will once again be forced to unload more shares with stop loss set at 100. If NVDA can break through the previous all time high above 140 I will resume buying, in but in the meantime I will not get tricked again into buying anything below that ATH resistance point and I’m sure the momentum is back.",

What I’m saying is that it’s usually good to be buying stocks with strong upward momentum as it often signals an upward trend driven by positive investor sentiment and market momentum. You want to be capitalizing on the market’s confirmation that the stock has intrinsic value and is backed by strong fundamentals. Breaking out to new highs is one such signal and a very good time to be buying. Selling as a stock drops, on the other hand, allows you strategically exit before market corrections escalate, enabling you to preserve capital and reinvest in other high-performing assets. This way, you’re always moving your money to where the growth is, and not stuck holding stocks that might start losing value over time.",
