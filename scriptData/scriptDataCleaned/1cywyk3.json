  "selftext": "Long story short is stock gains + NVDA call flips helped me bring my portfolio to $132k by mid March. This was just around when GTC was going on, hype was up, NVDA reached $970, then it tanked a little and the call buying began. My calls, as you can see, were really risky and OTM. $990 March 22, and $945/$950 April 19th. These expired and my portfolio went down to roughly $50k. Eventually onward to $39k.\n\nThe day NVDA dropped down into the $760s (April 19th) I bought some Aug 16th $850 calls. I didn't time it too well though, I think I bought when NVDA was around $815 that day. Could've bought more for cheaper (8 calls for $60 instead of 6 calls for $83).\n\nToday I sold when NVDA reached about $1049.\n\n\n\n[$132k mid march -\\> $39k mid April -\\> $136k realized today](https://preview.redd.it/o3n64qqsc72d1.png?width=523&format=png&auto=webp&s=67d0e60102bc48d98944ee017b5bd9891535a0f5)\n\n\n\n[When the drop from $132k to now began](https://preview.redd.it/p9fbwk1tc72d1.png?width=1598&format=png&auto=webp&s=7716906c1b84231a59982ccba306d53144887275)",
