This also means that relative to right now...if you had what would be 1 share today at todays now $1.00 price...you'd need to have 10 shares...and back then, they were also $1.00, so if you had 10 of them, it'd be $10.00 so...highest price is $10.00, despite never once being above $1.00\n\nNow, imagine if they did a dilution,\n\nSo...now instead of only having 5million shares remaining Lets say they sold 195million shares somewhere between $1.00 and.....i dunno, lets say 25cents(because it makes my example simple).\n\nWell, now you've got a company with 200million shares, worth 25cents and they have to do another reverse split...this time 1-for-4.\n\nWell, now we're back to 50million shares, a price of $1.00, but if you wanted to own just one share of the company today, at todays price of $1.00, you'd have had to have bought **fourty** of the original shares, which also cost $1.00 back then, so thats like having a share price of $40.00/share.\n\nSurprisingly though, their market cap has never been more than $50million, but 50million shares with a \"price\" of $40.00 is clearly more than $50million...its false.\n\nSo yeah... just go ahead and repeat this...the math grows much quicker when you dont use $1.00. whatever the numbers were for TOPS, it gave us the chart for them...",
