They will have to adjust down the profit severely.\n\n2. Any FUTURE renewals will also be SEVERELY hampered in terms of cost that they can charge.  If a company had $1 million/yr contract for 3 years (Usual industry term length) and it is their first year and if they have $5million loss, they aren't paying anything for 2 more years and most likely will NOT renew as they will spend next 2 years trying to move away from them.\n\n3. No NEW clients are going to sign up or will only sign on with liability limit waved but if this starts to happen, there is no way CS can get liability insurance large enough to cover anything CLOSE to what is needed.  In turn, there is no way new contracts are signed without any liability insurance in place.\n\n4. with no $$ coming in or in limited supply, they aren't able to retain top talents thus they will start jumping to competitor and their product will no longer be competitive.  In long term, their product will probably be bought out in firesale and will be re-branded under another company.",
