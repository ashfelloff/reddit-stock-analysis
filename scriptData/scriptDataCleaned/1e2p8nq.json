I'm invested because I think the research their leadership did for over a decade at Stanford adds a lot of value to their current pipeline (and it comes free since it was all before the company was founded)\n\nWEAV: a vertical market software company that does CRM for dental and other medical offices, trading at a relatively low multiple.

If your asking why, I believe it was the announcement early last week that Peugeot, Opel, and Vauxhall, we’re going into production, in 11 European countries, using SoundHound in their vehicles.\nLink to one of many articles\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/soundhound-chat-ai-launches-peugeot-130600385.html\n\nI got in at $4.67, $5.05 and $5.46.\n\nIf you’re curious, here’s a link to 50 AI companies the institutional investors/Banks have been touting this last year.\nI’m still looking at the list but if anything jumps out to anyone please share.\n\nhttps://www.stockgumshoe.com/2024/02/the-a-to-v-of-artificial-intelligence-stocks-54-stocks-teased-as-a-i-plays-by-investment-newsletters/",
