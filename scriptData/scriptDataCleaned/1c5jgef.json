  "selftext": "Tesla clearly sporting a downward head and shoulder pattern. Papa Elon taking you, your wife, her boyfriend and your mother down to $15 a share.\n\n1. Robotaxi sounds as bad as the shitty robots tesla puts out, and won‚Äôt materialize for another 10 years. If they do put a robotaxi out, adoption of it across major cities will take a dozen years. \n\n2. Affordable Tesla project has been scrapped!\n\n3. The truck is a behemoth money suck\n\n4. Quality issues plague all teslas - Elon does not have the brain-time or the patience to focus on making their products world class\n\n5. Electric car demand has subsided considerably, and there‚Äôs way too much competition \n\n6. His half-wit shitty comments have alienated possible customers. Not many want to be seen in a Tesla.",
