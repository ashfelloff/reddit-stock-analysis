Every other shoe brand—adidas, Hoka, etc has since followed suit. \n\nNike infinity foam or whatever it’s called rebounds 85% energy. Compare to foams Hoka was using that only rebounds 50-60% until they recently developed bouncier cushions\n\nNo, it’s not just that they sponsor the best runners. Nike shoes have been progressing running shoes with legitimate innovation",
