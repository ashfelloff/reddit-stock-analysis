This morning I was feeling FOMO and thought I should try some low risk trading on a fun stock. I also thought\n\n1. an option is 1 share (It is 100 shares)\n\n2. Options are low risk because I don't have to buy the stocks so they are very cheap\n\n3. The premium listed on Fidelity is the total price that I was buying and therefore risking (It was per option)\n\n  \nI now understand what I did (not really) but I had no idea that I spent $65k this morning (my fault but fidelity should tell you also why can you spend that much from an app) and then went to a picnic and work and left my phone in my car. I'm never trading options again.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/q871jj9sn05d1.png?width=1590&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f5891b0bf6a645605d745513143b7fbf172ed0d\n\n",
