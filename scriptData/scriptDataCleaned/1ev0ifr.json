Dad refused. “I don’t invest in tacos” he said as every american lined up for more. CMG shot back up and beyond to pre split $2600/share or whatever it was. 5 years later or however long it was my dad let my then 17 yo brother cash out and buy tesla… at it’s lockdown height… so you wont let me buy tacos but you’ll let bro with 0 stock analysis buy the cybertruck?
