  "title": "Check My Thinking Fellow Regards: NVDA should get a good earnings bump ",
  "score": 63,
  "selftext": "NVDA has been getting hammered along with the rest of the Magnificent 7/tech sector. But a closer look makes that seem odd. Generally speaking tech earnings have come in at or ahead of expectations. But a major thing dampening investor appetite has been high expenses associated with scaling up for AI.\n\nBut the thing is that spending is the very thing that’s propping up NVDA. So it seems odd that’s moving in tandem with those stocks. Now over the long term, investor squeamishness for capital expenditures and a lack of profitable use cases for AI could hurt NVDA as tech companies scale back investment. But NVDA is only reporting earnings through July so it feels safe to think those will come in strong.\n\nNow, I’m not saying the stock will hit $150 or even get back to the 135-140 range it was at a month ago. But it doesn’t seem unrealistic that it could see a 15-20% bump back into the $120 range where it essentially was prior to the stock split in the spring, assuming the broader economic picture doesn’t worse.\n\nMy highly regarded brethren, am I crazy for thinking this? What am I missing here?",

Either it needs to become extremely profitable or become essential to remaining competitive. There’s a huge level of fear that the capex will be for naught and it will be a “fad”. Not such a big deal for other tech that have diversified revenue streams but for NVIDIA it would be a death stroke until such point as AI developed to the point that it is commercially viable. Who knows how long that would be or if it would even be based on the same hardware. \n\nAlso, tech represents the “early adoption” part of the bell curve which means it is the first to suffer pull backs in tough macro economic settings when people are more conservative, hence why essentials like utilities preform well and are popular in those times. A mix of the two is what is causing the latest pull back and due to NVDA’s dominance, other semi conductor companies have seen mixed earnings. The latest earning coupled with the price correction should create a lot of confidence which is good for another rally.",

To get any benefit from AI companies have to invest insane amounts of money in NVDA hardware and many do. However, the reality seems to have started sinking in - real benefits of AI are in the far away future. So I think most companies have slowed down their pursuit of the “AI revolution” and are waiting for it to get developed enough to become profitable. This is why I expect NVDA to go down after ER. The expectations of the market and big money are very high but the reality is showing a different story. However, prior NVDA history shows that their ER get a lot of people a major erection so anything is possible with them. This is why I’ll be sitting this ER out. Also the recent SMCI ER is a warning sign",
