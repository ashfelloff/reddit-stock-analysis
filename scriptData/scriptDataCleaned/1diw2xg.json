If that's the case, please [send us a message](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll look into it right away.\n\nThe bot will unspam tickers when their market cap is >500MM and re-spam them after they sink to under 400MM. (Roughly, and sometimes it takes a day or two to update)\n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",
