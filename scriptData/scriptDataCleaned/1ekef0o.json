  "selftext": "You always hear about buying and holding through rough periods in the market.\n\nBut by the looks of it, I’m fairly positive that my Nasdaq stocks are all going to be cheaper on Wednesday than they will be tomorrow morning.\n\nI’m considering just selling about half of my portfolio (it’s about 100k in total) tomorrow morning and just buying it back within the next few days to weeks from now based on how things go.\n\nThe market is freaking the fuck out, and I’d rather be in cash than ride this to the bottom, however far down that may be.\n\nAny arguments against this approach, or reasons why not to do this? \n\nI assume I’ll have to pay taxes on all my gains, which I’m okay with because the last week and a half wiped out a sizable portion of them anyways, and I’d rather at least preserve some gains than lose all of them.\n\nI also realize that if I buy back within 30 days, I won’t be able to claim and capital losses on my tax return. I suppose I’m fine with that too.\n\nThe alternative is potentially losing another 10% of my portfolio in the next week or two, which is honestly where it looks like the market is headed.\n\nIdk, how are you guys approaching this situation? Sounds like many of us are in the same boat here haha",

A few countries are at war. Things are pretty wild at the moment, no doubt about it, so stocks are getting skittish -- it's a tale as old as time. But the unfortunate reality is that moments like these are actually *pretty damn common,* and you just have to ride it out. It'll be fine.

      "body": "I am a financial advisor, and while I deal more in diversified portfolios consisting of ETFs and Mutual funds, the following advice holds true for any portfolio: \"it's not about timing the market, it is about time in the market.\"\n\nEssentially, timing the market is virtually impossible.  You do not know when the worst days are going to come, and you do not know when the best days are going to come. Selling your investments out of fear because of a steep dip in the market can prove to be a costly mistake, because not only will you be realizing those losses, but your running the risk of missing out on potential gains. \n\nUsing the S&P 500 as a benchmark, here is what a $10,000 investment would be worth today if it was first invested in 1994 and you:\n\nMissed the 30 best days of the S&P 500: $30,889\n\nMissed the 20 best days of the S&P 500: $48,874\n\nMissed the 10 best days of the S&P 500: $83,272\n\nStayed fully invested all 30 years: $181,763\n\nNo one knows when the best days are going to happen, but trying to time the market pretty much ensures that you will at least miss out on some of those days.\n\nAlso, people tend to sell when stocks are low out of fear, and they tend to buy when stocks are high out of greed. That is the exact opposite of what you are supposed to be doing.  Now is the time to hold, and buy more since everything is at a discount.",
