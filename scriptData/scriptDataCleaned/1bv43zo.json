The NDL from NASA, which was one of the 6 onboard components, IM managed to reconfigure into being their eyes. However, there was latency bc, again, not the primary system.\n\niii) The tip over information was not defined based on the data they had at the time of the first announcement.  Original data stated it was upright, which it was, but only until the booster stopped firing (it was on the lunar surface, with the engine powering down, and that thrust was holding it vertical).  Only after it stopped firing and the new data came in did they realize it had tipped over (broken leg upon descent due to lateral velo and catching a rock on one of the feet).\n\nThese are engineers, who made an incredible on-the-fly patch to enable the lander to touchdown softly.  They aren’t snake oil salesmen trying to fuck over John Q Public.  They presented what they had when they had it.  Hell, they could have NEVER said it tipped over and no one would have been able to call them out for it bc…how?!\n\nLet’s give these folks some serious fucking props, they deserve it. Rather than, as pretty much all of X and RDDT are, circle jerking on the “it tipped over” rhetoric over and over and over.\n\nAbove and beyond, LUNR. Continue kicking ass and silence the critics!",
