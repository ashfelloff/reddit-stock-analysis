From what I can tell Boeing is still in charge of deciding how to improve safety. The FAA isn't really doing anything extra besides saying your plan looks good. \n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2024/06/13/business/faa-boeing-oversight-too-hands-off/index.html\n\n> But for years the FAA has relied on employees of Boeing and other manufacturers to inspect their own companies, then report to the FAA, under what is known as “delegation of authority.” That structure is still in place, even with more FAA employees now on the floor at Boeing factories.\n\n>That reliance on self-inspection and self-certification first started getting attention in 2019 after two fatal crashes of the 737 Max killed 346 people and led to a 20-month grounding of the plane. The fact that much of the certification of the Max, a relatively new aircraft, was done by Boeing employees, not FAA staff, raised questions in Congress and an outcry among families of some of the crash victims.\n\n>In January, after the Alaska Air flight, Whitaker joined those who suggested the process needed to be changed.\n\n>“It is time to re-examine the delegation of authority and assess any associated safety risks,” said Whitaker a week after the incident. “The grounding of the 737-9 and the multiple production-related issues identified in recent years require us to look at every option to reduce risk.”\n\n>In February the FAA gave Boeing 90 days to come up with a plan to improve safety. And in late May when the plan was submitted, the FAA announced it was leaving a limit on production levels in place until safety improves.",

But thousands of times a day a Boeing 737 takes off and lands without incident so statistically speaking, you’re more likely to die in the car on the way to the airport. More people have died on the way to the airport than have died on an airplane.\n\nIt’s relevant because your TLDR was “if it was easier to choose an airbus I would because they are safer” taking public transportation is statistically safer than you driving yourself as well, but something tells me you won’t be taking a bus to the airport next time you fly.",

The MAX only has a slight pitch up at take off thrust which can easily be corrected with trimming down.\nNow where MCAS comes in to play here, was so pilots wouldn't have had to retrain to relearn a different flying characteristic of 737 MAX to the NG and cost airlines money to retrain and get new type ratings. So they made MCAS mimick the characteristics of the NG. The MAX without MCAS is a perfectly fine flying airplane with different flying characteristics.
