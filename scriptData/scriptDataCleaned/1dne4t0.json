Compared to previous years, the portions were cut in half, the quality of the ice cream went to shit, but the prices were about the same.  In spite of it all, there was a longer line than I've ever seen before.  This business drastically reduced quality and their costs while increasing their sales.  This tells me that disposable income of an average American consumer can support economic growth for the foreseeable future.  Calls it is.",

The lowest limit is like $11k and a few are $20k, $21k, whatever. So average is probably like $16k/card. 13x16k… I would guess that we probably have over $200k for a limit if we really wanted to just go nuts with them.\n\nLike with just Citi in particular we have 6 different cards (from taking advantage of various promotions over the years, like we both have the Miles Up card to use occasionally so our American Airlines miles never expire) with a total limit of probably more than $80k between all of them.",

Walmart is famous for strong arming their suppliers to continually lower prices because they make huge orders, and should they cancel an order, the supplier is stuck with a huge chunk of inventory they have nowhere to store.  In response, suppliers make special, extra-shitty versions of their product for Walmart-only distribution.  I am not sure if the latter applies to Coke, though.  It's also possible that Walmart uses Coke as a loss leader to get shoppers through the door.",
