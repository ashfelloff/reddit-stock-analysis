No one knows even the short term data on this stuff but everyone is betting big.

Still scratching the surface of this market. But once it's in pill form and these drugs break out of America and the developed world, the total addressable market is HUGE.\n\nBuuuuut once that happens and more competitors are also in the game, and generics start hitting the market, it's gonna destroy the current profit margins they are enjoying and basically their moat is gone. \n\nSo unless they can really keep the IP of these drugs contained, which is what I suspect they are currently doing, there may not be much of a long term play on a per company basis.
