Im sure you can tell when I discovered options. \n\nMostly just play 0DTEs and SPY so I guess this was expected, especially since I never learn from my losses. \n\nMy last $300 will be 0 DTE SPY 565c in hopes of a Powell Pump. \n\nMy advice to any budding regard. Never enables options. And if you do and you hit big on them, turn them off a never do it again. \n\nIf you need me I will be at Wendy’s. ",
