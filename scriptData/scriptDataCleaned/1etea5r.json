They were supposed to go down significantly over the next few years and that would've been **fine** because they were never meant to be that high. 2019 levels would've been a good target. Instead they've stayed flat since that artificial boost, which indicates that consumer spending has been **good**.",

And you probably(but not 100%)won't come back to the store. This number is monitored pretty closely. \n\nAt grocery stores, people are 100+X less likely to do that. \nThey usually bite the bullet. And they will absolutely never ever step foot back in your store. And you don't notice you lost a customer until they go 30 days without buying something from you for the first time in over 5 years.\n\nThat was the mistake that caused a ton of heads to roll at Amazon this year. Whole foods had a great quant team, that all got let go when Amazon bought them. The guys Amazon replaced them with understood this much less thoroughly and then they shot themselves in the dick the past two years. They just replaced the whole team with former HEB employees. \n\nBiggest chain effect corporate fuckup since windows decided not to subsidize windows phone app ports.\n\nEvery whole foods by me has giant windows so you can see how empty the place is from the street all the way across the giant empty parking lot by me.",
