If lower income people have pockets to carry discount retailers and grocers, I would have to imagine mid to mid-upper class consumers have to have the same presence if not stronger. The drop over the last 1-3 months has been energies (in parity with crude oil pricing), B2B software (trimming cost structure), home reno, and consumer cyclical (online retailers).\n\nBrick and mortar retailers are booming right now. Except BBWI because fuck them.\n\nConsumer footwear (excess purchasing) up 15-20% in many subsector leaders. Apparel is it right now, at least for the last 1 month and maybe 1-2 more months until summer ends.",

PVH also did build during the Q vs. LULU which hit a major drop on the CPO leaving, so even if they hit this quarter, investors may be shy if they dont settle understanding long term product vision. it looks like PVH[correction in edit below]. it's all a crap shoot.\n\nEdit: PVH Revenue: Reaffirms projected decrease of 6% to 7% (decrease 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis) - so it looks like PVH confirmed to investors they are losing market share.

The main factor is that most retailers are losing their Asian market.\n\nHowever, the reaction was not down to just guidance. \n\nIt was mainly down to the brand strength/value and how much the executives of these companies are roaming in the MM circles. \n\nRL took a very different turn from others, so my conclusion changed. I do not think guidance is the main thing when it comes to these upper-middle-class retailers.",
