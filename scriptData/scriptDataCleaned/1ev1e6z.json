  "selftext": "A few years ago I came up with the investment thesis that the world was not a happy place and evil people seemed to be doing quite well, so I decided to go long evil with my investments.  I thought Facebook, Palantir, Raytheon and Philip Morris would be a good place to start.\n\nSince then my evil portfolio has done extremely well in with Facebook (up more than 400%) and Palantir  (up more than 250%) and reasonably well in the case of Raytheon and Philip Morris - albeit nothing spectacular like the other two.\n\nI'm interested in investing in more evil companies - I had in mind Correction Corporation of America and Nestle (after a friend told me their CEO thinks all drinking water should be privatized) plus I've already invested in a couple of drone manufacturers as well  It looks like evil companies with a tech aspect seem to be doing well, but overall evil seems on the up.\n\nWould anyone have some suggestion on truly evil companies I could invest in, perhaps some non-US shares as well?\n\nPS I'm interested in investment opportunities in really appallingly evil companies rather than just your average corporate wrong doing - accounting fraud, price gouging and routine worker exploitation probably wouldn't make the grade - although I do have a soft spot for exploitative monopolies.",

The company manufactures weapons systems, fighter jets, missiles, and other military hardware. Critics argue that companies like Lockheed Martin benefit from conflict and global instability.\n\n# 2. Philip Morris International (PM)\n\n**Industry**: Tobacco **Why \"Evil\"?**: Philip Morris is one of the largest cigarette manufacturers globally, known for brands like Marlboro. Tobacco companies are often labeled as \"evil\" due to the health impacts of their products, which are linked to millions of deaths each year from smoking-related illnesses.\n\n# 3. Monsanto (now part of Bayer AG)\n\n**Industry**: Agriculture and Biotechnology **Why \"Evil\"?**: Before being acquired by Bayer, Monsanto was infamous for its production of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and its herbicide, Roundup, which contains glyphosate, a chemical linked to cancer. Monsanto was often criticized for aggressive business practices, including suing farmers and pushing for global adoption of its controversial products.\n\n# 4. ExxonMobil (XOM)\n\n**Industry**: Oil and Gas **Why \"Evil\"?**: ExxonMobil is a major player in the fossil fuel industry, which is a significant contributor to climate change. The company has been accused of funding misinformation campaigns to downplay the impact of climate change, even while being aware of the environmental damage caused by its products.\n\n# 5. Nestlé (NSRGY)\n\n**Industry**: Food and Beverage **Why \"Evil\"?**: Nestlé has faced numerous controversies over the years, including accusations of exploiting water resources, unethical marketing practices (especially concerning infant formula in developing countries), and involvement in child labor within its cocoa supply chain. The company's aggressive practices have led to widespread criticism.\n\n# Summary\n\nThese companies represent sectors like defense, tobacco, agriculture, energy, and consumer goods, where their practices have significant global impacts. They are often criticized for prioritizing profit over ethical considerations, making them fit the criteria of \"evil\" companies in the context you're exploring.",
