So Aug 9 - Nov 9. Since it's a weekend it will be approved the following week as long as theirs no issues (CRL).\n\nSome drugs that received extensions and approvals:\n\nNirogacestat - AUG27/NOV27\nPalopegteriparatide - MAY 14/AUG14\nArimoclomol - June21/Sept21\nAducanumab - Mar7/June7\n\nThe list goes on. I have bought 300 x Nov15 7.5 Calls.\n\nThis is entertainment like your mom.",
