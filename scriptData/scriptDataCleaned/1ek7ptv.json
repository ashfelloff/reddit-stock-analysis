I didn’t touch but still monitored the stock that I bought that went 60k -> 130k. In this time I was lurking and actively monitoring the stocks I bought which convinced me that NVDA was going to report extremely well for their upcoming (may) earnings. Bought about 20k in options a few weeks before (the first one’s always free 🥲) and sold for 100k (210k total). This was end of may. The week after I pretty much full ported about 70% into UNCOVERED NVDA calls expiring in September at various prices (advanced regardation I know).  At peak (NVDA 140) my account value was just over 300k (that same day I also promised myself I’d sell all my calls at 150 😭). As of last Friday all of my unrealized profits since I’ve been actively trading have been wiped out and then some (124k total). At this point my whole account graph is just mirroring NVDA. I know this is stupid and i should’ve sold and my ass should’ve stopped trading options after that first trade, but I’m still hoping after NVDA continues to go down tomorrow and the rest of the week it will rally up to 125~130 BEFORE earnings for me to exit my September calls with decent profits and pivot to just buying the stock and LEAPS. I still don’t own any puts on NVDA or any other stock for that matter, something I was thinking of changing next week just to attenuate any potential further losses on the stock (I’ll have to do a lot more research before actually buying any of course). On the bright side I still have 35k in various stocks (mostly NVDA) and my ASTS 2026 leaps have been printing big time and I plan to hold and exercise what I can when the time comes. I’m still pretty much a newb when it comes to trading as a whole but I think as long as I manage to pull out before earnings and shift to just buying leaps and stocks I’ll do decently.",

                          "body": "TLDR: I think NVDA will moon after earnings but the possibility of it tanking makes pulling out before hand with decent profits more appealing to me and my tolerance of risk. + I have and plan to buy more LEAPS and some short term OTM calls before earnings to hopefully still play this event in case of a massive jump.\n\nI might be completely wrong on this but from what I’ve seen from the past year this market is completely irrational and won’t follow any logic whatsoever. I am completely confident NVDA will outperform any expectations for their upcoming earnings, I’m just worried about how this irrational  market will react to that information. If NVDA tanks lower than 90 AND stays there then I’m pretty fucked. I already hold (be it few) NVDA leaps and honestly the main factor in selling pre earnings is just stress and the possibility that I might lose most if not all of my life savings. My plan is to sell my September calls and hopefully buy some leaps a long with a few short term OTM calls to hopefully capitalize on any short term gain while also having slightly less leverage due to the longer expiry date on my leaps. If NVDA climbs up to around 135~140 like I think it will pre earnings (I’m maybe too bullish on this stock but wtv) and I sell then I’ll have made a decent bag and would be completely content with the profits while still having some slightly less risky plays still on NVDA in case of a massive jump. Not to mention I still own quite a lot of NVDA stock too at this point (💎🙌). This will probably sound naive and regarded (which it is) but I really think NVDA is like the last thing holding up this clown show of a market and so much pressure will be put on their upcoming earnings reports for the rest of this calendar year that any little thing be it a comment or reporting 19% growth instead of 21% can be fully make or break for honestly... the entire market and I just kinda want to pull out in this short term to hopefully move over or more “long term” (2~3 years) plays that’ll put my mind more at ease. I’m planning to sell the week of earnings if the price reaches 135~\n\nHOWEVER if NVDA doesn’t reach ~135 in the week leading up and is below 130 the day of earnings I’ll probably not sell and my regarded self will most likely anxiously sit through earnings.",
