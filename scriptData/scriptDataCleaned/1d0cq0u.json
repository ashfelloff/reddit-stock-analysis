Those data points only tell part of the story as to the safety of the vehicle.\n\nIn any case, unless I really didn't have a choice I'll never fly on anything that doesn't have fixed wings or a very high thrust-to-weight ratio. Helicopters/rotorcraft in general crash way too often for my liking. I understand service members don't have that choice, and I think it's terrible that so many people's lives are ruined just in training missions alone.",

          "body": "I worked at Bell for a few years during the design of the V-280 and spoke to a few rotorcraft experts about this very topic.\n\nWhat I've learned:\n\n- Osprey was fundamentally kneecapped by the fact that it had to fold up and fit inside of an aircraft carrier. This meant that the rotors had to be significantly shortened compared to the \"ideal\" rotor diameter for that size of aircraft\n- this shorter rotor disk meant that the blades had to spin faster to generate the same amount of lift.\n- the fast-spinning small rotor blades caused the aircraft to easily fall into Vortex-Ring-State (VRS), something that wasn't well understood until late in the development, and led to a significant amount of the initial accidents involving Ospreys.\n\n- The V-280 is a SIGNIFICANT improvement over the Osprey in this regard.  The engines don't rotate (much more reliable), and the rotor blades are MASSIVE compared to the size of the cockpit.\n- It is much more challenging to enter VRS because the rotor diameter has been optimized for the aircraft since it doesn't need to fold up at all.\n- the overall FBW system is much more redundant and reliable than Osprey\n- the driveshaft technology has improved dramatically since the V-22 was initially designed, and is less complex than the V-22's\n\nBasically everyone said that V-280 is the aircraft that the V-22 should have been (ideally), but the V-22 got wrecked by requirements that compromised the usability of the vehicle.\n\nI agree that we'll have to see how the V-280 performs, but I have a high level of confidence that it will far exceed V-22's track record, I'm extremely optimistic.  The V-22 crashes really hit the engineers at Bell hard (deservedly so), but it seems like they spent decades understanding the deficiencies and perfecting the art of the tiltrotor in the meantime.\n\nWe shall see if it works out! Definitely think it was a much better choice over Sikorsky's offering as well.",
