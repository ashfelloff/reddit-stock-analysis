  "selftext": "Alphabet is again investing in its self-driving car unit Waymo — this time with $5 billion.\n\n“This new round of funding will enable Waymo to continue to build the world’s leading autonomous driving company,” Alphabet’s outgoing finance chief Ruth Porat said Tuesday on the company’s second-quarter earnings call, adding Waymo is an “important example” of Alphabet’s long-standing investments.\n\nPorat announced the “multiyear” investment on the call and said more information would be available in the company’s quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing, expected on Wednesday. \n\nAlphabet’s “Other Bets” unit, which includes Waymo, delivered $365 million in quarterly revenue, up from $285 million a year ago. But the unit’s losses widened to $1.13 billion from $813 million in the year-earlier period.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai said on the earnings call that Waymo provides 50,000 weekly paid trips, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. It has completed 2 million trips to date. In June, Waymo removed the waitlist and opened Waymo rides to all San Francisco users.\n\nThe unit raised $2.25 billion in its first external funding round in 2020. The company raised another $2.5 billion in 2021 in a round that included funding from Andreessen Horowitz, AutoNation, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Fidelity Management & Research Company and more.\n\nAlphabet’s increased investment in Waymo comes after General Motors’ autonomous vehicle unit Cruise said it would indefinitely delay the production of the Origin, a self-driving shuttle designed for use in cities. Tesla on Tuesday delayed plans to unveil its CyberCab, a dedicated robotaxi, from August to Oct. 10.\n\n“Alphabet has committed up to $5B to Waymo,” Waymo CEO Tekedra Mawakana said on X. “We are grateful for their immense vote of confidence in our team and recognizing the amazing progress we’ve made with our technology, product, and commercialization efforts.”\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/23/alphabet-to-invest-5-billion-in-self-driving-car-unit-waymo.html",

However, that doesn't mean that the next 10 units will cost $100,000,000; rather, it they will be able to afford 100 units with another $1 billion using what they have learned and developed from the first 10 units.  The next $1 billion might get them 1,000 units. \n\n\n The cost of further adoption goes down the longer they go at it, and what Alphabet is likely seeing is that the money gained from each unit is enough to justify further expansion.\n\n\nAlphabet has proven their technology. It's not something fanciful in the future maybe, it's working right now and generating revenue, and they have the blueprints for expansion.  And future expansion is going to cost less than similar numbered expansion in the past. ",

A taxi wear out in 5 years. With maintenance, fuel, insurance cost the annual cost of a Waymo is approaching $60k. If you add billions of development cost a Waymo is more likely cost $100k a year. There is just no chance Waymo can be profitable, let alone beat Uber or Lyft. I think FSD, after its mass testing in China, will definitely best Waymo. Just ask your self, will you put your hard earned money to invest in Waymo?\n\n“Waymo, valued at $175 billion by Morgan Stanley in 2018, saw its valuation slashed to $30 billion by early 2020. This decline raises questions about the challenges Waymo faces in the autonomous vehicle industry.” This round of funding has no valuation figure!!!! No auto company participated in this round of new funding. \n\nI don’t have figures. My bet is that the total investment by google is more than $30 billion. In another word it was a failed investment.",
