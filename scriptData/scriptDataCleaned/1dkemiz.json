  "selftext": "For context, MBS have been stuck on the balance sheet for the last 16 years and account for about $2.35 trillion of the balance, sheet, two thirds of the size of the U.K. stock market. I understand that the Fed has a mandate to make money, but my searches indicate that the Fed has no longer been underwater on these assets since mid 2023. I think most economists would agree that the percentage of MBS and \"other\" assets on the balance sheet should be close to zero, and for better or worse, 100% of fed members are economists. Eyeballing the charts, it looks like the Fed is selling treasuries faster than MBS assets, and in the last year, other assets spiked with the SVB bailout. \n\nIn speeches, Fed members trot out the soft lie of a statement that interest rates are the only tool they have to manage inflation, and this is certainly not true when the Fed has private assets that approach or rival the GDPs of many countries. It seems to me that the Fed can cut interest rates, which helps everyone, even low-income earners, and still attack inflation by the selling of mortgage backed securities. Lower interest rates should give a boost to real-estate, but the Fed could conceivably manage any related real-estate growth by accelerating and decelerating the sale of MBS and other assets. \n\nThe reason I am asking is that I'm heavy on tech and waiting for warnings signs of economic trouble. Anecdotally, a ton of REIT deals that were financed at low interest rates pre-covid will have to refinance at much higher rates late this year and early next year. Many companies won't be able to do so. I personally don't mind if they can't, and I even experience joy at the economic troubles of all the companies with business models that involved leasing office space and parasitically re-renting it at much higher prices, with speculators adding no value to the economy. I would love to see these speculators get burned. If they still come out ahead because the Fed doesn't want them to be burned, then that reeks of moral hazard.\n\nHowever, I am worried that Fed members know more than I do, and that Fed members are worried about real-estate exposure on bank balance sheets. For example, CITI has a price/book around .55, which ordinarily would be a no-brainer buy. But, a number like that makes me worried that banks are in more serious trouble than their typically well-above book value prices represent, and that the Fed is happy to allow for real-estate inflation, even though it is driving overall inflation, to keep is MBS assets from going underwater again. \n\nI'd love to hear from any economists who know what is actually going on or anyone who is very plugged into the MBS market.",

They're also not selling treasury either.\n\nThe mortgage rate is pretty high already. 7-8% on current inflated housing prices is insane, and the only people who can buy are either high cash down payment or just super earners. I'd say the Fed is just as scared of breaking something as high inflation.\n\nIt seems like they've made up their mind that if they break something, cause a recession, cut rates, there's a risk that inflation will return after the recession is over. That happened in the 1970s, and even in 1980 during Paul Volcker (yes even Volcker made the mistake of cutting rates too early). I think they'd rather just have elevated inflation for 5-6 years, but slowly bring it down without resorting to cutting/stimulating the economy.\n\nSo actively selling MBS is something they haven't done in the past and there's a risk they could break something, forcing them to cut rates and stabilize financial markets, even when inflation hasn't gone down to 2.0% yet. happened to UK in late 2022, and that complicated the central bank communication alot. In that scenario, there's a high risk inflation will return.",

I still feel like active tightening would slow down the economy and reduce liquidity and inflation, with the amount of risk proportional to the amount sold. \n\nMy gut feeling, which could be completely wrong, is that the Fed should increase the use of selling and tightening and simultaneously lower the funds rate, even though it won't happen. With regard to treasuries, I can completely understand not selling them, because that increases the cost of the government to borrow money when it is expensive enough right now. But, maybe selling MBS would only exacerbate the cost for the government to borrow if it somehow increased treasury yields through knock-on effects.",

              "body": "The Fed doesn't even believe we have a rent inflation (not housing affordability due to high mortgage rate) problem right now. They believe we have a data collection problem where real-time rents aren't flowing through on the data, but I don't get the sense they are concerned about rent inflation. Real time rent is slowing down, but not on the data. They've been patient with the data flow lag for about 1 year now, and I think they're not gonna grow impatient until maybe 2025. I think as long as monthly core PCE doesn't annualize to 3.0%+, they are okay with letting the rent inflation stay high on the data. Once it goes above 3.0%, they will become uncomfortable, and that's when they start looking for the low hanging fruit to bring inflation down.\n\nNow as far as housing affordability goes, I have zero clue why housing prices haven't dropped yet. People keep saying demand is way too high. Where is all this demand popping up from out of nowhere in the last 4 years? WFH is almost done, homebuilders are still ramping up supply, housing affordability is at 40 years low. I have a house, and even I cannot afford the mortgage if I just bought it this year.\n\nMy guess is that the people with second/third houses and 3% mortgage are refraining from selling them because they believe it's too good to throw away. They are renting those houses out instead, even if the rent only breaks even the mortgage. So while housing prices are still high, rent prices are much lower relatively. Rent demand, however, is also elevated due to the influx of immigration (legal + illegal) in the US over the last 2 years. It's estimated that there were 4m of new immigrants in the US since 2022, double the usual amount.\n\nSo until immigration slows down to the normal level and rent demand slows down, forcing these rental homes to be empty and eventually sold for profits, I don't think housing prices will normalize. Or if we including mortgage cost into the inflation metrics, then maybe they start addressing the housing affordability issue. Cause as of now, even rent price is at a disconnect with mortgage costs, running much cooler.",

Due to locked in effect, existing home sales volume is incredibly low at 2009 level. That means that homeowners are in no rush to sell, unless if the sale price is incredibly attractive. Homebuilders also don't want to lower official listing prices, but choose to give incentives worth around 5-10% discount under the table instead. Due to the low mortgage rates, people who want to upgrade their home will also try to buy a second home and rent out their primary one, instead of selling then buying. Homebuyers are also constantly told by their RE agents to just buy a home now and refinance 1-2 years later when mortgage rates drop. Homebuilders even buy down their rate by 2% for the first 2 years to make the mortgage payment look cheaper before they refinance. These four factors mean only the super wealthy, or someone who severely downgraded their standards, who really need a home will buy a home, propping up official home prices.",

I think the reason why so many analysts made the wrong call on that front is because there is such an insane amount of private capital sitting around these days that is owned by people who are very, very financially secure. The real-estate market is a beneficiary of that private capital. I would argue that this private capital is still a beneficiary of treasury prices. \n\nOne way to frame your argument would be to say that the economy might collapse if tightening pressured the balance sheets of banks that were runaway beneficiaries of historical emergency easing measures. I think there is some marginal degree of MBS tightening that could cool inflation. I'm still not convinced that selling 0% of Fed-owned MBS is the optimal solution for cooling inflation while keeping the economy from falling off a cliff. I don't know the optimal strategy, but I don't think the Fed knows either.",

I picked USRT as the y-axis. You can plot them on the same chart for the last year and transparently see that they move in tandem, which implies lower MBS prices should correlate with lower real-estate prices. I plugged them into my own python program that I use to correlate different assets and, for the last year (220 days) I get the equation:\n\nUSRT = 2.128 * VMBSX - 114, with an r^2 coefficient of determination of 0.927, which is very strong, not zero, and definitely not random. To be fair, that correlation is weaker and weaker the further out you go, which is apparent in their disparate price movements, but it is still positively correlated. \n\nUnder this relationship, you would expect a decline in MBS to result in a decline in USRT.

The correlation is still positive, not negative, but it is pretty meaningless. \n\nI still don't know how selling MBS would affect inflation. Broadly though, tightening tends to put the brakes on inflation that comes with an overheating economy. Broadly speaking, when the Fed engages in monetary easing, like it did when it started purchasing MBS like crazy, that stimulates the economy and stock market. To me, are my first-order assumptions, and other considerations are a perturbation, but maybe that assumption is wrong in this case. \n\nOverall today I've learned that the Fed won't sell their MBS because they won't sell their MBS, either because it might cause inflation, or because it is too radical and might break something. From my perspective, even if mortgage rates go up, that shouldn't have a clear 1:1 relationship with inflation. For example, one possibility is that the financial environment with a selloff of MBS makes the banks less likely to lend and that has the effect of reducing bank-led increases in monetary supply. Another part of the equation is government stimulus increasing inflation, and now there is so much private wealth that buying treasuries from the government that this can increase monetary supply. It seems tough to me to have 2% inflation when treasuries are offering 4.5% and 10% of people have most of the capital. But, I'm obviously not an economist.

First, there are a ton, so you definite it by a basket of MBS instruments. How do you measure real-estate prices? You use a basket of different real-estate prices. I think it's better to use a basket of real-estate assets because corporate real-estate is the only part of the market showing some warning signs.

I don't directly care about the 30Y correlation between mortgage rates and the housing price index. Mortgage backed securities didn't even exist for most of that time. The price of MBS instruments don't always work out like they are supposed to on paper, as everyone knows. I'm not saying that they are toxic instruments or going full Michael Burry, who has been losing his pants shorting the stock market over the last couple of years. Are there rough seas ahead 6-12 months out? I don't know. Is there a finite chance that a quarter point rate cut might be too little too late and people won't be able to refinance corporate real-estate and this will have a knock-on effect on the banks and stock market?

          "body": "I still don't get that statement at all. Are you honestly stating that the Fed has the authority to buy private assets and MBS, but has no authority to sell them, at all? I think one authority implies the other. \n\nI also think that if the Fed were to release meeting minutes that revealed that members were ready to cut by .5% but sell 10% of the MBS assets, in aggressive tightening, then markets would broadly drop the next day. Mortgage rates might increase while the Fed unwinds its effective trade, but the balance sheets of banks would go down. The liquidity of banks would go down. Higher bank interest rates decrease borrowing and spending, and I think expensive loans would probably reduce the monetary supply, and fight inflation. \n\nYes, keeping rates high also fights inflation, but in the two scenarios, I think the current scenario increases the borrowing costs of the federal government more. Again, maybe I'm wrong. But I think the Fed does have the implicit authority to sell private assets that it bought, and it is a weird world in which they don't. Right now, the stated goal of high interest rates is to increase unemployment, hurting people who work for money, while guaranteeing 4.5-4.8% returns to retirees. A different strategy is to put pressure on asset and balance sheet valuations. \n\nI get that it's not going to happen, but I still feel that increased tightening is a hell of a lever.",

      "body": "If your goal is to look for warning signs of \"economic trouble\", then looking at the amount of MBS on the Fed balance sheet is not really going to help you.  The MBS that the Fed buys are essentially securities (backed by the value of homes, but they are not homes themselves) that the banks no longer want, because their value have dropped too much.  When the Fed buy these MBS from the banks, they're bailing out the banks because they're giving the banks valuable cash equivalent securities in return for the toxic value of the MBS.  The Fed can hold onto these toxic MBS assets on their balance sheet in the long-run, because they have infinite liquidity to absorb the losses.  So you can think of the Fed as going around soaking up all the toxic MBS asset, and absorbing losses from these MBS assets in the short-run.  Eventually, they will sell these MBS back at market value, but the price of these MBS usually bounce back in the long-run and so the Fed often make some profit when they sell the MBS (generating profit is not their goal though).  I'm describing this mechanics to you, because the action of buying and selling MBS is just a clean up tool AFTER a crisis already happened; it's not an effective tool in managing inflation, and predicting when the next crisis will occur.  \n\nI also don't know which economist you're talking who believe that the amount of MBS on the Fed's balance sheet should be \"close to zero\".  It would be close to zero if the Fed doesn't have to step in and clean up asset bubbles, but whenever it does ... then it takes time to offload the MBS from balance sheet, because you don't want to sell them too early when their value haven't bounce back yet.",

          "body": "I made this post after reading that these MBS assets as a whole were no longer underwater as of a year or two ago, I forget exactly. They were underwater as a whole for many years. After making this post, I learned that the Fed had also sold a relatively small but non-zero portion of their MBS assets. Of course, they could very adversely affect markets if they sold a lot at once. But, if their mandate is to make money, selling the MBS assets that are not underwater is a way to make money and reduce the balance sheet and maybe take some burden off of T-bills, which is good for the government (people). I'm still unconvinced that there is no way to do this without making the sky fall. The Fed has been selling treasuries to reduce the balance sheet for awhile now without making the sky fall.",

              "body": "To your point, the Fed IS trying to offload and unwind its MBS positions.  It doesn't benefit them to hold onto MBS that are no longer underwater, because the goal of the Fed is NOT to generate profit, but simply to achieve price stability and maximum employment.  The process of buying up toxic assets like MBS is to clean up the financial system whenever it crashes, so that firms don't shut down.  It is a safety protocol for the economy, not a profit-generating protocol.  The Fed has been trying to slowly offload its MBS since 2022.  Maybe it's not as fast as what people would like, but they've been holding a lot of toxic assets over the years since they rescued the economy twice in 2008 and in 2020.  It will take time for the process to occur, because they don't want to flood the market with MBS, and offloading a large amount of them will put upward pressure on interest rates.\n\nI'm not here to make excuses for the Fed, because they DO need to shrink their balance sheet.  If their job is to act like a sponge to soak up toxic asset when \"shit hit the fan\", then the sponge is looking pretty full and saturated right now.  It needs to empty some of those assets off its books so that it can get ready for the next financial crisis (which will inevitably happen, since we've designed the economy that way).  However, the process of quantitative tightening (QT) is still being worked out, and we don't know what negative effects it can have, so the Fed is proceeding with caution.  They are offloading their balance sheet as fast as they can, in order to get ready for the next crisis, without adversely affecting the \"landing\" of the current financial crisis.\n\nThis article from Richmond Fed is helpful for example:  https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2022/q3_federal_reserve\n\nI don't understand why traders are obsessed with the Fed's balance sheet.  As traders, you make money based on what will happen next, but the Fed's balance sheet is not deployed to rescue the economy until crisis already happened.  Focusing on the Fed's balance sheet doesn't help you predict the future of where the market will move next.  It's like trying to predict where the next crime will happen, by looking at how full are the jails.  I can assure you that the Fed doesn't know when the next crisis will happen; they just know that it will definitely happen again because we've engineered our economic system that way.",
