What would be attractive for me as a brand new investor of Netflix? \n\nYou already finished your era in the sun of gaining someone from $5/share into the $hundreds. We saw what a freak, once a century global lockdown can do to your price as a matter of crazy speculation, and you just now re-achieved that ATH 3 years later. Every country with electricity on Earth knows what you're about and is subscribed or not. You feel like your business model is basically at saturation.\n\nAnd to top it off, you pay me absolutely nothing for my ownership stake (the no dividend part)\n\nWhy would I as a potential investor invest in stocks like this?",

The majority of global households don't have a Netflix subscription.\n\nSecond, there's nothing forcing the company to stay strictly in the movies/TV shows streaming forever. They can expand into any field imaginable. The natural first expansion would be into anything entertainment streaming-related. For example, they could relatively easily kick start a music streaming service similar to Spotify, YT Music, etc. They already have the infrastructure, they have functional recommendation algorithms that could, with some modifications, be applied to music, etc.\n\nThey could go deep into live streaming, like broadcasting major sports events.\n\nThey've dipped their toes in gaming by publishing mobile games and there could be some expansion in this direction.\n\nAnyway, I may have said some nonsense above but the point is -- there's one field in which they generate like 10B of revenue but there's infinite number of fields in which they generate a zero. They have the money and if growth in their current business model becomes impossible, they will be increasingly open to experimentation to see what else will stick.",

Remember, they're not just a streamer, they're an entertainment company, and entertainment is HUGE. Gaming, TV, films, theme parks, music, VR/AR(if this goes somewhere), podcasts/talkshows, books and reading, merch, live events, and so many more. Netflix can expand into plenty of these(I personally like the idea of a Netflix theme park). It's also worth noting that Netflix only has 270 million subscribers. That's less than the population of the US, and as more of the worlds population is lifted out of poverty and gains access to the internet, we could see a future surge in streaming revenue",
