By the time you're 20, 23, or even 25 years old, you will be thanking yourself for putting $2.5k into that ETF and holding as an investment long-term. The remaining $500 use for trading. Your paychecks from work, use it to add on to your ETF shares and you can add a small portion of your paycheck for trading. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that you hit a nice amount so you really gotta be smart about it and not blow it all up. Trust me when I say that $2.5k into SPY or QQQ and then continuously adding on to it from your paychecks like just even $200-$300 each paycheck (get fractional shares) will be so rewarding in 2-5 years. And then whatever funds you use for trading, if you do hit good profits, do the same with your profits: Take a good portion of it and invest it. Use the remaining for trading while also adding some to it with your paychecks. \n\nBuuuut if you want to speedrun being a millionaire, then by all means go ahead and you do you lol.",

Once he owns the option, he can sell the option or exercise it to own 100 shares. Since he doesn't have the capital in this case to exercise it, it's better to just sell the option to make profit. \n\nSome people can sell options without owning the shares as well, but usually brokerage requires X amount of money in their account. Usually 25k+ depending on whichever brokerage company. This scenario is called naked since they don't have the stocks originally. If they do that and the strike price crosses the target, they will owe 100 x the price of the stock at the exercise time.",
