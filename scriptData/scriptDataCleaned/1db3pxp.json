Ignoring the part about Elon leaving or not, *what about the fucking board.* The board is all yes men and super corrupt, right? \n\nSo actually, in theory - if the majority of the vote is no, but the board overrides it and gives the package anyways - that could be *better* (depending on your perspective of course) because that could potentially lead to like a massive shareholder suit or legal action to get *the entire fucking board* replaced. \n\n***THAT*** would be fucking saucy. 🍿🍿🍿I will admit I love Tesla but I think they need new leadership and this whole thing has been wild.",
