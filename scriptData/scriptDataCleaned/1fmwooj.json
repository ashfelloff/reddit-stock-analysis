                  "body": "From the article:\n\n>  For years, market participants have complained that requiring exchanges to quote stocks at increments of at least 1 cent restricts liquidity and competition for orders.  \n\nIt allows traders to pay less spread.\n\nIf a share costs $0.1 and the minimum spread is $0.01 then the spread is 10% of the share's price. With half a penny spread you're paying half as much for spread.\n\nIf they reduce it further in the future then you'll be wasting way less money for unnecessary spread\n\nIf you buy 100,000 shares for $0.1 each then you pay $0.11 √ó 100,000 = $11000 with the old spread vs $0.105 √ó 100,000 = $10500 with the new, lower spread. So you're saving quite a lot: $500, or 5% of the actual shares price.\n\n> Because I challenge anyone‚Ä¶ go spend 100.5 pennies. \n\n> In fact, if you ‚Äúcut‚Äù a penny in half you could go to prison for defacing US currency.\n\nSo as you saw above, there's no actual \"half a penny\" for a large enough order. For smaller orders I assume it's rounded so that you lose and the broker gains (although it's negligible unless you literally buy 1 share thousands of times instead of buying all the shares at once (in the above scenario))\n\n> Edit: and a Forex account is a special account, like margin accounts, where leverage is offered. Remember cash accounts don‚Äôt have these ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù.\n\nNot necessarily. Depending on the broker, you can have leverage on any asset you wish, and not have it on your Forex account. The additional decimals are simply to provide more accuracy (especially when handling large orders)\n\nI don't get your tinfoil conspiracy theories lol",

My only beef was w the claim physically mutilating a penny, or any U.S. currency without fraudulent intentions, was a crime.\n\nBut yes - I completely agree with you these institutions are partaking in blatantly illegal activities with little to no consequences.
