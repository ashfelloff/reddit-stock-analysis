              "body": "Sure, I bought 30 calls then after they were up a little I shorted 30 of the calls for the next higher strike price. This turned my strategy into a ‚Äúdebit spread‚Äù (look it up) with a cost of $0.25 (bought calls @ $0.75 shorted higher strike calls at $0.50 so .75-.50 is my cost). Since I shorted the 182.50 calls I could only make a max gain of $2.5 per spread because that is the difference between 180-182.5 strike prices. I sold close to max gain at $2.3 so $2.30 - $0.25(my cost) x100 shares x 30 contracts gave me about $6.15k profit.",
