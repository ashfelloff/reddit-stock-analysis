Designer might say “gap between these two doors is supposed to be 5.0 mm plus/minus 1.0 mm” so a range of 4.0 to 6.0 mm, but when you do the tolerance stack up, everything on short end and everything on high end off tolerance, the allowable gap between the two doors might be 1.0 to 9.0 mm.  Then you say “everything is statistically in control” well even then the possible gaps with everything in control is 3.0 to 7.0 mm, so then it just becomes the engineer/manufacturings problem.",
