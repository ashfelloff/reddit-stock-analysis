In other words, yes. Greed definitely plays a role. The pursuit of profit has perhaps gone a bit too far (it reminds me of how folks gouged the natives in Killers of the Flower Moon). BUT inflation is still a result of several factors, on both the supply and demand side, as well as productivity. It’s not all greed. And we know that adjusting interest rates does have a significant impact on inflation. We also now know that there isn’t necessarily a lag today, given the free flow of information (so Milton freedman may have been wrong, or is at least irrelevant today). We can immediately impact markets and inflation by adjusting the fed funds rate. By increasing the cost of borrowing and tightening the supply of money, businesses have less access to capital, consumers have less money to spend, the economy slows. Businesses drop prices. And so the cycle perpetuates. There will also come a breaking point where consumers simply aren’t willing to pay the price for a product anymore. I don’t use Uber anymore because it’s cheaper to call a black car and the service is 10x better. I don’t eat at my local diner anymore because it costs just slightly less than the nice restaurants by my house and the food is significantly worse (same With fast food — it’s insanely expensive now).
