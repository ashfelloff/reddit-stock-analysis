I know rich people love to bitch about the homeless even when they are not in their neighborhoods, but just wait until they are. The homeless population has already exploded since Covid and they have nothing left to lose. When a hungry addict ends up shitting on your lawn, or a gang of them rob you or break into your home, you might realize that just because you have a comfortable life doesn’t mean someone else gives a fuck about your comfortableness. It never benefits society when people are suffering. Even if you are the “non affected” class you will be affected. I own a business and may not be directly affected, but I also don’t want homeless drugged out addicts stealing my equipment or shitting on the sidewalk that my child uses. I’m in Florida and if you think it won’t be like a Cali or Oregon level of homeless problem here in a couple years you are wrong. No one ever talks about how bad it has gotten everywhere in Florida. It’s hidden. It’s pretty sad.  I hope you don’t step in the shit.",
