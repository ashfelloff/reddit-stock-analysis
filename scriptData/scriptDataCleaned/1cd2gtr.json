  "score": 27,
  "selftext": "Letâ€™s talk about Diamondback Energy (FANG), which looks primed for a sick run as we slide into earnings next week. Hereâ€™s why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANGâ€™s sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; itâ€™s got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3. **Institutional Love:** Big moneyâ€™s been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isnâ€™t just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. Thatâ€™s some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. Itâ€™s above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ainâ€™t financial advice, just one apeâ€™s take on a stock thatâ€™s looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. ðŸš€\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR:** FANGâ€™s got the goodsâ€”solid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy position: 38 210c 4/26 exp  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/vc7o2as4vowc1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=77da67a35857dbee1a226b10501a0f55a3e293f6",
