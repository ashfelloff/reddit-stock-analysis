      "body": "With persistent inflation pushing input costs for businesses so hard, it comes down to pricing power. If you can pass your increased costs onto your customers, you'll be OK. If your customers are price-sensitive and have alternatives to your products, inflation is going to squeeze your profit margins.\n\nI would target monopolies for that reason, and the great thing about living in American neoliberal hell is that there's plenty of them. Most industries are very consolidated and are dominated by 1-3 heavy hitters. \n\nIn the grocery business, for example, you have Walmart and Kroger. Both of those guys can pass their $5/lb chicken breast prices onto consumers, and all the consumers can do is suck up and pay it. Where else are they going to buy raw chicken? Their neighborhood butcher? Walmart forced that guy out of business 30 years ago.\n\nDon't take my word for all this. [The Fed wrote a white paper](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/current-policy-perspectives/2022/cost-price-relationships-in-a-concentrated-economy.aspx), discussing how the overall economy has 50% less competition now compared to 2005, and that has boosted companies' ability to pass on costs by about 25%.\n\nSo if you want to pick individual stocks, and you expect inflation to hang around, I'd stick with the big boys.",
