What that does is to say to any given majority, my issue, what I care about, is more important than the structure of the Senate, which has served us well for many, many years,” McConnell said. “That bothers me a lot.”\n\nThe reason the filibuster will not end, is because A) it protects the status quo, and B) the filibuster protects Republicans just as it does Democrats.",
