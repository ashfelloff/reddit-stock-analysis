But one of the real risks is the decay which is as a result of the daily resetting on the leverage. So say the fund declines by 10% one day and then rises 11.1% to recover from the original loss, on a normal fund it would be back to the normal amount of money you originally invested. But a leveraged fund won’t be because it locked in the 10% decline on the end of day one and then you have a 3X or whatever leverage on that smaller amount of money NOT the original amount you had on day zero. \n\nThat is decay and it fucks you over time. The longer you hold the fund the more decay you experience and the returns you get may massively deviate from the stated return on the stock graph. And it’s even more complicated because they do reverse splits to further hide this on the return graphs.\n\nHonestly, anyone investing in this should really just read the prospectus on these funds. They are not as straightforward as they seem.",
