  "selftext": "Lets start with why Japan is fucking Jerome Powell to save themselves. \n\nI don't think anyone even the Bank of Japan (BOJ) knew how bad the carry trade problem had gotten when they made the choice to raise interest rates. \n\nInflation is rampant in Japan - If you have US Dollars you have a lot of buying power there. \n\nOn July 31, 2024 The Bank of Japan decided that Inflation was severe enough that they made an almost unheard decision to raise interest rates a miniscule margin from .1% to .25%.\n\nThe Yen started to strengthen vs the Dollar\n\nAs you know, On Monday August 04, 2024, everything started to fall apart and the carry trades started getting margin called as they unwound their now unprofitable venture.\n\nTonight, Tuesday August 05, 2024, BOJ has decided to rescind its interest rate hike. Now the carry trades can continue. The Yen can go back to being weak and the world can continue to keep on chugging along. \n\nBUT WAIT IT CANT!\n\nIf the US lowers its interest rates then the Dollar gets weaker compared to every other currency including the Yen. IE: the YEN strengthens vs the Dollar.\n\nSee the problem? US lowering our interest rates has the same effect as Japan raising theirs!\n\nThat means the second we lower our interest rates even a little the carry trade problem is will come back with vengeance and it will all be blamed on Jerome Powell when the markets have more -14% days.\n\nThe second problem is our own Market is begging for an Interest rate cut and would react very very poorly to being outright told that we can no longer lower our interest rates because the Yen carry trade issue was uncovered and we would have to unwind all those trades resulting in very deep drops on exchanges. \n\nI don't think Jerome Powell knew about the Carry Trade issue when he spoke at the July FOMC. \n\nAll previous predictions about when we would lower rates were based on an assumption the global economy did not rely on a strong US dollar and Bond market.\n\nYou saw what happened when Japan raised interest rates .15% we ended up with +60% on VIX and a -14% day in Korea and Japan and -5% at home. \n\nJerome is now the one who has to choose. What is the worst evil? Sending the world into Global Recession as carry trades break down under a weakening Dollar and weaker Bond markets? \n\nOr dealing with a slowdown in the economy at home due to high interest rates stressing the US economy. \n\nLong story short. Japan has decided it would like to keep carry trading with low interest and a weakening Yen and fuck the rest of the world. \n\nI personally don't think Jerome will be able to lower interest rates until some law is passed to deal with carry trades and until then he will dance around the topic of lowering US interest rates month after month.\n\nTLDR: I would buy puts for each FOMC over the next few months because there is zero chance Jerome Powell will lower the US interest rate until some regulation actually removes carry trades. Japan is addicted and wont do it. ",

(Japan buying LNG is why a company like Cheniere exist which I have been long on for 10+ years.)  \nSo the pensioners have made the politicians promise to strengthen the yen and their plan was to raise their prime rate then sell US bonds ($400B) and buy Japanese bonds instead.  \nJapan announces they are going to raise rates and the \"carry trade\" is now less profitable and more risky so everyone doing it starts selling their stuff and figuring out what else to but.  \nMean time JPow announces he's going to start dropping the US rate since people at Intel have started jumping out windows.  \nThis spooks the Yen-USD carry trade in particular and is why we've had a negative month. It's not actually negative growth, it's just the end of free yen.\n\nShit's selling until it starts causing panic on Monday in Japan sending jitters everywhere else. If Japan dumps their US bonds then the US is going to have several failed auctions as people snatch up the cheaper Japanese ones. Confidence in the yen is failing.  \nJPow and Ueda (his Japanese counterpart) must have made a backroom deal to chill-the-fuck-out and they both announce they are going to CtFO to calm the markets while they figure out how to unwind the carry trade.\n\nBut Japan is on the clock. Elections are coming. Winter is coming. LNG is not coming cheap enough.",

Typically, Fed rate cuts would weaken the dollar and strengthen yen.  However, if most of yen weakness (dollar strength) came from selling yen for carry trade.  And that demand for dollar (short yen) isn't there because the carry trade isn't profitable due to the expected glide path of Fed rates, then USD-JPY would weaken, but not dramatically drop.\n\n  \nI guess I'm arguing that we have to look at the rate of change of USD-JPY when the Fed begins to cut.  If it's disorderly, then yes I agree with your thesis.  However, if it's not disorderly, then I don't think we'll see panic.  The unwind will continue but VIX won't shoot up to 60.",

In the wake of the turmoil caused by its decision to hike the rate this past week, it decided to walk back those comments and promised not to raise interest rates while markets are in turmoil. OP misinterpreted this news as the BOJ rescinding (undoing) the recent rate hike. Either that or the OP doesn’t know what rescind actually means.
