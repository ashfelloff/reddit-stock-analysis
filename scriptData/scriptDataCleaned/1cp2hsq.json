The ad just made them feel negatively about the company, which is a totally reasonable response, especially when they can explain why.\n\nApple has long positioned themselves as the tech company for creatives. But in an era where creatives feel they are being crushed by tech giants, this commercial shows many of the tools creatives use and see as an extension of themselves being literally crushed and destroyed.\n\nViewers understand the logical intent of the commercial. But the commercial was also meant to be evocative by its creators. And it was evocative, just not in the way they intended. People felt like it was a Freudian slip from a big tech culture that does want to destroy them and tipped their hand without meaning to.\n\nSo yeah, people are allowed to dislike commercials and say so, and companies are allowed to pull marketing that doesn’t support their brand or move product. This is a normal part of the business cycle. Being bothered by it is the weird thing.",
