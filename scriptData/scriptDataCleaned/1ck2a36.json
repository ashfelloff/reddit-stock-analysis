  "selftext": "For the past few weeks I've put in relentless effort into studying stocks, technical, fundamental and sentimental analysis to analyze the charts in great detail. During my analysis I was saw a 16 day triple moving average intercept of the RSI convergence to the upside suggesting an inevitable retest for the institutional order block sell-side liquidity sweep zone before a continuation trend unfolds. The MACD on the 1 year timeframe began to form a second degree polynomial curve and was retracing the 61.8 Fibonacci level right Infront of my eyes. There was even a fair value gap on the 5 minute timeframe so according to SMC theory it is guaranteed to print a bullish engulfing harami candle and a subsequent elliot wave which will be the initiation of the bull run.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tkyvust3cfyc1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=de3216ce420656b753a83a3a1ec63f6169b4c06b\n\nFurthermore I also noticed a nice 6 sided triangle forming an ascending channel with lower highs and higher lows, complimented with a breakout double bottom flag pattern in the 1 second timeframe resistance level which I have then cross-checked to the fixed range volume profile. After adding a few more exponential moving averages and a 9 period volume oscillator it had come to my attention that my ICT hypothesis was coming into fruition and thereafter I calculated that I'd get a return of at least 17500% minimum by session closing on Thursday the 32nd of June.\n\nAfter seeing a break of the linear regression trendline structure, I went to the 12 hour timeframe to make sure the candle closed outside of the parabolic support area before placing my trade. I didn't see it there but I did see it on the 3 minute timeframe so that was good enough for me. As soon as the price crossed the upper quartile of the williams fractal index with an increase in order flow, everything had finally come together and the setup had presented itself nicely. I wasted no time and decided to sell most of my possession's and put it into this trade which I understand is a no no but I was sure this time. I position sized appropriately and went all in a market order at 143x leveraged hedged position going long with a 1:175 risk to reward ratio and a stoploss at the recent swing low.\n\nWhile I waited for my order to hit my take profit and feeling optimistic about my position, I opened up a new tab in my browser and began customizing the brand new lamborghini I was about to order. It took me about 15 minutes to finish then I added to cart. Now that I was ready, I decided to take a quick look back on the progress only to find that my position had been liquidated. My only mistake was that the liquidation price was set above my stoploss so that was hit first. Actually the other mistake was that I went long when I should have gone short (avoid this). All of this has left me devastated and I have come to realize that trading just isn't possible and the only way to profit from this is by selling courses.",

Selling out of a position first now you're fucked wishing much of the time you hadn't. At least a full box hedge allows you to collect your thoughts. the only way it would hurt you if something moons all of the sudden but if the knife drops you've only lost 1, 2, 3 percent and you're good.\n3. I rather keep my core position heading into a long term gain over time especially if I believe in the stock. If the mentality is I want to buy the dip then this is a great strategy to not get wrecked on wild swings down. or up even in the reverse.\n\nYour mental state doing this will be so much better and the decisions you can make from there are much more calm and collected.\n\nMoral of the story is, never sell, just protect your ass and buy the dips as you wish.\n\nIt's a buy short position -> stop quote \\[price go down to a point\\] order\n\nRisk management is as important as profits.
