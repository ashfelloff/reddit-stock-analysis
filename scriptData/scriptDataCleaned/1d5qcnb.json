  "score": 284,
  "selftext": "Thinking about Apple recently, and I'm quite thankful that they haven't released a shitty AI like Google. Not yet, at least.\n\nI think they are a buy right now. The stock has hit the same price ceiling twice in the past year, and is quick approaching it again. Also, WWDC is in 9 days, and a collaboration with OpenAI and Apple is confirmed. \n\nMy expectation is essentially a Siri upgrade, on 4o tech, to be rolled out later this year. I'm bullish on a Siri IQ increase that might inspire me to actually say \"Hey, Siri\" now and then. Might even get a free psychologist.\n\nThoughts?",

      "body": "The general idea is that currently there is approximately a 1.5 billion user base for iPhone. The excepted WWDC announcement for AI capabilities will most likely only work on iPhone 15 pro and pro max. iOS 18 will work on iPhone 11 and newer but will not have the compute to handle the improved Siri with AI features on device unless you have a 15 pro or pro max. The cutoff for laptops and iPads is most likely the M2 chip. There are a majority of pandemic era iPhones reaching 4 to 5 years old. Apple shipped 230 million  iPhones in 2023 and 50 million in 2024. That leaves a user base of 1.4 billion with iPhones unable to handle the new SIRI AI features..... With an average cost $800 per phone you are looking at a massive upgrade cycle…trillions of potential revenue in 2025/2026 . That is not taking into account how many of the recent iPhone sales were not the pro model, nor laptop, and iPads that will effectively be obsolete in the coming year.  \n\nAnother bullish driver are rate cuts globally. Lower interest rates globally will create a more accessible financing option for consumer discretionary spend, which includes phones, laptops, and accessories.\n\nThe goal for AI is to be profitable. The best way to do that is market AI to consumers, putting AAPL in the position to be a leader in the consumer AI market with AI handled on device and offering the best personal data security in the market.\n\nAAPL has entered into a price war with its major China  phone competitor Huawei and seen results in increased sales in the last earnings. Being that the market is always forward looking WWDC could start an upward movement for the stock going into the iPhone 16 release in September. Earnings in the fall with increased sales, and an election in Nov with an anticipated rate cut to follow is painting a bullish picture for AAPL.",
