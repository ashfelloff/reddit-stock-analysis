It's going to be rough and I realize that. The past two days have been the scariest days of my life. My parents still don't know I've lost 1/3 of my inheritance. Every time I talk to them they can see how stressed I look and they keep asking me what's wrong and I don't know what to say. How can I possibly explain this to them? My only option is to hold for a decade. So that's what I'm going to do. I know people are going to shit on me, and you should. I recognize I made an unnecessarily regarded decision. I have received a lot of DMs and reddit notifications offering me mental help and Suicide hotline numbers. I appreciate your concern but I'm fine. I'm holding long term. I'm sorry if my decision made you upset and reflect on your financial situation, that was not my intention. I appreciate all of your support and constructive criticism. Some of you have been really mean but its ok, I know I deserve it. But im holding. Forever. Intel will succeed. ",

This is actually true because if any of us has $700k to use, no way are we just throwing it all into ONE STOCK. Who the fuck does that? Everyone here has read some kind of basic book or advice on investing and trading. If investing, never go all-out in one stock. Shit when I started learning about investing, that was one of the most basic rules I learned right away on my first day of studying. Diversify your shit. \n\nBut OP is so fucking regarded that if he knows about diversifying, he just shot himself in the foot because now that $700k is STUCK in Intel and he was 'planning to hold for a decade'???? Seriously? In a decade, $700k can be EASILY turned into millions if he just fucking followed the basic rule of diversifying and asking people for advice. Not fucking YOLOing into one stock. Goddamn. This makes me so fucking mad even though it's not my money.",

Meta earnings last quarter I was certain it was going up on a clear beat - they did beat but stock still went down over some bullshit. \n\nPeople will tell you to sell intel and others will tell you to hold. Whatever you decide is besides the point, in my opinion you should take out atleast a grand and dedicate that to your grandma as it‚Äôs the least you can do, visit her grave and put her favourite flowers on it. Do things that would make her feel proud she worked so hard for you. (And I‚Äôll tell you now part of what will make her proud is you not being stressed, prioritising your health and spending her money for you to be happy) fuck it if it was me I‚Äôd even find out the people who my gran cared about most and treat them each with a 1k holiday. The feeling you‚Äôll get from that is much more than if you‚Äôd made $200k on options TRUST ME. Imagine for example some sweet minimum wage carer who treated ur gran amazingly got a $1k holiday, they‚Äôd break down in tears‚Ä¶  \n\nAlso $100k in the S&P is honestly a no brainer for ur age come back in 10 years and you‚Äôll be looking very very nice üëå.\n\nThe best thing to do OP is to just accept that the market never wants to work in the direction you want it. 200k gone but 500k is still set for life money seriously. For most people that money is 20 years of hard work so to be sad and stressed over losing 200k when u didn‚Äôt even earn it just sounds pathetic (no offence xx)\n\nI heavily advise you to put $250k into an account that‚Äôll pay you 5.2% APR and do not gamble or invest any of it and try to keep it permanently above 250k. YOU WILL LITERALLY MAKE $1k a month without doing anything!!!!\n\nBut yeah maybe ought to re-assess your maths degree üòÇ if you can‚Äôt even work out how averaging down works (AGAIN NO OFFENCE) but surely you should‚Äôve thought maybe I should keep half just in case to bring down my average let  alone do this investment in the first place.\n\nAnyway ü§û for you OP u seem like a sweet guy and we all feel horrible when we make dumb decisions like you did, it‚Äôs all a learning point and in 10 years this moment will probably be one you are happy happened.
