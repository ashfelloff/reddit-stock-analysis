Like a failing grade or not graduating, it’s really sucks at this moment and you feel like life is over or changed forever. It’s not\n\n- you will come back, people either succeed or they quit. You will find a new play a new buy the dip opportunity, a new wave a new rumour a high spike that you know is bogus to buy puts on. You’re down but you’re not out\n\n- reflect on this week but also learn from it. Embrace political volatility and sometimes you need to splash water in your face to see things clear again. Never become emotional \n\n- don’t try to beat the dragon once it knocked you down. You lost, walk away, don’t go doubling down trying to proof you’re right. Nobody cares. Find the next opportunity. Nvidia should be the same as Nike to you, just a play where you either win or walk away \n\n- always remember the long game, remember that companies are busy day in day out thinking about top line and bottom line and beating competition. Even the mathematic equation of a random stock price is that it assumes it goes up. \n\nI really wish everyone well. And you will come back stronger! 💪",
