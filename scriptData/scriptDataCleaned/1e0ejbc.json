Considering it hasn't already been graded and especially if you can notice it's not mint and you're not familiar with the grading process, it's probably a pretty low grade. Only around half of new cards straight out of the pack to be graded get a PSA 10.\n\nA legit base set Charizard lower than a PSA 8 is probably worth around $200.\n\nI do a lot of collectibles buying/selling/trading mostly comic books and Pokemon Cards. I find most people way overestimate the quality of what they have. Also a lot of people confuse reprints of famous comics/cards with the originals.\n\nYour best bet is selling straight to consumer, if you're selling to a shop they won't pay more than TCGplayer prices, probably less.\n\nIt's the Gem Mint Holographic Shadowless Charizards that are worth around $30,000. You definitely don't have two of those. Even if by some miracle you found them at a garage sale, unless they were meticulously preserved, they'd probably be worth around $700 each.\n\nWhen looking at value for collectables don't look at the ridiculous numbers people put trying to sell them ($250,000 lol), look at the numbers for the ones that have actually sold.",

Take 10% and gamble that in single stocks or options. If you lose the 10%, don't pull from the 90% boring portfolio to restore your gambling portfolio. Get a side hustle and restore it that way by putting 50% of your income in your boring portfolio and 50% in your gambling portfolio up until your gambling portfolio is back to 10% of your total number. When you do win big, you will eventually re-adjust the money back to 90/10 ratio (in other words, when you do hit big just put the majority in your boring portfolio and let that compound. Your gambling portfolio will get bigger because you are using that 90/10 rule I've used this method and I'm 33 now and much more successful compared to most my age. I wish I had someone older to tell me this when I was your age. I've seen my portfolio lost 90% 3 times in my life (from ages 16 to 19.). Luckily, I did learn my lesson the hard way eventually. A lot of these guys that are on here never learn. Don't be like them.",

If you‚Äôve learned, and will take it forward with you, the money you lost won‚Äôt matter/will be worth the cost when you‚Äôre growing your account by hundreds of thousands/millions in the future. Respecting the market, avoiding emotionality when trading and avoiding gambling are all key. Better to find solid investments and only use options for exceptional opportunities that you‚Äôre extremely confident in for whatever reason.",

I didn‚Äôt go back to trading but I started watching charts every day. Mainly TQQQ, but also a few other ETFs like SQQQ, BOIL, and a few others that I focused on. I worked full time but would watch the 5/15 minute chart just kinda trying to see if I could make a guess what was going to happen. I got really familiar with TQQQ, more than anything else, mainly because it felt a little safer since the markets tend to go up more than down. Years and years I watched and practiced, my main strategy was buying the dip on the 5 minute chart that used to happen pretty often around 10-10:30am. I used RSI and MACD, I was a chart pro and made a bunch of good trades! \nJk I suck dick behind the Wendy‚Äôs but I still watch the charts while I do it.",
