As for tsla its been trapped trading sideways for weeks now and coming off from a major downtrend early this year. There was a mini bounce off the 50day MA, but if tomorrow you don’t get a nice green dildo, a nice short set up will present itself as the majority of longs on the daily compression, take their losses fueling the move lower plus new shorts (possibly me) piling in short to ride the wave down. This is real trading, waiting on confirmation rather than trying to get in early because if it sells, the backdrop could be ugly.",
