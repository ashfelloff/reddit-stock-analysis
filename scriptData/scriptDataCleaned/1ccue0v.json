The very unpopularity of the idea, despite its value, made it a pragmatic choice by definition of democracy and pragmatism. \n\nSecondly, isolationism and protectionism are absolutely not the same thing.  \n\nChinese economic policy is incredibly protectionist but they have their chopsticks in every coffer with a flag on it wherever the sun shines. China is a formidable threat rivaled only by Americas vintage preeminence. Both are protectionist to varying degrees; the winner will ultimately be decided by who executes protectionist policy to mobilize the massive power of MNCs. \n\nTo your gripes about protectionism: tell me how expecting a protectionist actor to engage earnestly in free market liberalist ideals while not hedging against the likelihood they don’t is a great idea and I will point you to the fact that the US government has been down that very same road over the last 20 years and is finally understanding the error of those ways. \n\nProtectionism is how states foster massive profit-extracting entities and deploy them at will where it is strategically beneficial. Isolationism is where states choke to death on their own farts. They are not the same and you should really consider whether you’re educated enough to espouse views on how the most powerful countries on earth should carry themselves. GUH. \n\nTSM to 0.",
