Right now tech stocks are getting reamed, but I also have a relatively low cost basis.  What are you guys thinking of doing? I feel like in the long term META will do fine, but short term/mid term seems like the stock market as a whole is going to continue to get battered. This period might be extended depending on how the election goes and trade restrictions. Any thoughts?",
