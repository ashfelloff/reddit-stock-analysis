Of course it misses on top and bottom lines and still somehow goes %4 Up because it's a DiViDeNdS ArIsToCrAt and FuTuRe ExPaNsIoNs.\n\nMcDonald's served up a 'Triple Miss' special this quarter, with earnings, revenue, and comparable sales all falling short of the market's order. With earnings per share at $2.97 versus the expected $3.07 and revenue dipping to $6.49 billion against a forecast of $6.63 billion.
