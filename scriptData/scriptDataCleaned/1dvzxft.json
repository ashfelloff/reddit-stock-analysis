Way above previous industry estimates.\n\n**The Last Jedi:**¬†$385.8 million total cost, $66.5 million UK tax return, net budget of¬†**$319.3 million**\n\n**The Rise of Skywalker:**¬†$542.4 million overall budget, $94.1 million UK tax relief, net budget was¬†**$448.3 million**\n\nThis aligns with previous reports that both Abrams movies had massive budgets whereas Johnson‚Äôs movie had few hiccups, which may also explain why Lucasfilm originally wanted him to make more movies. The Last Jedi was almost cheap to make compared to the two Abrams movies.\n\nThe spin-off movies:\n\n**Rogue One:**¬†$298.7 million total cost, $50.9 million UK tax relief, net budget of¬†**$247.8 million**\n\n**Solo:**¬†$351.6 million total budget, $64.4 million UK tax return, net budget of¬†**$287.2 million**\n\nTotal Box Office Cost: $1.759B\n\nTotal Profits: $1.186B (per the same article)\n\nEstimated profits after marketing: $700M\n\nstar wars is also more than the box office. Include how much they make off merchandising and its easily covered. Licensing and Merchandising are estimated to bring in $5-7B a year in revenue. Lets take a conservative 20% profit on that. (In all likelihood its probably closer to 30%). TFH awakens was released in 2015, so lets call it 9 years time to benefit form licensing and merchandising. Thats $9B in estimated profit. So $10.186B/$9.7B in profits more than covers the original purchase price using my box office estimate, but even using yours of $559M, its still over double what they paid. Lucas was genius in understanding that money is made on the shirts and toys, not at the box office.\n\nCould they have made more, absolutely, but its silly to think they haven't turned a profit on either Star Wars or Marvel.\n\nEdit: Corrected some numbers",
