Assuming perfect spreading of the satellites that would require 63 satellites. Given that the vast majority of a satellites coverage will be overlapping with others (circles don't tesselate very well at all) you're probably going to end up with at least 2-3x that number for proper continuous coverage, hence the \\~200 figure you suggested earlier.\n\nThis is all assuming that the number they state for the coverage is true, which is is likely exaggerated a bit or assuming ideal circumstances, all of which will further increase the satellite count requirement.\n\nAll in all, claiming that 5 satellites can do that is absolutely absurd.",

But honestly if starlink pulls through, whatever. Limits my upside but I’ll still make a lot of money if ASTS is the real deal. What’s shocking to me is people the shit on ASTS and wishes it fails. Why? Aren’t we all trying to make money? I never have been and never will be the type of person that shits on others for the money they make. If I’m being 100000% honest I’d tell you the FCC already struck down their claim and that Elon is a POS that can’t be trusted but I’m going to keep my mouth shut. \n\nRegardless I honestly don’t care. The stock price is 29 and if it becomes 35 I’ll be happy. I can’t imagine a world in which it becomes less than 29 5 years from now. Isn’t that the fucking point of investing?
