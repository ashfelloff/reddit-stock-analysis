They are still one of the worlds leading chip designers and makers and are making breakthroughs; intel is rumored to be the first to introduce back side power delivery next year ahead of tsmc, for example. Theyre probably still #3 in chip manufacturing expertise, and and argument can be said they can compete with samsung at #2. \n\nIntels problems are i think rooted in bad decisions and overconfidence during their years of leadership during the mid to late 2000-15 period. They missed the rise of mobile (big mistake, aa it gave the tsmc and samsung foundries money to grow) and they were bearish on euv tech for a long time, not comitting to it and staying stuck on deep uv for ages (a dead end tech) and hence being stuck at the same node for ~6 years.\n\nIn contrast, tsmc made the switch to euv early and mastered the process, and thats where we are today.\n\nIntel is now trying to play catch up against tsmc and samsung, who are both very good, very rich, and have a big head start. Whether they are ineffecient in terms of manpower- i cant make a judgement on that.",

They could have done that while taking their time to go to euv. Hindsight is 20/20 sadly. \n\nI wouldnt bet against intel turning it around though.
