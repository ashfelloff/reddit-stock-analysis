PMs are for long term protection from fiat devaluation with a side of non-correlating hedge against bonds/equities.\n\n----------------------\n\nAnyways, just for OP: \n\n>So who lends to the lender of last resort when the government hits a debt ceiling?\n\nWhy does someone with an infinite money printer need to borrow? [Answer is they don't.](https://youtu.be/Ck3FuTzZvhI)\n\nNot sure if OP is dumb or just has bad memory. The government and the Fed LITERALLY just printed trillions of dollars out of thin air. Money isn't even real in the sense that it's an asset or a store of value. It's means of facilitating trade, measurement unit by which to price actual assets, and a method by which to control the populace who lacks cash/wealth. How the fuck can you be buying silver, btc, or whatever trash stocks yet not understand such a basic ass concept?",

The fact that silver is a commodity with a use-case for significant tangible business operations makes it more useful than cash during an economic crisis in equities.

With the expiration of the Petrodollar contracts, the USD faces a true threat to its reserve status that could make hyperinflation risk real for the first time in decades.
