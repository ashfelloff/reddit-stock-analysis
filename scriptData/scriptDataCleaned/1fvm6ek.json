  "score": 213,
  "selftext": "There are plenty of news about more and more students are below their grade level for reading skills and college tuition also continues to keep getting more expensive and more inaccessible. Toddlers are given tablets and screens before learning how to speak. Teachers are treated like minimum wage workers, overworked and underpaid considering the importance of their role in society.\n\nIt's not a situation that I look forward for, but I foresee the future to continue getting worse for the American education system. If so, I'd like to be able to afford my hospice care while my grandchildren stream my death on social media.\n\n  \nEdit: Should have clarified ideally ideas outside of the obvious tech eg. Meta, Alphabet",

Finances look good, and there’s definitely potential. \n\nThe big BUT and what puts off investors on Chinese stocks is that if the CCP / Chinese government doesn’t like what a Chinese big Tech company is doing, they step in. \n\nSee what happened to Jack Ma when he “stepped out of line” and see what has happened to BABA since then. \n\nIt’s a very risky play to invest in Chinese stocks. Upside could be huge, the biggest difference is that you have to factor in how sensitive the CcP is and how willing they are to step in and run a company how IT sees fit, usually cratering the stock price of those companies",
