Generally speaking, they’ll actually be pretty quiet. All of that being said, your overall sentiment is reasonable.\n\nAerospace is a large part of my work focus and I’ve commented on various Archer and Joby posts about the risks before and don’t have the time to expand atm, but these are long term lottery ticket plays. A few eVTOL platforms will likely *survive*, but the demand is very much tbd and the EIS targets are ambitious.\n\nJoby currently looks like it has a better chance than Archer but it’s still risky, though Archer’s more traditional aero supply chain may be beneficial in terms of costs and avoiding cert hiccups. If you do calls, be prepared to roll them on cert timeline delays or lose it all tbh. No guarantees here and OP severely downplays the risk.\n\nI used to swing trade these a bunch because the stocks would jump on overhyped FAA certification process news. I stopped because a prototype crashing, even for something minor, is all it will take for the price to plummet.",

With the fixed wing and tilting engines, you get a lot more range and speed than a traditional helicopter or multi rotor vehicle.

Short term damage from events such as natural disasters are not consequential for a long term investment over many decades. TSM core operations have to stay in Asia, the culture is too different. US plants are just an act for subsidies. Chip fabs aren't that profitable so no one else is both willing and able to do the dirty work. The technological capability that TSMC has is such that a semi industrialized country such as Poland or Brazil will take 100 years to catch up. The US is too rich to do fabs properly, and the EU is bogged by legislation and economically stunted by language differences and laziness. Japan is stuck in the past.
