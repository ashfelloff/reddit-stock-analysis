Just depends on how fast shelves in the US start to empty out and prices start going up.  \n\nConversely, the ILA has been offered 50% raises, but the union won’t accept without the automation clause.  I would be very surprised if they offer it because it’s playing Russian roulette with your business.  China already has some automated docks, maybe not fully automated, but automated nonetheless.  If they agree to it and some enterprising company decides tomorrow that they want to build a dock and have it fully automated the only thing stopping them is money and permits.  Hell, if they were smart they would buy a decommissioned dock where most of the infrastructure is already in place.  Spiff up the infrastructure so it’s top of the line, build out the automated equipment, dredge the channel so it can accept the huge cargo ships and they will hugely undercut the current docks.  I am willing to bet the permitting process wouldn’t even be that difficult if it’s in a southern state.  \n\nPoint being, damn near every industry has some form of automation, if the dock workers were smart they would have tried to figure out how to incorporate limited automation while losing the least amount of jobs.  Otherwise some person or company will come along and upend the industry and the dock workers will be completely fucked when it happens.  The current pay packages for dock workers would be over 200k with the 50% that was offered on Monday.  With that kind of pay package you can guarantee someone will figure out how to automate and make a killing.
