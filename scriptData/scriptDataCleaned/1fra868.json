  "selftext": "**DOCU's P/E ratio is looking pretty attractive at 13.07—not bad for a tech stock.**\n\nBut when I dug into the income statement, I found the reason: an $888M benefit from income taxes. So, it's not like DOCU suddenly became super profitable with great margins last quarter.\n\nOn the plus side, they’ve cleared out most of their debt and have built up a nice cash pile. That definitely strengthens their position. But here's the question—does this make DOCU more enticing as an investment right now? Or should we hold off until we see a real boost in operating cash flow?",

The guys simply do not bother about changing unless there's a catalyst or prices keep increasing yearly. Also the few times I've proposed switching this to better alternatives the expectations got too high with many leaders talking about investing \"block chain alternatives\". Microsoft has the SharePoint e-signature but it's not quite like what DocuSign is used for (primarily for signing contracts between third parties that most likely would not be at your SharePoint ecosystem). One tweak from Microsoft and they could build a rival software, the thing is most likely being the greedy bastards they are, they would charge something similar just enough to be at space and not to \"compete\"",
