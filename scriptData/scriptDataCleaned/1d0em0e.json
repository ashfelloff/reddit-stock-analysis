  "selftext": "On Friday 24th May, S&P 500 closed at whispering distance to ATH [5140].\n\nYou may have heard/seen rants from prophets of doom on how US equities valuations are bloated, economy is under strain, inflation is out of control, and average consumers in great pain.\n\nBut these naysayers have been consistently been proven wrong quarter by quarter for the following reasons: \n\n1) US is the leader in AI: US leads in AI chips developments, LLMs, Machine Learnings, APIs etc. These developments will usher in years of boost in productivity and increase in profitability in several unrelated industries.\n\nFinance: Credit, Mortgage/Lending, Fraud Detection, Derivative Trading etc\n\nLogistics: Autonomous Vehicles,  Route Planning and Scheduling Deliveries, Remotely Operated Cargo Ships etc\n\nManufacturing: Semi autonomous humanoid robots, Process optimization, Swarm drones etc\n\nHealth: Diagnostics, Remote medical attention, Cancer Treatment, Gene Therapy etc\n\nClimate: Carbon capture and sequestration, Pollution control, Waste management & disposal etc\n\nAgriculture: Higher yields and greater resilience to climate and pests etc\n\nSpace Exploration: Unmanned mining bots, Habitats of human colonies on Moon and beyond, Autononous and self operating space factories etc\n\n2) Equities analysts are consistently underestimating the strength of US and innovation ability of US companies: Michael Wilson [Morgan Stanley] is the latest example of the analysts in Ivory Towers proven detached to the mood on the street.\n\n3) Fed is still accomodating: While the era of Quantitive Easing [QE] is over, and we have heard \"higher for longer\" often times. Fed continues tk be accomodating and market expectation to come running for rescue at first sign of economic trouble is not unrealistic.\n\n4) Market crash is not be feared: Equities generate astonishing returns [100% and beyond] in the pre-crash stage, and give back maximum upto 30% in a short time, only to resume an upward trajectory. So talks of an imminent market crash should not cause fear to a retail investor who does Dollar Cost Averaging on a monthly basis.\n\n",

      "body": "The market once again went into irrational euphoria unsupported by macroeconomic and financial backing - another market hysteria, 2.6 trillion Nvidia capitalization with fierce buying as if 6x growth since early 2023 and doubling early 2024 didn't happen.\n\nNvidia has created 1.2 trillion in capitalization since Dec. 23 (including May 23 pre-market) - more than the capitalization of all publicly traded companies in major countries around the world combined, and that's just capitalization gains. \n\nNvidia's importance (in terms of triggering value creation in the financial markets) dwarfs any macroeconomic report, any Fed statement, and even geopolitical events, overshadowing the media agenda with the hype around AI.\n\nThe fact is that Nvidia's annual revenue is 80 billion (potential 110 billion) with earnings of 42.5 billion (potential around 60 billion), i.e. a forward P/S of around 24 and a P/E of 42-45. At current potential, Nvidia is worth 5-6x its peers on P/S and 2x on P/E.\n\nGiven its monopoly position, margins are indeed prohibitive, but first, AI datacenter expansion is being done by only a few dozen companies globally and there are no plans to expand the list due to the high entry threshold, and second, large capital expenditures are highly cyclical and such a frenzy will not happen in 2-3 years.\n\nNvidia no longer has the \"key to success\" as all other business segments (Gaming and AI PC, Professional Visualization, Automotive and Robotics) are literally insignificant on the scale of current results, generating about $12-14 billion in revenue per year with a declining trend. These segments will generate $15.1 billion in 2020, $15.5 billion in 2021, $11.5 billion in 2022, $13.1 billion in 2023, and the potential for up to $13 billion in 2024. Prospects - None, all the potential is in data centers only.\n\nIt is impossible to extrapolate the current growth rates of Nvidia's financial indicators - the results are already close to the limit, given the hype, and in 2-3 years the results will begin to decline, and the margin will shrink, because competitors - primarily AMD - can come to the profitable place. Google, Amazon and Intel are also trying to enter the market.\n\nAll of Nvidia's dominance is due solely to data centers, i.e. almost 90% of revenue is now generated in this segment. In 8 years, revenue has grown by two orders of magnitude (100x) in supplying data centers under AI.\n\nEven if Nvidia achieves potential results, the current capitalization is already 2.5x the market. Even in the most favorable scenario, buyers of nVidia at 2.6 trillion capitalization already have no realistic upside (suicidal and crazy), but have unlimited downside in the long run.\n\nThere is no doubt that Nvidia will repeat Cisco's 1999-2001 pattern (see the historical chart). Not because Nvidia is bad (best technology solutions on the market and great products), but because the market is crazy.",

You won't see any sort of returns within the next 3-5 years, might be even longer. \n\nPoint 2: genuine question, what's the innovation ability of US companies that actually outpaced other countries?  The big ones on EV , US companies definitely is lagging behind. Ford vs BYD.  ( I don't think the analysts here are necessary incorrect but maybe a bit early.) \n\nPoint 3: why is the fed being accommodating? How long does it usually take for interest rate impact to fully kick in and reflect into the economy? We had just experienced the fastest rate hike in the past few decades. Fed literally took just 1 year (2022) to raise rate to peak. So we really only had 1 year ish since we stopped raising rates.  Based on various research (don't take my words for it, feel free to Google), it takes AT LEAST 1 year for each rate hike's impact to reach the overall economy.  You should wait at least till end of year to see the actual impact by rate hikes.  \n\nIn addition, I still have doubt about the fed being accommodating. People were way too optimistic. Recall the market rally since end of 2023? They just printed articles saying fed may reduce rate as early March! (At one point the sentiment was showing over 60% probability of that.) Fed is just doing what they're doing and \"people\" are just shouting their predictions and pushing their narratives on to ppl. \n\nPoint 4: market crash is not feared...? How are many of these companies pushing for crazy valuation and all time high stock price? I think devil's in the details. You look at actions not what they're saying.  Buffet saying it's great time to save on taxes. Regardless, he's selling to accumulate cash position. This goes along with other CEOs/directors of major corp... Jeff Bezos, mark Zuckerberg, the Walton family, Jamie Dimon, Leon Black  etc are ALL selling. U think retail investors who's dca on a monthly basis will have as much impact as ppl such as Jeff Bezos selling like 8 billion dollars ?  \n\nI don't know the market inside out and I sure don't have as much info than these ppl. But if they're beginning to offload their shares in the billions, should we really not consider that as a potential sign at all? \n\n\nMy 2 cent, feds will NOT lower the rates until something major happen. Feds usually only lower rates in an aggressive manner when the market needs saving. So for people who are expecting the feds to lower the rates rapidly, I just don't share the same sentiment. There's a higher chance that feds rate will remain at the current level much longer. (Also chance to even increase the rates further due to the historical high level of debt Biden managed to get us into. )",
