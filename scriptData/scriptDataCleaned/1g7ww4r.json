In fact it‚Äôs a major hurdle. The infrastructure for the workers to live (there are as many workers as people in the city) the waterlines has been offically completed  (which was another major concern for the doubling and future doubling of the town) the government  has already approved millions in loans to help speed up developers putting up modular homes and building new permanent homes at a significantly faster rate. The mine has a 20 year plan to extract from above the water table. And 20 years under the water table. They also are the only company with a permit to mine in the 1.5 trillion dollar lithium deposit. It‚Äôs a multi year process to even get a permit and nobody else there has even started. That is why I chose to get in long before 2027 when the mine will be operational. 30% of extremely detailed engineering for future phases is already complete.

The trouble with LAC's Thacker Pass deposit is the concentrate produced isn't a high margin business as it needs to be further refined into a hydroxide or carbonate form.

During the lithium price spike, we actually found lot of high quality lithium deposits and realized it really isn't as rare as everyone thought. If we see another supply squeeze like the one during the pandemic, this bet could pay off but I think you'd be better off picking a more high quality, low risk producer. \n\nread more about lithium here:  \n[https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/lithium-sector-outlook-costs-and-margins-confirmation-CD.html](https://pages.marketintelligence.spglobal.com/lithium-sector-outlook-costs-and-margins-confirmation-CD.html)",

GM investing in $LAC for 20 year rights is a solid play on their end. The Ford MachE extended range as an example is not eligible for the $7,500 tax credit because the vehicle must be 60% American. The battery pack alone is a huge chunk of the parts content. Currently lithium is only coming from overseas so the only option is to start sourcing domestically. EVs will take of.

And nothing else comes along that might displace the primary use for lithium.\n\nBut full production for Thacker is slated for 2028, and there's a lot that can happen.\n\nThat's all I'm saying, from my point of view, 2028 was too far out to project, and I think the current excitement will fade for this particular project from the start date until production comes on line.

For stationary power applications, hydrogen has to become cheaper than propane, and have the supporting infrastructure. Propane also has an infinite shelf life and the margin that Hydrogen can try to have an advantage over propane is extremely narrow, and it lacks the infrastructure of propane.\n\nAn exception would be a breakthrough in technology that allows water to be broken down into hydrogen with very little input power. Generally, the return of energy in vs. energy out to produce hydrogen is the deal-breaker.",
