(NASDAQ: TSLA), has publicly rejected Elon Musk's latest pay package, citing his extreme right-wing views as the primary reason.\n\nAn ISIS spokesperson, who requested anonymity, stated, \"Elon Musk's extreme right-wing stances and recent actions are incompatible with our core values and objectives. As significant stakeholders in Tesla, we cannot endorse a pay deal that rewards such behavior. Our organization stands firmly against any alignment with his ideologies.\"\n\nThe pay deal in question, a multi-billion dollar compensation plan, has been a subject of intense debate among Tesla shareholders. With ISIS holding a substantial share, their rejection poses a significant obstacle for Musk.\n\nWhen approached for a comment, Elon Musk refused to respond, leaving many to speculate on his next move in this ongoing corporate drama.",

The firm said that Tesla met the pay package’s performance objectives, and it recognized the company’s substantial growth in size and profitability. But concerns about Musk spending too much time on other ventures that were raised in 2018 and since then have not been sufficiently addressed, ISS said. “The grant, in many ways, failed to achieve the board’s other original objectives of focusing CEO Musk on the interests of Tesla shareholders, as opposed to other business endeavors, and aligning his financial interests more closely with those of Tesla stockholders,” ISS wrote.\"_",

If I'm reading this wrong, I would really like to know what I'm missing. Thanks. \n\n\nPALO ALTO, Calif., Jan. 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tesla today announced a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting entirely contingent on achieving market cap and operational milestones that would make Tesla one of the most valuable companies in the world. In order to fully vest, Tesla's market cap would have to grow to $650 billion (an increase of almost $600 billion), and important revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved. The award is modeled after Elon's 2012 performance award, which helped bring about a more than 17-fold increase in Tesla's market cap in the five years after it was put in place.\n\nElon will receive no guaranteed compensation of any kind - no salary, no cash bonuses, and no equity that vests simply by the passage of time. Instead, Elon's only compensation will be a 100% at-risk performance award, which ensures that he will be compensated only if Tesla and all of its shareholders do extraordinarily well. Because all Tesla employees are provided equity, this also means that Elon's compensation is tied to the success of everyone at Tesla.\n\nCEO Performance Award Details\n\nThe performance award consists of a 10-year grant of stock options that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair of milestones are both met.\n\nMarket Cap Milestones: To meet the first market cap milestone, Tesla's current market cap must increase to $100 billion. For each of the remaining 11 milestones, Tesla's market cap must continue to increase in additional $50 billion increments. Thus, for Elon to fully vest in the award, Tesla's market cap must increase to $650 billion.\n \n\nOperational Milestones: To meet the operational milestones, Tesla must meet a set of escalating Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA targets (the only adjustment to EBITDA is for stock-based compensation). These milestones are even more directly aligned with shareholder value creation than those used in Elon's 2012 performance award. They are designed to ensure that as Tesla's market cap grows, the company is also executing well on both a top-line and bottom-line basis.\n\nFor each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Elon will vest in stock options that correspond to 1% of Tesla's current total outstanding shares (1% of that amount is approximately 1.69 million shares). If none of the 12 tranches is achieved, Elon will not receive any compensation.\n\nLeading Tesla Through Its Next Phase of Growth\n\nFor vesting to occur when the milestones are met, Elon must remain as Tesla's CEO or serve as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, in each case with all leadership ultimately reporting to him. This ensures that Elon will continue to lead Tesla's management over the long-term while also providing the flexibility to bring in another CEO who would report to Elon at some point in the future. Although there is no current intention for this to happen, it provides the flexibility as Tesla continues to grow to potentially allow Elon to focus more of his attention on the kinds of key product and strategic matters that most impact Tesla's long-term growth and profitability",
