  "score": 61,
  "selftext": "Genuine question to the people that hold Tesla stock for the long term or are currently buying the dip. What will be the final straw that causes you to sell the stock? The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says? \n\nI hold no positions in Tesla but have a bearish view because I think their valuation is too high.",

Why will the stock stop going down?\n\nIndeed, if the stock recovered 38% in the foreseeable future, maybe you should hold?\n\nIt’s super common for people to refuse to lock in loses. They are painful. I’ve been there myself. But ask shareholders of numerous large cap stocks of the dot com era who said exactly what you’re saying now … many of those stocks never recovered or took decades to recover.\n\nYou do you, but don’t lull yourself into the idea that TSLA *has* to eventually recover 38% because it was once valued at that price.\n\nIndeed, I can make the case that Tesla goes belly-up … and with all of Elon’s pivots (the latest being the robotaxi, but the last one I recall was trying to recast the entire company as an AI play) he seems to be all but admitting the fact that the company’s current product is dying on the vine.\n\nDisclosure:  I don’t own an EV and, liberal as I am, cannot see me ever buying a *pure* EV in my lifetime. I also think Musk is a shrewd but egotistical conman addicted to power and attention who has so badly tarnished the brand I would never buy a vehicle from his company.

The company is out of Germany and just went public about 6 months ago. This may be a buy and hold for me.\n\nI want to see what happens. Besides the looks of this cool little sporty city EV, the way they have marketed the car, has made me want to buy and hold. I may be stupid for doing this, but they market the car as a 2nd vehicle.\n\nMost other EV car makers want you to leave your combustion engines cars behind all together, and I think that's where the disconnect is for the majority of the population to go electric. \n\nThis company realized that 98% of people 98% of the time are doing in town/in city commutes, so if you don't have to haul something big or make bug grocery hauls everyday, then this car can save you 100s of dollars per week and 1000s of dollars in the long run on combustion engine maintenance and repairs. \n\nPlus, we all know combustion cars get the worst gas mileage when driving in city limits. You can also take this car on the highway too. 150 miles is a good range for city commuting. \n\nRight now the car hasn't made its way to America yet, but when they do, you better believe they will be popular in big cities like LA, San Francisco, and New York, which are the most densely populated cities in America, and over half of them just happen to be tree hugging hippies who want to save the environment lol. So this car will be an instant hit in those cities. \n\nThey have over 1000 cars on the road now in other counties, and they will only be $25k when they come to America. I'm not a professional investor. I'm just using a little common sense and the type of culture we live in today to make this bet. 😆",

Car prices/battery repair costs will continuously rise.   mass adoption began 2017 battery life expectancy =7-10 years.  Battery replacements will total a vast amount of teslas.  \n\n\n2.  Insurance policies for autonomous drivers is going to be nigh impossible to navigate for tesla as they will could be held liable for accidents.   \n\n\n3.  Power required from the grid prohibits run away demand for the product as there simply is not enough power locally or nationally to sustain a population primarily using EVs.   \n\n\n4.  Cobalt and other necessary materials were already rare before.   They will become so rare that it could killed the ev market for all but the rich.   \n\n\n\n\nWe shall see tho.  I'm a moron so if u think I'm wrong then ur probably right.   That's how I see it going tho.  ",

FSD, Semi, Roadster, Hyperloop etc. \n\nThe product line is old and there are multiple compelling products. In the US, the most lucrative segment is the boxy crossover and Tesla has no product to compete. Model Y filled that gap to an extent but now there are options. Rivian, Kia, Chevy etc. \n\nIn other markets where sedans still sell a lot, the is significant competition from the Chinese. It is a race to the bottom on that segment and Tesla can’t compete on cost with those manufacturers. \n\nTrucks. Well, the jury is out on CT but I think that it will be a niche at best and a failure at worst.\n\nSoftware was a differentiator until 2020 but most of the Industry has caught up and some have even surpassed at the moment.

So current demand issues aside and current issues with how developed the technology (i.e. batteries) are and the cost of the parts, I believe absolutely that EV's will be 100% of the auto market one day. Tesla I think is best positioned to capitalize on this and to make a lot of money as a result. I don't think anyone will be close to them for a good few years in their ability to manufacture desirable cars at the cost levels they can achieve.\n\n2. Self-driving is an AI problem, and my understanding is that data is the number one need to solve it. No one comes close to the data Tesla has and every day their ability to collect data is increasing faster than anyone else. With FSD12 I think they are on the cusp of solving it and expect within a couple of years to see substantial revenue from that, including robo-taxi and self-driving trucks.\n\n3. Going all EV requires substantial improvements to electrical infrastructure with local and grid batteries underlying that. Tesla with its 4680 dry cells seems to be on the path to become the leader at making batteries at scale for a lower cost than anyone else. The profit potential here is immense.\n\n4. Optimus might be a huge deal, but we can ignore that.\n\nPoint 1 and 3 this ties into the concept that moving to clean energy will be beneficial in many ways to mankind. I think reduction in pollution and the health benefits associated with it, the reduction in greenhouse gasses (even if you are not convinced this is an issue), avoiding the geopolitical risks, and so on make this all inevitable.",

When sentiment is down, they are down.\n\nThey benefitted from being the first to market and probably the only company who can actually do this at scale over decades. The failures of others hurt Tesla. Which is weird because it should be the opposite. The groundwork they’ve done is massive though. \n\nI honestly have no idea what a fair value of the company is though. I bought a decent position in the stock when it was trading $220-225 and sold before their last ER and am quite thankful I did. Playing options on them is honestly quite easy (I made money on trading both puts and calls on it today). Dumb luck but it is volatile and every time it goes high for no reason or vice versa I inverse with a close to ITM contract a week+ out and scalp 20-30% in less than a few hours.\n\nI think Cathie Wood is a Elon Musk piss drinker and I think Elon is really never going to be taken seriously.
