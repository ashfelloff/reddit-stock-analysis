Fucking 7% interest on 218k in student loans sucks. 7% on 50k is way more manageable, but idk how I’ll save up that much again. I can’t fucking keep working these kinds of hours. It’s literally all I do - work 13++ hours a day, every day. \n\nThen I see shit like OP and realize it’s better to pay off 170k than losing most of it on a risky call.",

For some reason after I wrote that comment I saw a post in the lawyertalk sub asking about how working remote from home makes you feel and [wrote a fucking manifesto](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawyertalk/s/zzcyT2maiN). I think the writing the post here combined with that question just.. made me feel pretty down. Maybe it’s because I’ll hit 8 years sober on Monday and that also made me think about how the choices I made are now coming to bite me in the ass. \n\nI know shit will get better eventually - until 2020, I don’t think I ever had more than 2k in the bank consistently. Now I’ve been able to save a lot, even if it’s by working a lot. My prospects are better, and at least I have a genuine chance of paying off a debt I really thought would be with me forever. \n\nDammit, here I am doing it again, lol. I need to go find an outside and find a dog to pet or something. Thanks for the comment - I appreciate it a lot, and it actually was something that helped.",
