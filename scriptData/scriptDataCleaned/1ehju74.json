Interest rates are lower from the fed.\n\nSo why are we seeing this insane drop across the DOW and S&P today? I'm trying to understand if there's something I'm missing because this seems like a steep dip too me. I was expecting a little pull back, not having one of the worst days in a long time.",

In part because almost all analysis are thrown to the wind and are only \"made to fit\" in hindsight. I've seen people authoritatively go either way when it comes to crashes and surges in the last three market days. Economy itself is already not an exact science, and stock market speculation, especially on a day-to-day basis, is basically a complete gamble.\n\nNobody is interested in 20 days of \"this might be the crash\" until the crash actually happens and, in hindsight, yeah, kinda obvious that it was the crash. But obviously people, esp casual retail investors like 90% of reddit is, just want line to go up; trading options like puts and calls is mega degenerate gambling that belongs in wallstreetbets unless you're genuinely really well versed in the stock market or have tons of money to hedge, which like I said, it's just not that common in here.\n\nThere really isn't much more to expect from day to day stock megathreads or discussions except \"wow, X stock really did Y huh\" because even great fundamentals some times go haywire, meanwhile stuff like TSLA which is just completely made up, not even in the usual bubble way, is one of the biggest companies in the market. The analysis of earnings tend to be more interesting, but it's always covered in hocus pocus; MSFT crashed tuesday hard due to slight miss of earnings and a worse outlook nad everyone was like \"no make sense the earnings were good but its showing a decrease in growth, the cycle is reaching its drop off point\", but by wednesday when the market just went \"Lol jk\" and nvda surged 13% I already saw people saying \"actually MSFT earnings said that AI is really earning money and that they want to keep investing in it\".\n\nNot only that, but every day \\*someone\\* is talking about a crash; and I mean, its the boom and bust, crashes are literally built into our economic model to happen. It's not just inevitable, it's literally intended and built in through business cycles. So in this insane bull run, every day we've seen a handful of people going \"beware the boom and bust, the crash is always around the corner, the bubble will burst, this is unsustainable\" and it's no wonder that people get tired of reading that every day even if they are right. Market analysts predicted 25 of the last 5 recession and etc.\n\nI guess what i'm trying to say is that this is inevitable whenever you're in any community about stocks that isn't downright scholarly or academical. That and I guess that people like having a silly laugh when they are trending red to decompress rofl.",
