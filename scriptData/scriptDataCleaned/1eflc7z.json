Along the lines of \"if TPUs were so great, why aren't they selling installations to reap the same fever NVDA has?\" Probably for the same reason they still use GPUs themselves.\n\n\nNot to mention - they should be bragging about having a TPU cluster that puts out the most flops at cheapest cost, etc. But they don't, so they don't have it. And Demis strongly suggests it's because the full scale build outs and the problems that come are difficult problems - there is a strong chance they simply cannot build the same scale cluster, the networking and other difficulties are beyond what they have solved.",
