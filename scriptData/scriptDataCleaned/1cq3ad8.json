      "body": "A long time ago (my early 20's) I got a job while I was in college to pay off my semester. I was working the night shift at Chase Bank. At least 100 of fake money orders where it's literally just a pen adding 0's at the end of 10 dollar checks would turn them into 1000 dollar checks.   \n  \nThey were so common that it was my main job to sit in a warehouse of pre-computerized checks and find fake checks from 8pm-4am after classes. They would give me the last 4 digits of the check, and then put me into what amounted to Belle's library full of checks, then tell me to have at it. I would have to guess by address, dates, hints, but there was no direct way to find them other than me pawing my way through hundreds of thousands of checks while listening to the album \"We Were Dead Before The Ship Sank\" (amazing album).\n\nThen we'd do 20 year old things like scrooge mc'ducking the check piles. We didn't have a disposal system for checks, so we just literally placed them in the middle of a giant room and never thought of them again after we closed the door other than jumping in them. We also would do money cart races at the bottom of the bank, blasting rainbow road and trying to make ourselves into gundams using all the leftover cardboard. The operations of this billion dollar bank was mainly left to 20 year olds, and eventually we got laid off after banking went digital. \n\nSo if you ever wondered how they used to find fake checks, or what happens to your check after it gets slurped up, the answer is that we would yell \"check figggght\" while chucking stacks of them at each other. And that is why I don't use Chase bank.",
