It probably makes more sense to think about in terms of hourly income since about 60% of jobs in the US are paid hourly anyways.\n\nI'm not sure if you are are saying my units (annual figures) are not useful or the concept of comparing personal income rate to expense rate for buying someone's time is not useful, but since I addressed the former now I'll try to defend the latter.\n\nAlso to be clear I'm referring to regular recurring habits/expenses (which is why I said \"too expensive to do regularly\") not one-time expenses which come from a discretionary budget you're comfortable spending on whatever.\n\nI've generally found it useful to compare recurring expenses to how much working time it equates to.  When the expense is literally buying someone else's *time* to do a thing I could just do myself easily, this comparison makes it pretty clear whether or not I can afford it.\n\nAs you can probably tell I'm very savings-minded, and a big part of that is talking myself out of spending money on things that I can *pay for* but not really *afford*.  I think most people would serve themselves well by being a bit more savings minded, the only downside is it can be a hard habit to break.  Once I had enough money to afford basically anything I want, it took a few years to start actually spending money on things I used to avoid as too expensive.\n\nWhile I think the economics of the gig delivery industry have some sustainability issues (expensive to most users, low pay for drivers, route merging does not happen often enough to get scaling efficiency) I'm really glad it's around because I use it for absolutely everything.",

If the split goes through it's price will tank accordingly as volatility eats it.\n\nCAVA and SG are just popular now. That may not be true in 10 years. Most of these places go through real business cycles but it's hard to see them at that level because on a chart a decade looks like a blip if the company has been around for multiple decades. MCD is the same, it's had it's highs and its lows over long periods of time, it's been popular and to blame for everything repeatedly. They're used to it.\n\nPiling into what's new and popular is nothing new for market participants. The question of whether you're getting a better deal for A vs B is usually arbitrary and almost all economic considerations don't support these theses rigorously as I know of no one who is hungry enough to drive an extra 15 miles to get to a Cava instead of an McDonald's if they are indifferent and just need to eat.
