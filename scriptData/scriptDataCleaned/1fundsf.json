  "selftext": "What happened the last time there was a war scare? Nothing. It was used as liquidity for the top firms to buy more stocks at the dip. This happens every single time. People panic, the bears come out in full force, enjoy a dip that lasts a total of 1-2 days, only for the market to go back up yet again. \n\nRepeat after me: when everyone expects something, it never happens. Everyone is now expecting a drop because of this Middle East scare. Guess what will happen? Absolutely nothing and the continuation of the uptrend. \n\nThe Iraq War started in March 2003. That was literally the bottom before the stock market went up another 50-60% over the next 9 months. \n\nAlways inverse the panic and you’ll be rich. See you at 600 for SPY and 150 for NVDA ",

It's all to have a firework show that some dumb Arabs (not saying all Arabs are dumb) can see and think Iran are going to kill the Jews. That's all this is about. It's part of the big scrap to be dominant power in the Arab world between Iran and Saudi.\n\nIsrael has nothing that Iran cares about. Not particularly great land, no oil. They are not going to get into a massive war with Israel, killing half a million Iranians for nothing.\n\nMy favourite tip on this is Energean, an Israeli gas platform. It fell 8% today. It falls every time this happens and bounces back in about a month or so. And pays a nice quarterly dividend, so even if it takes a while, you do good on it.",
