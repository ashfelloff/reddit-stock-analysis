The event drew fans from all 50 states and 64 countries worldwide.\n\n• VIEWERSHIP: WrestleMania XL viewership was up 41 percent across both nights versus last year's record-setting audience.\n\n• MERCHANDISE: In partnership with Fanatics, merchandise sales were up more than 20 percent versus the previous record set at WrestleMania 39.\n\n• SOCIAL: WrestleMania XL became the most socially viewed WrestleMania of all time, with over 660 million views consumed over the two days. WWE's YouTube channel saw its most-viewed day in channel history on WrestleMania XL Sunday with more than 67 million views in 24 hours.\n\n• SMACKDOWN: Friday Night SmackDown at Wells Fargo Center drew the largest gate in SmackDown history.\n\n• RAW: Monday Night Raw at Wells Fargo Center drew the largest gate in Raw history.\n\n• NXT: Stand & Deliver was the most-attended NXT event ever with 16,545 in attendance at Wells Fargo\n\nRaw after Wrestlemania ratings: 2,362,000 viewers; 0.83 P18-49 rating.\n\nRaw last year (4/10/23): 1,818,000 viewers; 0.59 P18-49\n\nRaw after Wrestlemania last year (4/3/23): 2,260,000 viewers; 0.76 P18-49\n\nAnd now we have UFC 300 this weekend, so we will see what numbers that puts up but from what I hear, it’s a hot card from top to bottom.",

They're going to get huge exposure from that and grow their audience ever more.  \n\nPlus the product is going to improve 10 fold now that Vince is out of the picture.  He's had WWE completely shackled with his out of touch boomer mentality (anyone who's a wrestling fan knows what I mean) and the talent are now free of all his shitty ideas, his toxic work environment and his unwillingness to try out new ideas and improve the product.  Vince has been holding back WWE and all its talent for years now and it's finally gone.  The company has been profitable despite Vince and now that it's free to reach it's true potential with Triple H in charge, this company is going to be gigantic.  Mark my words.",

Every time we touch close we push back down but I’m still optimistic. It would be great to see if have at least one nice run day where we break $100 before going into earnings so we are at ease a bit.  With the way the companies earnings have effected their prices in the market lately it’s hard to say even if TKO earnings are good if anything in the price would even change. I’m not holding onto this, and I haven’t heard it anywhere at all but TKO obviously wants to impress at these first earnings calls since the merge.

Lots of resistance to push past $97 but if we can break that and hold we should be able to head up to $100-$101 area before we hit a bit more resistance. Hopefully the market can get some good news tomorrow and at least break us up above $97 and with any luck finish the day around or above the $100 tomorrow. If we get Friday sell off.
