  "selftext": "By now most people have noticed sleepy ol' Gold is moving up... and its moving up pretty fast... well at least for GOLD.\n\nNow I read a post from a couple of weeks ago, where someone suggested gold at like 20k in 6 years... erm no. that just wont happen. GOLD while it is heavily traded and the theory is various central banks are buying it up currently causing the increase, its still fundamentally something used aa a commodity\n\nBut if you look at the long term chart, you can see how significant this breakout is. Its literally a decade in the making:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gxsutrvv78zc1.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=db17838abf1f85d5e6f880ee6fd513e2ea5bd591\n\nWhat's telling is that GOLD hit $2000 in 2011 and then fell 50% to $1000, and then has taken another 9 years to test and re-test! $2000, before breaking out.. .\n\n\n\nGREAT, so what? well my charting for dummies expertise tells me that a previous high of $2k, then a fall to $1k, before multiple tests and breakout, points to $3k. with an outside shot, it doubles the previous high and get to $4k!!\n\n\n\nso how do you make money? well, you can buy GLD or some other tracker. or you can take a position in one of the miners.\n\nWhy do this?\n\nBecause simply put its a leverage play. Which bring me to Kinross Gold, KGC\n\nFor full year 2023,\n\nthey produced 2.1m ounces of GOLD.\n\ntheir all in cost for each ounce was $1316/ounce\n\ntheir **av sale price was $1945/ounce**\n\nSo $1.2bprofit, deprecation, other costs etc gave net earnings of $400m\n\n  \n2024 Q1 results inline with the above with an **average sale price of $2070,** Gross profit $570m. adjusted net earning $125m\n\n\n\nSO...... if GOLD moves into a **new price range and averages $2500,** with other costs mainly remains the same. that would get them another $500/ounce on 2.1m ounces = $1.05bn\n\nSo their profit (depending on how they work their accounts) will go up 3.5 X!!!\n\n(the guidance for 2024, 2025, and 2026 is 2.1m ounces. if youre thinking production isnt going up, well just maintaining millions of production in commodities is a big win!!)\n\n  \nSo if EPS is around $0.40 at $2000/ ounce, it could be around $1.20 at $2500/ ounce\n\nSo on a pretty safe PE of 12, and EPS of 1.2 = **$14 a share vs  current share price $7.1**\n\nNOW, in the year to come if prices go up to $3000 and they hedge which is very common with commodities, **EPS could be $2 and at PE of 12=**\n\n **share price of $24!!**\n\n**so even forgetting just GOLD buyer hype, from a fundamentals point of view the share price has huge growth potential based on GOLD sustaining above $2000.**\n\nUsing charting for dummies, heavy resistance at $10, but then pretty clear up to $20\n\nAnd this is why although I have calls in PAA as many do, as a midstream oiler, they dont directly benefit from the increase in oil price, its the volume of flow which benefits them. (OK sure more oil, likely at higher price.. but its not a direct influence). **With KGC they are directly impacted by the GOLD price.**\n\nSo what do you go for? you could just buy some KGC shares... but yeh options is the play.\n\nGOLD does take its time. and so im not banking on any fast moves this year.. hence ive gone with the furthest out calls i can get:\n\nJan 26 $10 calls. currently around $.70 so if we manage to get to $20, thats an almost 15X return which isnt too bad given the fact that this a fundamentals plays and the calls are so far out.\n\nCAVEAT, I do expect a drop in GOLD sometime soon.. so Im preparing to add to my position in KGC if GOLD falls back to around $2200\n\n\n\n\n\nLink to KGC earnings reports: \n\n[https://www.kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2024/Kinross-reports-2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results/default.aspx](https://www.kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2024/Kinross-reports-2023-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-results/default.aspx)\n\n[kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2024/Kinross-reports-2024-first-quarter-results/default.aspx](http://kinross.com/news-and-investors/news-releases/press-release-details/2024/Kinross-reports-2024-first-quarter-results/default.aspx)\n\nDYOR\n\n\n\n\n\n",
