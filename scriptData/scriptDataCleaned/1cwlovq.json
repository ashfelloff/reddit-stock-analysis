  "selftext": "Many macro factors such as one of the lowest housing turnovers and lack of interest rate cuts and high debt contribute to holding this back\n\n‚ÄúHome Depot has more exposure to the professional channel, being 50% of sales. Lowes is only about 25% of sales. The pro market historically remains more resilient compared to DIY. People are pulling back on DIY‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm in home improvement sales and can see the lower sales across the whole industry in the professional space but also a decrease in DIY projects makes sense also as most people already finished those during pandemic times. \n\nThere‚Äôs historically the lowest turnover in home sales also indicating a lesser demand in home improvements.\n\nHome Depot already reported last week and missed revenue and they are the leader in the space. People only go to Lowe‚Äôs when it‚Äôs not available at Home Depot generally speaking. \n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on PUTS going into earnings. I‚Äôm holding four puts through earnings of $LOW strike price $230 at 5/31 expiry \n",
