I have not heard of a single problem with financing or re-financing in my market despite some obvious vacancies. At least out here the vast majority of CRE is held by a few extremely wealthy folks / land barons with the collateral to weather a storm.  Your market may vary, real estate is extremely local, yada yada.\n\nI just went under contract this week on a unit so if it is going to die will probably crater in late August immediately after I close!",
