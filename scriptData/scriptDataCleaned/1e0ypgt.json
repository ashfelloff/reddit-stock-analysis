Reuters said the NextGen vehicle was cancelled and TSLA dropped 8%. Elon manipulated the price by creating the hype around a vague announcement. Then, a short while later, Elon signed an \"FSD deal\" with Chinese tech giant Baidu, and the stage was set for bulls to say that Baidu was licensing FSD and this was \"proof\" that the 8/8 reveal was the real deal.

Musk is clearly bored of it. The problem is that all his wealth is in tsla stock so somehow he has to convert that into money without harming the price too much. One way would be to award himself a $56bn pay deal, take it in stock and attempt to dump it on the market. This probably isn't going to work. Another would be to sell the car business and branding to another car manufacturer and make Tesla a Virgin-style brand factory, focusing on AI or whatever the newest snake oil is.

They were first to mass market a quality EV offering and were handsomely rewarded for their ingenuity, so in 2018-2019, the lottery won if they could profitably build a reasonably cheap car for the (upper-)middle class. They did...and then covid hit and they hit insane margins. With an ever rising market cap, the lottery payout is just getting smaller and smaller. Plus, with a market cap well beyond automaker, you are betting on future technology that might not be the best nor first to market. TSLA is a start-up with an awkwardly attached sagging auto-biz.\n\nAt this point, it is clear that if/when Tesla rolls out a L4/L5 FSD, it will have tons of competition. There are thousands of driverless vehicles operating right now globally. Exactly zero are Tesla. Their proprietary 4680 battery experiment failed. Their energy products are essentially bought on the open market and put into a rack. Car sales will modestly decline YoY, while margins will steadily declined. S/X pretty much dead now that real luxury models are available. DoJo(ke) hasn't done shit and the likelihood of it generating any revenue in the future is near zero. They still run them in-house, but I'm curious if that's only because they can't afford/procure more H100s, which are clearly more cost effective to run. The low-quality tech and deceptive presentation of Optimus leads me to believe that Tesla knows their robot is kinda bullshit. Figure has $754M being spent right now and it looks sick. I don't think Tesla can swing that kind of R&D on the robot when they have all these other technologies to also be investing in.",
