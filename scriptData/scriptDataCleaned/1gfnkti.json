  "selftext": "From an article yesterday on Yahoo Finance courtesy of Insider Monkey, the day before Ernst & Young resigns as their accountant and the stock drops by 1/3. The stock market lottery has a surprise around every corner. Long, short, whatever you want, there's a chance. If this convinced you to get back in yesterday, what a surprise was in store today.  \n\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage.\n\nAt the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers.\n\nThough not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro’s revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market’s explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers.\n\nThe confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built.\n\nThe soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds.\n\n[Scout Investments, Inc](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/scout-investments-inc/20489/), an affiliate of [Carillon Tower Advisers](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/carillon-tower-advisers-inc/1984690/), released a second-quarter 2024 investor letter. [**Here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/super-micro-computer-smci-fell-after-disappointing-earnings-guidance-1348885/) is what the fund said:\n\n>\n\nOverall SMCI **ranks 8th** on our list of 8 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Make You Richer. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SMCI, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.",

              "body": "Hey, If you see my reply to my own comment here you will see I'm not someone who invests much time into this stuff so all I can offer is my personal opinion and feeling about ASML.\n\nAll right, that out of the way, here's my thoughts:\n\nASML is not a bad buy unless you are trying to day trade and make yourself a millionaire overnight. ASML is rock solid for long term gains. A very significant portion of the world's technology is dependent on their microchip manufacturing technology. It's important to understand that ASML is not making microchips directly. Idk why but a lot of people seem to think they do so I'm just reiterating that quick. They design and develop the machines that make the microchips. So businesses like intel, samsung, nvidia, amd etc, are all using ASML products to make their products. I think we can all agree that the demand for technology will only increase over time and ASML is foundational to the advancements in technology and especially so for the fact that they are the only ones developing and making EUV Lithography machines which if you dont know, all you need to know is that it means they can squeeze more circuitry into chips this way and that's paramount for higher levels of tech. Ignore the urge to paper hand this stock. Yeah you are at a loss currently from 800 but you can see they have been higher in the past and I see no reason they will not come back up with time. My insight for why ASML is dropping lately is because these machines are VERY expensive and last year was a pretty soft year for sales for them as everyone everywhere has been tightening their grip on spending (except the government of course, haha) for a bit now. Doesn't change the fact that they are a very large root for most everything we enjoy in the modern age and they are the ones leading the development of microchip tech into the future so they will never not be valuable. Their current EUV tech supports circuitry of around 13nm and next gen is looking for about 8nm. Might not sound like much but it is very impressive and will permit even higher levels of functionality and power from chips.\n\nIf you consider Warren Buffet's take on things in the market; \"you choose the company, not the stock\" - to paraphrase. So to that end, I think ASML is def a buy if you have money for that kind of investment because my dealings with them tell me they are foremost in what they do and that's not changing for a long time yet, if ever. $600-700 is a deal for a piece of a company that is fundamental to global technology.\n\nMy 2 cents ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)",
