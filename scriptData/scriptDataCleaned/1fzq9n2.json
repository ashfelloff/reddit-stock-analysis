Everyone thought youtube and instagram purchases were stupid until they weren't. Amazon literally does EVERYTHING. Apple keeps it close but once they expand they rarely fuck up or back out: ipods were a success, phones were a success, watches were a success, tablets were a success, they only left pods because their own phone made their pods obsolete, their payments/data/services so strong it's considered a monopoly case, going into chip design, making buds/pads, etcetc. Google's deepmind despite not showing shit actually leads AI, for each failure like Google plus there are things that remain like mail/voice/maps/etcetcetc, chrome is a top browser competitor, Android is in an oligopoly with IOS on mobile, and Alphabet weaseled it's way into all layers of mobile be it pixel devices, android os, cloud service, google store, chrome browser, google search or youtube, google ads, etcetcetc.\n\nIt's just that the FAAAMs constantly lose money with failures and then cut those failures. Their success rate is probably between 1:10 and 1:100 but that still beats early venture where it's 1:1000 or 1:10000 (but early VCs don't care cause their 1 win is more than enough to cover for the losses).",

                  "body": "Google has ended around 290 products. For comparison META has ended around 20, hard to find exact numbers as some projects end before they’re known about. You can argue that Google is such an innovative company that they just create products nonstop but I would disagree, up until very recently 90% of Google’s total revenue came from ads. Last quarterly report I checked, which was last year 88% of total revenue has come from ads. And that’s only because their cloud service was starting to take off (which is a good thing, diversification is good)\n\nBut I would argue quite the opposite, Google is not innovative at all, they have relied solely on ad revenue since their inception, by definition are a monopoly because of it and gate keep ad revenue for the entire planet. They failed to do anything with Deepmind and AI until Microsoft came knocking with OpenAI, directly threatening their ad revenue stream. Only when their ad revenue was in question did they implement their AI. \n\n\nThey were so late to the cloud party that Azure and AWS already had dominate market shares, both Amazon and Microsoft are two of 3 companies ever to receive IL6 (Impact Level 6) clearance from the US (Palantir being the 3rd) and that’s solely because of their cloud offerings and infrastructure. THEN after all that Google finally decides to join the cloud party and fight a massive uphill battle against AWS and Microsoft Azure. \n\nTo me these are a sign of one of two things; either Google’s C-Suite is incompetent, which I don’t believe. Or Google’s primary focus are ads, and protecting its $300 billion a year revenue stream. \n\nSo when I say Google’s entire business model is convincing governments that they’re not a monopoly I actually mean it. 290ish failed products and no urgency to enter gigantic markets compounds this fact for me.",
