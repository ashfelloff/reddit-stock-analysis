If it was up 100% you could argue that it was undervalued and Wallstreet finally picked up on a golden opportunity but this run up of 200% is definitely not warranted by any financial result or projection.\n\nWith that being said. I hope it runs up even more for everybody. I refuse to short it. But still. Someone is stating the obvious.",
