      "body": "It was already starting to come back down in the pre-mkt. Early on it was over $180, but as it got closer to the open it did come down; CRM was generally around 15-17% down yesterday after hours and this morning pre-mkt. Stock opened and it cratered further - at the open, you started to get more aggressive selling on that and some other tech names. \n\nFeels like people 1) looking for a bit of an excuse to sell after a good run and 2) are rightly concerned when something like CRM that had a good quarter last quarter suddenly downgrades their outlook - \"but AI\" not solving that at all and you have things like CRM where there's some AI benefit but it's not (at least at this point) equivalent to the hype and it's not going to offset if everything else starts to slow. \n\nNo idea what DELL does for earnings later - might be great, no idea - but imo something as big as Salesforce (currently down 20%) cratering I think created concerns that started to snowball as the morning went on. \n\nAnd perhaps that crates a few opportunities. I'd maybe consider adding a little to CRWD if it keeps selling off with the rest of software.",
