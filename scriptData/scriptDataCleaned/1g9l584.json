  "selftext": "NVDA is now over 50% of my portfolio, with 900% gains since I bought it a few years back.\n\nThis makes me uncomfortable, I would like to diversify and spread my risk out a bit to other stocks / ETFs. \n\nNVDA is sitting in a regular brokerage account currently, so if I sell any portion of it I would be subject to long term capital gains. I also have a 401k and a Roth IRA. Are there any creative ways to shift the stock over to those portfolios to save on tax?",

The basic move is buying a put to protect a position, but honestly, that can be pricey.\n\nA more interesting approach some folks take is selling a really deep in-the-money call on a stock that’s already had a huge run. It’s a way to free up some cash without having to sell and pay capital gains taxes. Like, if you’ve got a stock that’s doubled or tripled, you could sell a call a year out with a strike price way below the current price and use that money to buy something else. When interest rates were close to zero, people would even use this trick to buy other stocks on margin, treating the new position as basically having zero delta, so they could safely load up without much risk\n\"\"\"",
