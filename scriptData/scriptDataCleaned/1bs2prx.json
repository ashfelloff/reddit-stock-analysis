          "body": "23andme is pretty much dead, the recent databreach did them in.\n\nBut yeah at this point pretty much every single American's name, DOB, SSN, employment history, credit scores, email, phones, addresses are all fully available en bulk for like free or a few bucks on the dark web. Pretty much every corp has leaked data like a sieve with IT setup by Bob The Pervert in 1992 and hasn't been updated. And these are just ones we've heard about publicly.\n\nRemember when Equifax+TransUnion leaked everyone's information and everyone just collectively shrugged?? good times.\n\nI'll repeat some steps that everyone here should do (but some won't because they're regarded but I'll keep repeating this incase it helps even just *1* person avoid getting scammed and dealing with hours of fighting fraud):\n\n1. Toggle 100% credit freeze on TU/Experian/Equifax (sign up on their sites with your info before someone else uses your info to sign up for you). Do this now if you haven't. It's just too important.  Yeah its annoying if you need to open a new line of credit but at least you can just go in and toggle it off for a 72-hour period . It's better to be in control of this yourself than having someone just buy your dopey DOB and SSN for $1 and open $50,000 in credit lines in your name without you even knowing it.\n2. Sign up for [SSA.gov](https://SSA.gov) with your SSN before someone else does. This at least locks it in place and you have full control over your Social Security account in perpertuit. Otherwise if you haven't signed up, someone else will.\n3. Make sure you got solid Authenticator 2FA on everything important from Robinhood, Vanguard, Banks, whatever. Don't use email 2FA if you can avoid it. This one is stupidly obvious I feel stupid even putting it out there... and yet there are still people not using it.\n4. If your cell service has it, use EID/eSIM registration instead of SIM card. Getting SIM-jacked is only marginally worse than getting cum-jacked\n5. If your bank offers free credit monitoring (most good ones should), set it up to send you an monthly report so you can at least review and make sure no one is opening cell phones or credit lines or taking out car loans in your name or whatever. CreditKarma fucking sucks ass, don't use them.\n6. I put a monthly calendar reminder on my phone to force myself to go through all of my debit/credit statements at the end of the month just to scan for fraudulent shit. I absolutely hate doing this, I'd rather eat a fucking light bulb, but I really have to do it -- and everyone else should too. It's so easy for credit card numbers to get scammed out the wazoo these days. Think about how many apps you probably entered payment information and then think about how many are setup by incompetent Bob The Pervert and barely functioning VC garbage.  If you catch fraud charges quick enough, disputing and getting money back isn't that hard but it gets more annoying the longer they're there. Just do it as a habit.\n\nWe're in the scam economy folks.  It's just scams from here on out. The amount of scam texts I've been getting the past 12 months is up like 500%, it's just non-stop.\n\nI really feel like a gay ass 90-year-old boomer having to type that shit up, but it can be no joke. You might be poor nobody working at Wendys with -$1000 on margin calls, but someone can turn that into -$100,000 in your name popping open a bunch of credit lines, buying a new car, and then flying to the Bahamas on your information. Nobodies are the perfect targets because they also don't check or think about any of this shit.\n\nIf you only do one thing, it's at the very least having accounts setup in your name, and if you only do one other thing it's at least setting hard credit pull freezes.",

It's easily hacked and not secure at all. There's also been some.. weird stuff happening around the internet recently to various people that I know who rely on it, I'm kinda becoming skeptical that there isn't some kind of google password manager breaching or some kind of thing that can get info out of it going around right now.\n\nBut overall secure passwords are less important if you use 2FA/MFA cause at least you should get notification if someone is logging in. I consider the era of *\"just have a secure password!*\" to be largely el passe wisdom myself, it's good advice but one one of the least important things to do for personal security compared to everything else.",

I went to the AT&T store and finally got the number back, then as soon as I got home and started calling banks, they took the number back over. It took about 100 hours over 2-3 month in total restoring and locking down my identity after this, but it taught me a lot. I also got a $500 neiman marcus gift card in the mail for being a valued customer so that was dope. \n\nBut if you want to avoid the possibility of this headache I suggest you create accounts with experian, equifax, and transunion and lock your credit files and get with a phone provider that doesn’t allow you to switch phones without okaying either via an app or email or some other form of authentication beyond the pin they usually have you set up for protection",
