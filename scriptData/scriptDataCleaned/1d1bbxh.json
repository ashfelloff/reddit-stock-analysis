Apple didn‚Äôt spend building and marketing their search engine, they instead made billions from the real estate in everyone‚Äôs pockets. I think they should repeat this, it takes  tens of thousands of Nvidia H100s plus Datacenters, years, data, thousands of engineers and megawatts of electricity to make their own. why not just make the AI companies compete for the Real Estate. The Nvidia H100s are gonna be depreciating asset as more advanced chips such as Blackwell or other competitors replace them. Not to forget that most companies haven‚Äôt found a way to monetize this except adding to current products or optimizing production.",

They let the market figure things out, just like they did with apps, and just like they did with the iPhone, and then buy the very best and let the others duke it out.\n\nWhat Apple is doing with AI is exactly what Apple has done with every other technology wave.

They‚Äôre just going to come out with the absolutely most kick ass version of it that everybody wants years after investors and entrepreneurs have done all the work and let everybody else make all the mistakes first.\n\nSop.",

Apple‚Äôs strategy rarely worked outside of the hardware domain, in which they had/have some of the best talent in the world in terms of engineering,  design, manufacturing, supply chain, etc.\n\nBut when it comes to service software, Apple doesn‚Äôt have such advantage. Apple Maps and Siri do not live up to the standard of their hardware. Apple TV is decent but it‚Äôs got no tech advantage over any of the other streaming services.\n\nNow when it comes to AI, follow the talent. The best and brightest are going to a few top companies in the world right now but Apple isn‚Äôt one of those destinations. It‚Äôs a field that requires just as much compute as it requires human talent.\n\nFor example Apple succeeded in the SoC product line because it managed to get some of the best talent in the world through [acquisitions](https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/technology/28apple.html#:~:text=Apple%20wants%20the%20fastest%20chip,often%20found%20in%20mobile%20devices. ) and aggressive hiring. But unless Apple buys Mistral (unlikely) or OpenAI (almost impossible), it won‚Äôt have the talent war chest required to fight this campaign.\n\nBtw not only did I work for 15 years in the valley, a close family member of mine recently got a ML/AI PhD from a top university/advisor and the offers he‚Äôs been getting almost makes *me* jealous lol.",

Apple was able to buy Intrinsity for a fraction of the value of what AI startups are worth today.\n\nDoes Apple have a huge cash reserve? Yes it does, but making huge acquisitions has never been its modus operandi. What‚Äôs the largest acquisition Apple has ever done? It's barely $3B when they bought Beats. \n\nBy comparison Anthropic is valued at $20B, and OpenAI is valued at $100B. Apple has never made purchases close to that size.\n\nWhich is why I don‚Äôt think Apple‚Äôs traditional playbook applies in the software world today.\n\nThen there is the culture differences of building software vs. building hardware. Apple Maps and Siri are prime examples of Apple's software game being significantly behind their hardware game. \n\nBut again, it would be great if you can share some insights too. I‚Äôm sure you have valuable perspectives.",

Total Comp for senior engineers at those places are well into the 7 figures.\n\nAmongst other big companies, I would say Meta stands on it own. Not only do they pay top $$$, stuff like [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/) is almost the standard in the industry. They are a heavy weight that contributes a lot.\n\nThen there are super high profile startups like Anthropic and Mistral. Not very familiar with the latter since it's not a SV company, but Anthropic's offer package is known for having as much *salary* as the TC of other FAANG companies ($4-600k), *plus* ISOs that's likely worth millions down the road.\n\n>And where is the mid to low talent going?\n\nAlmost all tech company are hiring AI talents, the non-top tier talents will most likely work in the application domain instead of cutting edge research.",
