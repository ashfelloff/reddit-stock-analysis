They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick [http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/](http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/)\n\n>I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history \"The Unauthorized Bio\" with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released \"$200 Billion Broadband Scandal\" in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't. I updated the book in 2015 \"The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net\", but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting.\n\n>**We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion.**\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5\\_how\\_were\\_isps\\_able\\_to\\_pocket\\_the\\_200\\_billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c5e97/eli5_how_were_isps_able_to_pocket_the_200_billion)\n\nAlmost everyone in the US should have fiber internet by now, but we're still comparatively stuck in the dark ages because companies like Intel took federal funding and then continued on with business as usual.\n\nThe possibility of Intel doing something similar is an extremely serious issue, and it can't be allowed to happen again.",

The CHIPS Act, which was passed in 2022, allocated $52 billion for semiconductor manufacturing and research, with Intel being one of the primary beneficiaries. This is where they expressed interest in expanding to Ohio and got the funding to develop. The company has also received various forms of government support, including subsidies, tax incentives, and grants aimed at promoting semiconductor manufacturing and research in the United States. In 2017, Intel was awarded $39 million in tax incentives from the state of Arizona to expand its manufacturing facilities in the state. Intel has also participated in various government-funded research initiatives. For instance, the National Science Foundation (NSF) which has funded research projects in collaboration with Intel to advance semiconductor technology and innovation. Intel has received contracts from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for research and development in semiconductor technology, particularly for applications related to national security. Intel has also benefited from federal and state tax credits aimed at encouraging investment in research and development (R&D) and manufacturing. The federal R&D tax credit has been a significant incentive for Intel and other tech companies.\n\n\nURLs:\n\nhttps://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2017/12/14/intel-receive-39-million-tax-incentives-arizona/951052001/\n\nhttps://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/partnerships/\n\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/industry/2021/06/08/intel-aims-to-boost-us-defense-tech-with-new-partnerships/\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/research-credit\n\nhttps://www.theverge.com/24166234/chips-act-funding-semiconductor-companies\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I was wrong regarding the CHIPS act, but apparently the only reason they haven’t gotten the money is because they wouldn’t be able to even accomplish the bare minimum requirements.

The milestones are not hard to fulfill. They just have to fulfill the bare minimum of building, opening and operating the plants, with set amount of the grant being awarded at certain points of that process. My point is that after they finish building them, it's unclear whether they will just downsize and run at minimum capacity or shutter the plant after a few years. And at that point, who knows if the money can be clawed back.\n\n>Even after announcing layoffs and cutting the company’s long-prized dividend, Gelsinger has said Intel remains dedicated to its manufacturing road map. Schmidt, asked about Intel’s most recent earnings report, pointed to those remarks. And if there are setbacks, the Chips Act has a built-in insurance policy: Companies won’t receive money until they hit specific construction and production benchmarks, and CPO can claw back already-disbursed funds if projects are never completed.\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-09/with-us-chips-act-money-mostly-divvied-up-the-real-test-begins?embedded-checkout=true",
