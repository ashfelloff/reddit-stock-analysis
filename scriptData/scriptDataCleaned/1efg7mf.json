But 20 sells in one month right before earnings when the stock has 4x’d in one year…a year after it did the same thing and doubled, that’s a tell that he is taking some equity off the board while it’s at a high because he thinks it might level out for a while. I’m more skeptical of repeated buys because of what it signals. It’s not, “I need 5 billion for a yacht”, it’s a silent taking the chips off the table. This is his cash in month.\n\nRemember, he knows the business better than anyone. He knows the market share they will lose to the big tech folks 5 years from now when AI starts designing the hardware and building it for companies like Amazon, Apple, Google and Meta. He understands that they are an early rising tree in a forest with some bigger trees closing in behind him.  \n\nNvidia feels like a 3T company now, but it’s not. Those 4 tech giants will outpace Nvidia eventually with their own internalized products once AI is more involved in governance, and Nvidia will recede to half of their value. Don’t believe me? That’s what’s happened to every other tech company that rose like Nvidia. Nvidia is a player, but they are not the same caliber. Nvidia will still be a player, but they’ll be a like Netflix and they’ll take the backseat on the FAANG, Mag7 bandwagon. \n\nTLDR: Meta, Google, Apple and Amazon all have cloud, hardware, retail, industrial, SaaS and consumer components. Nvidia doesn’t. They are like Netflix. Not enough faces to keep rising with the other big names. They’ll have half the market share of those 4 in 5 years.",

Still, I'll concede that he obviously knows more than we do, so keeping an eye on future 10b-5 filings will be important. \n\nI agree that all semis (even AI chips) are cyclical. The question is how long the buildout will last and when it does taper, what will the replacement rate look like. Personally, I don't think the buildout is slowing any time soon. It could take 2 to 3 years. Maybe longer, but that's hopium speculation. For now, it's still blowing up, so I'm going to try to capitalize on it.",
