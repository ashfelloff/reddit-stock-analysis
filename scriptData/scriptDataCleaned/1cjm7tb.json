You bought safe puts. If anything I would average down on them if SPY hikes on Monday. I have a deep intuition that we will dump towards the end of next week. That bounce on Friday was because of a BS downwardly revised job report and because of Tim Cook announcing an insane cash buyback on Apple. It‚Äôs a dangerous time to trade options though, SPY is trading like a meme stock right now. I‚Äôve lost my shirt and even my pants these past 2 months. But I honestly think your position will be fine. Just don‚Äôt be greedy. \nOn Monday I‚Äôm probably going to get QQQ puts around that same expiration",
