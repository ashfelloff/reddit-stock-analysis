The only reason why I even bothered reading their shit is because the underlying report was done by Bain.\n\nThat Morgan Stanley projection yesterday talking about 450k chips / $10B in q4 revenue for Blackwell alone shouldn’t sound surprising to anyone paying attention. \n\nBtw energy for these DCs is going to be a big thing — that’s what the OpenAI meeting in the White House recently was about. Drop some regarded ticker suggestions with some sort of DD in the comments if you’d like — it is in fact, a dIscUsSiOn post.\n\nAs for the berrs  — fatten up on those baconators because it’s going to be a long hibernating winter.\n\n\nPositions: $100k in NVDA leaps and shares",
