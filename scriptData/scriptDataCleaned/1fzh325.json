AMD has the lead in AI interfacing speed.  After the model is trained, AMD chips are faster at using it.\n\nFor Nvidia to double, it needs to double its already crazy high earnings.  Possible, but very difficult due to chip capacity.  They are selling everything.  Hard to double without double the sales.\n\nAMD on the other hand can easily double, and its eps is set to double by this time next year.  Then it can double again.  Id bet AMD can double for 2-3 years in a row.\n\nTheres zero chance Nvidia can do this (baring market psychopathy).\n\nJust my thoughts.  Buy AMD.",
