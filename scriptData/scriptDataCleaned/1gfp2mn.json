If it's out of the money and expires you are SOL and lose what ever it cost to buy the options. \n\nThat being said unless your trading some no name company or something stupid like a put for Tesla reaching 50 by end of the week it's pretty much a non issue.\n\n In OPs case it's a heavily traded company and the option is in the money so it will sell as soon as they press the sell button",
