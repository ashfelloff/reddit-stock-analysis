We’ve had substantial selling the last few days and although people are using macro weakness as the reason for this sell-off, these are the same macro trends we have seen for months now with the fed forcing weakness into the economy to cut down inflation. I’ve been looking for the capitulation for months now, and this move has happened 2 or 3 other times since October with semis leading into the downside but market always gets bought up because at the end of the day the fed continues on track to cut rates and flood the market with money. Not saying we may not have another day or 2 of selling before this hits a stop, but I personally don’t think this is the true down move yet but rather just the market throwing a tantrum to get what it wants. This crash will definitely come, but as long as the fed can continue to push liquidity in I don’t think anything has really changed.",

We’ve been on back and forth Middle East war fears, climbing debt (especially at the household level through credit cards and other buy now pay later methods), government inflated job market. My point is that we have been in the silent depression for months now, but markets have continued to find a reason to go up. AI has always been a nothing burger, yet now people actually have decided to ask about ROIs? Why was that never a question 6 months ago when NVDA had already double their revenue just selling this scam? All I’m trying to say is that it’s very easy to create any narrative you want and give rationale to moves, when in reality the only thing that has driven this market up has been easy money pouring in and that idea has not changed. I would argue that we will actually see a massive spike in the coming months to make highs in the market before that is finally exhausted and people run into real fear with the pretense that we no longer have anything to save use given the fed exhausted it’s last chance. Obviously just my personal takes, but I have lost all gains in the prior sell offs because I thought the market had finally come into its sense and I held through the downturn hoping for more and it all gets bought up",
