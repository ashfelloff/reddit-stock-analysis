  "selftext": "52 week high of $923.83, low of $540.23. Currently at $891.\n\nP/E at 53% -- pretty high, but they are consistently growing, and growing at a consistent pace, 31 per year. Three states don't have a Costco, (now that they have one in Little Rock!!!!!) Rhode Island, West Virginia, and Wyoming -- wouldn't fit their model.\n\nup 37% YTD, up 200% over the past 5 years.\n\nSales, revenue, all up year over year -- consistently. 2020 net income was 4 Billion, 2024 is on track for 7.3 Billion. Nearly double in four years.\n\nHasn't split in 25 years and gained 2780% since that split.\n\nTheir dividends are meek, except when they do special dividends (last one was $15/share in Dec '23). Current dividends are at $1.16 and they go up every year (four and up). So they should be considered a dividend aristocrat I suppose, except those special dividends kind of throw off the calculation.\n\nI know that a split doesn't change the valuation of the company, just that it makes the stock more affordable to the average investor.
