TLDR: it's definitely not daddy's money, but i wish!!! instead my parents called the cops to kick me out at 21, during the lockdowns...lol\n\nearlier this year i sold QQQ and bought NVDA shares, then decided to use profits to get 40k of calls for recent earnings and another 30k the next day and i kept rolling out profits and... yeah 😅 here we are. aiming for a 7 figure tax bill this year 🤪🤪\n\n(check the all time chart for net deposits cuz the main chart shows deposits as gains)\n\n\nall time (doesn't show current day's balance tho): https://i.imgur.com/cXb508X.jpeg",

All the tax sites I’ve been to never state a number that works as a rough estimate that can apply to everyone. Considering all differences, for example almost nobody can afford a $25,000 tax bill though the IRS has repayment plans. Everyone is budgeted to the max. \n\nThis discussion ends up being a pro/cons for refund/owing government taxes between interest free loan and not paid. I know people can state which one is better. On an imaginary graph does a curve exist where people are not willing to pay in taxes after filing. People can pay $10 in taxes. A $500 tax bill for sure. A $20k, $40k, or $60k… now you bring those people who find every method to not pay taxes because that amount is too much. \n\nI’m cutting it off here, because this can be a 3 hour lecture.
