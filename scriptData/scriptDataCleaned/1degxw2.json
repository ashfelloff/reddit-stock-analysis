  "selftext": "Would ya look at this shit?! Just look. My god. Itâ€™s beautiful. I started with 1k and wasnâ€™t too happy with losing it. So I kept depositing money and revenge trading until I had maxed out a 8k line of credit and had 1k left in my port. I contacted RH and told them Iâ€™d like to close my account. They of course told me my trades need to clear first. Yada yada yada. Next day Iâ€™m like fuck this 1k letâ€™s get it. And from that I went from having 1k in my account, and down 10k on the yearâ€¦. To being positive 17k. Iv taken out 11k roughly to pay back my line of credit and buy something fun. And today I took the 3k left from that and over doubled it to 6600$. Iâ€™m not sure what my next move is yet but I believe I will be pulling 5k more out tomorrow and sticking with the 1.6k left that Iâ€™m comfortable playing with. \nWhat Iâ€™m trying to say is if I had quit like I planned. Iâ€™d be down 10k right now with 1k in my pocket. I made 17k in a little longer than one month with just 1kâ€¦.. kind of?\nI just feel like screaming from the rooftop. Iâ€™m fucking JACKED about this shit. But I canâ€™t tell anyone because Iâ€™m so embarrassed for being -10k in the hole at one pointâ€¦. So Iâ€™ll just share with you regards!! \nPositions: NVDA, SPY, and AAPL calls. BA puts ",

If you dwell on losses like this it might be smart to just quit. The chances of you coming back from 99% in one play is preposterous. Itâ€™s called revenge trading when you canâ€™t accept the loss. You have to be patient to make your comeback or else youâ€™ll just keep adding on to the losses",
