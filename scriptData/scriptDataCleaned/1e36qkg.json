No magic 8 ball here. It was a small investment that exploded, but not for a long time after I bought it. As I said elsewhere, I think that people should make occasional token investments early on in companies founded by visionaries who are fundamentally changing the way we do things. Then give it 20 years to see what happens. Ideally, do this in a Roth. Don't do it often, and don't jump into every new thing. It has to be infrequent and it has to meet the criteria of fundamentally changing how things are done. It took years of retrospection to develop my visionary approach to investing. For the most part, I am a very conservative broad market investor.",
