As demand for electric vehicles slumps and its profits plunge by 45%, Elon Musk is betting on humanoid robots, autonomous taxis and artificial intelligence to revive growth — a strategy that may test investors’ patience. Despite Musk asserting on a post-earnings call Tuesday that “the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy,” the timeline for the pivot is uncertain. The company now intends to unveil its robotaxi in October, two months later than planned. Musk has also revised his robot timeline, saying they will “hopefully” be available to customers in 2026.\n\nStolen from: By James Callan, Editor at LinkedIn News\n\nEven if you're a bull of Tesla, I think any of these focuses are a long-shot from actually becoming a reality:\n\nHumanoid Robots - What are the chances of these becoming a reality in the next 10 years, and Tesla actually profiting from them?\n\nAutonomous Taxis - How long has Elon been promising this to be a thing, and what are the chances of these becoming a reality in the next 10 years, and Tesla actually profiting from them?\n\nWith all this being said, I have a cool grand to gamble on options, so what bet do you guys think I should make on Tesla today?",

The 4680 battery didn't really work out as planned. The cybertruck is only selling to a small niche. The low cost Model 2 is on the back burner. Growth in deliveries has stalled out/peaked. Trump will likely be president and remove the $7500 IRA tax credit, obliterating Tesla's profitability.\n\nThe only things going for them are: 1) tariffs on BYD imports. 2) energy storage is growing. (and energy storage is literally just batteries in boxes, not something TSLA has any kind of strategic advantage on).",
