A few weeks before big tech earnings, it gets really difficult to trade far strike prices as well. It gets way too choppy and kills the IV.

Ive only mildly watched the stock, nothing more. I made 20k today and left almost at the bottom. I could have stayed and let the dunning kruger effect kick in. Instead i realized it was more luck than my own DD, and i pivoted into some qqq calls. If i happen to be right on these qqq calls, i will exit sometime tomorrow and wont take the risk of the market continuing to go up. The goal is to constantly move my money into a new position. So i think i may either trade shares until earnings are over or i might go back to mid cap stocks because they took a breather recently.",
