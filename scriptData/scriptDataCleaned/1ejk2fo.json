A lot of their current valuation is built on this idea of AI. But if you cannot deliver meaningful results for shareholders it doesn’t matter. \n\nIf you truly run the numbers the amount of money spent on AI is not going to be worth it.

Hell Iron Mountain started as a bomb proof storage company in the 50's. Cloud is really nothing more than fancy colocation, and colocation is basically the digital equivalent of a storage unit.
