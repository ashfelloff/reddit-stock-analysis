  "title": "FUNDAMENTALS DD: Why Grindr is different from all other dating apps and deserves a 10b+ valuation",

  "selftext": "Disclaimer: I own a shitload of $GRND (shares mostly)\n\nInvesting in a gay hookup app that's up during a year when dating apps like Bumble ($BMBL) and Tinder ($MTCH) are getting crushed? What are you, fucking stupid? No, hear me out.\n\nI argue that Grindr should be valued like a food delivery app because of the unique characteristics of its user demographic. Unlike Bumble and Tinder which cater to opposite sex couples, Grindr's users are primarily gay men. It's a biological fact that men are (on average) hornier than women, and that explains why interactions between Grindr users are more explicitly sexual in nature with a focus on hookups. Although other dating apps can be used for hookups, they were designed for dating and the mismatch in sex drive between men and women guarantees that won't ever change. Grindr, on the other hand, is specifically designed around sex, with users able to filter potential matches based on their sexual preferences and interests. The app is built for hookups.\n\nReturning to the food delivery analogy, the key insight here is that with Grindr, you are not ordering food to your doorstep, but rather a human being. Just as with apps like Uber Eats and Doordash, you select the menu item (in this case, the person), specify any additional options or requirements (such as bear, twink), and then place your order. Once the order is complete, it is delivered to you (in this case, the man arrives at your location). Easy, convenient, and efficient.\n\nToo much so in fact. Similar to how food delivery services exploit people's dopamine button to serve them overpriced fast food, Grindr short circuits the brain's reward system to serve them sex. From an addiction perspective, its actually even worse because nobody spends multiple hours a day seeking instant gratification by constantly refreshing Uber eats. If you don't believe me, search \"addiction\" on r/grindr. This is why Grindr users spend on average 61 minutes per on the app, FOUR TIMES are long the average Bumble and Tinder user (source: page 24 of the [Investor Presentation](https://s201.q4cdn.com/840224656/files/doc_presentation/2022/05/Grindr-Investor-Presentation-2022.05.10.pdf)). Furthermore, same-sex households have an 18% higher income compoared to opposite and gay men have an 10% higher median income than do their straight counterparts. In case the penny hasn't dropped for you regards yet, that means gays can afford to spend hundreds of dollars per year on Grindr.\n\nOk fine, I kind of see your point, u/AnusChapstick. Grindr should not be valued like a traditional dating app because its userbase is infinitely more horny and monetizable than regular dating apps. But how did you arrive at that $10b number?\n\nRemember, Grindr is a delivery app but with men instead of food. Let's compare it to Doordash, the food delivery market leader. $DASH trades at a market cap of $53 Billion. With 37 million monthly active users (MAU), that ronds to $1430 per user. Is that high? Could be, but when you factor in its topline growth and expansion potential, that number starts looking a little more reasonable. But wait, what about Grindr's revenue growth? Isn't Doordash growing a lot faster? Well no, with 242M in TTM revenue (up 34% since last year), GRND is growing at the same rate (actually slightly faster when comparing Q4 YoY growth) than DASH is. Furthermore, DASH is still operating at a loss whereas Grindr is profitable, making Grindr a better stock than Doordash by both profitability and revenue growth metrics. Applying DASH's user multiple to GRND's 13.3mm MAU yields a market cap of $19 billion. Hence the 10b+ valuation I alluded to earlier.\n\nJust like how Tesla's stock price experienced an unprecedented rapid rise compared to other major automakers such as Ford and GM, Grindr is exploding in valuation compared to Tinder and Bumble. The market is quickly pricing that man ass is more monetizable than puss.\n\nGRND PT: $69\n\nTl;dr $GRND has 15%+ short interest but the shorts are dead wrong because they underestimated the horniness of gay men.",

Right now it's mildly undervalued, and it's undervalued because it's gay. Because businessbros (as well as firebros, brobros, collegebros, etc.) have significant difficulty dealing with gay things in fear being seen as gay.. It's just a thing. So people aren't buying into it now. \n\nBMBL and MTCH don't provide a good dating experience. It's human nature, men and women are looking for different things and so have a disappointing time, especially men, we're just horny mofos that want to fuck. Also happens that men are the ones (in general) who have to pay/subscribe because women get bombarded on the apps. So the men don't have a good time and leave, hence those businesses going down. \n\nGay men tend to lean towards wanting to fuck, early, often, and without shame. So Grindr works great for them. They looked for sex and found sex, holy shit, I'd pay for that shit too. Future looks good when everyone is getting what they want from the app (relatively obviously).\n\nSo now you have an underpriced company who is likely to continue to show growing numbers for the near future at least. And eventually the businessbros will see value so good they don't care about being seen as gay. Which would become a rapid growth stock as someone was already the 1st one so it's fine.\n\nThat's my opinion anyways. Now that I see how long a ramble i wrote I'll think I'll skip on the dab I was about to hit.",

All the fundamentals seem like they are there, but if everyone gets what they want wheres the carrot to make people pay for the access to sex. As a straight guy on dating sites, they put walls on the access to the possibility of dating or sex. For example, if you don't pay on the dating sites, it's pretty much impossible to match or see the people who like you. Is Grinder making it too easy? Or are there the same type of pay walls? I mean, if they had a site for straight dudes to have access to sex so easily, they would pretty much make sure you had to pay to get lucky. What structures are in place to profit off gayness?",

I would assume the number of LGBTQ ppl is somewhat finite. I would also assume most (70%+) are already using the app. So you would either be betting on the world becoming gayer, or on free users converting to paid users. Even with the latter, there would still be a cap on income because the user base is limited. I imagine this is why the current value is what it is.",
