And I drank them and they are pretty tasty. \n\nAs energy drinks go they aren’t that bad. High caffeine but cmon, it’s an energy drink. The vitamin content is a meme, there’s so little and such poor quality vitamin here that it might as well not even be there, but nobody really knows that so health conscious people who want an energy drink will think it’s healthier.\n\nI didn’t see any trash in it like taurine etc. it’s just a pretty decent and tasty energy drink.\n\nThe company is wayyyyy over valued. When i bought at 52 the p/e was already like 10 above the rest of its sector. It’s even higher now. I’d never buy it at these prices. But at 52 for a tiny bit of my portfolio it’s been a huge winner, up like 60%",
