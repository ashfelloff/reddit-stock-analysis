No idea what the stock will do for earnings, but feels like for a lot of cpg names they will have to figure out how to move volume again and not just have these quarters where volumes are around flat or worse but they raised prices significantly. Not apples-to-apples, but in terms of the consumer and cpg brands, the GIS quarter the other day wasn't very good.",

I really want PEP to be a sizeable position in my portfolio due to the quality of the company and the nature of the stock, but I feel like they might have a hard time coming during Q4. It depends how niche growth they have in other markets outside of US and Europe where inflation has been an issue. China is facing its issues too! Nestle is another company thats kind of in a similar position to PEP.",
