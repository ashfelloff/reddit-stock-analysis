  "selftext": "Miss Cathie Wood:  \n\nThe autonomous vehicle business has \"an 80% to 85% gross margin,\" Wood said. \"It's like software as a service. Right now, the electric vehicle gross margin is in the midteens. But we think it's going to be a 25 to 30% gross margin.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Most analysts have Tesla classified as an auto company. It isn't. It isn't at all. It's a robot, energy storage, AI company, and its margins will show through.\"\n\n\"The auto industry -- Ford and GM -- is backing away from EVs. That's a big mistake because the only way they'll become profitable is to scale [EVs.] So they're basically ceding the market to Tesla and they will have obsolete products as Tesla's cars drop into the $20,000 to $25,000 range within five years, compared with their average of $30,000 to $45,000.\"\n\nWhat are your thoughts? \n\n\n",

Even if they were \"ceding\", it would be to BYD, not Tesla, who can straight up out compete them on cost and production capacity. \n\nCathie is touting high margins on all Tesla does because she assumes near monopoly status and a competitive moat. There is no way Tesla maintains margins at the levels she is putting forward if other folks have a viable competitive product. I don't see them having a moat on any of these ventures as there are many folks already ahead of them (or at least even) in everything Elon is shilling. This is literally what is crippling them in cars now; they are no longer the only option and they are hemorrhaging market share. It will happen on everything else as well. The only exception might be charging networks but those are going to be government regulated as a utility and I doubt will be allowed to operate with the absurd margins Cathie is predicting. \n\nPosition: $30k+ in puts for April 26th.",

If you truly believe Toyota and all the Chinese companies won’t have a fleet of EVs ready for America with self drive capability and Tesla will be the only car company left, you’re crazy. \n\nFurthermore, if FSD becomes viewed as a safety requirement, I expect regulators will step in and ensure that you’re not able to charge people thousands of dollars per year for it (or the insurance companies will fight it, because if FSD is truly as wonderful as claimed, there is no reason for them to exist). Additionally, I expect demand for the robotaxi will be low. Musk is not going to just let every random Model 3 or Y be turned into a taxi. He’s going to force you to buy the specific “robotaxi” model if you want to operate so he can squeeze $25-30k out of you. Why else would he need to do a “robotaxi unveil?” There are already thousands of hours of video of teslas driving themselves to varying levels of success. There is nothing to “unveil” unless it’s a new model specifically designed as a taxi.",

      "body": "Here's my regarded take.\n\n\nMost car companies are going to be required to make EV their main source of car sales. They're approaching it as another ICE vehicle that happens to run on electric. TSLA, despite its faults, is looking at the bigger picture of what EV and it's monitoring/data collection can bring to the future. It's not a secret most younger generations don't have a desire to own cars. With the mindset that the end goal is not ownership of EVs but rather another form of privatized public transit, I think TSLA is the most poised for this.\n\n\nAny other manufacturer is not looking at EV sales in the same way. I believe the way of owning cars is going to go away in a decade or two driven by the next gen of buyers who are already not interested in ownership.",
