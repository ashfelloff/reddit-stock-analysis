  "selftext": "I’ve been following this stock for years. I bought in early, sold, and bought back again. I know feel like I know everything about this company and product- an infusion therapy for relapsing MS. \n\nI’ve studied their LinkedIn, employees, Facebook community patient group, etc. If I buy in on a small cap, I’m typically putting in a few thousand or buying a few call contracts. I am so confident in this companies drug based on patient sentiment, it is only a matter of time before they become market share leader and eventually a buyout. I’m in at $22 a share and this is about half of my retirement account. \n\nI’ve lurked in this sub for almost a decade and this stock has the feeling of pre-2021 WSB. This stock is heavily shorted when the company is cash-flow positive with a drug that’s rapidly taking market share. This gets taken out at $60+ by end of year if rates improve. ",
