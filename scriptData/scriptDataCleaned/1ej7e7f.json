It seems astonishing to me that you don't grasp this. A gain of 1.28 million people is a large change. That things were different in the past is not relevant.",

That is how much of an increase the percentage of part time workers there are from june of last year.  you have twisted yourself so much you don't even know what you are talking about.\n\n  \nI know remedial math is hard but come on bro, try to keep up.\n\n17% of the workforce being part time is NORMAL.  \n\nCONSIDERED HEALTHY. \n\nWITHIN RANGE AND STILL BELOW THE LONG TERM AVERAGE.\n\nwhat part of this don't you understand?\n\nIf you have something on sale for a dollar, but the normal price for the last 20+ years is 5 dollars and after the sale it returns back to 5 dollars is it a huge increase in price? Or is it returning back to normal?",
