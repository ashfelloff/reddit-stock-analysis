  "selftext": "SoFi is in the accelerated growth phase and its growth will dramatically benefit from the upcoming much friendlier environment for financial institutions:\n\n* ALL of SoFi's Lending Business would get a strong tailwind as the interest rates fall and the biggest headwind within student loans would start to dissipate.\n* Looser regulation nourishes an environment for the rapidly growing SoFi. It is predicted that the new administration could change up to eight leaders at federal agencies overseeing the financial services industry.\n* More leniency in approving IPOs that boost SoFi's IPO business.\n* The probable upcoming tax cuts for big corporations will propel the uprising SoFi to grow much faster. The increased budget would allow outdated banks to invest in the newer/updated technology that SoFi's Cyberbank Core (Galileo & Technisys) has to offer to meet newer bank regulatory requirements.\n* The new administration would likely scale back or scrap the proposed Basel III requirement. Basel III requires lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. SoFi would have more liquidity and be able to invest more allowing it to make more money without this Basel III capital constraints.\n* Short interest will go down at an accelerated rate as SoFi's stock price rises.\n* There is a 97.4% chance of a 25 bp rate cut for this upcoming Fed meeting tomorrow, Nov. 7th. which would already meet the 75 bp cut that SoFi's CEO has predicted for this year to facilitate SoFi's rapid growth.\n* Bank stock rose 20% three months after the election in 2016.",

It’s value add overall, but not nearly what the “AWS of banking” folks believe it to be currently.\n\nWhat I’m sure the market will react to is potential for stronger student loan & overall re-fi volume. I expect it to acts like it has, sharp increases followed by heavy shorting/declines, but overall the business maintains a positive trajectory.",
