  "selftext": "I'm aware that JGBs are known as the widow maker, but going long the Yen against the US dollar seems like a no brainer to me...\n\n Thought I would share my DD in case any of you regards would like to join me, or else try to persuade me why I am wrong!\n\nIn March 2022 the Fed started raising rates and the US vs Japan interest rate differential started to blow out. The long USD vs short Yen carry trade was reborn. Why settle for just selling volatility and riding the crypto/tech wave upwards when you can get even more return by borrowing at low interest rates in Japan. After all, that's never ended badly for anyone. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ghjnx81xknrc1.png?width=1192&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d2577df97ae4910114fb2f13b246d1b9b30b0fb\n\nIn late 2023 it started to look like this party might be coming to an end, the market was frothing over 6-7 US rate cuts, and the BoJ was making murmurs about ending it's zero interest rate policy. \n\nAt the start of 2024 the headlines were expecting a possible BoJ rate hike in April 2024 ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/01/11/economy/boj-ex-official-on-ending-negtive-rate/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/01/11/economy/boj-ex-official-on-ending-negtive-rate/)). I don't remember reading a single article that was expecting a rapid pace of hikes, as per this quote from that link, \"The BOJ will only go slowly. It’s completely different from the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank, Sakurai said. What Japan’s economy needs is the continuation of an appropriate level of monetary easing.\"\n\nWe duly got a tiny BoJ rate hike in March and the FED has remained dovish, indicating that it still wants to cut rates in the face of high employment and slightly elevated inflation. Interest rate differentials fell. Of course the yen rallied right? Right? \n\nNo, the widow maker did what it does best and the Yen returned to freefall. How does the MSM explain this? \"The slide comes amid speculation the yen will remain under pressure to weaken due to Japan’s large yield discount to other developed economies, notably the US. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda and his officials’ insisted that financial conditions will stay loose even though the nation hiked its interest rates for the first time since 2007 and scrapped the yield-curve control regime this week. [https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/yen-falls-lowest-since-2008-010208156.html](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/yen-falls-lowest-since-2008-010208156.html)\". WTF? **Nobody** was ever expecting massive/rapid tightening in the first place.\n\nEveryone loves a good carry trade though, fundamentals be damned. So the hedgies, trend followers, retail etc. have continued to short the shit out of JPY. You can see this for yourself... [https://uk.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-jpy-speculative-positions-1614](https://uk.investing.com/economic-calendar/cftc-jpy-speculative-positions-1614)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l76vva4xonrc1.png?width=665&format=png&auto=webp&s=443d6a559de90f0ba43c1328f853a3eaac366872\n\nI for one am ignoring the BS coming out of the press, and think there is a decent chance that this carry trade gets unwound if/when the FED does start to cut rates. \n\nThink I am crazy?\n\nHere's an article in the HedgeFundJournal from May 2007 explaining why the Yen carry trade will probably continue to work, [https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-carry-trade/](https://thehedgefundjournal.com/the-carry-trade/). \"The situation is very different now. The excesses of the bubble 1980s have worked through the Japanese economic system. Hedge funds employ less leverage and big currency bets are much rarer. Many investors other than hedge funds are making use of cheap yen. Most transactions do not have to be unwound or can be hedged. Prime brokers and banks have become a little more disciplined about how much and to whom they provide leverage. The increased sophistication and institutionalisation of the hedge fund industry has brought focus to risk-adjusted returns not just top line performance. The carry trade is just one source of alpha among many. And why would Japan stop lending yen now? Japan has lots of money and the economy is much more stable than ten years ago. The carry trade is not without risk but then nothing is.\".\n\nWell, we have the luxury of knowing what happened next... the FED cut rates in late 2007 (shown below) and the dollar subsequently puked. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7oyjxdmnpnrc1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=1bb697265fa86b1cad34f41d9691848def16abb5\n\nHistory doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. Occam's razor. The increase in US vs Japan interest rates seemingly caused the recent selloff in the Yen, why wouldn't a decrease cause the opposite. \n\nThis all relies on the FED cutting rates, which might not happen, but I've started buying some JPY. Fancy joining me, and taking the other side of these momentum junkie, carry loving, short volatility investors before the fun starts?\n\n&#x200B;",

There are a lot of carry traders out there, a lot of people who think that the USD is the \"cleanest dirty shirt\", a lot of CTAs and trend followers chasing the price momentum etc. My thesis is that **if** the FED cuts this year, I would like to own JPY. I've got other trades that will make money if they don't.",
