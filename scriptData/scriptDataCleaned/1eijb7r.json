If you hire a bunch of employees to do close to nothing, consolidating those positions and letting go of your excess staff frees up skilled labour for other companies. \n\nThis is a big thing in tech now because for like 5+ years the mega caps were hoarding unnecessary skilled labour and starving the smaller tech companies qualified employees. In a strong economy, those big companies letting people go would be irrelevant, because there would be demand for that labour somewhere else. \n\nUnemployment is a lagging indicator because the cause is overall economic activity decreasing, not any individual company downsizing. This is because for each individual company, downsizing was a rational decision based on their production needs at the time. But if every company has lower production needs at the same time, that is what causes unemployment.",
