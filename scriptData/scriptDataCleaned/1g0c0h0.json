We have yearly vehicle registration tax, there is property tax - cities have zoning schemes and depending in which city and which zone you are you pay tax and there is tax on owning fire arms and some other things.\n\nAlso we have excise tax for items like fuel,cigarettes, and alcohol drinks, for example right now excise tax for fuel is 46% and fuel is aroud 2$ per liter, and last but not least is import tax which is 10%, when you buy something from other countries, customs is collecting 10% import tax and 20% VAT tax.\n\nAnd for businesses since i am business owner we have monthly VAT tax , 20% of products we sold - 20% of products we bought( because i have welding / laser cutting shop, i mostly buy materials for prdoucts i make), and you pay that difference every month, there is also yearly profit tax which is 10-15% of your yearly profits, and there is bunch of some other smaller taxes, like ecological tax depending on what your company do and in which pollution category it fits.\n\nExamplw for monthy 20% VAT tax for business is, You sell 100k of product this month but you only spent 20k to make that product, so 20% of 100k - 20% of 20k is = 20K - 4k =16 K and that is how much you own in VAT tax to government\n\nEdit 1 :\n\nThere is also one more type of tax and that is tax for hight earners, everyone that earns above 40k $ is taxed additional 10% and everyone above 85k $ is taxed 15% of their income.",
