  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "> Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio said the overall picture of the US economy probably warrants a smaller interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve this week.\n\n > Whether it‚Äôs 25 or 50 basis points, 25 basis points would be the right thing to do if you look at the whole picture‚Äù ‚Äî  ‚ÄòRight Thing‚Äô for creditors.\n\n> ‚ÄúIf you look at the mortgage situation, which is worse and that affects more people, then it‚Äôs probably 50 basis points‚Äù ‚Äî would help mortgage borrowers.\n\n> But Dalio said that what the Fed does this week ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt make a difference‚Äù over the longer term. \n\n> ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs such a silly bet ‚Äî 25 or 50,‚Äù he said. Policymakers will ultimately need to keep real interest rates low to enable the servicing of mounting debts, he added.\n\n> Dalio isn‚Äôt the only financial luminary to express ambivalence about Fed policy. JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said whether the central bank cuts rates by 25 or 50 basis points, the move is ‚Äúnot going to be earth-shattering.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey need to do it,‚Äù Dimon said at a conference on Tuesday. But ‚Äúit‚Äôs a minor thing when the Fed‚Äôs raising rates and lowering rates because underneath that there‚Äôs a real economy.‚Äù",
