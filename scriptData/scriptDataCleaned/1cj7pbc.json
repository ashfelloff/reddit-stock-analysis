(Picture money supply as a baloon either inflating or deflating)\n\nAlthough these common causes make sense at a face level, we cannot really label them as causes.\n\n1) The inability to enforce tax collection by itself does not cause inflation, it is the government’s decision to resolve this problem by emmiting legal tender as their source of revenue.\n\n2) Large foreign-denominated debt gets a little tricky, since you not only have to print a lot of money, you also have to exchange it, continually making the exchange rate worse, incentivizing you, to print even more. Weimar republic probably got away with it for longer than one could today, given the fact how big the FX market is and how quickly information spreads.\n\n3) Decline of supply leads to higher prices. The rise in prices in this case is not caused by inflation, rather by market mechanism, which then the government decided to solve by excessive emission, resulting in inflation of 80 sextillion per cent or whatever. That is why more and more people started to pay with foreign currency, mainly the USD (because inflation is tied to a currency and its supply, not to economies and their price levels).\n\nDomestic debt also incentivizes inflation, as it devalues the real debt, which is something states around the world utilize.\n\nTLDR: The only cause of hyperinflation is the government’s decision to resolve situations via excessive emission of money",

No new money created.\n\n\nThe Fed Reserve = banks.  They print money by lending it out...to the Gov mostly in the form of buying Treasury bonds, the people are borrowing from this bank.

You might say oh, the Fed is run by the Gov really, and works with the G man...no, no they appoint a chairman, 99% of the time from the board of chairmen who are all brought in from large banks.   Very little control from the President actually happens, because Politicians cannot be trusted to do this stuff (and you should agree cuz 1929 was mostly caused by Gov interference).\n\n\nThe Fed Reserve (bankers) bought down Mortgage ETF's to get you 'cheap' housing in 2020/2021.   The Fed gave out 0.25% loans to any corp that wanted it.   The Fed created this money out of thin air...~$14T new money over 2yrs.   No vote was made, no politician instructed them to do this.   It accounted for 25-30% new money injected/printed.   A further ~$7T came from the Gov in the form of PPP loans, Stimmy checks, and SNAP/Unemployment increases.   Grand total 40% new money on the street, or 40% inflation instead of 3% each year (+33% if you want to be pedantic about expecting 3% inflation)\n\nOK so the Gov printed money you might say - see $7T...well no because guess who bought the vast majority of those new bonds?   Yes the Federal Reserve did...sure some other countries bought some, but after 2008, it's been dropping every year as the other central banks trust us less and less, and they see us flirt with default over and over again with the debt ceiling debates (essentially we are fucking around with paying back foreign countries money we owe back, no wonder they stop investing in our bonds).\n\n\nOk so can we go bankrupt, sure - stop paying on T bills.   Realistically no we will not do that it would destroy the world economy, our own and just everything would turn to shit.   No we print the money from the Fed, devalue our currency, spend into inflation because we have to.\n\n\nI'm a dumbass who didn't graduate from college, I work in IT, I shouldn't know better than an economic advisor who supposedly is Biden's guy.

The USA has tripled the amount of outstanding money it has spent into existence, and banks have lent (printed) a quadrupling of the money of money they are providing. Meanwhile prices have only doubled.\n\nKnowing that a country with its own currency, and a private sector that borrows in the government currency can't go bankrupt, doesn't mean you forget about inflation and think printing money is inconsequential or only good.\n\nLike this guy obviously is clueless to the mechanics of money. But Kelton, the other person in the video, the one telling everyone we can't go bankrupt, basically won't shut up about inflation being the thing to watch out for. If you read her book \"The deficit myth\" she's non stop talking about inflation before her second or third chapter is titled and about inflation.\n\nEveryone knows about inflation, almost everyone overestimates it's likelihood let alone its intrinsic damage, and virtually no one educated enough in economics to know the difference between a country that \"borrows\" in its own currency and a person borrowing on a credit card ever forgets inflation risks.",
