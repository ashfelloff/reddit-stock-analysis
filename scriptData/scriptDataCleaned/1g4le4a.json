              "body": "You may be right, but it isn't my experience. I spend my Reddit time (and energy) on a couple of niche, low traffic subs specific to my narrow hobbies. I'm a moderator on one. I haven't seen much obvious bots or overt product promotion or other garbage posts. It's mostly geeks, often real experts, answering people's questions about things they are obsessed with. With occasional references to other sites with solidly useful information and products. \n\nMy conjecture is that the reddit value proposition is actually in the thousands of niche subs like this. Kind of the long tail argument that was an important part of the Amazon story in the early days. I guess the bots aren't targeting this kind of sub much (yet). No doubt they will. And it will take a major effort to deal with this problem.\n\nThat's why I think that they need to focus on supporting /encouraging the human moderators. And on developing the AI tools to crack down on the garbage that will otherwise, as you say, become an avalanche that buries the whole thing. I may be overly optimistic, and they could easily fail, but on the positive side there are some major players with a vested interest in a thriving Reddit. If that logic plays out  there will be some major hiring expenses as serious expertise transfers across from their 'partners'.\n\nOnly time will tell I guess.
