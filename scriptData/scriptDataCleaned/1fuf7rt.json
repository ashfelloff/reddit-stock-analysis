I could buy three cars over the course of a couple of years with the money I pay on car insurance alone. But it covers injuries!!! We have to pay health insurance too. It's already suppose to be cover. Then there's house insurance, equipment insurance (for businesses), unemployment insurance, etc. Etc. It's the same issue as college degrees. Normal people can't work a living wage job without paying to win 5 digits minimum. It's actually ridiculous to be young today and be born into a world with AT LEAST 10 bills you have to pay. And then the politicians wonder why suicide rates go up and no one wants to work. Where is this mental health crisis coming from!!! /$",

The fact that he considers insurances claims as \"losses and loss adjustment expenses\" should make you realize why American insurance system is such a hellhole compared to other countries.
