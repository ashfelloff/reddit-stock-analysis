  "selftext": "We‚Äôre likely to see added liquidity and volume in the names being added to the index, leading up to the reconstitution day on June 28. ETF‚Äôs that track the index need to buy the underlying stocks to track the index effectively. This leads to added liquidity in some stocks that were previously illiquid.\n\nIMO, a good strategy would be to buy these newly added stocks that have low float low liquidity ahead of the big ETF‚Äôs buying. I‚Äôm playing $ROOT - It has 4m tradable shares, 1.1m shares short and volume traded on it has been low lately. It‚Äôs extremely undervalued relative to its strong fundamentals because of the lack of volume and attention (Has $640m in cash $220m in investments, $1.2b revenue for this year, became profitable at EBIT and EBITDA last quarter, is doubling its revenue each year, yet trades at around $700m market cap now) - any added volume and liquidity will cause impact on this one for sureüî•\n\nWhich names are you guys playing? \n\nIf you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about just look up June 28 index reconstitution day \n\nHere‚Äôs a list of additions:\n\nhttps://www.lseg.com/content/dam/ftse-russell/en_us/documents/other/ru3000-additions-preliminary-20240531.pdf",
