The upside though is much higher than 20%, so it's a pretty good looking trade.

Trumps got a bigger name than Altman, and no one’s heard of oklo unless they’re already looking in the space. I’ve seen projections of $100, $30, and everything in between. The long play on this is better, but we’re years off from a consistent solid return. I bet we don’t get to 21. I’ll celebrate if I’m wrong though. The shares of the insiders are eligible for sale if the price sits above 14 for 20 days. I doubt it goes well beyond that.",
