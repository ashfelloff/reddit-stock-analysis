  "title": "Could PLTR go on a TSLA-like Run (70%) if Included in SP500?",
  "score": 70,
  "selftext": "On June 7th, S&P 500 is set to rebalance and Palantir will be eligible for the third time. With the spotlight on AI and Palantir's continued strong performance, there's a very high likelihood it is included in the S&P, which could lead PLTR going on a Tesla-like run. \n\nFirst, let me break down why Palantir is a great candidate for inclusion. Inclusion in the S&P 500 index involves meeting several stringent criteria related to market capitalization, liquidity, financial viability, and corporate governance. For Palantir Technologies (PLTR) to be considered a good candidate for S&P 500 inclusion, it must satisfy these key requirements:\n\nMarket Capitalization: A company must have a market cap of at least $14.6 billion (as of 2023). Palantir's market capitalization has been above this threshold for a while.\n\nLiquidity: Companies need to have adequate liquidity, with a high trading volume. Palantir's shares are actively traded, reflecting strong investor interest and sufficient liquidity.\n\nFinancial Viability: The company must report positive earnings in the most recent quarter and over the last four quarters combined. Palantir has demonstrated profitability, reporting positive GAAP EPS in recent quarters​ (InvestorPlace)​.\n\nU.S. Based: Companies must be U.S.-based, with the majority of their assets and revenues derived from the U.S. Palantir fits this criterion, being headquartered in Denver, Colorado, and deriving significant revenue from U.S. operations.\n\nPublic Float: At least 50% of a company's shares must be in the public float. Palantir's public float percentage is adequate to meet this requirement, with substantial institutional ownership indicating wide distribution among public shareholders\n\nPalantir meets all the eligibility criteria, the only which could be a problem is corporate governance, ie, the insiders own a lot of shares of the company; however there are tons of examples of other companies that have a similar structure.\n\nAs many of you know, Tesla went on a 70% in the weeks leading up to and the month following its inclusion. However, it's not alone. Many other \"sexy/high-profile\" names go on epic runs when SP500 inclusion is announced. \n\n1. Twitter (TWTR)\nInclusion Date: June 7, 2018\nMarket Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $26 billion\nPerformance:\nWeeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on May 21, 2018, Twitter's stock increased by approximately 14%.\nMonth Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, Twitter's stock increased by about 5%.\n\n2. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI)\nInclusion Date: March 20, 2019\nMarket Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion\nPerformance:\nWeeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2019, NXP's stock rose by approximately 10%. \nMonth Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, NXP's stock increased by around 6%.\n\n3. AMD (Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.) (AMD)\nInclusion Date: March 20, 2017\nMarket Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $20 billion\nPerformance:\nWeeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on February 28, 2017, AMD's stock increased by approximately 12%. \nMonth Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, AMD's stock rose by around 9%.\n\n4. T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS)\nInclusion Date: June 22, 2020\nMarket Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $30 billion\nPerformance:\nWeeks Leading to Inclusion: In the month leading up to the inclusion announcement on June 5, 2020, T-Mobile's stock increased by approximately 8%.\nMonth Following Inclusion: In the month following the inclusion, T-Mobile's stock saw an increase of about 7%.\n5. NVIDIA (NVDA)\nInclusion Date: November 18, 2001\nMarket Cap at Inclusion: Approximately $25 billion\nPerformance:\nWeeks Leading to Inclusion: NVIDIA's stock saw a significant rise, roughly around 20-25%, in the weeks leading up to the inclusion.\nMonth Following Inclusion: The stock continued to perform well, with an additional increase of around 10-15%.\n\n\"S&P 500 effect,\" is a real phenomenon and I think it's even more powerful with high-profile names like Palantir. \n\nAs mentioned earlier, Tesla went on a god-like run in the weeks leading up to and after the announcement. And I think Palantir shares many characteristics with Tesla that may see it go on a similar run. Both companies have a very high-profile CEO. Alex Karp is loved by Palantir holders just like Elon is by Tesla fanboys, which leads to my most important point: retail ownership. Palantir has a significant amount of its shares outstanding owned by retail; if SP500 inclusion is announced and institutions have to buy shares it may create a similar move like Tesla's as most palantir fanboys won't sell. Like Tesla, they believe Palantir is changing the world (look at their subreddit). \n\nI think buying Palantir options is a great upside play with limited downside, depending on when you purchase your options. The inclusion announcement is on Friday after hours, so you could buy Friday before close or anytime this week and sell Monday morning if its not included for a minimum loss. \n\nAnd with options being so cheap, this could be a 50-bagger if it goes to 30 bucks. \n\n6/21 23 C\n6/21 25 C.",

      "body": "I interviewed at Palantir years ago, back when onsite interviews were actually onsite. As part of the interview day, they gave me a tour of the office. All the desks were in an open format in a large room, and in the middle there was a platform, almost like a stage but only about 1ft tall. On top of it was a big desk and it had a bunch of Japanese shit and katanas around it. In front of the desk was Alex Karp, doing Tai Chi or some shit on this elevated platform in a room of engineers working silently, literally beneath him. It was the most remarkably odd thing I’ve ever seen. I asked the recruiter why his desk was there and she said, “Alex believes in leading from the top”. \n\nAnyway, I’m bullish.",
