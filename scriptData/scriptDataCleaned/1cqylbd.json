That’s exactly why I buy Apple products. \n\nThere are lots of other benefits - great UX, great customer service, near seamless compatability between all your devices, to name a few - but yeah, their products look fucking cool and feel luxurious. \n\nSome people like nice, premium, fashionable things. They want a stylish car, a stylish home, a stylish wardrobe and, yeah, a stylish phone and laptop. Apple products are actually a very affordable piece of luxury. Everything from the point of sale through the unboxing process through using them day-to-day feels premium and luxurious. For many iPhone users, their phone and maybe their sneakers are the biggest concessions to luxury they’ll ever make, and they feel good about it. It’s money well spent for them, for the feeling it gives them. \n\nAnd if you think that feeling is worthless, that says more about you than about them. That feeling has a lot of value to a lot of people. Apple has mastered eliciting that feeling in people in much the same way big fashion brands have mastered it. It’s a good feeling and it comes with a pricetag.",
