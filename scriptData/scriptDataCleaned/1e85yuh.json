At the very end she tried to force me to pay her legal bills too, which she claimed came out to $47k.\n\nMediation was fantastic, best day of my life. She showed up with a demand for 400% of our net worth, plus alimony of something like 40% of my gross *for life*. The mediator fucking hated her, and described her demands as the most extreme he'd ever seen. And he was a retired family law judge who thought he'd seen it all.",
