Everyone I know who has a Tesla (and that's lot of people) also has a similar experience.\n\n  \nAs a manufacturing engineer, let me talk about something which people always confuse with reliability: PANEL GAPS.\n\n  \nPanel gaps have nothing to do with the reliability of a car. They are designed in via the manufacturing GD&T process. If it costs me $1 to create a car with +/- 2 mm panel gaps vs $10,000 to create a car with +/-1nm panel gaps - you can bet your ass an optimization will be done to fine the tolerances somewhere leaning closer to the +/- 2mm rather than the +/1 mm.\n\n  \nHere's the thing: do most Tesla owners care about panel gaps? No. So why spend billions to upgrade the machinery, process, BOM, and quality inspections to make sure your vehicles have a Toyota level or Porsche level of panel fitment. FYI: the panels gaps in Teslas have been getting narrower, but it's clearly not a focus for them.",

It's not a business decision in the best interest of the company that went wrong, it's his personal desires that are in conflict with the best interest of the company and he's plainly saying that publicly. The AI/Robotics division are part of how shareholders have made decisions to buy into Tesla at ridiculous multiples, and a huge reason why they have a larger market cap than the rest of the worlds automakers combined, despite not selling anywhere near the amount of cars those other companies do. Without the AI/Robotics angle, they are simply a car company that should be valued at a similar P/E as other car companies, and if that's true, there are a whole lot of shareholders that are going to lose a ton of money.",

If he’s saying he will destroy that part of the company if he’s not given more money than the company has ever made, I don’t see how it can be more clear cut that he’s abandoning any premise of being a fiduciary. Now my guess is he hasn’t seen consequences yet because the authorities are waiting for him to take concrete actions they can tie to his statements, but who knows, I’m not an expert in corporate law by any means.",

Like 2016 Elon basically marketed himself as the product of Tesla in addition to EVs. Basically the pitch was buy our expensive cars and you're buying a piece of the future, because Elon has a plan for how to address climate change and your investment is helping him bring this vision into a reality. Trump had just won the election and there was a lot of fear about all of the ways he would undermine the federal government's response to climate change, so a lot of the fearful public really bought into the cult of Elon.\n\nHe's still got his personality cult now but it's concentrated itself to just be tech bros and weird right-wing trolls who actually worship him.
