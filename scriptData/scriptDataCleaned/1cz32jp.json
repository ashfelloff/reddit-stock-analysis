But really if this is a strategy it is sad.\n\nHere is my reason. Other than a very few states rec is not really going to do anything this year. Maybe PA and a long shot being Flordia. With desantis I don’t believe that it happens. \n\nThat being said I really don’t think that you will get explosive gains from MSO’s you have to be able to see this for what it is.\n\nPharma is finally going to get its time with cannabis. They will be able to start selling their product to the pharmacies in the us. This is going to have a direct impact on the medical side of the equation of the MSO’s. Hell the MSO’s could lose medical all together depending on the language of rescheduling. \n\nThe markets have already started to level off in a lot of the states. \n\nSo with this i think that the first stage is going to belong to Pharma cannabis companies. They are going to be taking market share directly from the MSO’s.  \n\nThis is just an opinion of a guy who has spent way too many hours analyzing the industry.",

That's my Cannabis play. \n\nI have 7,000 shares and a $2.31 cost average. \n\nHere's an excerpt from some articles that explain why \n\nHigh Tide: Potential For Long-Term Compounding Through Its Differentiated Ecosystem\n\nSummary\n\n    High Tide prioritized generating free cash flow to strengthen financial resilience and fuel future growth.\n    The company can potentially make a return of more than 20% on their invested capital.\n    There's ample room for growth in Canada and possibly also in Germany and the US.\n    The management has, up until now, proven to be of high quality and is aligned with shareholders.\n\nInvestment Thesis\n\nThe investment potential of High Tide (NASDAQ:HITI) lies in its possibility to be a long-term compounder, driven by the strategic allocation of free cash flow toward the expansion of new stores. Thereby realizing more free cash flow to have the funds to open stores at an even higher pace. \n\nHigh Tide: Insiders Are Buying, And So Am I\n\nSummary\n\n    High Tide Inc. has an extremely competitive business model and a low cost of expansion.\n    The cannabis industry is facing catalysts from both rescheduling and the passage of some form of the SAFE Banking Act.\n    High Tide has reached positive cash flow a quarter earlier than management previously projected.\n    Multiple valuation methods indicate the company is significantly undervalued.\n    I consider HITI a Strong Buy.\n\nThesis\n\nWith rescheduling on the way, and momentum growing for the passage of some form of SAFE banking, the cannabis industry is eagerly awaiting its next rally inducing catalyst. For the U.S. sector, this will mean improvements to their margins and returns. For the Canadian sector, they will finally be allowed to expand out of their overly competitive market.\n\nHigh Tide Inc. (NASDAQ:HITI) is my highest conviction investment because of their extremely competitive business model and low cost of expansion. I believe they will be able to capture significant market share in any ecosystem they are allowed to enter. Two important events have occurred since my last article on High Tide. They achieved positive cash flow a quarter earlier than expected, and a cluster of insider buying was announced on November 22nd. After looking over their present financials and valuation, I currently rate High Tide as a Strong Buy.",
