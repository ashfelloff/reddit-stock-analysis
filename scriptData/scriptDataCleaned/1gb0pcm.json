That boils down to AA running on crappy old planes, unreliable newer ones, and Boeing is yet to deliver new unreliable planes ordered (backlog in the thousands). With a good portion of people (like myself) who avoid flights on Boeing jets, that's more revenue that AA won't be getting back any time soon. Even if EPS is up, outlook is murky, and not all that positive. Boeing's like an anchor attached to their planes.",
