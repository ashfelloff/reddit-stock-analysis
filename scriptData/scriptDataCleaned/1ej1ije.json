The stock then needs to drop enough for you to be able to repurchase the shares at a lower cost basis than what you originally purchased them for. \n\nWhat makes this have increased risk is that there are borrowing costs associated with borrowing shares to short. You are essentially on a time crunch because the costs associated with borrowing are eating you up. To make matters worse, if the stock increases in value, then your loses continue to worsen to the point where you may no longer have the funds to exit the position. You're basically screwed.\n\nWhen you buy a put option, while you can lose all of your capital, the risk is defined (e.g. the cost of the premium to enter the position).\n\nThere are many nuances and risks associated with all strategies. Buying shares is considered as less risk because the maximum loss is still defined albeit it can be higher than the premium for a call option. The thought process is that you are buying shares for a stock that is stable enough where any depreciation in price will be short lived (thus less risk than a call option where you don't want to pay additional premium for time.)\n\nPersonally, I think it depends on the circumstances specific to your situation and trade what strategies you should or should not use. That being said, don't short stocks or take any positions that have unlimited risk unless you are a professional. The risk is simply not worth the potential for profit.",
