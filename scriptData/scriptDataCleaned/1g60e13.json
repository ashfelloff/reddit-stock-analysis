That is not correct. In fact, many sectors of the chip industry have been in a revenue bear market for the better part of a year if not a couple years. However, it should be noted, that that's largely behind all sectors except a few specific ones that will be bottoming out here in the next quarter or two.\n\nWhat ASML indicated is that the pace of recovery from the cyclical bottom is slower than many hoped.",
