Summer is generally not a good time for stocks. NVDA will split and crash like Tsla did after it split. Market down over the summer so they can pump it in the fall for the election. I think gold will continue higher slowly and steady, and crypto. Crypto might dip with the market if it does crash. But I‚Äôm long term bullish on crypto based on the fact that every single halving has led to a new bull market even if it didn‚Äôt happen right away.

The acolyte is about to debut.  It cost as much as dune 2 to make.  Kathleen Kennedy hired strictly female directors for this and the next movies.  Female isn‚Äôt the issue though the ladies have never seen Star Wars.  They‚Äôve both shown their asses already one of them said stars needs more female representation and girl power obviously didn‚Äôt know most Star Wars shows and movies have centered around women for well over a decade. \n\nThe cast of the acolyte also have no clue about basic Star Wars story lines.  Not a huge deal but for such a big project you might immerse yourself a bit into the subject.  They‚Äôve already started making excuses for the acolyte if it failed it would be do to toxic fans.   \n\nThe new director of the movies has never made anything other than documentaries and she‚Äôs only made like 3 the most popular about feminism.  Typically you want a director to have experience in sci fi type movie making bc it‚Äôs unique with the cgi and all. She‚Äôs announced Rey will be returning as the lead character. The most recent Star Wars movies universally hated by Star wars fans but she wouldn‚Äôt know bc she‚Äôs knows nothing about the franchise. \n\nSo just a fairly simple prediction most people can see coming, bob Igor has to let go of Kathleen Kennedy if acolyte is anything other than a game changing grand slam. Disney has its backs against the wall and they re pushing away loyal fans and tanking a 4 billion dollar investment.  They‚Äôll scrap the whole dei working model a get Back to making good films.  When they can Kathleen Kennedy the stock should jump when they announce her replacement it should jump again they‚Äôll have to hire a name fans trust with Star Wars.  Then they‚Äôll announce new projects.  \n\nThere have been rumors of scrapping all current scripts and writers to replace the woke agenda.  Politics aside rumors drive stocks and when it goes in a new direction it should come out back on top.  I think for the first time in forever paramount led all movie companies in gross box office totals a spot Disney has held for years even if they took a loss. \n\nTarget is also making changes long calls can‚Äôt hurt.  do long calls they‚Äôre expensive but if you have a year or two for the stock to pop just always does and just sell for a profit.  Watch the 52 week low list for large market cap.  Be patient",
