      "body": "Look at the bright side, you made $15 on it today!\n\nBro, your average price is too high on the stock and it doesn't look like it's going anywhere up soon, but famous last words. It's a very high-risk strategy to average the shit down and will involve pumping more money into the stock. I would not suggest that, but it's an option since it's just 10% of your portfolio. If you have gains elsewhere, maybe you want to take them and adjust your average price.\n\nOr, you can take the loss and whatever you get from selling, put it into an option call and hope for the best.\n\nI was fortunate once, I could've held the stock forever but then nothing is going to change if I'm not making any moves. I had this 10K investment, took a loss of $4k, and sold the remaining $6k, I dumped all that into an option call on Amazon. Very fortunate that I caught a big upward move and ended up making $15,000 within three weeks. But it could have just as easily gone wrong. It's just one of those times when I happened to make the right move.\nAll the best brother.",
