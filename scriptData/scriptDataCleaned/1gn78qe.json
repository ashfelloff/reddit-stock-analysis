Ask yourself this question.  Is it easier to build a social network that hundreds of millions of people use or is it easier to have MBAs and programmers optimize ads on every corner of a web page?\n\nThe reach and zeitgeist of Reddit gets made fun of on WSB, but it's impact is wide ranging.  /R/nfl is the place to discuss the game -- remember when people said a million dollar for a super bowl ad was ridiculous?  Ads on game day relevant subreddits right now are ridiculously undervalued.  Reddit spawned the stock that should not be named, Name Top.  Reddit is the place to promote your movie or television show, e.g. Snyder's terrible Justice League.  /R/Wsb is THE PLACE to pump your stock.\n\nOn top of just ad rev which is responsible for last weeks trip to the moon, the API dataset is the gold standard for AI LLM.  Obligatory jokes about bots and your comments making it dumber, but it really is the gold standard.  Reddit is now turning the screws on these AI companies and they will have to pony up for access or risk potential litigation.\n\nTLDR: Making tons of ad revenue.  Looks to be making more.  Frosting with AI licensing. \n Very early in life cycle, still not too late to enter.  Position $1.3 million.",
