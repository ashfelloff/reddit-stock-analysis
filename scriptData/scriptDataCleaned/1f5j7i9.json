                          "body": "> Here's why: In 2008, the euro was worth almost one and a half dollars. By 2022, it had fallen back to close to parity. As a result, the EU economy, measured in current U.S. dollars, would have declined in dollar terms compared\nto the U.S.'s even if it had Wirtschaftswunder-like growth rates.  \nWhen you weigh other indicators, such as economic output adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), per capita GDP, or productivity per hour worked, it's almost as if a miracle has occurred-or at least, the European economy looks far better.  \nAdjusted for purchasing power, the EU output fell only 4% behind that of the U.S. over the last 20 years. Looking at GDP per capita, the EU 27 grew faster than the U.S., thanks in great part to Eastern Europe catching up and Western Europe holding steady. The only bad news here is for Italy and the Southern EU: Their GDP per capita kept falling behind.\n\nThis answers the gdp growth question and low birth rates is what almost every western nation is facing including USA.",

And even they may never surpass the US companies as they lack the cutting edge technologies like the latest chip tech that Taiwan leads and only shares with the Western (US) companies. Hence the strife between China, US, and Taiwan. Or at least one of the reasons for that ongoing tension.\n\nEU at this point feels like a \"legacy\" culture, society, economy etc. They have their legacy culture, nations, languages, economies, companies etc. They will remain first world, and they will have iconic companies that bring in revenue, but they can never surpass or lead the US when it comes to technology especially. Even US is I think having a hard time catching up to Google, Meta, Microsoft etc. They are all playing their own games and pay some hush money (or perhaps share data, tech etc.) to US government to stop them from any monopoly investigation. That's a very different kind of world.",

EU is going on their own way of more social, leftist, moderate to high taxes, unionized etc. way to organize their society, economy, business sectors etc. That is respectable and understandable after the horrors of two World Wars and being in the epicenter of decades long cold war etc.\n\nThen you have United States with a completely different culture, landscape, capitalistic outlook etc. California and Wallstreet feed each other. From one environment new companies start constantly, the other environment see which ones are profitable or visionary and inject cash into it. And the lack of or lower (compared to EU) regulations, taxes, bureaucracy etc. means more \"maverick like\" individuals to try their hand and take the risk to start companies compared to EU (and especially Germany) where it is more preferred to carry and support the established, legacy companies (BMW, Henkel, Bosch etc.)\n\nBut EU wants US like innovation and growth without offering the similar \"high risk high stakes\" environment. You can't have your cake and eat it as well. You either select a less risky, more stable, more widely supportive social/economic environment which will reduce the high risk taking, or you open up that environment to more risk and creativity, but that also has its own social/cultural problems. \n\nUS deal their own problems due to the type of society that they have but the economic and technological results speak for themselves. The poor is dirt poor, lives on the streets, and the rich is well the richest in the world and the rest use their products, services etc. Even Taliban needs to use US made software or products to keep Afghanistan going I'm sure. \n\nBut at the end of the day it's that old adage: \"You would like to work in the US, earn in the US, but retire in Europe\" or however that goes.",

The only reason companies like TSMC/ASML succeed is due to use of American IP, and those same American companies later being run by MBA nimrods that decided outsourcing everything was better for the bottom line.\n\nIf we want to do something better than everyone else, we can and will - we've never lost a battle of innovation that we've wanted to win. China isn't some manufacturing marvel. We literally offloaded what we saw as grunt work to them. If they were so amazing, why do they insist American companies that want to operate there also must share their IP? Hur dur. They are great at putting people to work like slaves for cheap, but first they need us to build a template. Not impressed.\n\nAs for tech in Europe/the rest of Asia:\n\nINTC used to own the semi-industry. TSMC didn't beat INTC - Intel gave up (sheer arrogance) so they could do more buybacks and dividends.\n\nASML wouldn't even exist without US tech. This isn't some big boast. You can look it up. How else do you think we can literally dictate who they sell to? There is a law that stipulates if a product uses enough American licensed IP, we have a right to prevent its distribution to those we deem unfit. The US Department of Energy funded and launched EUV technology - then once again, American companies got lazy, greedy, and essentially handed off the reins to someone else assuming they could always buy it for cheap.\n\nThat's another thing we also do better than others - hubris to the level of absolute stupidity.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1pd0zryfv2md1.png?width=1748&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb158f54d26b6d8fea142703f43709bb530dc219\n\nEdit: And if you get bored, google \"US medical innovation\" - 300 million people produce more than half the world's leading technical medical breakthroughs and drugs.
