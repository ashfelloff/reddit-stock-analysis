  "title": "Why the $TSLA dam will burst at $166.50",
  "score": 253,
  "selftext": "Don’t worry, this isn’t technical analysis (I already ate all my crayons). \n\nElon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn’t realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. \n\nNow TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn’t even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn’t been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. \n\nThat price? $500. But it’s $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. \n\nThe stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That’s because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. \n\nWill it close below? I don’t know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we’re one bad market day from the dam bursting. \n\nLong deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls. \n\nSource: r/gonewildstories (nsfw)",

Having to reduce prices from 50k model 3 down to 39k and 60k+ model Y down to 40k does not look good for them.\n\nPeople are no longer believing the FSD pipe dream which is very abundantly clear given that they just reduced the monthly price to $100 down from $200, and also are rolling it out to pretty much all customers for free to try to capture some interest; but it isn't working.
