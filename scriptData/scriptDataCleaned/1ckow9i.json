  "selftext": "Recently, I've been scrolling through loads of Insta Reels featuring Crocs. Came across one where Crocs cars were cruising around town. You might wonder, what's the big deal? But there's some serious genius behind Crocs' social media game. They've got like 2 million followers on TikTok and Instagram, and their viral videos rack up millions of views. The younger crowd is all over Crocs and see see 'em as cool. But what really catches the public eye are those limited collab Crocs. Like, have you seen the Pringles Crocs? They're awesome if you ask me. I live in the Netherlands, and every time I've tried to get a limited edition pair, they're sold out within days. And they go for 70 euros, which definitely means some sweet margins for sure.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0rmn0u52kgyc1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2e02d522ae85b9e75f35e2325b47b9b74bc35d3\n\nCrocs as a brand is killing it, but their 2021 acquisition of Heydude isn't. Heydude's revenue is expected to take a hit, dropping by 22%, while Crocs' revenue is set to climb by 7%. Seeing the struggle, Crocs decided they needed to shake things up at Heydude and brought back Terence Reilly as Heydude's president and as Crocs' VP. Now, you might be wondering, who's this Reilly dude? Well, he's the brains behind those Stanley bottles that were hugely popular earlier this year. I've even seen videos of folks fighting it out over one bottle at Target. Reilly took Stanley's revenue from 70 million in 2020 to over 800 million in 2023, and now he's at Crocs. Seems like a long-term play, but I've got a feeling Crocs' guidance is gonna be solid with this guy onboard. \n\nForbes even did a whole video about him, talking about why brands should be taking notes from his marketing masterclass: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9IF7wBnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9IF7wBnus)\n\nBut what does that mean for their financials? Well first of all Crocs is seriously undervalued compared to other big names in the footwear game. They're trading at a PE ratio of 9, while Skechers sits at 18 and PVH at 11. Crocs just soared 12% in their latest earnings report, thanks to record-breaking revenue and profit. The only thing was their guidance for next quarter, which came in a bit soft. They're expecting revenues to dip by 1.5%, mainly because of Heydude's revenue slump. But with that soft guidance, there's definitely potential for a surprise in store.\n\nCROX is set to drop their earnings on May 7th before the market opens. The implied move is around 10%. I'm planning to dive into some call spreads worth 4k next monday and will put the details here.",

I bought CROX because the financials look too good.\n\nPreviously I thought it was just goofy looking rubber shoes, but after doing some research I realized there's so much more to it. I suggest watching Rose Anvil's youtube video where he cuts crocs in half and explains their features.\n\nI just bought my first pair of crocs two weeks ago for outdoors. While browsing, I noticed that not all crocs look goofy, and a lot of them actually look aesthetically pleasing. Then last week I bought another pair to use as indoor slippers. It's actually kind of addictive.",
