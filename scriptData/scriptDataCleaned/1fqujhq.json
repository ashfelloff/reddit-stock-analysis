  "score": 346,
  "selftext": "RKLB is complicated. It’s a rocket and rocket systems end to end company.\n\nI’ve seen many confuse it with RKT- a mortgage company, that is how regarded people are.\n\nIf you read my DD on HIMS it was much more complicated.  If you traded on that, congrats you are up 18% in less than a month.\n\nI’ve done similar research on RKLB and taken a $12k position in calls expiring January.\n\nHere’s the quick DD:\n\nThey make rockets, and successfully launch satellites into orbit for small and medium size satellites.\n\nSpacex has a sort of monopoly on launching the larger satellites with larger rocket, Falcon 9.\n\nRKLB, is making a rocket to compete with falcon 9 and will be done in a year or so.\n\nSpacex has a $200B or so evaluation.\n\nRKLB has a $4B evaluation.\n\n200/4=50 \n\n50x gain opportunity.  And that’s just shares.\n\nWith options napkin math you can 5-10x ur gains if you pick the right contracts.\n\nSo there’s a 250x return here just waiting to be taken.\n\nRisks people keep saying that aren’t true:  “they will go bankrupt their cash burn is crazy!”  \n\nThey are actually profitable if you don’t include what they are spending for the next year or 1.5 years to finish their falcon 9 competitor rocket, which is the whole point of the thesis.\n\nThey have executed flawlessly on building many rockets so far that are putting satellites into space.\n\nThere is a more complicated platform play here for the true artists.\n\nBut personally I like to keep it simple:\n\n250-500x return on long calls, 50x return on shares.\n\nBuy buy buy \n\nExcept this isn’t financial advice,\nIt’s a fucking rocket company\n\nU can lose all ur money but imo gamble is\nWorth it not much else has this kind of potential.",

In a few years when they have more cash on hand and it seems more certain which type of satellite businesses are the most lucrative (earth imaging, communications, defends/spy sats or a new use we haven’t realised yet), there’d be nothing stopping rocket lab from building and launching their own constellation of satellites to make a bunch of money, similar to how spacex has built and launched their own constellation. So while it’s fair to not pin $200bn expectations to RKLB because spacex has starlink which contributes vastly to that figure, gotta keep in mind rocket lab could easily have their own “starlink” <- obviously not Starlink, what I mean by that is their own constellation to bring in revenue, whatever purpose that constellation might serve. \n\nThe growth prospects of this company are huge",

Their constellation plans are currently nothing more than passing commentary. So SpaceXs valuation is more comparably $80-100B relative to RKLBs $4b. \n\nRKLB is also 5-10 years behind SpaceX and there’s huge risk in the Neutron program.
