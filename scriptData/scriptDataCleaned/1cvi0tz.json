He claimed that every car already had the needed hardware for FSD before launching several revisions and sensor suite overhauls.

In slower, more urban traffic it's a jerky mess.  It's particularly bad at the roundabouts near my house.  I don't use it there because I know it'll only piss off other drivers.\n\nIt's useful for long highway cruises, but It's not exactly confidence inspiring in city driving.\n\nAlso, the video being cited was from Whole Mars Catalog, an unabashedly pro-Elon/pro-Tesla account, not a source I'd trust for a balanced perspective.",
