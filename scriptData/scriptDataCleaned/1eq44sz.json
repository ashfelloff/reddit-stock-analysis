      "body": "The Blue Ocean Alternative Trading System (BOATS) is an execution venue that Robinhood uses for its 24-hour trading service, allowing users to trade stocks outside of traditional market hours. However, recently there have been issues with this service.\n\nOn August 5th and 6th, 2024, Robinhood had to suspend its 24-hour trading service due to problems with Blue Ocean ATS. This suspension happened during a period of significant global market volatility, which included a major downturn in Japan‚Äôs Nikkei index. During the suspension, users were unable to execute trades between midnight and 8:00 AM UTC, although they could cancel orders or place new ones for later sessions.\n\nThis suspension led to significant user frustration, with many expressing concerns over the legality and transparency of the trading halt. Some users reported that trades executed before the suspension were later canceled, leading to potential losses, particularly in volatile stocks like Nvidia, which saw significant price movements during this period.\n\nThe issue highlights the challenges and risks associated with extended-hours trading, especially during times of market instability. BOATS implements risk controls similar to public exchanges, such as limiting extreme price movements, but the recent events have raised concerns about the reliability of these systems during turbulent market conditions.\n\nFor more detailed information, you might want to check sources like TradingView and Cointelegraph, which have covered these developments extensively [oai_citation:1,Robinhood suspends 24-hour trades for 8 hours](https://cointelegraph.com/news/robinhood-24-hour-trade-suspend-8-hours) [oai_citation:2,Robinhood suspends 24-hour trades for 8 hours  ‚Äî TradingView News](https://www.tradingview.com/news/cointelegraph:425f45f27094b:0-robinhood-suspends-24-hour-trades-for-8-hours/) [oai_citation:3,Robinhood Halts 24-Hour Trading Amid Volatility, X Community Furious | BanklessTimes](https://www.banklesstimes.com/news/2024/08/05/robinhood-halts-24-hour-trading-amid-volatility-x-community-furious/).",
