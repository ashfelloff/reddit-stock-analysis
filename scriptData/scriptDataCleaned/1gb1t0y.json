Maybe a 4070 if the price is right.\n\nMost of the improvements from generation to generation are just based on the process node used. NVidia got a big jump in performance on the 3000 cards over 2000s by switching from Samsung to TSMC (which immediately gave them a 15% improvement to power, plus the normal ~10% generational improvement). Now the 4000 and 5000 cards are being fabbed at ChadSMC, and NVidia doesn't have that performance-boosting trick in their bag any more. \n\nFrankly, TSMC 3nm and 2nm don't look like super huge improvements over the 4nm node that the 5000s are using. Maybe like a 10% jump each. So the 5000 is a good stopping point for anyone but the diehards IMO.",
