  "selftext": "Hey fam,\n\nLet's talk Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) and how it stands in the face of the escalating geopolitical drama around Taiwan. TSMC, the heart of global chipmaking, is smack in the middle of this tension. If things go south, what’s the play with Intel?\n\n**Why Taiwan Matters:**\nTaiwan is HUGE in the semiconductor game because of TSMC. It’s the backbone of the supply chain that feeds giants like Apple and Nvidia. But with China’s eyes firmly set on Taiwan, there’s a real risk to stability here.\n\n**TSMC’s Tight Spot:**\nLong story short – TSMC is in a geopolitical hotspot. Any military or political upheaval could lead to serious disruptions. We’re talking damaged facilities, production halts, and potentially losing market share if clients start looking for stability elsewhere. It’s impossible to overstate how much would be lost if a hot conflict erupts. I would expect TSMC, &  to go to ZERO - 5 minuites after a shooting starts. TSMC has built in failsafes to destroy some aspects of their fab if China tried to take them by force. \n\n**Intel’s Edge:**\nHere’s where Intel could swoop in. Unlike TSMC, Intel’s got a hefty chunk of its manufacturing stateside and in the EU. They’ve been pouring cash into expanding their U.S. fabs, which could be a massive advantage if TSMC gets hit.\n\n**Bottom Line:**\nBetting on Intel could be a smart move. They’re set up to handle the fallout if Taiwan's situation goes sideways, likely going back to 90’s level  market share and emerging even stronger with contracts from what’s left of NVIDIA.\n\nWhat’s your take? Bullish on Intel given these factors, or is there too much uncertainty in the chip sector right now?\n\n---\n\nWould love to hear your strategies and thoughts on this!\n\nTLDR - I’m not an optimist. In the longterm, I think that war or political conflict over Taiwan is inevitable. That being the case, if Taiwan goes down, TSMC goes down. If TSMC goes down, NVIDIA go down too. Who’s left in this scenario? Intel. That’s the only real game in town after this shit. \n",

Intel uses a lot of partners in Taiwan - including TSMC that is used in the supply chain.  All those partners would basically halt the global supply of most semiconductors.   A conflict in that region would also temporarily halt the demand of chips.  It's really a lose/lose for all companies - I don't know of any winners in this scenario.    \n\nBut - I can think of some good reasons to own Intel for a 2025 turn around:\n\n1) Intel will have a state of the art fab with the 18A process starting some time next year.   The fab will have clients outside of Intel (including Microsoft).\n\n2) Intel is starting to compete with AI and it should only get better from here with Gaudi 3, Lunar Lake (laptop + handheld CPU) in 2024 , and a dedicated AI server GPU (Falcon Shores) in 2025, and Arrow Lake/Panther Lake in 2025 for the desktop AI CPUs.\n\n3) Much improved discrete Battlemage GPUs should finally be available in the near future as well.    \n\n\nI see Intel having a really rough 2024 - but I think in 2025 people will start seeing the potential.   I am definitely buying Intel stock  at these lower prices.",

      "body": "China is all bark and no bite. Wolf warrior diplomacy is their game and Taiwan is an easy nationalist rallying point that they will absolutely milk for all its worth. They like having Taiwan exist as it does because it creates a target, an object of desire to call upon and rally the masses, \"we will take Taiwan back!\" and all that. It cannot serve this purpose if they actually do it. \"B-but they did it with Honk Kong\". Much different circumstances, different geographical proximity, different setup, different stakes. They absorbed Honk Kong through subversion which means that ultimately business carries on as usual. Sucks for Honkongers but the rest of the world at large is unaffected. For China to benefit from such annexations, aside from their 15 minutes of fame which politically don't mean much since the same party has absolute authority anyways, they need to annex them intact. Honk Kong is a major economic hub and getting to stick their hands in those coffers is the whole point. Taiwan too, as a major industrial hub, is only worthwhile if it remains intact. Taking the island by force is next to impossible for various reasons, and even if they succeed it will be destroyed and be worthless. Taking it by subversion may be possible, but it will take time and not really affect the world at large, again business will continue as usual. China has no real friends but they've shown they prioritise trade relations above all else. Taking Taiwan won't mean much when they get sanctioned to hell and don't have where to sell their goods. US and Europe are trying to cut their China dependency, slowly but surely, so there's only so much they can push before they lose their customer base which is more important than any piece of land and whatever symbolic value it has. They also risk outing themselves as the paper tiger that they are if they do attempt to forcefully take it and not immediately succeed. Taiwan won't go down without a fight. \n\nBut this is wsb so let's go back to the stock. INTC is undeniably and fundamentally a great company, world leading on processors. But their stock is just shit. Don't ask me why because I really don't know but it's been pretty much trading sideways for 20+ years. It's maybe a decent long term dividends hold if you're ok with the massive range it has, so you're holding 60$ stocks for 2 years and then 30$ stocks for 2 years and then 60$ again so let's say average of 45$. Options plays on it are useless unless you're buying 1-2 year LEAPS because it's otherwise going sideways most of the time. Price ***could*** go up if they make some amazing AI announcement that changes the game but I doubt they can truly break out from their average of the past 5 years. And it  ***could*** go up if Taiwan is sacked but I honestly don't see that happening no matter what the papers say. \n\n**TL;DR:** Don't bank on Taiwan being attacked to make money. No matter how you look at it from opportunity costs alone INTC is not a good stock and your time and money are better utilised elsewhere. There are better chances on a shorter time frame for AMD to break out playing catch up to NVDA, as in the next couple of years or so compared to Intel who may keep trading at a 45$ average until the sun goes out.",
