If it hits $160, I'd say that means it got back to $140 range in the pre-earnings run up & then it hit $160 in early to mid September (but still before 9/20).\n\nThis week will be key with AMD AMZN APPL MSFT & META all reporting.

But overall... the stock will keep climbing as long as every product they can make is already pre sold. That is a GREAT problem to have for any company. Add to that, they are not selling to retail to make those big dollars.... that is CapEx spending to all the BIG players. Anyone who can't get the cash in hand as soon as the part is ready... they move on to the next guy who is cash in hand!!!!!\n\nHUGE list of BIG CapEx buyers that are ready and able to spend.
