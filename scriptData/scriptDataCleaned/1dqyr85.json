      "body": "This was rough for me. I was getting back into options after taking a year break. Over 6 years I was down almost $30k.\n\nOver a month ago I set eyes on MU and bought $120C for 7/19, $500 worth. It tripled in value after a few weeks, MU was already past the strike. I decided to place a much larger stake for earnings, I wanted to erase my previous losses and go back to just buying shares. Took out a loan for $17k. I put it into a variety of MU calls, quickly went up to +$12k. I was very happy, but I knew it wouldn't be enough. I wanted to erase my mistakes, and this seemed like as good of a chance as I was going to get. I wanted to reposition so I sold my options, planning to buy back in ASAP. I don't have margin available so I had to wait until the next day for the funds to settle. The next day it was like +5% at market open. I thought okay it's obviously going to go back down so I waited it out, but some puts. but it was +3% like two days in a row after that. So I thought damn okay, price targets are all being raised to like +20%, this is going to stay here or rise until earnings and then really pop. I bought back in, fully. That did not happen. It just kept going down. After it was down quite a bit from the peak I realized that even a +200% wouldn't cut it, so I put another $5k in. \n\nMorning of 6/26 I had like $16k, up $2k from the previous few days. It was doing good in premarket, I felt good about it. I was planning to listen in on the earnings call, my first one. I thought I saw somewhere that it was at 6pm. I checked the stock at like 4:30 and saw that it was down 10%... freaked out. I thought maybe this was sort of normal for earnings calls, right before the call the stock might go up or down but it won't be very indicative. but I looked up the earnings call and I guess it had started already, so this was the actual result and this situation was real.\n\nwhen it was down 6% i checked the simulated returns and saw that I should be down like 60%. well, at least it's not everything. i realized it might not be taking the expected volatility from ER into account. that guess was correct, I was down 91% at market open. i had $500 left, I put it into a TSM call. aside from that i'm just going to focus on paying back this personal loan... part of me hopes that i never do this shit again, part of me hopes that i do it again and finally win once and for all. sigh.\n\ni'm still doing fine financially, even though this loss was huge. i have $10k in the bank, so this loan is more than the amount that i actually have. but it's $366/mo, for five years. i'll probably pay it off sooner than that. I'm 24 and making $84k in a medium COL area, so overall i'm still okay. it's easy for me to cope. it's not my first time so it really doesn't sting that much.\n\nif i learned *anything*, it's to not buy expensive options. out of curiosity i checked the puts, and the recently-ITM puts were *down 50%*. i made some bad decisions, but the whole time i was wondering if it was overall just a bad move to buy these options since they were so expensive. i think the correct answer was yes.",
