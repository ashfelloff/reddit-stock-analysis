Asts' goal is to provide service to these phone companies to ensure they don't have deadzones by not relying on only cell towers. In areas like camping grounds and such. Btw, they have over 40 cell phone companies already buying into their idea because of this. It's a huge perk to have more coverage than your competitor.

Those want to expand coverage to as many places as possible. But in a lot of places it's not cost effective (or not possible) to build tower. That's where ASTS step in because their sats are basically cell towers in the sky. ASTS plan to do that in several countries. They basically allow MNO to expend coverage to remote / desert areas. There are also government uses cases for example setting up emergency satellite network when natural disasters destroy terrestrial network infrastructure.\nEven when the service is available, end user probably won't know they are using ASTS satellites",

They use ASTS satellites to do so. They charge their customers extra for the service. That ‘extra’ is split 50/50 with ASTS. \nThat’s it. \n\nAs for it being ‘substantial revenue,’ well let’s put it this way, multiple large cap companies are paying tens of millions effectively just to be front of the queue for the service.  One of them put out an early advert with Ben Stiller to plug it. \n\nNow, maybe these massive multinationals just like to piss money down the drain or just perhaps the people who know the telecoms industry best believe that this is going to print.",

They sign a $200 million coverage contracts and sell that shit to everybody in their cellphone plans. Everybody. Sneak it in their contract like a roofie and charge em nickels for it.
