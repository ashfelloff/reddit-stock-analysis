When this happens, banks are required to convert assets (investments) to cash at market prices. If this happens at a bad time for asset prices, a bank can implode quickly and even instantly. This happened quite recently in Q1 of 2022, but has happened thousands of times in the last 100 years which is why the banking industry is heavily regulated.",
