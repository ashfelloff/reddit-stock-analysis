Why do most stocks fall/lag the overall market on their ex-dividend day? Because price is being adjusted by a similar amount. What you need to know is that price appreciation and dividends are not mutually exclusive, if a company doesn't pay dividends all the value created is distributed through price appreciation, with that in mind once they distribute dividends price is adjusted leaving you were you started. Divends do not directly create value, they are great signals though when evaluating a company. That's why when a company that has never paid dividends announces a quarterly dividend payout the stock might really which is counter intuitive but the rationale behind that rally could be that because of asymmetric information the agents at those companies have a more positive/stable outlook for the company which leads to a reduction in risk/cost of capital and then price appreciation, on the other hand when high growth companies suddenly announce quarterly dividend payout their stock might decline because the market believes the company no longer as growth prospects and with narrower future growth comes lower prices.¬†",

This again goes to my point of signaling, if a company as a significant cash balance and doesn't pay out dividends, the executives are likely to chase value destroying activities and this leads to a discount in price and if the company doesn't end up doing something stupid and rather pays a dividend, price appreciates it's not because they paid the dividend rather it's because they did not destroy value by pursuing stupid projects.",

Both would return value to the shareholder either in the form of a cash dividend or stock price appreciation.\n\nAgain, I do not say that the dividend would have created value...I am saying the dividend literally did CREATE value to the shareholder.  It's right there in their account in the form of U.S. dollars.  That's fucking value.  To argue otherwise is ludicrous.\n\nIt's like you're getting it but you're not:\n\nTo issue a dividend is literally returning value to the shareholder.  To spend that money doing whatever they do with it does not always translate into value for the shareholder.  People may not like that the value being returned is in the form of a dividend, but to argue that that is somehow not value returned to the shareholder is just wrong.",

I have faith the company is doing big things, but then we get to the meat of this.  AI.  AI is why Nvidia is +200% in less than a year, and 750% since the beginning of 2023.  So what is this AI?\n\nIt's the new big thing, look at all these cool things we can do with it, it's going to be big, nvidia is leading!  So far, AI falls into three categories.  A soon to be copyright hell with how it pulls data, a way to eliminate help desk people by providing information on fixes and help, and a way to write up complex documents such as for lawyers, doctors, and even research.  Problem is, the last two could be a disaster.  For one, a help line giving someone bad information that damages equipment or hurts the person will not only result in shutdowns, but will incur legal expenses.  Second, we already seen what happens when lazy lawyers and such rely on this.  It requires in depth analysis or it risk bad information.  Maybe they do something crazy, but I think in the next few years, we'll find AI is less useful for everyday use than we thought, at least for businesses, and that's where the problem lies.  If it can't make money, it's a toy, and it's less useful, and if it goes that route, companies like nvidia riding this wave are in trouble.",

They manage to connect every major city with their fiber cables without ever knowing what the internet will become. Then the internet goes mainstream and Nvidia is the only name in the game that enables high speed internet. Yes, there are other competitors with dsl and broadband copper lines but Nvidia is the only with fiber.
