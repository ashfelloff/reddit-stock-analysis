All the neighbors protested it at every meeting and stalled the project. Last I heard, it is still stalled. They would be fine if it was a luxury development, they just don't want affordable housing built in their neighborhood because it might impact their property values. Same thing happened in San Diego with a downtown project and it got stalled as well. There are huge tracks of land that are owned by developers out in the desert that they can't build on yet because they haven't gotten approval. Many of them are waiting for ballot initiatives to pass that'll allow them to build. \n\nThe problem is that these homeowners do everything they can to push up their own personal property values, and this means crushing new developments as much as possible.",
