These cases will force him to loan or sell shares of $DJT, which would likely sink the share price.\n\n- The price is current at $60.00?! Everyone will definitely sell and I’m going to make a killing on the downfall.\n\nBull:\n\n- This is Donald Trump’s company? He wants to restore free speech? I want to be a part of this, so I’m gonna buy shares.\n\n- Donald Trump’s company just went public? This guy is the world’s #1 self-promotor & people are going to go crazy for this. I’m in.\n\n- The price is currently at $60.00?! I can get in early and in 10 years this thing will go 10x\n\nLike everything that relates to Donald Trump. $DJT is polarizing subject. Some would relish in seeing this thing completely and utterly fail, while others hope to see this truly succeed.\n\nSo why does this matter? If you happen to be in the I don’t GAF camp, I’m just here to make money. Then here’s why it matters, the politics of this stock has created a massive short squeeze opportunity the likes we haven’t seen since the stock who shall not be named (... \"we like the stock\").\n\nLet’s take a look, starting with the most recent ORTEX data:\n\n[SI Overview](https://preview.redd.it/k1hn3qhqqvrc1.png?width=3584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c7dbf15c7638766bc500d7d8f049bc133ac4a0d)\n\n1. the Short interest value is $278.73 million.\n2. the Cost to Borrow is at 342.71%.\n\nFor those who don’t follow this kind of thing, most stocks, especially those that are widely held and traded have a relatively low cost to borrow rate, often below 5%. Stocks that are in high demand for shorting, have limited availability, or are perceived as having higher risk may have significantly higher borrowing costs. Rates above 20% are generally considered high and indicate a particular set of circumstances that makes shorting those stocks more expensive. 290.65% annual borrowing cost is far outside the norm, It suggests an exceptionally high demand to short the stock, combined with a very limited supply of shares to borrow. Here’s where things get interesting…\n\nLet’s take a look at how much shorts are spending daily with these numbers:\n\n(SI \\* CTB) / days per year = cost per day.\n\n**($278,730,000 \\* 342.71%) / 365 = $2,617,083 per day the shorts are paying to borrow shares & short $DJT!**\n\nHow did shorts do lasts week with these high rates and high demand for $DJT?\n\n*Processing img 7rj9qlkubwrc1...*\n\nThey took a $95 million loss, lol!\n\nSo what are shorts doing now? Are they running for the hills? Are they declaring defeat?\n\n*Processing img anagfj98cwrc1...*\n\n\nNope… They’re doubling down. Last Thursday they borrowed over 879k shares at a borrow rate of \\~ 600+%!!!\n\nWhich brings up the question. What are the shorts betting on?\n\nIt’s simple, the shorts are betting that they can get shareholders to sell based off the fundamentals of $DJT. Is this company making money? Is it worth the current valuation? The answer is no and no one would hold after acquiring these gains, right?\n\nWhat they aren’t realizing here is Trump supporters are holding $DJT. The same people who after 2 impeachments, 4 indictments, Jan 6th, “Grab em’ by the p\\*\\*\\*\\*”, $DWAC SEC investigations, <insert random scandal here>, aren’t leaving his side. They are still buying his $400 shoes [for over $450,000](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-sneakers-ebay-profits-1872111), buying 110,000 of his [$100 “Trump baseball cards”](https://opensea.io/collection/trump-digital-trading-cards), and more than anything, still voting for him. These people would march through the gates of hell for Trump and would die before selling their shares. The shorts are GROSSLY underestimating to what lengths these people will go for Donald Trump.\n\nThis brings us to the crux of the situation. The shorts need to keep the price down and are throwing the kitchen sink at it. If they can’t, they will be forced to cover 4.5 million shares worth at whatever price the holders deem their shares are worth. All this while it’s costing the shorts $2,617,083 dollars per day to keep this going & it costs $DJT holders nothing. It’s quite clear which side can outlast the other in this situation.\n\nThat’s all I have to share for now. I hold $DJT shares and options. Obviously the squeeze would become more likely if investors buy shares in addition to options. Feel free to double check and correct any of my info. Good luck to everyone no matter what side you fall on. Hopefully we all can make some money on this.\n\n",

TMTG includes none of Trump's real estate, naming rights, companies or any revenues from anything else he owns. It's got to be one of his lowest value assets that's barely even a company at the moment. Could this change later on if he wins the election? Sure.

Their main revenue source is going to be political advertising and they have only 1 general election within the time they have left to make the company profitable. So 2024 is going to be their best shot. \n\nIf Trump loses in October, truth social becomes worthless. All they have are Trump fans who are politically motivated...so if the Trump fan base loses interest in politics then the entire revenue stream dies.\n\nDJTs best shot is to pump RNC money into Truth Social advertising.  However, since this only reaches die-hard trumpers, it's a huge waste of the cash in their war chest.  So a win for $DJT spells almost certain disaster for the RNC. \n\nIt's a catch-22. If he pours RNC advertising money into Truth Social then in 6 months he will be able to sell a bunch of stock and stay afloat...but the RNC will probably lose the election and lose badly. He will then have about 3 months to take his money and run before the Ad revenue dries up in November 2024.\n\nBut if he neglects Truth Social and advertises with platforms that have a broader base, truth social will be crippled by October but the party will win. But there will be no other big opportunity to make Truth Social profitable before they run out of money.\n\nSo the question is...does he save himself ...or save his people?",
