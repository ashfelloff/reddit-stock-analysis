  "title": "Rate Cut Pump and Dump Theory; BULLISH",
  "score": 42,
  "selftext": "My theory is the sharp spike and sell off that we witness today was due to the high level of uncertainty over the size of the rate cut.  It would seem that almost half of wallstreet was therefore on the wrong side of the trade today and we saw the pump get killed to give them a chance to exit their short positions, and to buy before the run-up.  \n\nI’m planning on buying some 0dte calls in the morning tomorrow.  If we move up, the move will be big.",
