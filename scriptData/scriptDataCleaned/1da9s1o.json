      "body": "I own a trucking company - class 8 18-wheelers, 48 states. My industry has been in a bloodbath since late 2022 / early 2023. Every few months something happens to one of the big boys like US Xpress with 6k trucks or Convoy with thousands of trailers. Every day we hear news about 100-500 truck companies going under. Everybody knows solo drivers owner-operators  who have quit. There are hundreds of thousands of trucks less on the road. Scams, fraud and cargo theft have skyrocketed. Freight brokers have their credit ratings downgraded and we just stop working with many of them.\n\n\nThe volume of freight is down. We need volume - we don't care if we haul corn for $20k market price or electronics for $150k - it's still 40k pounds to us. This means the US consumer is buying less shit for higher prices. There's consumer fatigue. I suspect sooner or later this will hit the other sectors too. ",
