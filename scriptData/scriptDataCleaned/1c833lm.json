(I’m 100% not joking.). One man wrote me a letter telling him I gave him his manhood back as he felt like he couldn’t provide for his family, and I enabled him to do so.

I don't post a lot but most of you invest on yolo, feeling, mysticism, and news that doesn't always manifest as to what the market will do. Gambling addicts lose a lot of money typically and it's stupid.\n\n\nWhat percentage of you are successful? It's ridiculous. The \"I turned $1000 into $300,000 and into 4 cents in a week\" stories are sad.\n\n\nI realize it is your generations and this wsb bro culture just empowers and enabled people to make dumb mistakes with their money. GameStop was never investing. AMC was never investing. I guess this isn't an investing group but just wow. \n\n\nAnyway, it is sad people are killing themselves over losses. It happened in the 20's and it has happened every year since. But this wsb yolo culture is really taking it to another level. Most of you are idiots and the smart people in here who are successful are like sick enablers watching a train wreck every single day. Why don't you help these people? \n\n\nAt least with GameStop you were acting together as one and fucking over the man. Now the man just sits in here making sure you aren't going to fuck them over again, egging you on to make independently bad investing decisions, and taking your money. Nobody in here is changing the world with SPY puts. You guys have gone from changing the world to being played like every other bad investor in history. ",
