  "score": 247,
  "selftext": "I’ve saved some money during my whole life, and I’d like to invest it. I’ve come to the conclusion that the safest method is investing in ETFs (specifically, NASDAQ and S&P 500). You won’t get rich in a month, but it grows with the time.\nI would also like to invest some money in Bitcoin (about $500) and stocks of some big companies (as they might grow faster, and I could get a little more money), but not too much because it’s quite risky.\nIf most of my money goes to ETFs, is there still a big risk?\nAnd don’t tell me, ‘If you can’t lose your money, don’t invest’. It doesn’t help me with anything.\n\nEdit: wow, this has blown up! I was not expecting that. Anyway, I’d like to clarify something: of course, the chances of it decreasing to zero are low. However, my main concern is losing money, not necessarily losing ALL of my money. I don’t wanna lose even 10% (at least, not in the long run).\nHence, I shall rephrase the question – ‘what are the chances of losing an (big) amount of my saving?’",

I see the point you're trying to make but I don't think anyone should have regrets in that instance because it would require them to have known the future which is impossible. Obviously if someone somehow knew that in the future money would be meaningless, then they could just buy Ferraris and hookers, but they'd never know that",

If you're 25 and you don't have specific short-term goals where you'd need the money, then yeah sure go for it (that's my current approach). If you're 55 and you want to retire in 10 years, you might start allocating things into less volatile investments because you might not even be around to see the market recover if it crashes as soon as you retire.",

This offsets the maximum loss they would’ve suffered. For example, I used an sp500 DCA calculator with contributions increasing with inflation from January 1996 to today, investing $1000 a month. In that 28 year period, following the above DCA strategy and with dividends reinvested, the total cash contribution from the investor is 482k. The portfolio value at the end is $2.2 million (10% rate of return) or 7.5% return if you adjust for inflation.

That said, one must be prepared and accepting volatility.\n\nIf one sells when the market is down, the loss is most likely permanent as most investors will miss the timing of the recovery.\n\nWhile most recoveries of market corrections happen in less than a year to 3 year time frame, that is not always the case.\n\nThere are periods of time when markets can fall dramatically and take many, many years to recover.\n\nFor example, it took about 13 years for the QQQ to recover what it lost in the 2000- 2002 dot.com bubble burst where the QQQ lost 80% of its value over that 2 years and didn't get back to same level until 2015.\n\nS&P 500 fell by 56% in the great financial crisis of 2007 - 2009 and it took about 5 years to recover.\n\nThe Japanese market collapse of the early 1990s famously took 30 years to recover the previous high.\n\nThe most important thing is to stay invested, be invested in diversified ETFs and keep investing new money regularly to take advantage of low prices when they occur.\n\nWish you good luck!",

Stock market has always had inherent risks that are vastly different from other types of investment because a lot of times, what you are doing despite due diligence is just wagering a bet. Go on wallstreetbets and see the kind of behaviour exhibited there; some of it is not too dissimilar to what you would see in a casino, just that your chances of winning on the stock market is significantly higher than that of Las Vegas. \n\nAt the end of the day, the retail investor is at a significant disadvantage compared to HFs and certain people of power because of an information asymmetry. Because they know people and have information that most retail investors cannot access, they are able to play things on the market to their favour *cough cough Pelosi*. But despite that, if you made the right choices, you could still aggregate 5%+ returns in a month, only that YOU are the one who has to decide when to take profit and exit, because no one else will do it for you. Staying too long in a stock can sometimes be costly; one day is all it takes for a +7% return to become -5% in some cases. \n\nIf you are able to put the money away for an extended period without touching it, and want less risk, then do consider a fixed term deposit with any of the major banks; because interest rates are still so high, you can still find 1 year bonds paying out 5% or so interest. It’s mostly hands-free and does not require you to make decisions like you would on the stock market on when to take profit or invest in something. Hope you figure a way to make things work OP.",

That's the difference between strategically investing in companies/\"the market\" versus playing the market like a slot machine.\n\nFor example: Let's look at the \"chances\" of the following:\n\n* On the 5/10/20 year scope will you loose money on the S&P 500?\n\nProbably not.\n\n* What are the chances of losing your money if you blindly through it at a small cap pharmaceutical company? \n\nI can't say for sure, but the chances are comparatively WAY higher than if you had stuck that money into the S&P500.\n\n-----\n\nThe important difference between the two is understanding WHY. It's different because small cap pharma lives and dies on FDA trial approvals and hype leading up to report dates; and rarely do they ever have something supporting them in situations where they fail to meet their metrics. That's why you might see on the bets wall street sub-reddit that one SCP might pop 1,000% in one quarter while 50 others go bankrupt in the same time.\n\nIn comparison, the S&P 500 being an averaging of the 500 strongest companies on the stock market; if whomever is in 480th place on the S&P500 makes an internally bad choice and results in them having a bad week/quarter, it doesn't kill the index because there are 499 other, probably, well preforming companies to hold up the value of the index overall.\n\n-----\n\nThat is to say, in answering your original question.\n\n\"What is the chance that you loosing a (big) or (>10%) amount of your savings?\"*\n\nIf you invest entirely on the indices like the S&P500 (or their sub indices like the Vanguard 500 and the Schwab 500), very very low.\n\nIf you invest entirely on inherently very high risk individual stocks, very very high.\n\nIf you invest on anything in between, could go either way depending on how smart or dumb the company leadership is.",

If you made a mistake, you can buy back in. This answers your question can I lose all my money. You can lose all your money if your not paying attention. 3) I would rather miss out on a couple of dollars in profit than lose a couple of dollars. It is important to remember in the stock market you are CONSTANTLY learning, building discipline, patience. The stock market is the great economic equalizer. It does not care about your color, your education, how much money you are putting in. It requires you to take 100% responsibility for your actions. There are NO do overs. If you make a mistake and lose money the brokerage is NOT going to cover you. If you have access to the internet and have some money to get started you can turn a few dollars (over time) into a fortune. Losing some money (even all your money) in the market is part of the learning process. I urge you to whatever amount you start with launch in an IRA It has easier tax implications (look it up). start with just the QQQ for the NASDAQ and the VOO is the S&P500.  buy a few shares (at least two) of 2 companies that are doing what YOU know. IE when I started my kids they bought Disney and Microsoft (they had an Xbox) You DO NOT have to be in a hurry. The market will be there 100 years from now.  Look up your picks in the evening or maybe just a couple of times a week see what happened. Watch the volume levels the highs and lows of the day any news that came out. KEEP LEARNING, BE PATIENT WITH YOURSELF. You will be great!",
