Saia is one of the least known companies in my portfolio, yet the strategy still works for it. Resistance levels on this one aren't perfect, but you can see it has some consistency to it. After holding for about a month, the stock gapped up 12% and I'm strongly in the green. My most recent buy is $WDAY, using the same principles. Big companies, when oversold and at support, tend to begin an uptrend; they will also gap up on less significant news because most negativity has been priced in already.\n\nMy portfolio, if you want to look: AAPL, ASTS, AMZN, CVS, HSY, INTC, LULU, META, MSFT, NKE, NVDA, ODFL, PYPL, SAIA, SBUX, SHOP, SNOW, SONY, SPOT, STLA, TSLA, ULTA, Z, WDAY",
