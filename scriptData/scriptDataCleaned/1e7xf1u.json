  "selftext": "I bought a credit spread on $spy on July 9th, expiring this Monday (7/22). After some time (days before expiration) I check my robinhood app and my account is flagged with an account deficit, and a regulation T call. There is also a new position opened of a $557 put with 9 buys and 900 shares of SPY. My account even has margin investing disabled. I don't know what to do as I don't have a spare 501k. What should be my next move?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ldo5lhf5todd1.png?width=1290&format=png&auto=webp&s=b808206eb17c81955494073a72b0e0fdf6a5c840\n\n",

Owning (being long) a put means you have a right to sell the underlying at the specified price, and selling (being short) a put means the purchaser of the put has the right to sell you (assign you) shares at the specified price. \n\nThis can happen anytime on or before the expiration date (early exercise is regarded in most scenarios, won’t get into that rn).\n\nWhoever he sold the $558P to decided to early exercise 9 puts, thus assigning OP, meaning OP has paid 558 for 900 shares of SPY. So he owes 558*900=$502200 to the broker to purchase those shares to deliver.\n\nThis may look like OP is absolutely fucked. But remember they also are long an equal amount of the $557P. Thus they can exercise their puts, selling all of the 900 shares they were assigned at $557. They lose (558-557)*900=$900 (which is much less bad than losing $500k). They actually lose $900 minus whatever credit they received to enter the trade (since selling the 557-558 put credit spread would initially put money in OPs account). So it's really not that bad. \n\nTl;dr: op received some money (credit) in exchange for the possibility that they buy high (558) and sell low (557). That possibility came true, and OP lost some money, but it was a defined outcome trade (credit and debit spreads have defined max loss and max gain).",

The options themselves are worth a ton, but your position is not when it nets out. \n\nI was in a similar position once. What I ended up doing (this is very risky and not advisable but is a potential way to profit from the situation) I held the shares and the puts and rode SPY up and followed the chart to see where it's resistance level was (requires TA understanding) and when I saw it retested it and failed, I immediately sold the shares for more than what I \"paid for them\" and covered almost the entire deficit, then rode the remaining puts all the way back down to the next support level, and sold the puts when it retested that, which covered the remaining deficit and earned me a nice profit as well. Even if all went wrong and spy kept going up or down beyond where i would break even, I could still excercise my puts and just taken the loss that I had initially paid to open the spread, which was likely just the $500 for 5 spreads.\n\nI ONCE AGAIN DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU DONT UNDERSTAND OPTIONS ENTIRELY YET. I GOT LUCKY AND WAS SMART ABOUT IT AND DIDNT GET TOO GREEDY!\n\nAlso, if you ever have a margin call, I believe RH gives you 2-3 trade days to clear it. That's why I didn't sweat it. I figured if I can't profit off this, I still have time to just cover by exercising. \n\nTHE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU HAVE TO KNOW: DO NOT SELL THE PUTS BEFORE THE SHARES. THEY ARE YOUR INSURANCE AGAINST 500K WORTH OF SHARES OF DEFICIT. ONLY SELL THEM IF YOU CAN SELL THE SHARES AT A PROFIT IF SPY RECOVERS PAST 558 AND COMES BACK DOWN TO PROFIT ON THE PUTS.\n\nsorry for all caps, but I needed to drive the point home so you don't bankrupt yourself. Because make no mistake, what I was doing was playing with RHs money and risking bankruptcy for a profit of 1.5k. Would not recommend.",
