In general, once a consumer accepts prices, why would you lower them if you don't need to? You don't. \n\n\nPeople need food, shelter, energy and the basics. That stuff isn't moving down at all. The money supply isn't drying up. This is why the 10 year auctions are selling so horribly as well. There's no demand for US debt/bonds domestically. Maybe foreign, but that's only because your rates over there are even worse. \n\n\nPrices will only come down IF THEY HAVE TO. Companies aren't going to lower prices out of the goodness of their hearts.  When defaults start ramping up and companies and individuals start to become insolvent, THATS when you'll see prices come down.\n\n\nInflation being at 2% means prices go up 2%. By definition that means prices won't go down, only up. It's going to take defaults and negotiations to accept any payment rather than no payment to reset this system to more affordable levels.\n\n\nOR we print money until we can't anymore.
