A lot of managers are today are going to go apeshit, say \"why the hell are we outsourcing our IT and observability to these clowns, we should drop them immediately\". \n\nAnd then they'll run the numbers on how much it'd take to hire and train their own IT and gulp and wonder why they laid 80% of their IT department. Or they'll look at switching to another enterprise IT solution, and it'll cost about the same except there'll be upfront costs and a rocky transition period and however much they're locked into for the next few years of their contract. \n\nAnd meanwhile, CrowdStrike is sending them apologetic sales representatives and cybersecurity analysts talking about how they're immediately implementing procedural fixes and here's 20% off for the next 6 months or whatever. Some places will switch, but most of them will decide it's not worth the hassle.\n\nIn October, they'll be looking fine. My bet is rebounds to $360. I'd be suprised if $400, but not shocked. But their customer losses will have been minimal, they'll have new products to focus on, etc. \n\nThat said, longterm (3-5y), you just *don't* fix this culture. Who's going to sign a new contract with CrowdStrike? How do you hire new cybersecurity/IT talent if your name is a joke? The vibe working there is going to be miserable in the coming months; they're gonna be working overtime to unfuck stuff or rush out products they can point to to assure customers they're changing, and executives will be playing the blame game. That, plus frustration at whatever existing incompetence caused this, is gonna be the kick in the pants every competent employee (who is able to, hard if you're a foreign worker on work visa) needs to get out.\n\n(To counterargue my own pessimism, Cloudflare's had some devastating outages and I think they still have a good amount of prestige. In some sense, being \"the company that broke the internet\" means you're working on something that maters. Potentially (though imo it's unlikely) CrowdStrike follows that model and this doesn't hurt them too much.)",
