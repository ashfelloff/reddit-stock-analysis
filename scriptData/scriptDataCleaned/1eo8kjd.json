I made stupid degen plays to get to 1.5m and I made stupid degen plays to get back down to 25k. Literally all I had to do was buy 30k shares of QQQ and I could've let that sit forever. I got so greedy and in turn spiraled out. I would never kms, but I understand the headspace now. The money was never mine to begin with if I never withdrew it, but still. All of the should've could've would'ves... At a *conservative* 8% return, it'd be $15m+ by the time I'd be allowed to touch it without penalty. Oh well.",

That isn’t saying to yolo everything into 0DTEs but if you look at weeklies or even a month+ out that 9% doesn’t sound crazy. The impatience and loss of dopamine is what will eat at you.

This is where patience, stability and discernment really determine if that account goes higher or goes quickly down.\n\nTake a deep breath. Life over money, always.
