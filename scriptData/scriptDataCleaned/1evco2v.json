  "score": 88,
  "selftext": "Hello fellow investors,\n\nI need some advice on what I should do with ETSY, SQ, AFRM, and PYPL. I bought these stocks 2-3 years ago thinking they’d be a good investment but now am having second thoughts. I’ve got quite a bit of money tied up between these stocks. \n\nShould I just realize my losses and write it off on my taxes and use the money to buy VTI? Or do you guys think I should continue to hold maybe eventually making a profit on them?\n\nAny advice would be fantastic for I am still very young and dumb lol (24 y/o)\n\nThanks!\n\nMy positions:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/cIPUEwI",

      "body": "Whatever you do OP, just pay attention to what VTI has done in the same time. I don't know about your world, but I'm sure you know someone who bought into TSLA 8 years ago and made 30,000% profit. (I know folks who bought into AAPL, AMD, NVDA 30 years ago, etc...) Sure, sometimes you get lucky. But most of the time, you're chasing something after the fact. At your age, you're half my age, you can go super heavy into tech (e.g., VGR, CIBR, SPY), and that's a solid move. But I wouldn't allocate more than 5-20% of your portfolio into individual stocks. One thing I might do if I were you is set up an automatic, weekly deposit of $100 into VTI and leave your portfolio alone for a few months. (Shoot, why not a year???). Slowly, you'll see those losses become a smaller and smaller percentage of your total portfolio. At which point, you won't notice those losses. And who knows, maybe they climb back in that time? But like someone else mentioned, you're doing great!!",

I am holding mine through the end of the rate cuts to see if they can restart growth.\n\nPYPL - a bit of a risk, but this is one you have to hold. Company seems to be doing okay - not stellar, but fine. Very undervalued if it is doing fine. It is crushed on fears that other competitors are going to starve it out, but again, seems to be doing fine.\n\nSQ? Owned it at one time, but not now. It is growing revenue at 20% a quarter though. Why would you not keep it? I haven't look in depth, so there may be something not obvious.\n\nRemember that Tesla was flat for 5 years before it went up 10x. If you were looking at the numbers behind Tesla, you were buying shares the whole time and not worrying about it.\n\nBest thing to do is - and I am going to make an assumption - learn how to value the companies that you hold, so you know if they are currently s\\*\\*tting the bed or undervalued. If you bought these stocks, you should know why you bought them and if your investment thesis has changed. The price of a stock often deviates from the fundamentals of the company, and this is how you find money making opportunities.\n\nPersonally, I am holding PYPL waiting for it to be valued higher. I would probably hold SQ if I owned any. I am holding ETSY to see if they can turn it around. The business story is good, the execution is not as good, and the growth is pitiful, so if revenue growth resumes, the price shoots up. AFRM - no idea.\n\n---\n\nEDIT: I want to say that I don't own huge amounts of these. These are risky. If you own a lot of this for the size of your portfolio, you should probably look for exits - but this appears to be an up market, so take your time.",
