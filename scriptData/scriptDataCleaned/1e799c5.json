I doubt anyone is migrating because the problems and challenges involved, especially considering CRWD is a really good EDR, are not worth the pain.\n\nEdit: Although maybe I could see more adoption of Defender and Cybereason as more is migrated to the cloud and EULAs and cloud native aspects of cloud provider sec tools become enticing.
