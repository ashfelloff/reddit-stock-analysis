              "body": "Honestly I don’t know why people give them so much shit for the extras. That’s the entire business model, or the base fare can’t be that cheap. Just get the maximum allowed size for your personal carry on bag and stop packing a billion things on every trip. If you’re flying with multiple people you can share larger carry-ons too. They don’t even charge more for drinks than the airport vendors and if you have airport lounge access just bring a few cans of soda with you.\n\nI can book a spirit flight, upgrade to the bigger seat, buy the WiFi pass, and buy myself a snack and still come in cheaper than a regular airline’s economy seat. Spirit mostly sucks if you’re a complete cheapskate who refuses to buy any extras at all for it to be less miserable. Bring an inflatable seat pad for their shitty hard plastic economy seats if you aren’t upgrading to the big ones, it’s like $10 for a nice one people take camping and takes up almost no space.\n\nIRL I always hear the absolute dumbest complaints about Spirit. Someone once told me that they don’t fly spirit because last time they did there were too many kids crying. Why don’t you own a pair of noise cancelling headphones if you regularly fly?! I just watch my movies on my phone, drink the can of soda I bought or got at the lounge, and either buy or bring my own snacks. It’s still way cheaper than the other airlines and maybe one out of every three flights I’ll upgrade to the nicer seats.",
