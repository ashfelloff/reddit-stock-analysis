  "selftext": "The journey this year: \n\nFirst half of this year, I was skeptical of the market and had quit my job, so I didn't touch my accounts. \n\nThen, I decided to experiment with options. I started small, trying to apply my investment lessons to longer-term monthlies (4-6 mo expiry). It went pretty well, for a while, made a bunch off the rotation trade into small-caps and consumer discretionary. Got caught a little by wide bid/ask spreads, and a bad entry on the NVDA rebound, but nothing too bad. \n\nThen I had the brilliant idea to try intraday trading weeklies. No 0 DTE, because Fidelity (thank you broker). Tried trading MA crossovers like a regard, then tried some trend-following using VWAP. Got eaten alive by ü¶Ä movement. Was up 60% three days ago, now I'm down 25% on the year. Gonna take a while to get it back now, and really.kickling myself hard for being an impulsive regard.\n\nTL;DR: I made a bunch rotation trading longer-term monthlies. Then I tried weeklies like a regard. RIP my ROTH. ",
