  "title": "Rate cut in September - Powell said it himself",
  "score": 44,
  "selftext": "\"A rate cut in September could be on the table\" - Powell's exact words, which is a big deal. This is the most concrete he's gotten about a rate cut yet. He still left some room for himself to back out depending on new data. However, he acknowledged that the trends have been good. There has been a \"significant decline in inflation\", and the labor market is showing signs of cooling. \n\nPowell is now more concerned about the job market. While the downside risk of inflation has been reduced, \"the downside risk from jobs has become real\". This marks a change in the narrative. In their questions, reporters voiced concern about the recession risk and if Powell made a mistake by not cutting rates sooner. We had an optimistic bull run in hopes of the Fed rate cuts so far. However, if the sentiment shifts more negative, the bull run could be over as soon as the Fed cuts the rates. And with people worried about the cooling job market, I suspect there will be more volatility and jumpiness to the downside.\n\nNow the big question is whether or not the September cut will be 25bp (0.25%) or 50bp (0.5%). Given how markets are expecting 25bp, and Powell likes to keep everyone from losing their minds, I think it will be 25bp. A more significant rate cut could signal trouble in the economy and an excessive jobs cooling.\n\nSo if we continue seeing the downtrend in the inflation and labor market without any unexpected swings, we will get our rate cut and a soft landing. With jobs data coming out this Friday, Aug 2nd, we will hopefully get more certainty about what comes out of the September meeting.\n\nNote: Although it was kind of expected as to what would happen during today's meeting, I just want to point out that I was right in my previous post. So there were no surprises, and the fed meeting failed to move the market.",
