And are rebounding. And I mean look at that sexy ass chart I cooked up. \n\nHas been a while since I been here. But the ticker took me back. \n\nRegardless. C9.5 end of month. Happy weekend. ",

However, to use them in industry, they must be cost efficient, scalable, and better than their classical counterpart. \n\nAll current quantum machine learning theory are based on assumption of a good quantum computer, but the hardware is still long way to go. For reference, the quantum computer at IBM(Condor with 144 qubits) only has 0.1% percent of correct output due to decoherence. What we need right now is a fault tolerated quantum computer, and the best candidate right now(Majorana particle-topological quantum computing) is extremely hard to detect, not to mention manipulating them.\n\nFor example, Shor’s algorithm, one of the best quantum algorithm, is going to need an order of 10 million functional qubits to offer its real world advantage.(https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.09749). Thus, right now, and many years ahead of us, we will still see QC limited to academia.",

We can see how ChatGPT caught Google so very off guard. These large entities get so big that they aren't sure where their left hand is at times and how to work it efficiently. My largest gripe with IonQ is that its co-founders seem to have little faith, at the very least, in its immediate rise, while the sector still has some fundamental issues that need to be resolved. To be marching down the incorrect technological path with such a high perceived valuation is not ideal. They are great at marketing and I've caught plenty of gimmick within it. Nvidia had a ton of early competitors in the graphics space and most of them we don't know much about today. The sector is an obvious win, but I'm not convinced IonQ is the obvious winner. I think it's perhaps the most overvalued in the space at current and that scares me.",
