But it sure seems like we're heading toward a breaking point - maybe that's in 2 years or maybe it won't happen for another 50.

It’s because the short end of the yield curve is influenced by bond traders’ expectations of the Federal Reserve’s actions over the maturity period, which in turn is driven by economic expectations within that timeframe.\n\nSo, if the 2-year yield is dropping sharply before a Fed rate cut materializes, it indicates that traders believe the economy is deteriorating and expect significant rate cuts from the Fed within a 24-month timeframe. (This example assumes you’re referring to the 10-2 spread in your previous comments).",
