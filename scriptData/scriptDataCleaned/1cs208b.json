You can see the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù or the price I paid to acquire the that position had increased which is why I sold it.\n\nThe numbers you are seeing on the left are simply the strike price for the specific option I traded and the expiration date of that specific option contract. \n\nThe left side does not say that I bought and sold at the same price on the same date.

The key is to avoid holding onto the option for too long because if the stock price starts to level out the IV will drop known as IV crush and the value of the option will drop dramatically. So selling when IV is high is typically what you want to aim for. Not financial advice, this is my smooth brain understanding of how these meme stocks work",

You can also resell an option contract, although the passage of time reduces their value (theta), working against you. The ability to control 100 shares for a fraction of the cost of buying them outright is why they are so volatile, relative to the underlying (i.e. the stock itself).",
