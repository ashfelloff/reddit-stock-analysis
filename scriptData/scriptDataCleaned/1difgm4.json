It’s also cheaper to invest in SPY. Small investment funds are a great opportunity for great growth and are risky, but the larger they become, the harder it seems to make solid investments because there is money that needs to be managed and more books that need to be explored before investments are made. The SPY is just a mindless beast that doesn’t require much human interaction in theory, instead focusing on few solid principles that I believe many investment firms tend to ignore sometimes because they need to be able to beat the market and can’t rely on the same principles that SPY uses. \n\nIt’s always boring because it’s reliable and stable, but SPY and any S&P500 etf that follow the principles will get good returns. It won’t be a dramatic story, but it is consistent.",
