Few hedge funds loaded up on shares around $17 earlier this year before it dropped to where it is now (around $12). Company has cash on hand, is implementing a share buyback, said “AI” a bunch in last earnings, and the OI on calls for Aug 16th has recently exploded…. Like from next to zero OI to tens of thousands at multiple strikes, all the way up to $20. Someone’s been loading a few hundred calls per day for a while now. Seems like someone knows something and ZI may pop on their next earnings (end of July). I’ve got 31 contracts, heavy on 15C and 16C but all the way up to 20 for Aug 16. Could also do nothing or tank, but keeping an eye on it.",
