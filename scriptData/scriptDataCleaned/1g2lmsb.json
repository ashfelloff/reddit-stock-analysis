  "selftext": "COST, a high volume warehouse retail store, trades at 50x forward earnings while CRWD, which literally brought the country to a halt a few months ago, trades at 75x forward earnings.  Both have PE/G ratios over 3 (1 is considered fair value).\n\nThe total market cap of the S&P is 2.0x US GDP (vs. historical norm: 0.75x-1x) while the P/E 10, i.e., Shiller's CAPE, is over 100% above its arithmetic mean and over 120% above its geometric mean.\n\nWhile the US will continue to \"quiet\" default through non-stop printing, total government debt to US GDP recently surpassed 100%, which suggests it's only a matter of time before the bond markets start to push back with higher rates at the long end of the yield curve.\n\nAs they say, you can't call the waves but you can time the tides.\n\nIs anyone adjusting their asset allocation, portfolio or going hmmm based on these metrics?\n\nNote: if you disagree, please explain your valuation methodology and how you conclude a stock (or market) is fairly valued vs overvalued.  Just saying \"people have been saying the market is overvalued for years\" or \"a correction is coming\" doesn't really address my argument unless your opinion is valuation is no longer relevant because the Fed will just keep printing until kingdom come, which is probably true.\n\n**** Thanks for all the responses - good, bad and ugly. You guys are definitely smarter than you look.",

To borrow an analogy from Cem Karsan, when you're on a jetliner, you don't really care how far off the ground you are (valuation) so long as the engines are still firing (positive flows).  When the engines cut off, how far off the ground you are is all that matters. \n\nMarkets also take a lot longer to top than to bottom, largely because a lot of people see the valuation problem and try to short while flows are still positive.\n\nIf you can't get involved in the trend, fine - at least don't fight it.  Better to wait for the dominant flows to turn negative before shorting - a good trader hopes only to catch the middle of the move.",

People who have waited to invest in periods of overvaluation have also typically missed out on strong returns as this can continue for a while. \n\nMany younger investors especially don’t seem to know what it was like to essentially have a decade of no returns (2000 to 2010, or 1965 to 1983).  Over the past 80 years of the stock market there have been several periods like this. Based on history it seems we are likely due for another period at some point of low returns.  Like COVID no one can predict the exact event that will cause sentiment to change.  \n\nAs far as reasons why the stock market might not be overvalued: 1) AI efficiencies become realized, 2) P/E multiple expansion, due to more demand to invest in assets (older people with retirement funds, more younger people saving), 3) tied with 2 a bit, the stock market may just be the best alternative available.  Long term bonds especially seem pretty risky to me with the specter of a debt fueled inflation rerun.",

My guess is any answer you can come up with (currency, commodities, gov bonds, corporate bonds, real estate, other alts, market neutral strategies) is similarly richly valued relative to the fundamentals and lurking global issues. As a retail investor, if you can identify opportunities that have uncorrelated return potential and inflation protection, but are simply too small, illiquid, or difficult, that's your edge.

That means we have trillions of dollars distorting capital markets across the world. Everything is extremely overpriced. Eg: real estate is in most countries above the price where the median salary can afford it. \n\nAdditionally the vast majority of this printed money has been given to large corporations, banks and the UHNW. This means that the people holding the money supply don’t need to actually use it for consumption, it’s purely going towards investments and asset classes. \n\nTheres nowhere else for this money to go, and it keeps being printed. We’re practically in a neofeudal society, the value of labour vs capital is worse than it was prior to the Great Depression but the financial markets have been successfully disconnected to reality, compared to back then. \n\nThe only thing that can happen in the long term is a credit shock on the dollar, that is to say that a large range of investors into US treasuries and dollars stop buying and using them which isn’t going to happen anytime soon because a failed USD would fail the entire global financial markets at the same time. It’s a Ponzi scheme that needs to keep running off the backs of future generations.\n\nThe other thing that can happen is a socialist revolution in various parts of the world that would lead to a massive shock in how secure economic assets are considered to be by investors. Right now the belief amongst banks and everyone else is that the world is capitalist and there’s no way a country risks its economic future by not putting investors first. Challenging that perception could lead to de-financialisation in a lot of sectors.",

I started work in 99'.\n\nWhat you call earnings, for us, was just investors relations (IR) telling us what the shareholders wanted their EPS to be; as you can before filing a paper to the regulator; simply modify your \"earnings\" to what the shareholders wanted. EPS is just an easily modified variable with no meaning. Check Truist Financial - they sold a \"fire sale tactic\" - aka drop your most profitable entity to ensure that even tho' your dead in the water; you still show inflated \"earnings\".\n\nBut you didn't earn anything. All you did was selling what you had. \n\nAnd companies aren't making record profits. Not based on yield out of products out of revenue. Earnings come out of selling stuff off, or cutting employees which flips a loss into a profit. \n\nDoesn't change intrinsically that the firm is still bleeding money.\n\nBeyond Meat, Lyft, Peloton, Doordash, all are good examples. Earnings isn't \"debt restructuring\". Debt isn't \"growth\". Is extending the inevitable ever more expensive bill that will come eventually. Hence firms like Beyond Meat will die as they issued a huge debt (and the redemption date is coming) and they are loss making already; no way they can pay that back. \n\nWe finally get rid of the firms who solely lived on the regime of low interest rate and used that iteratively in loops to restructure their debt to keep liquidity while their actual product became less and less profitable. \n\nAnd the labor market is strong? Based on what? What the government says? Or their metrics? Since when did the government \"save us from disasters or recessions or anything else?\" - last time I checked their so called governing of \"how healthy everything is\" during the mortgage crash. The IT crash. Etc never helped. \n\nSo why trust a pattern that veils itself as \"we are safe\" yet all other recessions the government had it wrong? I don't know; you yell me. This isn't a conspiracy this is simply stories in a history book of last recessions. And that pattern is there once more. \n\nNot that some firms aren't \"truthfully\" growing; some are; I'm long in some value stocks who I absolutely believe in; but the majority is dead in the water. \n\nBecause I don't comprehend when a firm is loss making. Has more debt than ever and debt one day has to be repaid. How on earth they will be able to afford it?\n\nThey can't make new products; no money; they can't issue more debt because the yield will be higher crushing the margins on their own product line. \n\nDo explain please because I don't have an answer.

Delusional leaders lead a country into further polarization. If I trust what history tells us; that's how (most, not all) either civil war (contained in a country) or all out war. \n\nIt's not me trying to convince anyone; it's basically repeating the patterns of history books we all got taught as kids.

Regardless A or B. \n\nProblem is; towards the elections; the polarization is absolutely maddening. Left is extreme left, right is extreme right. Populism is easy; speak to your voters what they wanna hear (even if not economically viable) - so I hope regardless A or B elected they don't do (more) short term thinking. \n\nMore spending for jobs to keep people happy short term\nBy issuing more debt and more and more..\n\nIt works.

Supply pool of voters are blissfully unaware; but hedge funds and banks are not; they see free cash.\n\nAnd I don't like it. Screwing further generations by short term thinking and short cuts to keep the electoral population happy. It works now, not the next few years. \n\nAll I can say fingers crossed, I'm an ex institutional trader since 99' and eventually headed a front office team in a large bank.\n\nAll I can say; I've seen this pattern or loop; over and over and over again. \n\nWe all know who gets hurt the most.

Now that forward PE is at 23, basically the same/higher than 2021 level (it peaked at around 25 during the dot com bubble), people are using all kinds of excuses to justify it like the Fed cutting.\n\nIn 2023, SP500 ran up 24% after a -28% correction in 2022. We are up 22% YTD after the historic run of 2023. I highly doubt there's much upside for this year. After a 10% correction, then maybe we'll talk. If it doesn't happen, I suspect there'll be a bigger correction that follows, closer to 15-20%. The catalyst could be new administration policy, inflation picking back up, treasury issuance freaking out bond market, labor market weakening leading to recession scare, etc.",

No one cares about valuation while the music is playing, and the street and buy side careers depend on on the fact you stay in it and play the game. Law of averages tell you over long periods something does occur and a discernible pattern emerges but is irrelevant if you are making short term decisions at the moment tick by tick with your life savings. Valuations can give you a picture but not the answer, and typically most utilized when attempting to explain something in hindsight, most times long after time to take action has passed. All this is occurring in time with the emergence and dominance of quantitative strategies in equities seems more than spurious to me. That's why nobody makes money consistently long term just based on predicting the markets anymore, if ever. E.g. Lynch leveraged his massive mutual fund to game the market and manipulate his holdings to his favor while Buffet's track record from pure stock picking has not been as good as the good old days when asymmetric info could be found by obsessive stock hounds.",
