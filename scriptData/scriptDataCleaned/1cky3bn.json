That's the week of 5/13.\n\nThe call is for $1000, so even if the stock was to approach the ATH of $975 that week the call will still be OTM & close to expiration, no?\n\nEDIT: I looked it up & it looks like...\n\n- $975 on 5/13 = $100k profit\n\n- $975 on 5/14 = $60k profit\n\n- $975 on 5/15 = $20k profit\n\n----\n\n- $975 on 5/16 = $25k loss\n\n- $975 on 5/17 = $70k loss\n\nSo OP needs to sell early or hope that it reaches ATH exactly 1 week before earnings (or earlier obviously).",

For the huge risk you are taking such a return is not worth it. A yolo gamble on options needs to have a decent shot at 300%+ return.\n\nAlso, if the markets get the slightest whiff of recession, stagflation, inflation, hikes, softening of labor market, war, oil hike, treasury yield hike, I mean even if Powell farts, NVDA is the first stock to take it straight in the chin.
