Tech trimmed out the extra head count and the cycle of over working groups is back in action, organizations will and are ordering substantially more hardware which indirectly ties into TSM manufacturing. \n\nThis is just industry knowledge and that is why I'm going to put $3,000 on TSM calls for July 19 @ $185. If the moon I'll win, if the don't ill lose. That's 50/50 odds and I can live with that. ",
