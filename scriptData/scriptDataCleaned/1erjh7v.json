One company has an ad I’m pretty sure could cause epileptic seizures. \n\nAnd the other ones are so off the mark it is ridiculous. One company keeps advertising their front license plate holder for Rivian R1 vehicles that attach to a tow hook. \n\nGuess what? I can’t even buy a Rivian as they’re not sold here. The amount of money these companies waste on ads must be ridiculous. \n\nI’m not sure what’s more painful, all the reposts, or all the ad repeats. No, actually I do know.
