My main theories:\n\n-Worries over GDP numbers tomorrow coming in worse than expected\n\n-TSLA and GOOG/GOOGL destroyed the market out of pure happenstance that it caused a chain reaction throughout the market as a whole.\n\nI've done a bit of reading and I think the first theory is more probable as GDP is already expected to come in lower than Q1. It won't be enough to spur on a recession as \"healthy consumer spending\" helped a slow decline. GDP will still be up at least 1.8%, I don't expect anything less but I'm also not an economist so I can't say much to that point.\n\nMoral of the story: I believe today is a result of worries from a nothing burger of what we all pretty much expected.

We've seen markets go crazy over the idea that AI will change everything, and then Google comes out saying they‚Äôre spending way more on AI than expected but still don't see any real returns yet. That made everyone nervous. But Google, being the money-making machine it is, said they're fine with overspending because it's better than underspending if AI turns out to be huge. It's a weird thing to say and not what investors want to hear, especially since so many people are already doubtful about this whole AI craze. Zuckerberg said something similar yesterday, which is why META took a hit today. You can‚Äôt just drop bombshells like Google did and expect things to go smoothly, especially when you've been telling everyone that you need to spend a ton on AI but have nothing significant to show for it.",
