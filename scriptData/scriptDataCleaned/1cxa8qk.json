More than we ever have made in revenue in the entire 100 year history of our company. \n\n They were pushing anyone with a business to take as much money as they wanted. So we did 3 months of salary because our business was effected but not as much as others so we wanted to play it safe. Then I looked at what everyone took in my area and it was insane. A brewery... a brewery in a small rural montana county took over 50 million...then 6 months later they bought a huge piece of property and built another brewery and restaurant and a massive outdoor amphitheater and a bottling facility.... like I said people who don't own businesses are far underestimating how much money was handed out and how much the banks were encouraging everyone to treat it like a pinata at a birthday party.
