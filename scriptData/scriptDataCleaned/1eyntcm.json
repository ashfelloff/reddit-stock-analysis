If the stock is at $130 range prior to 8/28, that means $155 is in play by late September (if other market catalysts don't interfere).\n\nWith your expiration date of 9/6, you might be looking at $145 as a best case scenario.  That's about 11% above $130 in a week & a half.   You didn't post your strike price, but I'm guessing it's around $120 given the cost of the contracts?  I'm guessing those would be worth around $50,000 if the stock gets to $145...\n\nYou also have the next jobs report coming on 9/6, so you probably don't want to be selling on the last day because of the risk.
