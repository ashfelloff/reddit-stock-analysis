  "score": 182,
  "selftext": "**Background:**\n\nI have been looking into insider trades around the stock BYON. I noticed some patterns regarding insider buys and the subsequent stock performance.\n\n**Findings:**\n\nHoly shit these guys (the insiders) are really fucking good at timing their own stock. Who would've known? Also note that the filings are released within 48 hours so there's very little delay on a longer scale. Plotted their buys over the past 5 years below (The ticker used to be OSTK before around October, 2023)\n\n[Insider buys, BYON, last 1 year](https://preview.redd.it/t4j041lxhk7d1.png?width=967&format=png&auto=webp&s=dabba61833e92feb58c2dd6e0cc21240c01759fa)\n\nI can't add more than one attachment, but the 5 year chart is more of the same. Insiders had cluster buys in March 2020 (500% increase in 5 months!) and November 2020 (100% increase in a month!)\n\n**Positions:**\n\nI'm buying shares for this, and maybe a couple long dated calls (17.5c, Sep 20 expiry). Setting stop loss at 10.00 for shares.\n\n**TLDR:**\n\nBYON insiders are godlike at determining the bottom. I am following their trades on a 1-3 month swing trade horizon.\n\n**EDIT: as of 12:13 on 6/20/2024 I am up 5%+ and will be halving my position.**",
