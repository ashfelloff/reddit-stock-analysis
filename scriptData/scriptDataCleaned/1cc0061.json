As there are both gay and straight men on Grindr you would likely be able to push your profit margin considerably past normal variance levels of being fucked if the photo got out - as you have higher degrees of being fucked - example being old straight fathers with multiple income sources that you can steal from.\n\nWhat’s great about this investment strategy is that the underlying asset is strong because… well who of us haven’t tested the waters on grindr and who in their right mind is gonna let those photos come out?",
