The stock was dog shit up until the ATT deal because despite the tech being incredible, the management were diluting on every single piece of news because they were poors, and their PR/comms is the worst of any company I've ever seen. It looked like they were actively trying to make cash and run the company into the ground for a couple years.\n\nThe run is partly due to the ATT/Verizon investment but mainly because the risk of management being full regard is removed. It's a legitimate exciting company now, and Abel actually looks like a bit of a genius by keeping all these deals under wraps from Starlink.\n\n[They have a spot booked on SLC-40 for later this year](https://next2space.com/spacex/slc-40/).\n\nThe only way it halves from now is if the rocket blows up, or they put the 5 bluebirds up and they don't work at all (which is very unlikely with the addition of an AT&T director on the board in the last few weeks). \n\nBy the time they get full global coverage (*if* it gets that far, big if) it will be a $100bn company minimum. Deutsche Bank's price target for 2027 is $650.",
