  "selftext": "Chinese electric car giant BYD sold a record number of passenger vehicles in August, with sales of hybrids growing faster than those of battery-only cars.\n\nThe company said August sales rose by 30% year-on-year to 370,854 passenger cars.\n\nIts sales of battery-only cars rose by nearly 12%, while hybrid-powered vehicle sales surged by 48% to account for just under two-thirds of BYD cars sold last month.\n\nIn contrast, several new energy vehicle startups saw a dip in deliveries last month.\n\nLi Auto, best known for its range-extender vehicles, reported 48,122 deliveries in August, down from a record 51,000 in July.\n\nAito, which uses Huawei technology, said it delivered 31,216 cars last month, down by more than 10,000 vehicles from the prior month. Huawei is selling the Aito trademark and patents to automaker Seres for 2.5 billion yuan ($352.5 million).\n\nLower-priced cars hitting the market\n\nNio said it delivered 20,176 cars in August, down slightly from July but above 20,000 for a fourth-straight month.\n\nThe company’s lower-priced brand Onvo opened 105 stores on Sunday as it prepares to begin for deliveries for its first car, the L60 SUV, this month. Nio is scheduled to report earnings on Friday.\n\nXpeng reported 14,036 car deliveries in August, its best month for the year so far.\n\nThe company said on Friday it began some deliveries of its newly launched, mass market Mona M03 electric car that sells for the equivalent of less than $20,000 in China. It was not clear whether those M03 deliveries were included in the total figure Xpeng reported.\n\nGeely-backed Zeekr reported a month-on-month increase to 18,015 deliveries in August, but that was down from 20,206 deliveries in June.\n\nUndercutting Tesla and going global\n\nZeekr on Friday said it would launch its first SUV this month with a price more than $1,400 lower than Tesla’s Model Y. The U.S.-listed Chinese company said it aims to deliver the SUV globally by the end of this year, but did not specify which countries or regions.\n\nBYD said it sold 31,451 cars overseas last month, pushing the year-to-date total to 264,869 and above the 242,765 cars it sold abroad for all of last year.\n\nIf BYD keeps up its average monthly overseas sales pace through the end of December, the company will sell just under 400,000 cars outside China this year, according to CNBC calculations.\n\nXiaomi only said it delivered more than 10,000 cars in August for a third-straight month. In mid-July, CEO Lei Jun said the company aimed to deliver 100,000 units of its SU7 electric sedan by the end of November.\n\nThat indicates Xiaomi needs to deliver an average of at least 16,000 cars a month from August to November, according to CNBC calculations of reported data.\n\nThe smartphone company began mass deliveries of the SU7 in April at a price about $4,000 less than Tesla’s Model 3.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/02/byd-sales-hit-a-record-in-august-despite-broader-china-ev-slowdown.html",

          "body": "Learn whats actually happening please. Nothing is stopping Chinese companies from making cars here (or partner countries). They can open factories and compete like anyone else. But their companies suck. They cant even make money in China. I think only Byd is profitable over there. The rest of the eV makers are being fully financed by the CCP to stay afloat.\n\nTo build a factory here would cost billions and defeats their entire export philosophy. There have been some attempts to start factories in the US (and Mexico) but almost every time it seems that they hinge on the Chinese companies expecting taxpayers to bend over and give them massive concessions and subsidies. This, I believe, is why the CATL plant in Michigan failed. The lawmakers/tax payers there basically said FU, pay for it yourself.\n\nLast, note that the price of these so called \"cheap\" eVs isnt as low as people think. For the most part, they are only about 10% lower than Teslas. Its not a huge difference. If they had to manufacture here, then you can bet the price will be near parity. The only advantage these Chinese companies have is the government over there, gave them factories for free and they keep financing their losses.\n\nIf you hand free factories to our companies then they could skip straight to scale production and pump out cheap eVs. But here in the USA, we dont keep supporting them like they do in China (though we did give Tesla a lot). Competition will keep them from being profitable just like they are unprofitable in China. They will just go out of business anyway and tax payers will be angry. Unlike China, we actually have elections. Note that Tesla was a special case because they were the 1st movers. They got a lot of help from CA including a free 1st factory and CA even started the carbon credit market practically for them (just to be stabbed in the back by Musk later).",

That's how they figured out how to be competitive at such prices and iterate so quickly. They're on their 7th or 8th gen of hybrids. \n\nThere's this weird \"Schrodinger's Chinese economy\" view in the West that's gained popularity.

It's pure cope.\n\nThe thought that the people who have been the world's factory for decades might be more efficient at manufacturing than anyone else never seems to be an option on the table for some reason.\n\nAs for not being able to compete on price, read about how non-Chinese automakers have slashed their prices and extended warranties to compete with Chinese EVs in Australia. They're all imported. None of them are made there.\n\nThey can sell them for those prices in the US as well, they just don't want to, and they don't have to because they can lobby government to avoid competition instead.",

The ones who fund it are taking a huge risk and in terms of the US government, they usually only do it when its something transformative.\n\nIn fact Fisker was competing with Tesla early on and failed. Whats the difference? Tesla was in CA and got a lot of help when CA was pushing green energy. This attracted more investors to get them over the top. Fisker didnt get help (forget what state they were in) and couldnt get more investors. They went bankrupt since there was no market for the cars yet. Fast forward and the newer companies are all failing left and right because they are not profitable. It appears that only Rivian will survive but even thats not certain yet.\n\nYou would have no internet today if not for the US government. The research into into modern computing wouldn't have happened if not for US government. A lot of space stuff wouldnt have happened if not for government seeding. And so on. The government was needed to fund these projects because they were too big for investors. But once they were up and running, they government tapered off (in most cases).\n\nFurther, and lets not mince words, the US doesnt take ownership of companies with the express intent of competing as an owner. How can anyone compete against a government owned business? China does exactly that which is why Chinese companies are valued far less than US companies.
