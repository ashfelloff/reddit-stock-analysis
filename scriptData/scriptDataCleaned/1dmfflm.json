ASML only licenses the tech from the US government 🇺🇸 \n\n> To address the challenge of EUV lithography, researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories were funded in the 1990s to perform basic research into the technical obstacles. The results of this successful effort were disseminated via a public/private partnership Cooperative R&D Agreement (CRADA) with the invention and rights wholly owned by the US government, but licensed and distributed under approval by DOE and Congress. The CRADA consisted of a consortium of private companies and the Labs, manifested as an entity called the Extreme Ultraviolet Limited Liability Company (EUV LLC).\n\n>Intel, Canon, and Nikon (leaders in the field at the time), as well as the Dutch company ASML and Silicon Valley Group (SVG) all sought licensing. Congress denied the Japanese companies the necessary permission as they were perceived as strong technical competitors at the time, and should not benefit from taxpayer-funded research at the expense of American companies. In 2001 SVG was acquired by ASML, leaving ASML as the sole benefactor of the critical technology.\n\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ultraviolet_lithography?wprov=sfti1#History",

This was in the 90s, you're just going to ignore almost 3 decades of research and innovation to make EUV FABs possible?\n\nResearching a subject and finding/calculating a way that \"should make it possible\" in my eyes is not the same as actually inventing and producing the machine that does it.\n\nLiterally the next paragraph of your own link that you didn't quote lol:\n\n>By 2018, ASML succeeded in deploying the intellectual property from the EUV-LLC after several decades of developmental research, with incorporation of European-funded EUCLIDES (Extreme UV Concept Lithography Development System) and long-standing partner German optics manufacturer ZEISS and synchrotron light source supplier Oxford Instruments. This led MIT Technology Review to name it 'the machine that saved Moore's law'.[7] The first prototype in 2006 produced one wafer in 23 hours. As of 2022, a scanner produces up to 200 wafers per hour. The scanner uses Zeiss optics, which that company calls \"the most precise mirrors in the world\" and are produced by locating imperfections and then knocking off individual molecules with techniques such as ion beam figuring.[8]",
