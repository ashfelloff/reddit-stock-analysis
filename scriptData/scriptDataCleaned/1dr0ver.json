Now let’s assume it stays at that price.\n\nAccording to my calculations, if nvidia pays $.01 every quarter and it reinvests the dividend back into the stock it would take…\n\n1,505,625 days\n\nOr \n\n4125 months\n\nOr \n\n343.75 years\n\nTo buy your second share off that dividend alone.\n\nNow according to a quick google search, Jeff Bezos would make 59,100 dollars a every minute, meaning in order for him to make more money off Nvidias dividend than Jeff Bezos makes every minute would take him \n\n2,157,150,000 days\n\nOr\n\n5,910,000 months\n\nOr\n\n492,500 years to make more money off Nvidias dividend than Jeff Bezos makes in one minute\n\nSo if OP is alive and kicking in 492,500 years he’d be sticking it to one of the richest men alive",
