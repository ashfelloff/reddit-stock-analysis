So much so that in the UK spread betting is tax-free becuase it's classed as gambling, like sports betting.\n\nIt's super simple - you just bet in either direction, it's soley based on share price. For every point the share price moves in your favor, you make profit. The bet you make is however much £ you want per point.\n\nIt's like options but without all the greeks and IV...it's literally just betting if the share price will go up or down.",
