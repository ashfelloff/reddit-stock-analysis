I just spoke to my mom via text message and asked her about her position. very very unfortunately she has informed me that she was margin, called and sold at $450 range and effectively and permanently lost $400,000. \n\nI really wish I had been more aggressive in telling my mom what to do with that money because I trade better than her or at least I spend a lot more time studying the technicals and the underworkings of why these things happen.\n\nI even recently asked my mom for a $30,000 loan to eliminate my debt because my interest payments are otherworldly. we dropped that conversation because I'm not privy to taking that much money from my parents or anyone for that matter and I felt guilty even asking. and now seeing her realize a $400,000 loss kind of annoys me to be honest.\n\nMy wife gets mad when I lose a few hundred dollars. so imagine this loss for anyone. my mom is not rich, she works a full-time nursing director job and she spent a year investing a lot of her extra income into Robinhood and it grew and grew via Tesla stock, Nvidia stock and other good names. but as she continued buying near the top, I warned her that this is a bubble. like I said before, I wish I had been much more aggressive and told her exactly what to do because she could have saved all of that loss.",
