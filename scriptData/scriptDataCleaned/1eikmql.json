They have 4x as many employees as NVIDIA. And they just decided to lay off 15,000-19,000 non essential jobs in a move that will save them $10B in 2025. \n\nThis is exactly the type of structural change that analysts have been wanting to see. But they posted shit earnings on the worst day of the year, so the reaction was quite terrible. However, the way the stock tread water while the market fell today is a sign of firm support. It was consolidating, which indicates a potential breakout.  I'd like to see some confirmation. Both from the stock and the market. But I'll keep this on my watchlist.",

X86 handles complex ops in fewer cycles. There's a direct tradeoff between the two, and lack of support for ARM. Mind you, AMD also operates on x86.\n\nRaptor Lake is a microcode setting applying too much voltage. Tweaking down will be the fix. Oxidation rumors are wrong/unwarranted.

Consumer purchasing in electronics will be down for another 2 years. Everyone got their hardware in Covid era, which is when Intel was losing market share due to 14nm struggles and a 2 year miss on Xeon delivery.\n\nThis is what happens when you throw away your competitive advantage by skipping out on R&D like they did pre-2020 and miss the big sales opportunities.

Some production runs very much are affected. And Intel has been somewhat cagey about how many potential units are affected. We also don't know what the state within those batches are. \n\nIs it just a larger percent than normal that fail over time, with the majority being unaffected. Or is the whole batch cooked and they all eventually fail on different time scales?\n\nIntel could have calmed a lot of waters by releasing batch numbers and weeks of production. The fact that they haven't, means they either don't know how wide spread it is or that they don't want to admit it.\n\nWe also don't know how bad the voltage issue will be long term. Problem with electron migration is that the initial damage can make the CPU more susceptible to further degradation. Once it's starts it doesn't matter that you fix the over voltage issue. Because now the safe voltages may not be safe anymore either. Because the physical damage to the CPU makes it more susceptible.\n\nIt's going to take 12-24 months before we start having a more clear picture of  the RPL issues. Now when everyone knows about it, people who are not Intel will start collecting far more data.",

Also once they lay off people and get to stabalise the price will go up unless other shit gets uncovered (could the Intel employee please stand up?). Also if we are lucky Trading Nancy still holds some Intel and will bail them out.\n\n\nI am looking at INTC as well but not YOLOing into it. For this you and the least favorite grandson deserve the crown. I do however recall when META had a huge drop after earnings and I jumped immediately on it just to see it drop even more and more. I eventually bought a bit more until I reached my max alowed position size (I know this is WSB and I should take such sane ideas like diversification somewhere else lol). Anyway eventually I ended up doubling my money, but if I would have waited more and did proper DCA I could have made a tripple or more.\nBest of luck my friend, I hope fortune will favor you and you will be filthy rich and will come and do a pizza party for us or something.",
