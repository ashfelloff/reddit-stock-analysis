  "selftext": ">Qualcomm (QCOM) made a takeover approach to Intel (INTC) in recent days, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Lauren Thomas and Laura Cooper. Such a deal would be ‚Äúmassive and come at a time when the chipmaker is sputtering,‚Äù the report stated. In Friday afternoon trading following initial headlines from the Journal‚Äôs report, shares of Qualcomm are down over 4%, while those of Intel are up about 6%.\n\nSource: Tipranks reporting on [WSJ story](https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/qualcomm-approached-intel-about-a-takeover-in-recent-days-fa114f9d).\n\nI don't have a subscription to WSJ and the usual archive links aren't working so if anyone has the actual full text of the article please feel free to share.\n\nAssuming this report is legit, how would you play this scenario?",

So far all leaks about the 8 Gen 4 look stellar. They look like they'd be stellar not in a phone but in a laptop/minipc enclosure.

Don't think they should go for the x86 license. Stick with ARM and develop RISC-V on the side. Buy out Intel ARC team and technology to speed up their GPU development for something suitable for workstation and data center. Intel GPUs aren't great now but they do have workstation and data-centric designs already deployed with drivers that they've been able to spend years working on.

Even if Intel is receptive, a deal of that size is all but certain to attract antitrust scrutiny, though it is also possible it could be seen as an opportunity to strengthen the country‚Äôs competitive edge in chips. To get the deal done, Qualcomm could intend to sell assets or parts of Intel to other buyers.\n\nIntel‚Äîonce the world‚Äôs most valuable chip company‚Äî[has seen its shares drop](https://www.wsj.com/tech/intel-intc-q2-earnings-report-2024-6ec4ea69)¬†roughly 60% so far this year. The company once had a market value of more than $290 billion at its peak. The stock rose 7% Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported the approach.\n\nShares in Qualcomm, which has a market value of around $185 billion, dropped around 4%.\n\nQualcomm is a leading supplier of chips for smartphones, including ones that manage communications between phones and cell towers. It is one of the most critical suppliers for Apple‚Äôs iPhones, among a range of other devices.",

The vast majority of Qualcomm‚Äôs business comes from selling smartphone processors, 5G wireless chips, and licensing mobile technology. There isn‚Äôt much synergy with Intel‚Äôs core x86 PC and server processor business, which has been losing significant market share to¬†Advanced Micro Devices¬†in recent years.\n\n>Intel‚Äôs PC chips have already been eclipsed by in-house offerings from¬†Apple¬†and others, which draw on designs from¬†Arm Holdings. On the data center side, New Street Research estimates that AMD‚Äôs x86 server processor business will reach 40% market share by year-end, up from less than 5% four years ago. Those gains have come at the expense of Intel, making it that much less attractive to Qualcomm, or any other suitor.\n\n>A merger won‚Äôt fix Intel‚Äôs biggest problem, its foundry, or chip manufacturing business. For Intel Foundry to succeed, the company needs a flagship U.S. customer like Apple, AMD, or¬†Nvidia. While Intel has¬†announced¬†smaller deals, including one with Amazon Web Services last week, they‚Äôre not large enough to matter. Amazon is sticking with¬†Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing¬†to manufacture its more critical AI chips, including Trainium and Inferentia.",
