Given the consistent drum beat that the consumer is slowing - and likely to accelerate this slowdown if layoffs start to show up - which stocks should I have on a short list to buy puts against? \n\nBtw, I have been burned on TSLA and CVNA so far is not looking good - no idea why these are going up but they are and that makes me wrong.",
