The person who is out of work and wants a job just has to have made a single active effort to find work in the past month. The definition of [\"active effort\"](https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm#jobsearch) is itself pretty generous, and can include just asking friends or family or former coworkers or social media contacts if they know of any job leads.\n\nFurther, the government still tracks people who want jobs but have stopped looking for work. For example, here is the [U-4 rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U4RATE) that includes both the \"unemployed\" (want jobs and are looking) and \"discouraged workers\" (want a job but are not looking):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dv23nn6kc8kd1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=244100f7a06f72842897976574007afbfb9176f1",

You might want to go out a little farther on risk spectrum so you can lock in some of those rates.  Look for preferred stock issued by CEFs, it is near guaranteed by virtue of the required asset tests.  Do your own DD but you can lock in 6 to 6.5% for very safe investments.  The value of your investment may fluctuate but the income should stay constant.  You might make a few percent above inflation if the fed cuts rates on your principal in addition to the dividend.",

Our org had a small team in the EU, supporting the EU market, and that team was a pain in the ass to deal with, with all the stereotypical European problems.\n\nSure, there is some talent in software engineer, production engineer or data engineer roles. But Europe is still lacking English-proficient talents in other roles, like relationship managers, product managers, or even product designers. Our product designers had to learn the ins and outs of some EU markets because we couldn't hire one in the EU office. Which meant the engineers had to work with somebody in the US. And that meant only having 1 hour, maybe 2, of potential co-working time per day, because EU folks refused to entertain the idea of working past 6PM.\n\nAs with any big company, there were coasters. The difference was, in the US, coasters could be laid off after 1 month after a performance review cycle. In our EU office, it took 6 months after a performance review cycle to lay off a very underperforming engineer. And it took time and effort out of some managers to document all the shortcomings due to regulations. That time and effort is money, of course.\n\nAnd then just the general negativity of the EU folks. In All-Tech meetings, new ideas were often welcomed by the American crew, and faced complaints from the European crew. Trying anything new seemed to be bad to the Europeans. They'd rather do things how it has always been done.\n\nSo no, outside of supporting the EU region, I wouldn't be hiring a remote team member from Europe thank you very much. I'd rather pay an American 4 times as much to do the same job.\n\nThis isn't true for everyone. We had a Singaporean office for the SEA region. And we had a Canadian office for folks with US Visa issues. And they are often wonderful to deal with. Singaporean team members so often hop on voluntarily at 10PM or 11AM whenever there were major issues. You wouldn't catch an EU member dead after 6PM in a meeting.\n\nCan the US white-collar workers be replaced by foreign counterparts? Sure. But it sure won't come from the Europeans. Europe, as I said, is dying. It's too lazy despite getting left behind by the US and caught up by Asia.",

The lower avg nonfarm payroll (250k down to 175k avg) means if firing was to accelerate, there's less \"buffer\" or \"runway\" for it to go from 175k average to 0 or negative. Furthermore, if we assume the job market has weakened since Apr 2023 (which is the timeline for this revision), then the current job reports might get revised down in the future, and the job market might even be weaker than we think right now.",
