After the book was turned into a wildly successful movie, Andy was seen as being able to spin gold.\n\nHis next book was about a colony on the moon and had its movie rights sold pretty quickly after the book was published.  Rosario Dawson does the audiobook which is really good.\n\nI don‚Äôt think that film project ever got off the ground but the Andy wrote a book called Project Hail Mary.  It was on that same epic scale as The Martian vs the other post Martian book.\n\nBefore the general public could even purchase the book, the movie rights had been sold and Ryan Gossling had already been cast as the lead.\n\nIt‚Äôs currently in production and I imagine is going to be either a very expensive flop or another huge blockbuster.",
