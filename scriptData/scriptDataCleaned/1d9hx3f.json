  "selftext": " Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you’re on old reddit, click “show images” at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like “Thoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\n**News:** [**U.S. Clears Way for Antitrust Inquiries of Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI**](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/05/technology/nvidia-microsoft-openai-antitrust-doj-ftc.html)\n\n**NVAX-** Company said it would be able to deliver a regulator-recommended vaccine against a strain of COVID-19 by September.\n\n**NVDA-** Watching the 1250 level. Might move down today on news of antitrust inquires from the Justice Dept. and FTC.\n\n**LULU-** Company raises full-year earnings guidance, $2.54 vs $2.38 EPS. Also authorized a $1B stock buyback.\n\n**GME-** Interested in the $33 level today. Still short calls, will likely hedge if we get up higher and break that level. Had a super interesting conversation with a trader friend that I’ll write up when I have more time.  \n\n**FIVE-** Discount retailer, cut its sales forecast for the year. $.60 vs $.63 cents expected, net sales missed $812M vs $834.3M.\n\n**Earnings today :** DOCU, IOT,MTN\n\n**IPO today:** LIF (Location tracker for your kids)",
