  "title": "HUGE LOSS. Husband used Motley Fool to change my index funded retirement account to stock picking, help!",
  "score": 1130,
  "selftext": "About 2 years ago my husband changed my e-trade account to individual stocks from an index fund that he used the Motley Fool picks. The entire account is down 40%. Can you please take a look and give some advice? Am I best just holding or do I need to cut my losses and get these into more stable picks or back to an index fund which is my preference? I know you're not supposed to sell at a loss but do these even have any chance or recovering or is my money better put into companies on the way up?\n\nIn the Red:  \nAIRBNB, -17%\n\nAMWL, -98%\n\nFROG, -33%\n\nFSLY, -90%\n\nLMND, -6%\n\nMASI, -53%\n\nNEE, -3%\n\nPGNY, -35%\n\nPINS, -42%\n\nTDOC, -95%\n\nTRUP, -70%\n\nYI, -94%\n\nIn the green,\n\nAMZN, +27%\n\nAXON, +85%\n\nCRWD, +86%\n\nETA: My husband did not force me or get into my account, I trusted him because he handles our finances. This is not to shame him. He has a very high earning career he should focus on that which has provided us money and also some sound real estate we purchased over a decade ago...  but he has no experience in markets or finances so he should not be picking stocks and should just buy into a long term growth strategy like an index fund. I feel like we can do much better than the current situation with our stock portfolios. I want him to do the same to his accounts. Basically cut down on these mistakes and losses and move in an upward direction. Unfortunately these were some costly mistakes but better to learn now than not at all right? I do think my husband is not starting to accept this was a mistake on his part and he needs to change his investing approach.",

Day trading is entirely different, and don't recommend that for this account.  I think listening to the Motley Fool, in an of itself, is not a bad idea.  But it is a person's opinion.\n\nI have been stock trading since the 1990s utilizing the concepts of William O'Neil, and those who follow him (Investors Business Daily).  I think that, with retirement accounts, I am a little more aggressive during strong market times, like now, and I work to lock in profits, but also cut losses.  \n\nWhen a person buys at the correct buy point, losses should never be more than 8%.  That saves further losses, like what you experienced.  Selling into strength or when stocks are positive, but break support, creates profits that slowly increase your profits.  \n\nIf your husband is not open to studying on how to invest (time or otherwise), I would really recommend sticking to index funds that will, over time, do well.\n\n  \nI want to look at AXON to give you an example, since I too bought it.  If you made over 80%, you have been holding it a long time.  I have a small amount of long hold on it, when I bought it as TASR and it is up nearly 775% since that purchase (it was a $2,000 purchase close to a decade ago).  I continue to have this more for sentimental reasons.\n\nHowever, AXON, I bought in November 2023 (larger amounts and different lots) on 11/28/23 at 228.68.  I sold much of it on 3/1/24 at 311.52 as it looked to be running out of steam after a 13% increase two days before, but then dropped on heavy volume.  It went as high as 329.18 on 5/6 (exhaustion gap) and then plummeting beneath all its support (Friday at 298.50).  I sold it to lock in the 36% gain and the stock has yet to recover since my sale on 3/1 (down 5% approx). \n\nCertain types of stock investing, like this, takes time, and I have no doubt your husband can do it.  It has taken me decades to get better, and I still make lots of mistakes. If you are interested in learning about this method, check out [investors.com](http://investors.com) or \"How to Make Money in Stocks\" 4th ed. by William J. O'Neil.
