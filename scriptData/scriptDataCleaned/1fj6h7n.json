Pretty much every carbon neutral initiative is nonsense that doesn't work or costs so much more that it can only be used on new construction. \n\nI believe they may still be using a \"cap and trade\" (its really set and credit system) system in which emissions are reduced by attaching a price to a set amount of released CO2. \n\nSo, the EU emissions trading system sells them at auction, likely quarterly. They likely have secondary sellers that will do that also.\n\nProblem is. This only affects nations that have signed on to the climate change accords. It basically moots all the effort when belt and road power plants ruin any progress.",

There are a lot of elements to this. \n\nA lot of people are deniers because they don't like the possibility of climate change laws. And that's a legitimate criticism. I don't like them either. People in rich countries will see the negatives as a minor inconvenience anyway. It's an oh lettuce is expensive this year thing to us. \n\nThe basic principle of the greenhouse gas effect is about 120 years old. But the atmosphere is a large active system. Everything is just a very good guess. \n\nI would focus on the basic principle and an increasing temperature and emissions total over the long term. You don't need to convince them to go buy into the green new deal. I wouldn't even try to convince them that this is an emergency. It's just a thing that is happening. But we will get through it.
