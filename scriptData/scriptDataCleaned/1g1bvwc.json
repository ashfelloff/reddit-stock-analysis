Are you serious?! He then showed a vehicle which was somehow even worse that the cybertruck - the robovhan. Buttressed by absolutely rehearsed or remote controlled robots. Another promise that it'll be $30k and start production \"next year\"\n\nThe remaining Tesla Stans are the dumbest people alive. He couldn't even announce that they're TESTING it anywhere because they aren't and they can't lol",

          "body": "Tesla is still overpriced.\nThat has been the case for a long time now. Tesla isn’t traded based on fundamentals but more as a bet on the future. However, when it comes to autonomous driving, for example, they are far behind the competition (see Google subsidiary Waymo, which already conducts 100,000 rides per week and thus has a competitive advantage, while actively collecting data). You only need to look at the visual difference between a Waymo autonomous car and Tesla’s Robotaxi. Autonomous cars must function under extreme conditions, such as complex traffic scenarios and bad weather — this requires expensive technology and data processing. It’s hard to believe that this could be available for $30,000. Anyone stepping into an autonomous vehicle must trust that it will get them safely to their destination and the Robotaxi doesn’t look trustworthy at all.\n\nAt the Robotaxi event, expectations were very high, but it was marked by theatrics and did not convince many people, leaving a lot of questions. For example, the remote control of the door opener and the Robotaxi driving off as Elon Musk got in, or robots that were likely being voiced by people behind the scenes through microphones and perhaps even controlled by them. It was unclear what was real and what was part of the show — and the Hollywood location didn’t exactly help either.\n\nThe big question is when Tesla will deliver on autonomous driving, and trust in their ability to make this happen in the next few years seems to be diminishing. This is also because Elon Musk has often failed to keep his promises or delayed timelines.\n\nIn addition, Tesla’s sales are below expectations, and there are many used Teslas on the market. Increasing competition from China, which is state-subsidized (for example, there are subsidies in China specifically for electric vehicles from Chinese manufacturers). BMW, for instance, has caught up and is now selling more electric cars in Europe than Tesla in some cases.\n\nThe build quality of the Cybertruck also leaves much to be desired in several areas (suspension, grounding when charging, sealing of the ‘frunk,’ etc.).\n\nThen there’s also the fact that Elon Musk is heavily supporting Trump’s election campaign, and his image is sometimes counterproductive for Tesla. This has also affected the decline in Tesla sales, for instance, in California. He’s also getting involved in political matters instead of focusing on Tesla, which many people criticize.\n\nFrom my perspective, there are currently more problems than opportunities at Tesla.",
