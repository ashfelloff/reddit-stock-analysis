I only hold MAG7/market indices long-term. If you use Old Reddit, click “Show Images” at the top to expand the charts. Any positions stated aren’t recommendations, I’m following subreddit rules to disclose positions.   \n\nSome stocks I post may be <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific questions. Questions like “Thoughts on _____?” or “Is ___ a good investment?” will be ignored or I’ll troll you unless you add detail and your own opinion. I will block you if you are a troll. \n\nNews: [Cyber Firm Wiz rejects Alphabet’s 23B offer, seeks IPO Instead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-23/cyber-firm-wiz-rejects-alphabet-s-23-billion-offer-seeks-ipo)\n\n- [**CRWD**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=CRWD&p=d) - Third day of trading since the outage, I’ll be looking for signs if CRWD has turned, but obviously I can’t tell the future. (Watching S, SentinelOne as well). Currently long. \n- [**SPOT**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SPOT&p=d) - Reported Q2 earnings, revenue growth of 20% YoY. EPS of $1.43 vs $1.15e. Monthly Active Users (MAU) grew 14% to 626M.   \n- [**UPS**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=UPS&p=d) - Falls after earnings miss and forecast. Profits fall 30% YoY. Revenue of $21.8B vs $22.18B exp. UPS returned to growth in terms of shipping volume for first time in nine quarters (normalization from pandemic highs).  \n- [**TSLA**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - Watching due to earnings today after the close- leaning bearish, I usually only trade after earnings have been released but I will likely take a VERY small position short beforehand.  \n- [**GOOG**](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=GOOG&p=d) - News linked, will be interesting to see how it trades today due to the cancelled acquisition and how earnings will go due to it. Other than that will stay mostly hands-off. \n \nEarnings: TSLA, GOOG, V, ENPH",
