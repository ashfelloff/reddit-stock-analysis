So when neutron is developed, built and launched regularly they’ll be cash flow positive. You’re a total idiot if you bought rocket lab without knowing what their primary revenue stream is, which is Space Systems (I.e general space infrastructure, satellites and satellite components etc). Their revenue growth has been massive. Launch isn’t their cash cow, similar to how launch isn’t SpaceX’s primary revenue stream. Neutron is designed to be a constellation launcher, and as far as I’m aware, rocket lab aims to launch and operate their own constellation of some kind (they haven’t given any details of what the constellation will do, because they need to get past neutron before they can start thinking about hyping the stock market over constellation stuff). Besides, when Neutron is operational, they will offer something SpaceX doesn’t - End to End space services. They’ll be a fully vertically integrated space company which means they’d be the one stop shop for getting whatever you want into space, meaning they’d design, build, launch and manage your satellite or whatever it is you want in space, offering a sort of space “packaged deal”. Even SpaceX is not vertically integrated in this way. This is all much more important in the context of the commercial space industry is expected to grow fucking massively, projected to be worth 1.8 trillion dollars by 2035, up from the 630 billion it’s worth today. Markets are forward looking, and this company’s expected growth over the next few years is nuts. Like most space company plays, it’s a long term hold play, betting on short term price swings is regarded because these stocks are very volatile and unpredictable in the short term.\n\nTLDR: you’re wrong, massively.",

If their revenue rises, then I'm adjusting my buy in price. You saw me say it'll go back down to $4 and got this offended? Edit: I know it's WSB and apes are leading apes here, but that's a lot of writing to convince me to make the same mistakes I was doing in 2021.",

Timing the market short term on a highly volatile stock is just impossible. It will dip, yes, I just disagree that it will see $4 again unless something majorly wrong goes on, considering it was hovering around that level back when no one knew about the company and neutron development was even further away.",
