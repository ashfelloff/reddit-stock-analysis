  "title": "Today has been a crash for NVDA, but there's no need to panic.",
  "score": 35,
  "selftext": "Market cap erased by 10% in a single day. I decided to escape from the top after NVDA plunged below 823, a key support level. Therefore, I cleared all my holdings of NVDA and NVDL at a price of around 810-820. Aside from that, I profited 30% from intraday shorting, by buying and selling 790 put, which compensated for about 60% of my loss incurred during the escpae.\n\n680-740 is an ultrastrong support level for NVDA. The 1-yr forward PE of NVDA has fallen to 31, a comfortable level. If the price can further plunge by 5%-10%, the forward PE value will be a typical level for mega-caps in the tech sector, which is small for NVDA (we need to consider its growth potential).\n\nThe earnings call may be a tipping point for NVDA, but it is still 1 month away. I expect that NVDA to be consolidating between 680 and 740 before that, the gap never filled after its blockbusting 2023 annual earnings.\n\nHere is my plan:\n\n1. 40% for left entry. Have bought 10% of 9/20 1000 call when the price fell to 760. Expect to buy another 10% when the price falls to 720-740, and another 20% when the price falls to 680-700.\n2. 40% for right entry. If the price starts to go up before the earnings, buy 20% at the tipping point, and another 20% when the 9-day EMA crosses the 26-day EMA from the below, a key indicator of buying.\n3. If the price of NVDA drops below 680, clear all long positions and use 50% for short-selling, namely, put option @ 700. This will continue at all rebounds until NVDA falls to 500, the price last December.\n\nUpdate: Change of Plan.\n\nAfter rethinking what happened to NFLX, I have decided to clear all long positions and wait until the market stabilizes itself, or a new trend emerges. There exists a strong probability that 'selling at the news' will occur. Even if META, MSFT, GOOGL all report blockbusting earnings, beating expectations in both guidelines and quarterly results, the stock prices may still dip, let alone something goes wrong with their earnings, like what happened to GOOGL earlier this year. AMZN dipped 3%, while META plunged 4%, all because of NVDA today. Similar things will happen if one of the mega caps delivers worse-than-expectation earnings.\n\nThe new plan:\n\n1. Close all long positions on Monday to avoid risks. If there is a rebound on Monday and Tuesday, buy a very small short position (\\~2%) by putting NVDA.\n2. If something happens during the earnings, put NVDA and buy SQQQ. If the earnings are all good, wait until all indices stabilize before buying long positions again.",

Today i closed my short at $769.... for som reason i always \"knew\" the old adage will hold - it came up too close to the sun too quick and had to go down sooner or later.... Hype is hype until there's money attached and to show for it.  I know markets are forward looking but it appears w NVDA them regarded markets were looking like into next century .... got to take it easy you kno....",
