Look at Ebola, Lasa or Marburg.  Super deadly.  But they can't get going into a world wild pandemic because if you see a guy bleeding out of his eyes and ears you know not to get near him.  Then he drops dead and you burn the body.  Something sneaky that kills a lower percentage can spread far and wide much easier and kill more people in the long run.",
