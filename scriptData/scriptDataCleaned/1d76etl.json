  "selftext": "\nShocked to see this myself as one who enjoys this Italian beer, but even more shocked by how low the stock is trading at today ~$53. Seemingly it is way undervalued right now especially given the quarterly gains it has been making over the past few years. Peroni being one of the largest beer brands in Europe really has my hope up for the future of the stock.",
