  "selftext": "After reporting 3% sales growth in Q4 last year, Tesla posted a troubling 9% decline in the first three months of 2024. From a consumer's perspective, higher borrowing costs make buying new cars much less affordable. Plus, Tesla has to deal with stiff competition these days, with well-funded Chinese EV makers making things difficult.\n\nTesla’s valuation. Even though shares are currently 56% off their all-time high, they still trade at a steep price-to-earnings ratio of 46.2.\n\nI Bought Calls",

          "body": "Actually I would argue the Elmo or not, TSLA growth outlook is pretty bad. They have not innovated in almost a decade. They are selling the same cars they were selling in 2018. Every other manufacturing company in the world has caught up and/or surpassed them in terms of core features, including and especially the Chinese ones. On top of that they rely excessively on the Chinese car market for growth, and neglect other revenue streams such as charging stations and the battery market. And they are doing so while Chairman Xi has repeatedly stated in the Chinese Communist Party Congress that China will invade Taiwan in 2027.\n\nThey need new car models. They need to make cars that people in the West want to buy, not iPhone with wheels for the Chinese market. Cars that go faster, further and for an extended period of time. They need new software that makes managing the car easier. They need chargers that charge faster and more efficiently. They need to make the cars cheaper.  And they need all that Yesterday. Not some bullshit AI that no one needs.",

          "body": "Here are the reasons apart from Elon that people have moved away from Tesla:\n\n- Tesla was too slow to release new models compared to its competition this is hurting them especially in China.\n\n- Tesla constant price cuts had lowered customer loyalty it doesn’t help paying 60k for Model Y only to see it selling for 40k in few years with discounted financing.\n\n\n- EVs just don’t make sense for good amount of folks out there and this is affecting sales of other EVs as well.\n\n- Tesla design for its models doesnt stand the test of time. My model y looks dated even though it is only three years old, when it came out it looked futuristic but after you see it everywhere it losses that appeal. Where as my Audi Q5 even though 7 years old still looks timeless. \n\n- Tesla are very expensive to repair after crashes causing their insurance cost to go up. Tesla also didn’t set up good supply network as they didn’t care.\n\n- Tesla Safety is questionable autopilot, fsd are known to be cause of numerous crashes and also unfamiliarity with EVs dynamics and touch controls also appear to have played a role. Also it doesn’t help you give super car power  to your average Joe. The data we have right now show Tesla are some of most dangerous vehicles out there in terms of crashes and fatalities.\n\n- Tesla quality is poor and Tesla are turning out to some of most expensive cars to maintain post warranty. In UK ranking both model S and X are in top 10 worst cars post warranty per released data (model 3 and Y aren’t eligible for that list yet). It’s huge achievement for Tesla to make EV vehicle less reliable than Land Rover. Anyway seeing the huge post warrant costs no one wants used Tesla’s..",

Performance capabilities (range, charging infrastructure) are still a factor preventing widespread adoption and until that is better solved it solved it will continue to have impact.\n2. The lower priced vehicle is a smart way to push towards mass adoption, but I’m concerned about the cost. In a vertically integrated company you can get better unit economics but the initial CapEx is insane. I don’t know that Tesla can be profitable with a cheap vehicle option.\n\nI think the second point is also why we haven’t seen Tesla introduce new models in so long which is one of the common complaints against them.

Definitely not the far right. Image matters.\n\n\n2) Looks are slightly dated. In general nothing has changed for 7 years. And no, the Highland \"refresh\" is not an improvement, if anything the original M3 looked better....but that's just my opinion.\n\n\n3) Decline is customer service! Here in Canada Tesla has closed service Depots and told Tesla owners to pound sand and drive 3 to 4 hours to get their car fixed. Do you think anyone one of them is going to buy another Tesla?\n\n\n\n4) Everything on the car is Beta. The fucking wipers don't wipe, headlights don't light, and turn signals don't signal. Everything from the app down to the fucking turn signal is in Bata testing. When you get in you feel like a fucking guinea pig.\n\n\n5) High insurance! The cost of repairing a Tesla is ridiculous and as a result your insurance bill will be equally ridiculous! You might not be paying for gas, but will be paying for insurance.\n\n\n6) in Canada some places are now asking Electric vehicles owners to pay EV Tax. They're doin this because EV owners are using public roads and they'not paying tax to maintain them. In Canada a portion of the gas tax gets put towards road maintenance. This is just an example of how \"advantages\" of owning an EV are slowly disappearing.\n\n\n7) High interest rates.\n\n\n8) Not enough super chargers! You have cities with a population of 500K+ and only 6 super charges! \n\n\nAnd there is probably more, but that's all I can think of while sitting on the can.",

Teslas recent market share in Europe of newly sold cars is down to 6% in the EV-market in Germany and England and around 15-20% in Norway and France.\nIn China the decline is massive, even with a sharply rising EV market.\nTesla is now only one player in a big market, they have their customers, but their market share in the EV market won't really rise anymore.\nThis results in a potential growth in China of about 100-150% and in Europe and USA of 300-400% with declining margins as you need smaller and cheaper cars for more growth. That is nothing what would lead to a much higher stock price.\nNew markets in India and Africa are more likely to go to cheaper Chinese-made cars either.",

There’s no universe where Germany allows China to flood the European market. \n\nThen there is AI which is clearly where Musk is putting his focus. They can sell their AI and OS to other car manufacturers like they’ve indicated, and, Tesla has a huge use case for robotics.
