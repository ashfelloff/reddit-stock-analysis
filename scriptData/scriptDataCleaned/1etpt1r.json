That is absolutely conceivable in this current environment. You take out 8% yearly and your investments grow another 8% and 2% for inflation.\n\nWhen will the party end? We are approaching 1 trillion in interest payments on the debt per year.\n\nIf we have another good GDP report, with no unemployment scare. It’s approaching 20% YoY for 5 straight years. That is completely due to inflation",

There's a lot of reasons to believe that it won't long term:\n\n- The national debt is growing unsustainably fast, and the deficit spending has been propping up markets.\n\n- Much of the gains of the past decade can be attributed to corporate tax cuts. If corporate taxes are increased to the old 37% level or higher, it will have a significant impact on the market. This seems very likely given the size of the deficit and the strong opposition to cutting social security/medicare/defense.\n\n- Population growth is slowing, and there is an increasingly strong opposition to immigration, could create a situation like Japan's where the economy/market stagnates due to declining population.\n\n- The rest of the outperformance of the US can be explained by increased valuations(higher P/E) and FX rates.",

Do not let the short term fluctuations affect the long term goals, because in reality how the market returns on average 10% in the last 100 years its not because it returns exactly 10% each year, nowhere close.\n\nTo understand if we are in a market that is overvalued, you have to understand valuation. I see many posts recently about how the market has gone up in the last year but people forget 2022 was a terrible year, so 2022+2023 is basically almost net zero. So whatever we have YTD is like the growth of 3 years, and when you think of that way, it is terrible.\n\nI quickly ran the CAGR rate from 2013 to 2024\n\n| Year | CAGR Year to 2024 | CAGR Year to 2024 (Net Inflation) |\n\n|------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n\n| 2013 | 10.50%         | 7.56%                         |\n\n| 2014 | 10.41%         | 7.26%                         |\n\n| 2015 | 11.72%         | 8.27%                         |\n\n| 2016 | 12.00%         | 8.38%                         |\n\n| 2017 | 10.98%         | 7.15%                         |\n\n| 2018 | 14.14%         | 9.94%                         |\n\n| 2019 | 11.40%         | 6.89%                         |\n\n| 2020 | 10.22%         | 4.98%                         |\n\n| 2021 | 5.16%          | 0.43%                         |\n\n| 2022 | 20.15%         | 16.96%                        |\n\nAs you can see if you did 3 years, it would show your average rate of return as 5.16% But if you did 5, it would be 11.40%, but these are such small samples.\n\nI have added the CAGR above as well, the 2nd number is the CAGR after inflation. As you can see if you look at it after inflation that 5 year return that looked great at 11.4% all of a sudden becomes 6.89%, which are below historical averages of the last 30 years which is around 7.78%\n\nInvesting is a long term thing, if you easily affected by the short term fluctuations, you will not be successful in this.",

In the grand scheme of things it mattered less if you invested at a local all time high that preceded a big drop than if the market ran up and up while you were DCA’ing. \n\nYou basically are saying you have confidence that the market is more likely to pull back during your DCA timeframe than keep running up when recessions are much more rare. You’re leaving money on the table unless you get lucky. \n\nAs an example, we had a pretty big pullback in 2022 right? 25% correction. Well, if you had “waited” for that or had been DCA’ing, the market didn’t even fall below pre-pandemic levels.
