I'd say in next few weeks there's a big rug pull event that's bought up by MAGA and idiots on this sub who are probably Maga leaning. \n\nYou should all buy LONG puts regardless i.e. as far out as you can afford but if it's only 2 weeks out, stop trading stocks/options",

              "body": "If you buy DJT right now, I assume you can sell it at any time right?  No one buying right now is within the lockup period right?\n\nI have a lot of friends who bought in a few years ago during the formation of the Spac and they couldn’t and still can’t sell until 6 months after the merger.  The same rule applies to Trump (at the moment).  \n\nIt’s definitely a gamble but if the 6 month rule holds up for everyone, wouldn’t the stock continue to moon until Sept given so many people are saying it’s a way for foreign powers to invest in Trump kind of legally?  If Trump can secure this new lower bond needed for appealing his NY court case, wouldn’t that buy a lot of time for him to need the money?\n\nI can’t underestimate the ability for Trump to generate money but his truth social platform has been in the works for years and years now. It seems like he wouldn’t crash it immediately until he either won or lost the election right?\n\nIt sucks knowing I could have gotten in at $4 but it all seemed too risky at the time since so many spacs fail to merge to begin with.  Curious what’s going to happen now until August and then in Sept when everyone is free to sell.",

There is a good $1-2 billion invested in before the merger and I doubt all those people who are in a lockup period would vote to allow him to sell.  Maybe I’m missing something.  Does Trump have enough majority stake to make that vote himself?",
