  "selftext": "Today may be a consequential date for 2 reasons:\n\nCPI data print: May CPI data will be released at 8:30 ET. Bloomberg survey indicates an expectation of 0.1% [very optimistic in my opinion].\nPrevious, CPI readings were as per below:\n\nJan: 0.3%\nFeb: 0.4%\nMar: 0.4%\nApr: 0.3%\n\nBloomberg survey also indicated Y-o-Y expectation of 3.4% [so no way near Fed's target of 2% inflation].\n\nFed speak: Fed will finish its 2 days meeting and spell out its plan for the current month. It is unlikely to present any surprises. \n\nHow will the market react?\n\nLast week, the markets were optimistic following rate cut by ECB and Canada. However, strong non farm pay roll report [272 K vs expectation of 185 K] did put a dampner at least for 7th June closing. \n\nApple's share price breakout on 11th June still suggests investors strong appetite for risky asset class.\n\nEven if there is a sell off on 12th June, it is likely to recover quickly on back of strong earnings of any of the major companies like Broadcom, Adobe, Autodesk etc.\n\nBut, if sell off is coupled with weak earnings this week then near term correction may be deeper.\n\nConclusion: Markets are at or near all time high. Despite sticky inflation and US Fed reluctance to cut rates: appetite among investors for risky assets class stays strong. \n\nBut a short term correction in near term cannot be ruled out. ",
