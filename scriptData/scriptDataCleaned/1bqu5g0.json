I had an unlevered buy order for $20k on the spot at $2.15 per contract. I had stop loss set around $.10 oil went negative that day and interactive brokers (the platform we used) had set up their execution under the assumption everyone had been taught in business school- oil is the only commodity that can’t have a negative value. So rather than executing near zero or even when it was slightly negative, IB stopped filling orders as the price went down. Settled the spot price contracts end of day at -$37.67. I tried to take physical delivery (you can’t with WTI and IB as a platform won’t let you, but apparently you can with Brent). Liquidated my account the next morning and I woke up showing a -$265,000 position. 3 weeks later the CEO apologized on CNBC and promised to make all our accounts whole to assume oil positions went to $0. \n\nThe kid had levered up his position, bought in at like $11, and the swing put him at like -$8 million. He was 19 and didn’t understand IB fucked up. Took his life. Parents sued for wrongful death and settled out of court.",

It allows the trader to reduce the upfront cost compared to just buying a naked call option.\n\nIt provides limited profit potential in exchange for reduced capital requirement compared to buying a naked call option outright.",

That reduces the price you pay to start because you pay for the $900 calls but make some money back from the premium on the $902.50 calls you sell. The consequence to reducing the initial cost is that your profit is capped (if the share price reaches $902.50 or higher). This is because if the share price goes above $902.50, both the calls you bought and the ones you sold start going up in value and cancel each other out.\n\nYour $900 calls that you bought were exercised, meaning you received 100 * 10 = 1000 NVDA shares (as the customer support told you) for a cost of ~$900k (around $900 per share, which makes sense).\n\nThe other half of the calls (the $902.50 ones you sold) were bought by someone else (the long holder). They were hoping NVDA would soar above $902.50/share, but it didn't, so the contracts they bought from you expired worthless... that means whatever premium they paid you for those $902.50 calls is yours to keep.\n\nSo now your Robinhood account shows that you owe almost $900k (which they call a deficit). But you now own 1000 shares of NVDA, which is currently at $903.56 per share, meaning you are actually up approximately $903.56 * 1000 - $897.8k = $5700 after you sell the NVDA shares.",

You just need to sell the stock Monday morning and it’s all good. You might make a few (hundred) bucks or you might lose a few (hundred) bucks if the stock moves between now and then.\n\nOn the other hand if that’s what happened and it was a *put* spread, you now have a ton of cash and a naked short position in the stock. You just need to *buy* the stock (using the cash) Monday morning and it’s all good. Ditto making or losing a bit.\n\nIt’s also possible that your short leg was assigned but your long leg was not exercised. This is a much riskier outcome but it *usually* happens when both legs are very near the money, so you *usually* won’t lose too much. Same thing, you’ll have a position to close on Monday.\n\nIf you just ignore it, RH will clean it up for you around 9:45 AM.
