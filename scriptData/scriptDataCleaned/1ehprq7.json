Cuz the market doesn’t like the future revenue and earnings forecasts of the business given all the publicly available information. And what is cheap to one person is expensive to another, relative to its 5 yr history? Relative to peers? Relative to the SPY? Relative to other country indexes?\n\nTo me, its expensive to own something that is cheap and getting cheaper. Its cheap for me to own expensive thing that gets more expensive because its in demand and people value hit more. Again, cheap and expensive are so subjective and it honestly doesn’t matter and its dangerous to think this way in my opinion. The US stock market is soooooo overvalued…relative to brazil, and brazil is EXTREMELY CHEAP but why is it cheaper relative to the US? Wouldn’t you want to own brazil? Why doesn’t anyone hold for the long term for brazil. Its such a bargain right? Id still rather own US because everyone knows there are so many things that the US does better than Brazil in terms of govenment, politics, laws,  immigration policy, individual rights, retirement plans, currency volatility, civil unrests, theft, safety, technological implementation, medical advancements, education quality, infrastructure of electricity delivery and gas, etc. thats why the US is “expensive” relative to Brazil. And this isn’t a discussion about why one country is better than another, every country has its pros and cons, the point is that what is expensive to one person is not for another. \n\nTo me those names are all ex-growth/slow grower names. Have you seem the ticket prices of disney? Where are the children if the birth rates have declined in the past two decades, where is the next revenue and earnings growth coming from if there are less children to serve? Nike is no longer just going to do it. On clouds and other major shoe brands are way higher quality, they don’t have modern day lebron’s signing up with nike anymore so who is promoting to just do it? Home depot is getting beaten out by other hardware stores like harbor freights whom have the same tools but for a fraction of the cost. For my investment objectives, these are not juicy enough for me to want to own. I want to participate in high growth names the management operating plan is excellent and product market fit is proved and they’re about to have plans to expand the top/ebitda/bottom line. \n\nThe question is what are you looking for in your investment and investment time horizon and will the stock you own perform in a way that is aligned with your portfolio investment objectives relative to current macro, industry tailwinds, and current “valuation”.",

Next year Panther Lake will be the 2nd iteration with many improvements. TSMC/AMD won't be putting out chips with backside power delivery until 2026. Intel is finally catching up its process node technology since the massive gap with TSMC was created due to Intels failure to acquire EUV lithography tooling early on. In order to catch up Intel had to buy EUV tools, redesign their processes, and double down on many efforts to close the gap with their rivals. A big part of that plan was what they called 5 Nodes in 4 Years which was effectively doubling the rate at which they developed new processes. 13th and 14th gen processors meant to compete with TSMC/AMD's offerings at the time of release had similar performance yet were made on an older process node. Now that Intels process node is nearly caught up we are going to start seeing chips that outperform the competition, EOY and next year for sure. I'm going to buy the dip now and hold for at least 5 years...by then Intel will be the clear winner.",
