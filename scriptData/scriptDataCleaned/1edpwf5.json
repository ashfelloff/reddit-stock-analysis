I was legitimately surprised by your question and thought you were yanking my chain - something that happens quite a bit on Reddit. I apologize, that was a dick move on my part. \n\nI have a 20 bagger in Tesla right now. For a while it was a 30 bagger. I’m in my 30’s and back in 2019 I put two years of my company bonus into the shares at that time, after around 9 months of owning a Model 3. At the time that investment was ~$40,000. Today, when combined with my company 401k and pension, it’s an order of magnitude more than enough money for me to retire. But I actually like my job and plan to hold the shares for a long time. \n\nMaybe you were around this sub back then, but if you weren’t, Tesla probably would have ranked low in the 9th decile of investment decisions. Anything positive about the company was downvoted into oblivion. There was an incredible amount of just pure shit-slinging. Having the experience of actually owning the product helped me cut through the noise. \n\nAnyway, back to the point. I’m keep this brief, and I would love your thoughts. I see seven major growth opportunities on the short/medium term radar, in no particular order: \n\nOptimus - Production experience/AI. Humanoid robotics play.  The product has the potential to be attractive in the labor market (a very large market) by replacing dangerous/boring tasks leading to unprecedented efficiency and cost savings. Big market. \n\nRide share services - Tesla has a low-cost, massively-scalable, generalized solution for autonomous vehicles. In the past they’ve said they need more compute and more video data. Now they have both. And they’ve rewritten their software stack to feed vision as a direct input to a control based neural network. Ultimately will lower costs and increase safety of getting around. Big market. \n\nEnergy - Huge market & profitability. The stationary energy storage market is projected to experience significant growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as increased renewable energy investments, global expansion in the electric vehicle sector, and regulatory changes requiring energy efficiency. It’s a marketing expected to conservatory grow at 25% CAGR for the foreseeable future. Tesla has a competitive hardware product and bundles it with best in class software. Just look at the growth in their energy business. It’s on track to be larger than the automotive business. Big market. \n\nCompact - High production capacity. Lowering costs using their unboxed production method they are going to dramatically expand their TAM. They will be punching down market and I think they will do well. \n\nDry cathode - Reduction in costs. Significant advantages over a wet cathode battery in terms of production costs and factory space savings.  Eliminates the need for solvents, reducing the energy consumption and costs associated with solvent recovery. Also eliminates a significant portion of factory space. \n\nCybertruck - Capable offering in the electric pickup truck market. They’ve said they are tracking for profitability by the end of this year. Hitting growth phase. Big Market.\n\nSemi - Capable offering in the commercial trucking market. Expected to ramp production in 2025. Big market.\n\nYes I do see a few growth opportunities ahead. I’m still very bullish.",

      "body": "He's not wrong though. Before you downvote, hear me out. Elon says that if FSD doesn't work, the stock is worthless. The street is valuing the stock on that plus revenue and earnings from auto sales (the biggest chunk), which are flat to down, and likely to have a tough couple of quarters. \n\nSo in the near term, the stock is likely to drop further if auto revenues are not good, which is likely. \n\nIn the long term, we haven't seen a rollout of Tesla robotaxi yet. Will it work? Will it run into regulatory and legal issues when there are inevitable mistakes? Will they try to roll it out too fast with too little human intervention, or roll it out slowly - risk versus near term revenue - risk of first-mover self inflicted black eyes.\n\nThere is a lot of risk with FSD and robotaxis, and the software is not ready yet for fully autonomous. There has been another delay of the rollout to October. Will it be ready by then? Will it still be making mistakes? Can they get the software stable and keep it that way?\n\nElon has a history of delivering, but not on anyone's schedule.\n\nSo the street is factoring in current known problems with demand and revenue with the risk of FSD being very late, underwhelming, and other problems that can occur on the way to doing something no one has ever done before.\n\nThe TL;DR is that there is a good chance that TSLA stock will drop further, and perhaps a lot further if the auto sales crater for a few quarters. Might be a good time to pick up some shares cheaply, until Tesla can show that they have a high-profit, ready to roll robotaxi service. \n\nIf you pay attention and understand what is likely to happen, you can reduce your risk ahead of the street. I don't think they understand this stuff or how big it CAN be. I say CAN because it doesn't mean WILL be. There are still risks, and FSD has been going on for a long, long time without being quite good enough. \n\nThe analyst is right though. Right now, Tesla is not performing like a 10x sales tech growth company, and they just delayed the rollout of the technology that makes them an AI play. Not a lot to like until that turns around.",
