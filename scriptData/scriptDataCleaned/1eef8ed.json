It’s not they are canceling the whole AI idea, but delaying it to general public while devs can stress test it so Apple can fix any glaring problem before releasing it to the wild.  \n\nIt’s bullish b/c less initial bugs = better perceived performance = better perception so more sales.\n\nIs it better than Gemini, Galaxy AI or ChatGPT?\n\nWho knows and neither does your mom or wife’s boyfriend.  As long as it functions as advertised the masses will say Apple made the coolest AI ever.  I can bet you all the high school kids and college kids are clamoring for a new iPad just for the calculator function.  \n\nThat’s some next level easy homework solution",

That includes some of the most significant changes to Siri, such as the ability to use on-device data to help field queries and for the system to use what is on a person’s screen to provide context for answers. \n\n>**The company is planning to roll out its full set of Apple Intelligence features via multiple updates to iOS 18 across the end of 2024 and through the first half of 2025, Bloomberg News has reported.** Beyond the iPhone and iPad, Apple Intelligence will come to its Mac computers with in-house Apple chips as part of macOS Sequoia. It’s also in development for the Vision Pro, but a release for that device isn’t planned until later.",
