There's no game, only superstition and luck. Shorts will always make money in this case because they're working with stocks they bought well below the strike price. It'll happen again in the future too - timing it well enough is the problem. You have to gauge how many times you can get it wrong versus the possible payoff for when you get it right. Could you tank six $7k YOLOs a year in the off chance that you'd manage to net a $200k return?
