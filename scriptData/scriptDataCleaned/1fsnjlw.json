Current PLTR Valuation is laughably high on paper, no doubt. \n\nThe shift from primarily govt business to the new AIP product for commercial clients is real though. This 📈growth in commercial enterprise space is real and the stories of immediate efficiency increases and $ savings by those enterprise clients: real. \nWatch some AIPcons for context. \n\nThat commercial TAM is huge and to my knowledge there are just no other direct competition for enterprise business to shop around. ERP software TAM itself is something like $70b annual and this AI driven product suite can effectively replace legacy ERP software in essentially all major industries- with a tangible argument to do so. \nThey've built use cases proving this from healthcare to oil to food biz to AARP. Etc. \n\nPalantir utilizes a very uncommon \"try before you buy\" sales model where new clients are increasingly \"inbound\", IE a CIO/CTO can simply say \"let's see what this AI can do if they aren't charging us to take on abstract tech?\" \n\nAgain, I understand databricks exists- but it cannot yet be directly compared to AIP/foundry functionality-> proven net savings by commercial customer. Microsoft does not seem to be attempting an alternative with their other higher priority verticals... just as they weren't in the ERP or CRM space prior to AI. \n\nAI is of course the buzz term and chips (..NVIDIA) has blown up to prove there is a tangible supercycle occurring on the backend (data center). However abstract that might sound, that data center growth is not a bubble at least for the foreseeable future. The revenue has followed the frothy valuations. \nComputing as we know it is shifting entirely even if the average consumer doesn't see it yet. \n\nObviously the megacaps are racing to not be left behind as we all see with their massive AI capex. \nSo now all other commercial c-suites are frantically wondering \"how do WE not get left behind\" \"how are our competitors potentially gaining advantage over us right now by using AI\".\n\n...\"We need an AI business solution ASAP\"\n\nPalantir is the one product without direct competition, with proven and immediate savings and efficiency metrics (watch their AIPcons on Youtube to see the vast application directly from those businesses c-suite). PLTR does not have an obnoxiously aggressive sales team like Snowflake jamming the product with promises of AI advancements later on - this product suite is already built, refined and deploying. \nAll while the tech is simultaneously advancing. \n\nThey have a first mover advantage. \n\nThey have an advantage w the steadily growing govt business- w the US but also our allies. Geopolitical risks and defense budgets don't seem to be cooling anytime soon. \n\nThis might turn off some investors for ethical reasons but having an innovative AI SaaS massively growing with commercial clients... that also acts as a defense company (hedge for future market volatility) is in many ways a potentially dreamy investment as it matures. \n\nRe Thiel: All mega-rich early investors will sell big chunks of equity after massive $ rises... especially in this debt-laden, unpredictable macroeconomic and geopolitical climate. It just makes sense to liquidate some small gains when you still are 99%+ invested in the growing company. Black swans happen, and we are still potentially looking at a recession which could deflates all risk assets. \nHard for us plebs to imagine but when you are this wealthy it really doesn't matter if you 10x that additional .5% of your equity that has already 10x. \n\nThey can probably live w 10x the 99.5% remaining, while they're on the yacht they purchased w the realized gains. \n\nPersonal shit like yachts, real estate or diversifying into other assets is just what rich folk do.\nIn Thiels case: I am certain that sale goes into other early investment ventures. Alll while he simultaneously benefits from growth in this \"more mature\" (relative) company. \nI'll also add that taxes can't realistically go down any further regardless of next POTUS- Thiel knows this. They are likely to, probably have to, increase if anything. \nAll these risks give good reason to lock in some gains now. If they sold entire stake or anything beyond a small %... that's maybe cause of concern that we've hit a definite top. It's just not that. These are scheduled sales and I laugh when ppl think nvidia is crashing because Huang sells a smidge after such a run-up. \n\nIt is easy to see this valuation deflating but if there is a commercial sales super cycle about to take place- the prior growth and revenue numbers are likely to be ultra-conservative (no Thiel pun intended). \nThe \"try it out because we are confident it fucks\" sales strategy could lead to exponential recurring growth with these huge potential clients. It shortens (traditionally long) sales and onboarding cycles. \n\nex: See Salesforce before that sales supercycle- when the PE was ~950%. \nInnovative, enterprise SaaS can scale very quickly in the commercial space. \n\n🐻: This clearly needs time to grow into elevated valuation even if it grows at a solid rate. \nThis could well be a near term top as it just was included in S&P and there is a potential dump about to take place. \nOr the hyperscale of sales cycle could be much smaller/less immediate than my bullish thesis, in which case this stock will drop considerably, at least in the near term. 25% growth is good but not enough to justify this price. \nIf the macro climate 📉hard then this thing could dip a lot harder than your average Dow holding haha. \nDatabricks or others might be quietly cooking up some tech that is better? I'm very doubtful that hits market anytime soon w respects to the PLTR headstart. \n\nNot financial advice or attempts to sell anyone on this risk/reward... adding context to what was once considered meme stock-> loser stock-> whatever it is seen as now.",
