  "selftext": "Have any of you regards ever used Amazon Medical Care?\n\nI woke up today with a cyst in my mouth. Of course I didn’t know it was a cyst, I thought holy shit there is a fucking lump in my mouth, I need to see a doctor. But, I have a busy day and the idea of sitting in an urgent care for hours was not appealing. \n\nWith some quick research I saw ppl generally have a good sentiment about Amazon medical care telehealth and how they were seen by a professional within 10 mins. I gave it a try and behold, within 10 minutes I was talking to a doctor, and 20 mins confirmed diagnosis. \n\nI take this as a sign to jump in Amazon now. The e-commerce platform has a lock on almost everyone you know, we all use it every week. AWS is massive and continues to grow. Whole foods is my number 1 go to grocery store. And slowly but surely medical care thru Amazon will become more popularized Amazon is continually diversifying its revenue and business streams, and doesn’t seem to be anywhere close to falling out of relevance.\n\nBonus: in addition Papa Bezos blocked newspaper from endorsing Kamala Harris, indicating that even if trump wins, Bezos n friends will be on his good side. \n\nPositions, calls only:\n\nJune 20 25 @ 235\nDec. 18 26 @ 200\nJan 15 27 @ 220\n\nI’m highly regarded and this is not financial advice ",

Matter of fact, I can tell you of a specific moment in my life when I was SO sure I just needed to go see PT, but turns out it was something way worse than I had expected.\n\nYou have to understand that it's not necessarily a bad thing that your PCP doesn't know how to manage your condition and sends you out for referral. You need somebody competent in medicine to know when something is just a simple ankle sprain versus something that requires advanced subspecialty referral. PTs are highly trained in their craft, but there is a reason why they cannot order an MRI/CT or prescribe you medication.",

                              "body": "I'm sorry. PTs do not go to medical school. They do not complete any medical/surgical residency, and definitely not any subsequent fellowship. They are not qualified to diagnose and treat disease. While I am sure they can build a competent differential for MSK injury, they most certainly CANNOT build a broad differential. I am sure most PTs you visit for initial consultation will tell you to go see a doctor first.\n\nYou have to understand that medical students technically learn ALL of medicine at some level. This means everything from cardiology to psychiatry to gynecology to oncology in 4 years, at least 2 of which are spent solely rotating in the hospital. Some dual degree training programs last even longer. They take (and must pass) comprehensive board examinations to advance into residency, where they proceed to practically live in the hospital for 3-7 more years. Discounting PCPs, they also often spend \\~2+ extra years completing additional fellowship(s) to carve a special niche. Do not tell me that a PT who completed a 2-3 yr. doctorate is as competent as MDs in building a broad medical differential.\n\nRe: cash-pay PT. I admit that I don't know how this self-referral system works. And frankly, it doesn't matter. I believe it's prudent for patients to see a physician for suspected MSK concerns before being referred to specialized therapy. This is why the system for insurance reimbursement works the way it does.",

I’m not discounting the fact that doctors have a broad ability to diagnose and treat disease. I’m focusing on the fact that they have to be gatekeepers when it’s not necessary. \n\nSee military PTs and, (unfortunately imo) Chiropractors. You can see them without a referral for a suspected MSK problem and they will send you to a doctor if it’s not MSK. \n\nThere are a lot of issues PTs would not need to tell you to go to the doctor for if the system was set up to allow it. \n\nYour previous points with the cancer and meningitis situations are rare and should be glaringly obvious that it’s not strictly MSK to any competent PT. They would send them to an MD (cancer) or ER (minnigitis). They wouldn’t know what it is, but they would understand the symptoms are out of their scope and if it’s urgent or not.\n\nThe vast majority of people will be coming in for things like an ankle sprain or tendinopathy. Why do they need to see an MD first? It’s just jumping through hoops that delays care for most people who don’t have quick access to their PCP or don’t have a PCP, as most urgent care docs and walk-in clinic docs almost never will give you a script for PT.",

I agree with you that this situation unfairly disadvantages some people who cannot easily be seen by a physician. However, that does not negate the necessity of a proper medical evaluation before physical therapy can be recommended. In fact, there are plenty of scenarios where PT is actually contraindicated in a suspected \"MSK\" condition (e.g., DVT, septic joint, etc.), and you would be delaying much-needed care by trying to circumvent the MD. Worse yet, you might see a chiropractor who completely ignores the problem and proceeds to make it worse.\n\nRe: my previous examples. No, they are not rare. Flank/lower back pain is a cardinal symptom of kidney cancer, which is relatively common in older people. Perhaps meningitis wasn't the greatest example, given how much it varies in presentation. A better example would be a newly-discovered DVT—yes, plenty of pain and swelling; no, definitely not something you'd want to screw around with at the PT office.\n\nCould a competent PT identify whether your diffusely swollen and painful leg potentially has a clot in it and tell you to visit the ER immediately? Very likely, yes. But the point is, you should have gone to the ER in the first place. Or, at the very least, a reputable urgent care/walk-in, as you mentioned.\n\nAt the end of the day, what seems like a simple ankle sprain or tendinopathy may not be what meets the eye. Sometimes, you'll need imaging or labs. Sometimes, pharmacologic therapy might be more appropriate. Other times, you might need a surgical consult. These are ultimately decisions which should be made by a physician. If your condition is not acute or severe enough to warrant medical/surgical care and is referred to PT instead, that means—by definition—it could have waited. And I think this should be the way to go.",

Many people will ignore MSK conditions until it gets so bad that they NEED to see a doctor because they know doctors won’t do much for them until it’s limiting function severely. If they had more access to PT they could be told it’s not MSK sooner and see an MD or treat the MSK problem sooner. The aim of direct access is to be an adjunct to MDs, not a replacement.\n\nI see your point. Your thinking is a more conservative, technically safer, approach at the cost of limiting access. \n\nIf you don’t think PTs can recognize red flags that point to cancer, DVTs and non-MSK conditions, I encourage you to spend some time talking with or watching a quality PT.\n\nWhat’s your opinion NPs providing care without MD supervision?

Their backend systems are so fucking old that both Microsoft and IBM refused to redo it/update it\n3. Regional managers are fucking brutal and willing to do whatever it takes to get money. This can be a sudden change in labels that a store cannot claw back, purposefully misleading customers into getting their cc at the register, and opening during holidays/extreme weather.\n4. Nobody ever confuses CVS for Walgreens, but holy shit it happens so much the other way around.\n\nWill it be profitable to take them over? Fuck if I know, I just now it won't be an easy company to unfuck",

Here are some thoughts on your points:\n\n1. **Telehealth Efficiency**: The quick access to a doctor through Amazon’s telehealth service shows how technology is streamlining healthcare. The convenience and speed of these services can be appealing, especially for those with busy schedules.\n2. **Diversification**: Amazon's move into healthcare, along with its strong foothold in e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), and grocery with Whole Foods, demonstrates a significant diversification strategy. This broadens their revenue streams and reduces dependency on any single market.\n3. **Market Position**: As you noted, Amazon's ability to reach a vast customer base gives it a competitive advantage. Their established reputation and user familiarity make it easier for them to introduce new services.\n4. **Political Influence**: Your mention of Bezos' influence in the political arena reflects how large corporations can navigate and impact policy discussions, which can be seen as both a strength and a potential risk.\n5. **Investment Positions**: Your positions in calls suggest a bullish outlook on Amazon's future growth. Just remember, while Amazon has shown resilience and adaptability, investing always carries risks, and it’s important to do thorough research.\n\nYour enthusiasm for Amazon's potential is clear, and it seems you believe they’re positioned well for future growth across multiple sectors. Just keep in mind the inherent volatility in the market and always consider the broader economic factors that can impact stock performance also if you're looking to automate your trading, check out pickmytrade.trade for tradovate automation and pickmytrade.io for rithmic automation",
