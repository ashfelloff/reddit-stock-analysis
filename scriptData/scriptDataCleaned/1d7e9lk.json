Don’t be afraid to stalk Linkedin/social media on employees, check local newspapers online if it’s a smaller company. You gotta beat the news though. Market at the moment is whack imo, but there is money to be made. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. \n\nKnow yourself most importantly and make an exit plan/stick to it. If you can’t..I would play it safe/stick to etfs. The miles you’ve driven/waited is not worth blowing that hard earned $1000, people think that shit’s easy just driving around delivering. It can be super stressful if you’re wanting to be efficient / idiots on the road. No bigger L than losing $1000, putting some wear on the car and having to keep driving with it on your mind.",
