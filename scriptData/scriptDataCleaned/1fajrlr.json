This is NOT gonna fly with anyone I’ve ever interacted with in my life.\n\nNot only Ads doesn’t belong in a car but also eavesdropping for target advertisement? Rest assured no one is gonna go near a 5 mile radius of the Ford dealers. They already are making shitty cars now to top it off this?\n\nThe moment they announce this, I’ll port half my portfolio to PUTs on F.\n\n\nhttps://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-in-vehicle-advertising-patent/",

It just means that it’s protecting its intellectual property from competitors. Ford, of course, could implement this system in some form based on this patent, but don’t presume that it will.”\n\nIt’s ***possible*** that Ford patented this so that others will not be able to implement it and perhaps they don’t intend to either.",
