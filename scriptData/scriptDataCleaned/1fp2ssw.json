Their data centre business is brand new and went from $0 to $5b annual in one year. The TAM will increase 4x by 2027. Even if AMD maintains its 4% or so market share it’ll see its data centre revenues increase to $20b annually (which is about what the entire company makes annually). Data centre margins are quite high (53.5% or so). \n\nRealistically, AMD’s market share will grow so we’re likely looking at least $30b in annual GPU revenue in the coming years. \n\nI still believe Nvidia will be the better performer since their sales and margins are much higher, however AMD will probably undercut their margins by competing on price. I would own both and Broadcom since the hyperscalers will continue to spend big on this.",
