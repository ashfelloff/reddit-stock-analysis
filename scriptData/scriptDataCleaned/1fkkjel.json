This part I get 100%\n\nin past every time there is a sudden rate cuts, it means they are panicking and underlying market conditions are not looking good. Rise in unemployment, either we are into or going towards recession. However, this time there is 0.5% rate cut this week, and already hinted for another 0.5% rate cut by end the year. Thats almost 1% full rate cut in a quarte seems unprecedented if we are not in recession.\n\nSo since market is reacting so positively, we are officially saying that we have a balanced unemployment and inflation to support unprecedented rate cut meaning \"Soft landing\"? Because if not then we are in Recession = \"Hard landing\".\n\nJust want to understand these are the only two scenarios or something else as well?",

Obviously that's not the ideal scenario, but I would think a super mild and brief economic downturn would still be quite the win under the circumstances.\n\nThe overall idea of a soft landing is slowing the economy without damaging it too much. Economies are not easy to control. The federal reserve does not have absolute control over our economy, nor does the federal government. They all have various powers to influence the economy, and influence it in substantial ways, but they cannot absolutely control it. So achieving this \"soft landing\" is extraordinarily difficult as it is quite easy to overshoot and over-restrict the economy and push it into a bad recession.\n\nTo make the above point even more challenging, the tools the fed has, monetary policy, operate with \"long and variable lags\" as Powell likes to say. This means that by the time the data starts showing X, Y and Z, the window of opportunity to change course may have already passed.\n\nFinally, interest rate policy has a murky concept of stimulating, restricting, or neutral rates, based on the impact the rates are considered to have on the economy. There is quite a bit of guesswork here, although the core of it is the difference between interest rates and the inflation rate. The absolute level of interest rates is not irrelevant, however which of those three buckets the absolute level of rates is very important for understanding what is happening.\n\nAnyway, all of this means that the fed believes that interest rates are both very restrictive, that inflation has come down, and that the economy is weakening. They want to get us to a neutral interest rate, one that neither stimulates nor restricts the economy, quickly before their window to avoid a recession closes.\n\nI hope that helps.",

More and more debt has to be paid, in this sense the dollar is a fundamentally unstable currency that if rates fall too quickly (risk-adjusted of course) will come under pressure due to reduced capital inflows, if rates remain elevated will remain strong in the moment but will continue to face further current account degradation and problems over the long term horizon. \n\nEspecially given that the commodity deficit is only growing so far: the last 4 months have averaged around $100 bln monthly, i.e. approaching ~1.2 trillion annualized levels. And this is despite the fact that over the last 15 years the US has shifted from being a net energy importer to a net energy exporter, but everything it has saved on that has been spent on something else. \n\nTotal external liabilities on the international investment position rose by $7.6 trillion to a record $57.1 trillion last year, while assets only rose by $3.2 trillion to $35.8 trillion, the net international investment position is negative at -$21.3 trillion, or 75% of GDP.

They’ve already moved most engineering to India.\n\nIf lower interest rates encourage them to do more R&D, it’s not gonna happen here.\n\nhttps://techcrunch.com/2024/09/19/chipmaker-qualcomm-lays-off-hundreds-of-workers-in-san-diego/\n\n>In a statement, Qualcomm spokesperson Kristin Stiles said: “Our leading technology and product portfolio has positioned us to execute on our diversification strategy. As part of a normal course of business, we prioritize and align our investments, resources, and talent to ensure we are optimally positioned to take advantage of the unprecedented diversification opportunities in front of us.”\n\nThey’re “diversifying” where they do the engineering.\n\nOnly 226 workers this time. 1,250 about a year ago. \n\nThose jobs are not coming back. I know an engineer who worked there for many years and took a buyout and retired early last year. \n\nScorched earth.\n\nThe jobs were moved to India. Everyone knew that.",
