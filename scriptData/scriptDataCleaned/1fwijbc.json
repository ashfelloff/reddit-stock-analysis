Finally generating profit;¬†\n3. Will do SaaS (which has relatively a higher profit ratio) with Counterpart;\n4. Recently got an improved CMS star rating to 4.0 star, which will help them market their insurance plan;¬†\n5. directors individually buying shares; and¬†\n6. Company authorizing share buy back.¬†\n\n\nI don't have a price target in mind - can't read the future - but I can see this going beyond 5/share. I sold some because I made 230% profit and wanted to lock some of that profit in and I had been holding over a year so I had reduced tax exposure. Hope this helps.¬†",
