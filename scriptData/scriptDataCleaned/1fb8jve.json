  "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been trading options for a while now and finally found a strategy that suits me. However, I’m struggling with one key aspect: knowing when to hold onto a trade. I often spot great setups on $SPY, but I tend to exit early, even after trimming, because I lost over $100k when I first started.\n\nI’ve recently become consistently profitable over the past few months, but I still cut my trades short at 20-30% gains instead of holding for more. Most of these trades often go beyond 100%, and some even hit 1000%. My biggest issue is that I get spooked by pullbacks. If you know $SPY, it’ll sometimes drop $1-$2, do a wick, and then recover before the candle even closes. With all the market manipulation this year, I hesitate to hold for longer.\n\nHow do you gain the confidence to hold through those pullbacks? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",

What's the benefit of risking and holding out for a play that makes 100% if you can instead make four plays that make 25%?",

If so then try holding to 50% profit and cash out until you get your nerves and emotions under control. Then it’ll be easier to hold during the dips while you wait for higher returns. Remember that nothing is fool proof and what may seem like a temporary pull back may last longer than you expect. You can also pull out profit at 20% so you won’t walk away empty handed but obviously this will reduce future gains.",

I'm in a similar position where I lost like 50% when I first started (got some back, pulled some out for house buying during early COVID) but since that mistake I've 2x'd S&P over the last three years.\n\nHere's what worked for me:\n\n1. Get good at reading price action across multiple time scales, and multiple indicators, simultaneously. I look to make plays where monthly, weekly, daily, and ideally hourly candle patterns and RSI/EMA bounces all line up. That helps me know clearly what trading range I'm looking at. If I don't have an obvious ressitance/support level I'm playing off, I don't enter the trade. \n\n2. Set very clear, and tight, mental stop losses, and don't enter trades where you can't set them, no matter what your \"gut\" says. Because gut feelings are amorphous, you can't argue effectively with them - leads to confusion which causes anxiety and FOMO or panic about downside. As a general rule, I don't allow myself more than a 20-30% downside on trades, ideally less. Don't mess around with \n trades where bid/ask takes you outside that risk.\n\n3. Have a clear understanding of macroeconomics, global money flows, and how they relate to business cycles across different sectors, countries, currencies. Use that macro knowledge to check you technicals. \n\n4. No pennies, clinical trial bio stocks, startups, IPOs, or other P&D prone sectors. Dilution risk is way too high and impossible to predict. \n\n5. Last, and most important, do your research after market close, and write down your plays in advance. Doesn't have to be a lot, just a few line touchstone in a note taking app. Crystallized your thoughts and makes expectations explicit, so when you are nervous/emotional you can double-check your current gut with your *reasoned* opinion.",
