So does forgetting that the next big market movement isn't going to be the same as some past market movement just because it shares some similarities with another time period. The 1970's and stagflation have been a popular theme lately, but we're not living in the 1970's. The world is very different.\n\nThis is why making decisions on macro analysis is useless, except for those talking heads and fear journalists who make a living selling bravado.",
