  "score": 76,
  "selftext": "I’m planning to buy NVDA calls before earnings, someone explain why this isn’t free money? Yes I know basically everyone and their grandma is projecting NVDA to beat earnings, so IV on the contracts will be low. But if I bought the contracts two days before earnings when IV is already low, then I can save myself from an IV crush after earnings, and just ride up the actual price movement of NVDA which will very likely go up. If IV is extremely high on the day of earnings then I can just sell some of my contracts to capitalize on that, and then hold some for when IV crushes but the price moves up. Am I regarded or can this work? ",
