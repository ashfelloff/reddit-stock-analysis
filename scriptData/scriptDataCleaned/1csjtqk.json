                          "body": "It all plays a role.  Cost of repairing cars has gone up 20% a year recently.  This is largely due to the higher value of vehicles and the enhanced safety features and electronics on new cars.  A broken windshield on a Subaru 15 years ago would be around $400 to replace.  A new one is several thousand dollars.  Its because they have a camera that is attached to the windshield that requires recalibration when you remove it.  When the value of cars increases (like it has), the cost of both your property damage coverage will increase even if your car stays the same.  This is because the amount of damage you would do to an average car on the road is more than it was when cars were worth less.  So multiple coverages are increasing just from cost of repairs and cost of new cars.\n\n  \nThen add in the nuclear judgements (thats the actual term) against insurance companies for injuries.  Juries are awarding ridiculous amounts for injuries and lawyers are the ones coming out on top.  The juries think they are sticking it to the insurance company and \"corporation bad\", but all it does is get passed on in inflated insurance costs for everyone.  \n\n  \nAs for how these companies are still in business with these ratios ... Its due to float.  If the insurance company pays out $1 for every $1 they bring in, they can still be profitable at the end of the year.  They take the unearned premium (the pre-paid insurance essentially) and invest it.  They then hopefully have a profit on that money that hasnt been applied to the insurance payment yet.  Thats why the insurance wants you to pay your full 6 months or 1 year policy at once, so they can invest the unused portion.  Think of it like this.  GEICO is owned by Berkshire Hathaway.  If GEICO had a 100% ratio, spending all of its money it brings in, every dime ... It can still send that money it brought in to BH to invest.  BH in return gets an interest free loan to invest in other businesses.  If GEICO didn't exist for BH, they would have to go to a bank to get that loan and it would cost the going interest rate.  Insurance companies can survive at around 100% ratio, they cannot survive at State Farm's 129% ratio they were running though.  Most companies want about 2-3% profit before float, 2022 was a very bad year for insurance though.",

          "body": "Yeah — it’s been a while since I was in this industry, but as of a decade ago, auto insurers basically didn’t make any underwriting profit.  Most states capped you at 5%, but you were lucky to break even if you wanted to stay competitive.  The profits all came from investments.\n\nSo, what the consumer pays (the premium) is pretty much a statistician or actuary’s estimate of the expected value of the contract, plus a percentage that covers costs.  \n\nWe also saw the same trend (decreasing frequency, increasing severity) back then, too.  If frequency was constant, premiums going up would just reflect the rising costs of cars and/or repair services.  Since frequency is decreasing, it means those costs are rising just that much faster — i.e. it’s a symptom, not a cause, of inflation.\n\nThat is, of course, unless insurers are taking advantage of increasing price trends to hike rates targeting greater underwriting profits.  Which they may be, and if they are, that is the very definition of price gouging.  You wouldn’t have gotten away with it a decade ago; honestly I have no idea what the regulatory environment is like today.",
