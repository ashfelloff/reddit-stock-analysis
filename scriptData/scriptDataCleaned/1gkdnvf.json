  "selftext": "The volume of calls is increasing. Until yesterday the volume of puts exceeded calls. Today that has been reversed, I don't know what to think... Until yesterday everyone was super bearish, but today I see more people bullish, at least for a rebound and then for it to continue falling. Also today there is no SMCI auditor, so technically they can say anything in their results release and go up, taking into account that the expected movement is +-27%. What do you think?",

If the penalty won't be getting them de-listed or forced out of business, it's possible they might be said to have been hit back enough.\n\nOther companies like Nvidia (running to beg for clemency already, along with one of their biggest customers Meta who's undoubtedly used the purchases of $NVDA products to boost their projected future value) might eventually have to face similar consequences.",
