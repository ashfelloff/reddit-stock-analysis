I might trade stocks that do not appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you are on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, but can be delayed if I am trading the open. These are not mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. These are potentially good candidates to day trade; I have no opinion on them as investments. PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on _____?‚Äù will be ignored unless you add detail to the question. ‚ÄúIs ___ a good investment?‚Äù will be ignored. I will block you if you are a troll.\n\nNews: [Powell Flags Rising Risks to Jobs While Avoiding Rate-Cut Timing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-09/powell-says-more-good-inflation-data-would-boost-fed-confidence)\n\n- [LZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=LZ&p=d) - Cut full year revenue guidance, new CEO change announced, and cut FCF revenue guidance.\n- [TXG](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TXG&p=d) - ILMN acquiring Fluent Biosciences, TXG down due to acquisition.\n- [TSLA](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSLA&p=d) - Has been on a tear for the past few days- bearish bias. Trading out of line with Mag 7 (which is expected due to car sale numbers), but will be looking for appropriate places to short if they occur.\n- [TSM](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=TSM&p=d) - Reported Q2 revenue last night in Taiwan, beating market forecasts due to AI boom. Strong growth in Q2. T$673.51B vs T$654.27B in revenue, (32% growth YoY). \n- [AAPL](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AAPL&p=d) - Still watching to see what we‚Äôll do at the $230 level, but other than that not going to play this short.\n- [AMZN](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=AMZN&p=d) - And again, watching AMZN.
