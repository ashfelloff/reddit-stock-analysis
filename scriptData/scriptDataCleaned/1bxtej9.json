Now hybrids on the other hand, will get a lot more popular than either EV or gas cars. Some one fact check me but I’m pretty sure I read (not too long ago) that Ford is focusing on hybrids. I like the EV concept I just can’t justify it based on my location and reliability if I were to take it into remote areas for camping/hiking etc. Currently a gas car owner. I really wanted a hybrid but couldn’t afford it. Guess what my next car will be? A hybrid. It would give me up to 600 miles. And I wouldn’t even have to charge the thing. Just pay the same amount $ for gas that I pay right now and get almost double mileage (as of right now in most hybrids). Gas isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.

To refuel an  ICE car, you *need* external infrastructure. If there's not a gas station within 300 miles, then it's completely pointless to own an ICE car. EVs can charge at any home that has electricity. In other words: any home. \n\nThe vast majority of trips (something like 95% iirc) are under 50 miles so any range over 100 is overkill most of the time. In the rare scenarios where you do NEED external infrastructure (like ICE ALWAYS does) you only need to be within 200+ miles of a charger which is a milestone the charger network reached in that vast majority of the US years ago.  Also, charge times have been dropping since the first EV was made. \n\nI'm not saying oil is going to be wiped out completely (plastics and diesel are likely staying around forever), but consumer gas cars will be absolutely decimated by EVs in the near future.

Meaning they are already working on laws, insurance plans, marketing, infrastructure, new dealership agreements, etc.\n\nDisagree, insofar as I personally know several big shots on the dealer and technology side of the industry who are completely out of touch with reality. They are coastal elites who travel around the world, from one big city to the next. I believe EV is completely impractical for commercial vehicles, rural communities, and that it requires a very strong global supply chain that cannot be guaranteed for much longer.\n\nAlso, I have some theoretical DD that may make some people money. Several in-the-know individuals who visit big conferences all around the world have personally told me the real alternative to ICE is good ol' hydrogen fuel cell technology. I'd look into that technology, the relative businesses, and start investing in them a couple years from now.",
