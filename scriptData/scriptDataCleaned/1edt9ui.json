Logical thing to do for me is to withdraw most cash and keep my account at 10% (40k) and gamble for pleasure. \n\nBut atm, I’m sorta used to gambling large amounts (after 2 months). The results don’t matter to me financially. I’m not rich by any means, but I’ve lived frugally all my life. It would make me feel strange to suddenly start splurging. \n\nAlso, not stupid. I see the joy that spending money brings to people. I have nothing against that, i envy people who buy that new thing (or spend it one someone they love) and makes them genuinely happy.

Stock was at 99.xx. I paid I think 3.25. Position was $200k. I thought it was a good buy, because IV was still low after the stock shot up from ~$86 in a matter of 3 days.\n\nI was right, IV was low. Options were cheap, but wrong on direction. I can endlessly dissect this loss in my head. But what would that achieve? I followed the stock in hong kong and then over in NY over the next 3-4 days. It dropped to $94. I ate the $100K loss and moved on.",

          "body": "Selling books is a business. While I read stuff, I’m always skeptical about what I read. Everything you read about everything is already priced in. BUT when everyone is anticipating the same thing, inverse it. You may not always be right, but when you are right, you can make up all the losses and then some. Use your head before inversing though. Betting against cult like brands like AAPL just cuz everyone else is too bullish and you think you’re a genius betting against the trend may not be smart. \n\nBut also beware. Volatility clustering is a real thing. ie, high and low volatility happens in clusters. You wont see a spike in vol one day and then go back to normal the next. But options pricing will adjust when that first spike in vol happens. So jumping on the trend may not be a good bet because you’re paying dearly for those options. Ask yourself, what do I see that the market is not seeing. \n\n\n\n\nRisk management is important, but that doesn’t mean “don’t bet more than x%” or “take profits/losses at x%”. I have 20 years of risk management experience and I still don’t follow the rules. I use intuition instead.",

This is why NVDA made money for people these past few years. The pros missed the whole AI thing, so their projections were low. Now all those projections are high. Not saying NVDA can’t meet projections, but it’s not an interesting play for me. Too many eyes on NVDA. This is just an example. Not trying to sh*t on NVDA. \n\nI have a good NFLX story too. This was back in 2011 I think. NFLX was trading down 30-40% because they missed subscriber numbers. You could have bought the entire company for $5B. I thought surely online streaming of entertainment is worth more than that. But I missed the boat, because by the time my money transfer hit my account, NFLX had already gone up 10-15%. I was waiting for it to drop back to the prior week’s levels and it never did. I’m still waiting till this day!",
