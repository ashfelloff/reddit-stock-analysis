  "selftext": "Hello,\n\nSince tech stocks have been hammered this week, I‚Äôve started scanning some companies and considering my next move, as I don‚Äôt think this dip will last long. I looked at Sony and thought I‚Äôd share my thoughts.\n\nI also noticed that Sony wasn‚Äôt on the list of Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for the week beginning August 5, 2024. [According to Sony‚Äôs website](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/), their earnings will be announced on August 7 at 15:00.\n\nI‚Äôm going to keep this short, so I‚Äôve listed and linked this year‚Äôs key takeaways and drawn my own conclusions. Please share your opinions, and let‚Äôs have a good discussion\n\n**General Key Takeaways 2024**\n\n* [5:1 stock split, which will be effective on October 1, 2024.](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20240514_E_02.pdf)\n* [Sony announced a share buyback of 250 billion yen ($1.6 billion) and plans to gradually increase dividends, with a target total payout ratio of 40% by the financial year ending March 2025](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sony-shares-leap-12-buyback-dividend-plans-higher-profit-outlook-2024-05-15/)\n* [The Afeela car doesn't seem like just a concept car. According to Sony, sales will start in 2025, with deliveries expected in 2026](https://www.shm-afeela.com/en/)\n* [Sony plans a partial spinoff of its finance unit in 2025](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/news/20240214_02E.pdf)\n* [Sony¬†Pictures has acquired¬†Alamo¬†Drafthouse](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/12/sony-pictures-buys-alamo-drafthouse.html)\n* [Crunchyroll's paying subscribers have been growing.](https://www.statista.com/statistics/594952/crunchyroll-users/)\n* [Apollo Leads $700M Capital Solution for Sony Music Group](https://www.apollo.com/insights-news/pressreleases/2024/07/apollo-leads-700m-capital-solution-for-sony-music-group-2919484)\n* [Sony, NFL launch new technology partnership](https://www.nfl.com/news/sony-nfl-launch-new-technology-partnership)\n* [The PlayStation 5 Pro has not been officially announced, but rumors are piling up that it will be released in the fall of 2024](https://www.techradar.com/news/ps5-pro)\n* [Sony has started operations in its new fab, which will be used for assembling image sensors for automotive applications and display devices, as well as for the mass production of laser diodes for data center applications](https://www.sony-semicon.com/en/news/2024/2024032801.html)\n\n**News that might influence the upcoming results announcement**\n\n* [The PS5 has been the best-selling console in the US this year, and Sony has acted as a publisher for popular games such as Helldivers 2](https://www.vgchartz.com/article/461914/ps5-best-selling-console-in-the-us-in-june-elden-ring-best-selling-game/)\n* [Sony has been actively repurchasing its shares over the past quarter. The $1.6 billion buyback program announced in May 2024 is now 11.18% complete, while the total number of treasury shares held by Sony as of June 30, 2024, is 30,868,630](https://www.tipranks.com/news/company-announcements/sony-group-advances-share-repurchase-plan?utm_source=edition.cnn.com&utm_medium=referral)\n* [Bad Boys: Ride or Die was released on June 7 and has grossed a worldwide total of $395.8 million, making it the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2024](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Bad-Boys-Ride-or-Die-(2024))\n* [Garfield was released in May and has grossed $245,464,603 at the worldwide box office.](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Garfield-Movie-The-(2024)#tab=summary)\n\n**Financials:**\n\n* [Financial Statements and Consolidated Financial Results for the Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2024 And Outlook for the Fiscal Year Ending March 31, 2025](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sony.pdf)\n* [FY2023 Consolidated Financial Results](https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonypre.pdf)\n\n**My conclusion:**  \nSony has a lot going on, and it takes time to understand the company. It seems that Sony is adjusting its strategy, as they are planning a partial spinoff, which will likely release capital for other strategic investments, such as growing the image sensors business or the Afeela car. The Afeela car seems interesting, but it‚Äôs uncertain whether it will break through. They are also likely planning something with their music unit, given Apollo's lead capital offers. The gaming industry still seems attractive, especially with significant releases like GTA 6 on the horizon. From a strategic and speculative point of view, Sony‚Äôs situation seems good. The financial situation looks good, and the upcoming stock split is an interesting move. We will see if it boosts the stock's liquidity.\n\nThis is not financial advice; do not invest or yolo your grandma inheritance on this stock, because of this post. Just wanted to share my thoughts.  \n",
