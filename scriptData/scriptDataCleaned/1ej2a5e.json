Natural disasters happen all the time, so guess what, who wants to be insured by a company that can’t cover its claims? Absolutely no one. \n\nApple is a 3T company that Berkshire invested in when they were in 500-600B range. Where is it going from there? Is the money at Apples now worth more than a dollar in T bills?  Maybe and maybe not; what Berkshire does, fit their timeline, which is way different than yours, and regardless what they do, being wrong is part of the job.\n\nBerkshire sold Apple in 2016 and then bought more. Berkshire sold CVX and bought more this year. They bought TSM and sold in the same Q. They bought Para and sold at a loss. I can go on many example of how they do what do for their own reasons,\n\nIts more convoluted than “buying a dip” and all the nonsense morons around here say\n\nThey invested in apple for one reason, and sold some for one or two or three different reasons that only them know, and that reason is irrelevant to us or the economy",
