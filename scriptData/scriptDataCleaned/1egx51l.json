  "selftext": "Qualcomm reported fiscal third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations, particularly for sales, and provided strong guidance for the current quarter.\n\nQualcomm stock rose over 4% in extended trading.\n\nHere’s how Qualcomm did versus LSEG consensus estimates for the quarter ending in June 23:\n\nEarnings per share: $2.33, adjusted versus $2.25 expected\n\nRevenue: $9.39 billion, adjusted, versus $9.22 billion expected\n\nNet income during the quarter was $2.13 billion, or $1.88 per share, versus $1.8 billion, or $1.60 per share in the year-ago period.\n\nQualcomm said it expected between $9.5 billion and $10.3 billion in sales in the current quarter, compared to Wall Street expectations of $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for earnings guidance of $2.45, versus the company’s forecast of between $2.38 and $2.58.\n\nQualcomm’s biggest and most important business is processors and modems for smartphones, which it calls its handsets business. The summer months are traditionally a slower part of the annual cycle for smartphones, because most new models launch in the fall.\n\nHandset sales rose 12% on a year-over-year basis to $5.9 billion in revenue, in line with analyst estimates from StreetAccount, which suggests that a deep slump in smartphone sales over the past two years is abating. Qualcomm is also framing its most advanced Snapdragon chips as necessary for “AI smartphones,” such as recent Samsung models, which can run some generative AI tasks like creating images.\n\nAutomotive chips remains small for Qualcomm but the company sees placing more software and semiconductors into cars as one of its strongest opportunities for growth and diversification. Automotive revenues rose 87% on an annual basis to $811 million. Analysts polled by StreetAccount were looking for $641.7 million.\n\nThe company sells chips for lower-cost devices as well as Meta’s Quest headsets in a business it calls “Internet of Things.” The line also includes revenues from the company’s new PC chip for Windows laptops, called Snapdragon X Elite, which it launched alongside Microsoft during the quarter.\n\nCEO Cristiano Amon hailed the Snapdragon X launch as a “milestone” in Qualcomm’s efforts to diversify. Still, Qualcomm said IoT revenue fell 8% on an annual basis to $1.4 billion, which beat StreetAccount expectations of $641.7 million.\n\nThose three hardware lines are reported together as QCT, the company’s chip business, which in total reported $8.1 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nQualcomm also collects licensing fees from companies that integrate 5G or other cellular technologies into their products, reported as QTL sales. Licensing revenue only rose 3% on an annual basis to $1.3 billion.\n\nQualcomm said it paid $949 million in dividends and repurchased 7 million shares of stock for $1.3 billion during the quarter.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/31/qualcomm-qcom-earnings-report-q3-2024.html",
