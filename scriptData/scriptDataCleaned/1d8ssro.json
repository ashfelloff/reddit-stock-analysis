Even at this brokie gym the patrons are wearing this brand. \n\nThereâ€™s no brand that can make your ass look as good as lulu, especially for girls \n\nChina expansion, I visited China a month ago and 2 new lulu stores are opening in my City. \n\nFriends from Canada travelling back to China bought 8 navigator down jackets for their friends and family in a check in suit case last week \n\nPosition sold 2x DTE 6/7 290P \n\nGood luck regards \n\n\nEDIT: LFG for all the regards that believed in my DD for China and bubble butts in the gym ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€",
