Remember that inflation was good for earnings, but if inflation slows, earnings will not grow as much. \n\nHowever, I wonder if theres gonna be a psychological shift in terms of how should assets be priced going forward. We printed too much money so I wonder if people will adjust their valuation metrics accordingly. If you look at historic pe, they do trend upwards. Maybe 30 PE is the new 20? 😆\n\nWhen the rates indeed drop, will large volumes coming from the money market be pumping it up? But uncertainty surrounding geopolitics and the election might cause too much volatility to the point that money market investors would rather sacrifice some returns in exchange of some stability. \n\nSo overall I would say that there are more downsides than upsides in the market right now. I bought a bit of Amazon on Friday when it dipped but going forward I’m gonna be building up my cash position and waiting on the sidelines for a bit just to see how this plays out.",
