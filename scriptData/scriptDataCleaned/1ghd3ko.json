I was kicking myself for not having any positions that day. \n\nSo, leaving your political baggage behind and from a strictly objective standpoint, what are your bets, and why? \n\nI'll set up a few comments below as headings. \n",

If we are burning down our cities for the next 2 months the market will take a massive hit.  If that doesn’t happen and we have a smooth election then I would say market pushes higher on a Trump win with the mindset that US business will “do better” under that administration. Only “wild card” there is the Tariffs he is promising, for that reason I don’t necessarily think a Harris win would cause a negative reaction IF the election goes smooth.  So again smooth election = significant positive relief reaction in the market + whatever the winning candidate brings. Bumpy election we are red until things settle down.",
