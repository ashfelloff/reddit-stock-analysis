I believe this is exactly what OP has heard. Not doubting him. But businesses look into new facilities and investments all the time. How often is a deal actually minted and billions in CAPEX spend approved? Just because they're window shopping doesn't make it a sure thing. It only looks really exciting to locals who want their economy to get a shot in the arm.",
