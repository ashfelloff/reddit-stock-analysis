You would obviously know this because he would not be able to shut the fuck up about it and literally used it to gain your business initially.  ...\"you know, Nancy Pelosi is my client\"...\n\nThen,\n\nYou see your portfolio up a meager 18% yoy and hers is up like 230%.\n\nDo you:\n\nA.  Pressure him to make the same trades for you, in lockstep, and risk insider trading violations.\n\nB.  Ask him, \"why can't you do the same trades for me as you do her?\" - obviously knowing the answer.\n\nC.  Threaten to beat him to a pulp if he refuses to get you the same returns?",
