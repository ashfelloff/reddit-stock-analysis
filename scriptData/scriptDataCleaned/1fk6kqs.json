              "body": "The reason interest rates increased In 2022 was because inflation was out of hand. Inflation was out of hand because of the global pandemic and the large amounts of money the Fed injected into the economy in order to mitigate the effects of a recession. The Fed printed out money to mitigate the effects of a recession because their usual tool for such instances, rate cuts, was not an option since interest rates were already near zero.\n\nInterest rates above 5% proved successful in decreasing the inflation rate to 2.5% after some years. Although this increase in interest rates decreased the inflation rate by slowing down the economy, the slowing down of the economy started causing a rise in unemployment. \n\nThe Fed wanted to decrease inflation while at the same time keeping unemployment low. The Fed doesn't want to overshoot it and cause a spike in unemployment which could lead to another recession. And so the Fed cut interest rates as a way to ease the brakes on the economy. It's a balancing act.\n\nLowering interest rates stimulates the economy, lowering interest rates is good for the economy.\n\nIn previous recessions, the recessions were not caused by the interest rates being cut. The interest rates being cut were a tool the Fed used to mitigate the effects of the recessions.",

                  "body": "All of that is well and good and is mostly true. But the reality is people had the same explanations for why the stock market was doing well pre the GFC. And the thing is right, it is in fact much more complicated than what you’re making it out to be. You’re correct in stating that the cause of the crash was mortgage related, and that lowering interest rates does stimulate the economy. But the fact of the matter is, every time there’s been a deep inversion in the bond yield curve, a recession has followed, yes they’re lowering rates and yes that is TECHNICALLY bullish, but many indicators like the unemployment one are lagging indicators on the state of the economy. So It is bullish but it could be too late, or they could have done it perfectly, it’s too early to tell. Just like pre the GFC, no one (hardly anyone) knew what the cause of the crash was before it happened. No one expected the GFC post the first 50 bp cut, everyone believed the housing market was too big to fall, and that it couldn’t possibly collapse. So id air on the side of caution. I think you’d find that most experts are still unsure what the future holds. Could be okay.. might not be.. like the Japan carry trade, don’t think anyone saw that coming, Japan randomly raising rates causing that recent spike in the vix, it really could be anything. People like warren buffet are in cash for a reason atm\n\nSummary: yes everything you said is objectively true, but it doesn’t mean there won’t be a crash of some sort, dropping rates is always meant to stimulate the economy but sometimes (most times actually) there is some crash related to something else weakening in the economy. That being said, I’m still slowly DCA in the stock market (and have a lot of crypto etc.) but I wouldn’t be surprised at a crash, just like JP said to some of the questions - he’s not even declared it a win on inflation yet, but dropping 50bp means they obviously more worried about a slowing economy.. also I really hope he’s done it and we all make it crazy money 🥹🥹 but who knows..",

The prior year there was already some hysteria due to the Y2K issue.  But interest rates were starting to drop in 2000 and in 2001.  Then, to make sure that people would still spend money, interest rates were dropped lower and lower and lower.  It became a game of refi's actually making financial sense.  People were refinancing 8% down to 5% and then when it dropped further, down to 3.5%.  That had a serious impact on a group of people.  Those people were the 'savers.'  Those were the people who would do CD laddering.  That group was mainly seniors.  \n\nThen, we get Ben Bernanke.  The purported expert on the great recession.  He saw that and decided to get back to 5% as fast as possible.  He didn't do 1/4 points every 6 months, there were times he was doing every month!  If he could have gone from 1.25 to 5 in a year, he would have.\n\nThat rapid increase caused chaos.  People who had notes tied to Libor/Prime were seeing massive increases in costs.  Businesses who used flooring or PO advances were seeing massive increases in costs.  They didn't have time to let things settle and raise costs to cover their borrowing costs.\n\nThe subprime issue is misleading.  It was not subprime that cause it, it was fraud that caused it.  Angelo Mozilo, a @#$% who died last year would give a mortgage to anyone who could fog a mirror.  He would then LIE when the mortgages were sold to be bundled.  Mozilo's product at Countrywide was a teaser rate adjustable.  Considering he basically put people in for zero down regardless of who they were, then offloaded the note, he pocketed the fees, and passed the future problem to others.  So when Bernanke raised those rates that fast, those teasers went from (fake math) $1200 a month to $2200 a month.  People had no money in it, they didn't care, so they handed over the keys.\n\nThe TLDR; version of the last paragraph . . . it was fraud compounded by Bernanke raising rates so fast that caused that timeframe.",

Real wage decrease very well could do us in this time, it's a problem on a global scale.
