  "selftext": "I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).\n\nAnd boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.\n\nFor the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c\n\nLet's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51\n\nHere we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.\n\nFrom the 10-Q:\n\n***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (“QoQ”).***\n\nSoooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?\n\nLater from the 10-Q:\n\n***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***\n\nSo they have three major holdings:\n\n* Aurora Innovations\n* Didi\n* Grab\n\nThey say they \"earned\" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.\n\nSo how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8\n\nSo if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.\n\nLet's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb\n\nThis one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!\n\nSimilarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.\n\nFinally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.\n\nOkay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:\n\n* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)\n* Didi ($414 million gain)\n* Grab ($91 million loss)\n\nIt seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.\n\nBut that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?\n\nWell, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a\n\nFirst up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874\n\nNext up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.\n\nNow for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4\n\nWow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!\n\nSo let's tally up the damage here:\n\n* Grab: $123 million loss\n* Didi: $69 million loss\n* Aurora: $505 million loss\n\nSo in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.\n\nMeanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.\n\nTL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.\n\nAs an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?\n\n**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.\n\nLikely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.\n\n**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said “it will go to $100 because they’re offering a lot of options in the app.” There is no rationale behind these movements. It’s been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch.",

But they thought they couldn't die because they had a walled market that people liked. Blockbuster and Gamestop assumed people needed to go into store to buy and sell or rent games and movies, and that customers wouldn't go for digital games. Sure, they charged too much and paid employees garbage... but who wants to \"own\" a digital game instead of a boxed game and instruction manual?\n\nWell, Uber thinks customers will be loyal because companies have Uber business accounts and people know the app, so they can charge whatever they want and string drivers along.

I'd like to add my $.02 on the state of their business, currently.\n\nThe current sentiment from every single driver is that fares continue to go DOWN, every year, counter to inflation. Drivers used to earn $4 base fare, with usually negligible mileage bonuses. Now, base fare is $2 - and if UE tries to stack two orders together, they count that as one fare, and offer $3 base pay for two stacked orders. I say all this to explain that they continue to fuck over their drivers while charging customers more in fees and tic tac additions to every transaction. \n\nOn the consumer side, especially in the last year, customers are denied refund requests for blatantly obvious errors and mistakes. I see this every single day in the subs, but UE is one of the worst offenders. Another constant critique is that Uber charges high fees and upsurge pricing on food delivery orders. We're talking a $20 delivery fee for McDs. Where are those fees going? Not to the drivers, that's for sure. \n\nI'm only speaking on the business as I see it, as I operate within it.

Although, after seriously pondering it I’m unsure of whether to interpret this as coincidental lucky price movement or if your thesis was truly the underlying motivator the action. Wish I could know for sure but I guess we’ll never know :)\n\nAnyways, regardless of whether the true EV of this play was favourable- I can now thank you for this amazing DD (and just allow myself to feel some confirmation bias haha)\n\n0% chance we just got lucky this time ;)",
