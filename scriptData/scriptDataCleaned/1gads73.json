I will also buy KMX/AN to set up a pair trade when the divergence just gets too far out of hand.\n\nAN reports earnings this Friday the 25th October, so I will be keeping a close eye out and see what the guidance looks like and how AN trades.\n\nCheers",

Every few weeks our client contact would change and I'm talking about a very high level operational position in the company. Why was it changing so frequently you ask? Because the new person would quit within the first month for the same reason...because of the chaos and toxic work environment (their words not mine).\n\nEventually, after going through 10 different people in less than one year they gave up all together on replacing the position (which was a vital operational roll) and appointed their head of legal counsel to oversee the responsibilities whom was a complete ass-hat moron that was completely out of his element and had no idea what he was doing. We finally had enough and told them we were done and they needed to find a new provider.\n\nLast time I checked they still haven't paid their invoice from over two years ago for all the work we did for them \n\nHope that gives a little insight to how shitty and poorly run this company is.",
