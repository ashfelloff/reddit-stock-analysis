Told me 40% of commercial office loans in Wash DC are already borderline in default.\n\nSaid his firm has been taking out enormous hedges against commercial real estate since 2022, to take some of the bite off it when things finally implode. And that they've been doubling and tripling down on this strategy for awhile now.\n\nAlso said that they completely canceled all new office space projects. All new projects are just large apartment building community projects, as there's still tons of growth there (duh, right?) out in the suburbs of major cities.",

I think it's what happens when the value of real estate gets out of whack with everything else. Reminds me of when I was a kid and the dot-com bubble and how chic city life was perceived. I don't think people are drinking less just the way they're getting their booze has changed. I'm old and out of touch but I don't feel like there's as much \"propagandization\" of dense urban life as there once was. Back when everyone was watching the same shows on 4 networks urban live was portrayed as a holy ideal. As a dude in my 30's its something I deal with for my job until I can get back to my actual home and don't want to live as a wage slave for the \"urban experience\".",

For a $200B bank, every basis point is worth $20 million. So how much do we have to pay for deposits and what does that look like down the rate curve.  The industry in general is somewhat blind on modeling this stuff out in an era where money can move in 5 minutes and price transparency/rate shopping has never been easier.  Last time we had “normal” interest rates like now was before banks even had mobile apps, for perspective, so it’s pretty inexact elasticity modeling.  And gets very nuanced as there’s still billions in our back book parked in savings at super low rates that we don’t want to reprice across the board.  So the range of outcomes/implications is huge. \n\nAfter that and more boring its regulatory impacts.  CFPB is trying to legislate out what remains of overdraft, along with late fees and more price controls on interchange.
