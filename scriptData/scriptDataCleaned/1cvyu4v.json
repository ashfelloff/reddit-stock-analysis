Because now you just use an app. The truth of it is you don't want everyone to know because there are some pretty undesirable people. For example, let's say you got your upside pineapple in your cart, and a single guy approaches. Well, that's definitely not what you want. Or some rando stops by your house, definitely not what you want. I have talked with other couples about ancle braclets, pineapples, white rocks in the yard, and no one does it. Because you want to be in control of who knows you swing. \nNow heres where it gets different were are friends now with a couple we've swung with. We havent hooked up in several years but my wife is friends with the other wife. And swinging never comes up anymore. Theres a saying \"you can make swingers your friends, but don't make your friends swingers.\"\n\nOh, and no one really calls it \"swinging\" anymore. I like the term, but its called the \"Lifestyle\" now.",

To be clear, this example ($400 pineapple) is not exactly in line with the way Japan handles it; but the idea of paying a bit more to get a perfect piece of fruit is appealing in certain cases.\n\nWhile we were there we went and found a market store selling these kinds of fruit, and while they had $100 melons, they also had a lot of much less expensive examples of melons at various prices. We bought a $13 one just to see and I have to say... It was VERY good. Probably the best melon I've ever eaten.\n\nI realized that here I don't often get melons at the supermarket because it's sort of a crap shoot, but if I could pay slightly more for one once in a while and know it was going to be amazing I think I would. That goes for other fruits as well to varying degrees. Just two cents.",
