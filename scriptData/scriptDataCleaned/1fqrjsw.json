It is the easiest to understand for beginner and small caps. You buy at least 1 contract. You choose the contract. You choose it by: you think at ‚Ä¶ date ‚Ä¶ stock will rise to ‚Ä¶ price. You can wait to the end and sell or execute on the expiry date. Or you can sell anytime when you see profit or just make conditional stop loss order. Lets say you buy 1 contract. 1 contract means 100 shares of stock. You only spend the money to buy 1 contract. If you are losing and you do not stoploss you can wait until the last date and it expires woress whoch means you can only lose the money you put in. \nBut if the stock price goes deep in the money which means go to profit area excessively, profit is unlimited.
