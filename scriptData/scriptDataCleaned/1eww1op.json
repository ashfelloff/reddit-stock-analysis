The market for 100% global coverage can’t be that big, relative to the population who already have cell service. Alternatively, I can see this being a value proposition in the long term if satellite service ends up being cheaper for providers than setting up and maintaining cell towers.\n\nThis of course is separate from the conversation on whether or not the executive team can actually pull this off which I’m gathering they have the right people.",
