Better would have been sp500 or something with yearly 7-10% gain on every penny you put in every month etc etc. \n\nIf you want to get a bit more risky for probably some more gains you could always just buy equal ammount every month in the big tech stocks and dont touch em over 5-10 years. I personally would just buy Microsoft, Apple, Google, Tesla, Amazon and dont care at what prices im buying or trying to time it. Just spread it out every month knowing that the market and the money works for me now. \n\nInstead I chose to be a degenerate gambler with Wendys wish complex!",
