  "selftext": "German automaker Volkswagen on Wednesday reported a 42% drop in operating profit in the third quarter.\n\nOperating profit fell to 2.86 billion euros ($3.1 billion), while third quarter sales revenues slipped 0.5% year on year to around 78.5 billion euros.\n\nVehicle sales fell 8.3% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same time period a year earlier, Volkswagen said.\n\nNet liquidity across the Volkswagen Group stood at negative 160.6 billion euros at the end of September 2024, it said. The company‚Äôs net liquidity stood at negative 147.4 billion euros at the end of 2023.\n\nVolkswagen on Wednesday said that its results across the first three quarters of the year were impacted by higher fixed costs and restructuring efforts. Operating profit between January and September of this year was 21% lower on an annual basis.\n\nVolkswagen shares were were last 1.8% higher at 8:19 a.m. London time.\n\nArno Antlitz, chief financial officer and chief operating officer at Volkswagen Group, said the performance reflected a ‚Äúchallenging market environment‚Äù and highlighted the importance of ongoing performance programs across the company.\n\nThe third quarter results come after Volkswagen last month cut its 2024 annual outlook for the second time in just a few months. At the time, the car maker said it was expecting a profit margin of around 5.6% for the year, along with a 0.7% drop in sales to 320 billion euros. Those figures were left unchanged on Wednesday.\n\nVolkswagen has been in hot water in recent months, warning of potential plant closures in Germany and scrapping a slew of labor agreements with local workers in September. The company also said it would end its employment protection agreement, which has been in place for its German workforce since 1994.\n\nOn Monday, the Volkswagen works council said the company‚Äôs management was planning widespread pay cuts and layoffs, as well as the closure or size reduction of all of its German plants.\n\nIn response, Volkswagen reiterated the need for restructuring and said that it would present plans for work cost cuts during a round of negotiations about the labor agreements, which is also taking place on Wednesday.\n\n‚ÄúAhead of the negotiations today, we need to state: the situation is getting more serious,‚Äù Volkswagen‚Äôs chief negotiator Arne Meiswinkel said on Wednesday according to a CNBC translation.\n\nHe added that current developments in the auto industry in Europe and especially in Germany were concerning, as shown by the latest figures from both the company and its competitors.\n\nMeiswinkel reiterated that Volkswagen needed to lower costs and increase its efficiency to be in a position that allows it to invest in its future.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/30/volkswagen-q3-2024-results.html",

              "body": "They are not closing \"all of their German plants\". Please do some research. VW Group has built too much capacity. Say they have capacity to build 20 million vehicles per year, and the demand is only 12 million, why should they have 8 million in capacity just sitting there, costing money? They are not closing down entire operations, they are getting rid of fat. They are thus looking at closing some of their plants, absolutely not all of them. \n\nGerman manufacturing is not on its death bed. German manufacturing is in a transitionary phase, one that smaller countries like Sweden have already gone through successfully. Sweden for instance switched from making generic products that anyone across the world could make, to making the most advanced, high end products that require high level of engineering and R&D. Think of companies like Atlas Copco, AB Volvo, Sandvik, ABB. These businesses still manufacture stuff, but instead of, for instance manufacturing regular steel alloys that any company can make - they focus on making advanced steel alloys such as ultra-high strength steel and what not. Or, in the case of ABB, instead of focusing on making some fuses and basic electrical equipment - they make industrial robots and automation systems. \n\nThere's a reason why Chinese manufacturing still rely on western equipment. Go to a car plant in China and you can see robotics from Swedish/Swiss ABB, or from for instance Japan (Fanuc). Go to Shanghai, as I did last year, and you'll see their fire department is using Scania trucks. Why don't they use their own trucks? They're not good enough yet for critical applications like emergency services. \n\nWestern manufacturing is not dead. However, western manufacturing companies can not compete with generic, basic products - and thus they should focus on the higher end market. This'll inherently lead to downsizing, but the industries will not die, as long as these companies handle these transitions good enough.",
