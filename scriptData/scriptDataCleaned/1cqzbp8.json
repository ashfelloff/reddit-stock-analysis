              "body": "Leases can actually be an advantageous way to buy a car but most people don't know how they work. You are only paying the depreciated value of the car during the lease (and the tax on that depreciated value, not the tax on the full vehicle price). Your buyout price is locked in at the beginning of the contract so if you appraise your car at the end of the lease and it's worth more than your buyout you can sell the car and pocket the equity, or you can keep the car and the dealer still has to sell it to you for that locked in buyout price.\n\nIn CA where registration fees are based off the vehicles value this can save you a ton too. Because you are only paying for tags on a 12k vehicle not a 45k vehicle.",

I could see a jeep or dodge be worth less. But then you can just give the car back and they are stuck with a lower value car than they expected.\n\nAlso you can't pay more than msrp if you plan on buying the lease out. There is a small fee to buy it out. I think subarus is $300. \n\nRich people be leasing cars and trading them in like iPhone. People here are making jokes about leasing being stupid is actually showing their ignorance.\n\nThink about it this way. If you traded in your lease for the newest model 3 times every 3 years you paid for the price of buying the vehicle outright. But you also drove a vehicle under bumper to bumper warranty for 9 years and the latest model to dickmeasure with ur coworkers, family, and friends. If you just financed a car fully you are now driving a 9 yo car out of warranty with quite a bit of miles on it. Most leases are 12-15k a year . So you could have a vehicle over 100k and be looking on buying a new one anyway. It makes sense financially for some people.",

The inefficiency of their vehicles implies they aren't any further along than they were when they started, and they won't be profitable when the ICE money completely stops flowing.
