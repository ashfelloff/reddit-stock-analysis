They're trying the exact same investor storytime again from people who have no business or knowledge of the industry, regulations, safety, and just how capital intensive it is.\n\nIf you  want to bet on energy, pick someone that's actually established with  massive working knowledge and deep pockets of capital like Duke Energy,  not plucky happy-go-lucky hyped-up SPAC non-sense.",
