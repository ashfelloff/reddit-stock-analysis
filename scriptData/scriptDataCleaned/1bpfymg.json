Fed's letting the markets run hot because they know they can't get inflation down to 2% this year without crashing us into recession nor get prices back to 2019 (Even though regards will expect prices to go down when prices NEVER go down in the long run. Bitches don't even remember $0.29 McHamburger Tuesdays in the 90s but acting like they deserve 2019 prices).\n\nAnyways, Fed is relaxing and letting markets rally while inflation picks back up a bit cause the Dems/Biden will whup them if they don't. So we get ATH in basically everything from US indexes, gold, bitcoin, and whatever stupid shit is going up.\n\nDJT SPAC merger and RDDT IPO are just another hint that we're in a 2021 type environment but we don't know how long shit will be good or stay stupid. It's a mix of chicken game and musical chairs. Some say it's sell in may go away, others say when NVDA/MAG7 fall, there are those that believe it's post-election or when inflation picks up, and others believe it's recession when the yield curve un-inverts. All I know is that neither of those two companies make money (in fact they lose money) so eventually fundaments will catchup to them.",
