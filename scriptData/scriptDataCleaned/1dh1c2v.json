  "score": 33,
  "selftext": "With the first shovel of AI - Nvidia, gone. I think the next shovel is going to be the nuclear energy companies powering the datacenters. Which companies are poised to benefit from this trend? Considering the growing demand for efficient and reliable power sources, nuclear energy seems to be a promising solution. Companies like NextEra Energy (NEE), Exelon Corporation (EXC), and Duke Energy (DUK) have significant potential in this space. What are your thoughts? Are there other companies that should be on my radar?",

I see no one in the market planning to do that. \n\nThe scale of the challenge is huge, but that does not make achieving the goal impossible. What makes achieving the goal impossible is a failure to accurately understand the scale of the challenge and the absence of policy proposals that match that scale.”    We have no policy proposal to meet the growing demand for power\n\nMy guess is the people building combined cycle NatGas plants will be most successfull in the near term.",

For decades, we've seen the desire and possibly need, to detach or atleast supplement fossil energy. Nuclear has been the topic of fear and the boogeyman of energy. Through time, education, and refinement of processes, we are learning how safe it is and the public is trending towards seeing through the illusion of catastrophic danger. We've also seen how much money it takes for renewable energy simply to damage wildlife and not yield nearly enough ROI. So there is a demand for nuclear, and soon sentiment may (will) influence policy. The question is when, and will something new and Shiney appear before that time.\n\nApproach:\n\nIt's too far away to tell what companies will end up as the big players. Obviously, some like Cameco is interesting, but as they develop products and processes, could a larger established company like GEV copy/paste and knock them off? Or will a smaller company do something innovative with speed and scale that they gap competition for years? (NVDA method)\n\nI'm lightly playing ETFs for the miners and the producers.
