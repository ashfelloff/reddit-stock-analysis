A huge loss unless they are required to buy fsd?\n\nI don't own Tesla shares and I don't really buy into the pitch but this is generally the Tesla pitch\n\nThe valuation is justified in the same way Apple's is, In 2007 if I told you Apple would become a $2T company from cell phones you'd laugh at me. All the manufacturers combined aren't worth anywhere near that! But what Apple did with the iPhone is create a new vehicle where software could be sold and then they collect what is essentially a tax on that software. Tesla is doing something very similar with cars. So even if they don't own the entire car market in the future car sales will become signifcantly more valuable due now also selling software. \n\nSo the margin would be much higher then 3% but mainly due to selling stuff like self driving software which at scale would be near 100% profit.",

Car prices/battery repair costs will continuously rise.   mass adoption began 2017 battery life expectancy =7-10 years.  Battery replacements will total a vast amount of teslas.  \n\n\n\n2.  Insurance policies for autonomous drivers is going to be nigh impossible to navigate for tesla as they will could be held liable for accidents.   \n\n\n3.  Power required from the grid prohibits run away demand for the product as there simply is not enough power locally or nationally to sustain a population primarily using EVs.   \n\n\n4.  Cobalt and other necessary materials were already rare before.   They will become so rare that it could killed the ev market for all but the rich.   \n\n\n\n\nWe shall see tho.  I'm a moron so if u think I'm wrong then ur probably right.   That's how I see it going tho.  ",
