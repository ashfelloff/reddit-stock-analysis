Then you play as big as you can afford wrt negative tail risk, and you would sit on many millions in no time.\n\nYou know who does that? The algorithms of the big guys, they play each other, and anyone else, for that tiny edge until it is so thin no human can access it anymore.\n\nYou can have an advantage, but you can only have it for a small amount of money, on a small part of the market, and for a short amount of time. You can't have it consistently over a long period or you would be the richest person in the world in no-time.",
