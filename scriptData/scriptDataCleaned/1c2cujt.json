  "selftext": "**Recap of What Happened:** \n\nElon Musk’s latest claim on Twitter was to announce the long-awaited Robotaxi reveal on August 8th, shooting the stock market up early 5% on Monday. \n\nThis announcement was posted on X just after news broke from Reuters that Tesla planned to cancel the long-awaited sub-$30,000 “Model 2” electric vehicle once again in order to focus on the launch of the robotaxi. \n\nElon Musk was quoted responding on X, saying that Reuters was “lying (again),” even though this information came from a legitimate and trustworthy source within the EV company.\n\n**Sides Are Split.**\n\nAlthough Tesla's stock shot up, from what I can tell WSB has had very different reactions to the announcement:\n\n**Bull Viewpoint:**\n\nIf the shift away from the Model 2 is confirmed, some believe that this would dramatically improve Tesla’s current position in the market. If the EV company is so optimistic on its improvements to its autonomous technology that it has decided to solely focus its efforts on releasing the robotaxi, then many analysts see this as a major positive.\n\nTesla is often valued closer to a technology company than an automotive one, and this development surely indicates this will continue to be true. The actual vehicle has never been Tesla’s main asset, but its self-driving robotaxi network, which is just now coming fully into focus, is its main value driver. Very few automotive companies would be able to imitate this product, which would give Tesla very favorable economics.\n\n**Bear Viewpoint:**\n\nOn the other side, many believe Tesla has sacrificed a key portion of its business, labeling the Model 2 as a volume play that would reaccelerate volume and demand for the company, metrics that have really suffered in 2025. \n\nIn order for features such as FSD, or full self-driving, to be as accurate as possible, Tesla needs more data. To get more data, the EV maker needs more cars on the road, hence where the Model 2 comes in.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",

Perhaps it has not been the main \"asset\" driving the stock price though.\n\nThis entire \"robo-taxi\" is dogshit elon hopes and dreams. If the technology for a self-driving robo taxi existed, it would *immediately* be consolidated into self-driving shuttles/vans owned and parked by a dispatching company. Tesla would probably not be the ones doing this because shuttles/vans don't look cool and Elon would veto the project. \n\nNo one wants to rent out their luxury leather seat Tesla for randoms to ride around in all day. Not to mention the garage/parking/charging/dispatch situation would get very dumb from personal garages.\n\nNever happening, just like Tesla FSD.",
