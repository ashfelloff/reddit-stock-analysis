  "score": 2606,
  "selftext": "After reaching its ATH in 2021, the company decided to throw away everything that was successful in the past and replaced it with the exact opposite. \n\nAnd there the ones wondering why activist investors tried to step in and fix what is now an unfixable situation littered with political theatre and back door board blowies.\n\nIt’s a pretty clear FUCK YOU to existing shareholders dumping the stock today who understand this big turnaround plan was because they fucked it all up in the first place and now want a mulligan.\n\nInstead of a corporate spring cleaning that starts with an excel file sorted by top salaries, everybody gets a second chance to put the final touches on ruining a brand name that future generations already don’t give a fuck about.\n\nThis is what happens when everyone’s egos outweigh the shareholders and profitability of the business.\n\nAt this point, just hand it over to Kendall, Roman and Shiv. It will be up to the Greg’s and the Tom’s whether or not it’s still relevant in 20 years. \n\nThe stock for now just secured its ticket to a shitty rest of 2024 and maybe forever.\n\nI mean you really want to bet on a stock that bought Star Wars and didn’t know what to do with it.

Personally — and I have some indirect experience with people at the company — I think they’re saddled with a bunch of aging sluggers that knocked it out of the park for 2-3 decades but are now past their prime and are reluctant to hand the reins to the next generation. And for that matter, its not clear who in the next generation is cut out for leadership, both creatively and in a business sense. And the demographics are changing in a way that’s much more challenging than it was before. When the original little mermaid came out, the country was 80% white. Now its 50%. Thats why Marvel worked so well — it appealed to all demographics. It’s harder to do that now in the political climate.",

That is going to tank for the kids demographic, but probably draw in a mature audience. ",
