These acts weren't done to stop Hamas.\n\nIn addition, israel committed many war crimes, like murder of prisoners of war, torture, looting, use of white phosphorus as a weapon, and some of the stuff I listed in the previous paragraph.\n\nMoreover, israel's International Affairs have called out multiple times on their lies, like when they said a calendar in the hospital was a list of Hamas names, but it was just a calendar, or when the media lied about the beheaded kids.\n\nAlso Hamas treated the hostages better than israel does. There are videos of Israeli soldiers taking off clother from prisoners and hostages, tying them, and hitting them or pissing on them. While Hamas' hostages claimed they were treated okay, fed, and cleaned, and most importantly, not beat up like israel does.\n\nHamas is a terrorist organization that needs to be stopped, but israel isn't some angel trying to bring good to the world. They are a terrorist state just as bad Hamas, if not worse, and also need to be stopped.",

Leadership decapitated, no foreign support, it goes away. Not one person left. Hamas ceases to exist today. \n\nWhat would Netanyahu do tomorrow? What would the Israeli government do differently tomorrow? \n\nWould they still legitimize the illegal creation of 3000 homes in the West Bank, like they did a month ago? Because I think they would. I don't think that suddenly stops. \n\nIsrael will still exist in 50 years. Period. It has all of the power and resources to still exist in 50 years. No amount of pipe-bomb missiles or threats will change that. Doesn't matter if Iran attacks. Israel still exists in 50 years.\n\nWhether the Palestinian people still exist in 50 years and on what scale is what's on the table. They do not have the power or resources to continue. They have fuck all for recognition on the international stage and their entire identity is associated with terrorists. ((So much so that you have to qualify EVERY statement of defense of Palestinians with a \"fuck Hamas\")) \n\nPalestinians are being systemically and intentionally deprived of their livelihoods by the Israeli government. Their destiny is not in their hands. Because even if Hamas ceases to exist today, their homes will still be bulldozed tomorrow. The destiny of the Palestinian people is in the hands of Israel.",

For ease I will describe this per share not per contract as the prices are all per share.  \n  \nThe user bought puts at a strike price of $512.  That means the user is betting that the SPY price will drop below $512.  Technically, a put is a contract that gives the buyer the option  but not obligationto sell stock to the seller of the put at $512.  The seller of the contract charge $.21 or 21 cents per share.\n\nIf the share price goes below $512, the buyer of the put option will be able to buy the shares at market price and then sell them per the contract at $512.  If the share price is above $512, it makes not sense to buy at a higher price and sell at a lower so the buyer of the put options will just forfeit the price they paid (21 cents per share).\n\nSo in this instance, the buyer of the put options paid .21 \\* 3400 = $714 for the 34 contracts.   The person who bought the puts can buy each share at $510.83 and sell at $512.00.  That means they get $1.17 per share or $1.17 \\* 3400 = $3978.\n\nTheir net profit is $3978 - $714 (what they paid for the puts options).\n\nThe break-even price is $512 - $.21 = $511.79.  That means they start making a net profit when the price of the underlying stock falls below $511.79.\n\nNow keep in mind they will exercise the contract at anything below $512 but they don't turn a profit until the stock price goes below $511.79.",
