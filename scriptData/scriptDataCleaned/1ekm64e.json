  "selftext": "1. No one can predict them, or only a very few people can predict them while everyone else is bullish. Verifiably false. Just before the big crash in 2008, a majority of investors surveyed by the AAII sentiment survey thought the market was going to go down over the next six months.\n2. They need a black swan. Not true. There was no black swan for the dot com crash. By the time September 11th happened the market was already down 33% from ATH.\n3. They are earth shattering events. Not true. I was in my twenties during the 2008 crash. I didn't even realized it had happened that's how little it effected my life. Now I'm sure for certain ppl it did have a big effect on their lives, but most of it is just imaginary money finally revealing that it is, in fact, imaginary. \n\nNo company is actually worth a trillion dollars, btw",

I think that the group of affected people grows each decade and this and every following crash will be worse than the last. \nLiving in florida, the number of homes owned by fixed income senior boomers is higher than ever and they are going to get spanked eventually.

They essentially strong armed everyone into putting money in the market or losing it to inflation.  Before 2008, rates had always been enough to at roughly break even and when things got bad would be over the market.
