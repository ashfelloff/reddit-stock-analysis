The pump, I believe, had nothing to do with with either of them and had everything to do with the spac hype. The vision and software had already begun before Toy took his role. Clov was never just a health insurance company- it was always tech, but entered the insurance market to collect data for their AI. Toy, as much as I admire him, did not create CA. He improved it immensely and Clover has benefited from him greatly,  but to disregard everything Clover set in to place before Toy is denying facts and disingenuous.\n\nThe rest of what you said after that is fact ü§ó\n\nEdit",

I guess I'm a CLOVtard, tho when I rarely visit WSB, I feel like I'm Joe Bauers in the year 2505. \n\nUp until Nov 7th, the stock will be especially volatile. My guess is there will be a relentless drive-down before that earnings report & those who buy the dips will be pouncing heavily. It could see $3 again by then but won't be much lower than that. I could also see the CEO & CFO buying another large chunk of shares pre-Nov 7th, so it could possibly hit $5, but it won't stay there. I'm very curious tho, if that ER will be a sell-the-news event or a buy-the-news event. It's a tough prediction, so I'm steering clear of options. I'm not worried, either way, because I'm in it for another 2-3 years. IMO, if it has not sprung by then, it simply won't. NFA, just opinion.",

          "body": "You should read the papers they have published about early diabetes and ckd detection.  They have proven CA isn't just an \"AI\" for a company with nothing to offer.  They have a technology that is proven to improve health outcomes by helping PCPs detect chronic diseases earlier.  This saves both Clover and the government money.  The reason MA plans are under scrutiny is because they have been using coding for conditions that bring them in more revenue, but don't cost them money for treatment.  They have essentially been cheating the government out of money.  This is why the government is phasing  out these codes and implementing v28 which emphasizes better health outcomes.  These changes have caused Humana, CVS, and Humana to lower projections at the same exact time Clover is raising projections.  The same reason Clover has an increasing star rating at the same exact time the average star rating is drastically decreasing.  The same reason Clover has gone from paying physicians to use CA to now having physician groups paying to use it.  None of this is a coincidence and none is the sign of an \"AI\" product that doesn't work.",
