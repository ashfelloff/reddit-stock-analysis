NVDA has increased orders by 25% since last month, and a 50% increase in Blackwell. \n\nSome regard on here posted a news article on that, and I can find it for you. \n\nFrom TSMCs earnings call:\n\n“This time, AI demand is more real than two or three years ago, the company is increasing capacity to find the right balance.” \n“The supply continues to be very, very tight all the way into 2025.”\n\nIn relation to NVDA:\n\nJensen said there was no air gap for the hopper GPU before the Blackwell, and orders have only increased. \n\nThere will be “a ton” of Blackwell revenue this year\n\nHopper GPUs, due to software updates, are over 30% more efficient than a year ago. \n\nAnd the rumor is: 30-40k GB200 36/72NVL servers will be delivered by year-end for a cost of $1.8million/$3million a piece. \n\nOn the low end of that rumor, (all being NVL36 at 30k delivered) that is $54 billion in additional revenue for the next two quarters, or and average of $26 billion per quarter. \n\nThis is in addition to the previous quarter’s revenue of $26 billion, or a 100% growth. \n\nTheir guide was $28 billion. Imagine if they only close 25% of that proposed Blackwell revenue. That’ll be a massive 16% beat, but I think they hit between $35b-$49b for the quarter. \n\nBefore earnings, it’ll run up to $137-142, earnings rip to $150-160, and then over the next 30 days, top out at $210. \n\nIt’s like clockwork, and every major signifier is showcasing that right now. NVDA isn’t affected by stricter China AI regulation, because they already sell a dumbed down H100 to them (the H20)\n\nAnd the president of Taiwan has already said they will pay for defense if Trump requires it. \n\nThe only reason Friday continued red was the outage.
