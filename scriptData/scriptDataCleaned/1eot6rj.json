Homie don't play that anymore. We're talking about shares. Yes, those things. Monday 8/5, I'm having breakfast at Lirica on Navy Pier - an overpriced and remarkably mediocre chimichurri steak and eggs. I get an alert - PLTR is down big. I missed some of the run-up to $28 last month, and I was tracking this in anticipation of the upcoming ER on 8/6. It broke $22 on the downside and started to bounce quickly. I set some limit orders but kept on missing. First, at $22, then $22.25 and $22.50. I never place market orders, and I never chase an upswing that I miss on 3 tries. But I felt I had to this time. I had a good feeling about earnings the next day and I wanted in. I set a limit order 25c above market and it hit at $22.68 and $22.69. 30,000 shares locked in. I checked the option chain on PLTR immediately afterwards and saw some fat premiums for weeklies since we are in an earnings week. The plan was simple: I was going to sell 300 calls at $26 and let theta burn these premiums right after earnings. I had the order entered on the Etrade app. Gratefully, I did not submit. Something told me it was going to blow right through my strike and kill my upside. And it did. Earnings took PLTR past $28 but it settled down in the $26-27 range. Near the top of that range, I did get a little restless and tried to sell 300 calls at $31. Only 131 contracts hit, and when they dropped from 21c to 9c, I collected my profit. A modest intraday gain of $1548. Now here's where I got stupid. It looked pretty clear to me that PLTR was rangebound 26-27, maybe 28 max. No fucking way it was going to clear $29. So, I sold 300 calls at 29. An hour later, it was blowing past 28 and a day later it closed at 30. At 3:17am 8/10, my calls were assigned. 30,000 shares called away. Oh well. Still, a $194K profit in 1 week. +\\~28% on \\*shares\\*. I'll call this a good week.\n\nTLDR: I bought shares of PLTR and generated the annual salary of a pediatrician in 5 days.\n\n",
