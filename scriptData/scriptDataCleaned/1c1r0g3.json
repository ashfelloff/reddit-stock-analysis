Almost lost my bag due to my $HOOD yolo, so had to cut that and jump into rising tides and positive price momentum.\n\nBrief dd since detailed ones turn stocks upside down:\n\n* Achieved first profitable quartet last earnings report, has consistently beat earnings expectations for multiple quarters, and SOFI historically has a delayed upward bounce after earnings beats\n* Recently oversold due to complex financial changes / maneuvering\n* Several fundamental investment firms value the stock much higher (\"fair value\" is around $11)\n* Technically under 3 month moving averages, and edging to cross over ;)\n* The stock bottomed for FY24 a couple months ago and is going up üöÄ pivot point?\n* Also my portfolio created a \"W\" pattern after buying in, which is obviously a bull signal for upcoming \"Wins\"\n* This is my first time in $SOFI, so I'm not a bag holder, yet...\n\nCome at me bro...earnings call set for 04/29/2024 pre-market.\n\np.s. how do you guys guess / tell when ppl use ChatGPT?\n\n[Doubled down with more short-term call options on the CPI dip - currently 100&#37; in, and down about $2K since opening the positions](https://preview.redd.it/88qhsml14xtc1.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61a64ebd63eb5da71e24552cd6e14b0f66d306c2)",
