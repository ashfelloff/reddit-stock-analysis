Their over-optimism (which is never-ending) also NEVER ends up panning out when it comes to Fed action, yet it is this over-optimism that leads them to being wrong. the market is poised on pins and needles and ready to explode at the first hint of any dovish Fed action. And THIS is precisely what keeps the numbers going up, which means the Fed keeps rates higher longer. And unless Powell is 100% full of shit, the Fed will remove hawkish until the market isn‚Äôt a powder keg ready to explode at the drop of a hat. Therefore, anyone who isn‚Äôt a moron would have been able to se that there weren‚Äôt going to be 7 rate cuts in 2024, and this meme is obviously making fun of those morons who DID think that (and lost money too lol)",
