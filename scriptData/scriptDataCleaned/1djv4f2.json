I know that people spend a lot of money on it, but after regular costs, ridiculous taxes and regulations, and tons of competition, it seems like a money incinerator from an investing point of view. It's such an obvious investment thesis that everyone who stumbles upon it thinks that they're a genius but pretty much everyone is losing money on it. I check in on a few of these stocks every once in a while, trying to see if I can spot a bottom, but all they seem to do is lose money.",
