  "selftext": "On September 18, 2007, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high on October 9, 2007, which would not be matched again until March 2013 in recovery from the Great Financial Crisis.\n\nOn September 18, 2024, the Fed made a 50bps rate cut, greater than expected, despite reasonably good economic data. Markets rallied for about 3 weeks, and SPX closed at an all-time high today, October 9, 2024.\n\nThis is not financial advice nearly as much as it is anecdotal evidence that we live in the Matrix.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\nThe Sahm rule stood at only 17bps as of the unemployment reading of September 2007, as opposed to 50bps in September 2024. Albeit, unemployment was generally higher right around 4.6-4.7% between late 2006-2007. Additionally, the part-time gig economy is MASSIVE today compared to 2007 (but BLS still counts that as not ‚Äúunemployed‚Äù)\n\nThe VIX was hovering between 16-18 during the October 2007 market peak, compared to 20-22 today.\n\nYear-over-year CPI change from December 2006 to December 2007 was 4.1%, so inflation was NOT dead when the Fed started their easing cycle. The bond market is implying a similar problem in today‚Äôs economy with increasing US treasury yields, although current YoY CPI readings are generally lower today than in 2007.\n\nUnlike 2007, this is an election year, and I operate under the assumption that all current BLS statistics are not just cooked, but deep fried.\n\nEDIT: Going to try to address some of the repeated comments I‚Äôm seeing here.\n\n‚ÄúPAST PERFORMANCE DOESN‚ÄôT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS‚Äù\n\nOf course, the main point of this post was to highlight the similarities in timelines between today and 17 years ago. Our economic situation is MASSIVELY different, although I‚Äôd argue still weak.\n\n‚ÄúBUT THERE‚ÄôS NO SUBPRIME CRISIS‚Äù\n\nRight, probably not. However, we still have skyrocketing consumer credit defaults paired with an abysmally low personal savings rate. Additionally, we have something along the lines of $1 trillion CRE loans with balloon payments or adjustable rates kicking in within the next 6 months, on a bunch of loans that are underwater with their respective banks, and many of which have been collateralized into CLOs and sold both domestically and internationally. I still think there will be some blood in the water.\n\nAdditionally, the median house price to median income ratio is HIGHER today than it was at its 2007-2008 absolute peak, so I‚Äôd still argue that real estate has been over-speculated.\n\n‚ÄúTHE GOVERNMENT WON‚ÄôT LET THE MARKET CRASH DURING AN ELECTION YEAR‚Äù\n\nProbably not! In fact, there‚Äôs a very real scenario where the Fed steps in with hyper-QE if things hit the fan. Congress is scheduled to meet in January 2025 to negotiate the current US debt ceiling, and the US frankly can‚Äôt afford a recession right now - they need those tax dollars. Hyperinflation to erode the real value of the US debt and prop up the markets is highly plausible IMO.\n\n‚ÄúDUMB BER‚Äù\n\nDumb bol.\n\n‚ÄúPOSITIONS OR BAN‚Äù\n\nI‚Äôm short term bullish on bonds. TLT just bounced off its 200 SMA twice and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see investors eat up those nice high yields if earnings season goes sour. I have 6 figures on TLT calls expiring post-election, I‚Äôm gonna wait on SPX plays until the election is over.\n\n**TLDR: The Fed cut rates on the exact same date (9/18) in 2007 as 2024, and SPX hit an all-time high on the exact same date (10/9) in 2007 as 2024, except it was a massive crash afterwards in 2007.

So they put groceries, car repairs, basic home maintenance, travel because they were tired of being cooped up during COVID, etc on credit cards and then took HELOCs at 7-10% in 2023-24 because their home value had increased but that increased their LTV. In the event of a slowdown or recession, home prices will come back down and could create negative equity, especially in those that took out the max available loans. Many people think that it won't matter if we have a recession or slowdown because those trying to buy a house have reserves saved up and interest rates fall, but most will probably use those savings to pay for everyday expenses as one or both incomes are lost. I'm not a Doom and gloom guy and don't think it will be GFC 2.0, but I don't see the economy being able to limp along on the back of real estate at new low interest rates.",

In January of 2009 I opened a 401k at work with the maximum allowable match. I also opened it E-Trade account and threw a few bucks at some bedrock companies trading at their 52 week lows. I didn't have the patience to hold as long as I should, but I remember it being somebody easiest money I ever made. My 401k balance is healthy to this day I think largely because of that timing.

They were the \"world‚Äôs factory,\" but now they‚Äôre struggling because we don‚Äôt have the money to buy their stuff.\n* **AI Hype Skepticism**: The AI productivity boost feels premature, and Altman rushing his IPO? Makes you wonder why, right?\n* **NFP Data Weakness**: Adjusting nonfarm payroll data for last year‚Äôs seasonal factors shows job growth is overstated‚Äî150k instead of 240k. Are they cooking the books? Maybe not, but those tweaks sure feel like it.\n* **Bond Yield Red Flags**: As you pointed out, the 2-year bond yield is reacting exactly like it did before the 2008 crash.\n\nWhat else can I say?

      "body": "The parallels between 2007 and 2024 are striking, but it‚Äôs critical to recognize that while history echoes, it doesn't repeat in the same way. Yes, the Fed‚Äôs 50bps rate cut in September 2024 has driven markets to fresh highs, much like 2007, but the context around these moves is vastly different.\n\nIn the labor market, we're seeing turbulence, particularly in tech, where layoffs have become increasingly frequent. However, we‚Äôre not facing the same systemic risks as we did in 2007. Back then, the cracks in the foundation‚Äîparticularly in housing and credit‚Äîwere already severe. Today, there are vulnerabilities like consumer credit defaults and shaky commercial real estate, but the tech layoffs are more a reflection of sector-specific restructuring than a signal of an impending financial crisis.\n\nThe housing market, too, looks precarious. Prices are outpacing incomes at a level we didn‚Äôt even see in 2007. However, unlike then, we aren‚Äôt dealing with a subprime mortgage collapse, even if over-leveraged commercial real estate could pose a similar systemic risk if those balloon payments start to hit.\n\nIt‚Äôs also important to remember that monetary policy and the broader economic environment are significantly different. The Fed has more tools at its disposal today, and in an election year, we could very well see aggressive moves to prevent a crash. The specter of quantitative easing looms large. However, if the market does falter, we will rebuild, rehire, and reinvest. The resilience of the U.S. economy has been proven time and again.\n\nWhile consumer sentiment is wary and some are praying for a crash, we are far from a repeat of 2007. There will be volatility‚Äîmarkets always cycle‚Äîbut our response today will be more measured and informed.",
