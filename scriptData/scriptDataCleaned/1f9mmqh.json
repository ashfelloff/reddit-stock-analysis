Meanwhile, ACH is regulated to shit by the fed and a bunch of banks, but somehow Visa and Mastercard get to slip by and have profit margins of 50%. \n\nYou'd think with the rise of the internet their influence would've been significantly reduced by competitors, but it appears to only get stronger by the year.

Some upstart like the ones OP is hypothesizing about aren't really going to introduce some innovation that'll help the business. The closest things are these fintechs that really just brand cards and function as a way for businesses to get more customers on that side of things, and crypto, which has accomplished nothing and is vaporware.",

      "body": "It’s very surprising, and it’s the reason I’ve (incorrectly) stayed out of MA/V for the last 20 years.\n\nAll they really do is operate a private, secure network.  At one time that was amazing, and existential.\n\nTheir long-standing advantage was in having that network reach every country and city and town and shop.  End point terminals could send rudimentary messages back and forth to a central decision hub.  They offer some basic functions and policies, and for that, they get to charge about one percent on every credit card transaction in the world.   \n\nBut once the internet and strong encryption became equally pervasive, that could basically have ended the importance of Visa/Mastercard’s key element: their secure network.\n\nThe processing functions and policies and clearing are not that special.  Any reasonably adept organization of scale could do the same function.  And such an organization might even have done it with more favorable policies, or at a cheaper price.\n\nIt always struck me as something Google or Apple could easily do, layering a virtual private network across the global internet, and using their scale to ensure the processing and clearing function.  I imagined one of them announcing they would provide the exact functions of MA/V, but at one-tenth of a percent instead.\n\nYou ask how these two have avoided that kind of asteroid that people in the industry could have foreseen.  Well one way has been in their velvet gloves approach to each other and in allying to share the network and all policies.  In reality it’s really Eurocard plus MasterCard plus Visa, aka EMV.  They set and control payment standards worldwide.  The duopoly presents as an illusion of competition and then they each get to operate as a virtual monopoly.  \n\nTo me, a key point was when Apple entered the payment space.  Had Steve Jobs been involved, he would have undoubtedly done the more disruptive thing and created an Apple equivalent to MA/V.  Yes, it would have stirred their lobbyists to fight back, but he would have done what he always did before.\n\nInstead, his less bold and non-innovative successors took the laziest, easiest path and just became a standard, old fashioned brand partner with a bank.  They owned nothing.  They just let legacy banks runs cards through iPhones.  Instead of being disruptive to MA/V, they helped extend and enshrine them.\n\nOver the decades there were other things.  By locking out all competition with their E/M/V alliance, they could set proprietary standards for how internet commerce would function, debit cards, how NFC would be implemented, how chip cards would be implemented, and so on.  \n\nBut to me, the point when they were most vulnerable, and the most viable disruptor (Apple) just voluntarily conceding to them, that is what has given them an extra and unearned whole generation of monopoly power.  Today, Apple or Google or Microsoft would not be viable disruptors because they’d be mired by complaints of their own anti-trust tendencies.  Younger people might not realize it, but in their earlier times, each of these companies was kind of beloved by consumers.  They were seen as upstarts, providing amazing new innovations every week, at little to no direct cost.  Obviously that sentiment is gone, and I’m not sure there’s anyone or anything today that matches that same mood.",

Note that this money is that of bank. I can lock the card immediately and have new card shipped overnight. Whole process takes 30 seconds.\n\nFor UPI, reversal of unauthorized transaction are bank initiated. So you have to contact the bank to first start the investigation, and then the payments are reverted later. Note that this is my money, so if I was in need of my money immediately, a bit of an issue. Also, if your aadhar gets leaked, it is basically game over. That is US equivalent of using SSN to access individual credit card (both Aadhar and SSN have dogshit security infrastructure). So just resetting PIN to prevent future unauthorized transaction is somewhat unreliable. Very different than locking card and getting brand new number.\n\nSo to say India is ahead and US is behind is somewhat deceptive.

      "body": "Visa and Mastercard, as American companies, benefit indirectly from the global financial structure that supports the US dollar's dominance, and keeps any non US competition out of the game.\n\n1. **SWIFT Integration and Global Financial System**: While Visa and Mastercard aren’t directly integrated into the SWIFT system (which facilitates cross-border payments between banks), they operate within the same global financial ecosystem. The dominance of the USD in international trade and finance strengthens the position of US-based financial networks like Visa and Mastercard who are locally integrated and share/exchange staff with the institutions that manages the dollar. The personel exchange between VISA, MASTERCARD, The US Federal Reserve, The US Treasury and the Bureau of the Fiscal Service is actually envouraged. Global reliance on the dollar for trade and commerce indirectly supports these companies because they facilitate payments in USD through credit card transactions globally.\n2. **Petrodollar and USD Dominance**: The US dollar’s position as the world's reserve currency—thanks largely to the petrodollar system—creates an environment where US financial institutions are central players in the global economy. Visa and Mastercard’s dominance is bolstered by the fact that a large percentage of global transactions are settled in USD. As long as the US dollar remains the primary currency for international trade, especially in critical sectors like oil and energy, US financial institutions (including Visa and Mastercard) have an advantage plus their staff integration as pointed out in point 1.\n3. **US Government and Financial Interests**: The US government benefits from the dominance of the USD and US-based financial institutions in maintaining global economic power. While Visa and Mastercard are private companies, their role in facilitating global commerce aligns with US interests in maintaining economic and financial dominance. This manifest in organic regulatory support, trade policies, or geopolitical strategies that, boosts American Financial companies by default, and help sustain the environment in which they thrive.\n4. **Credit Rating Agencies and Financial Dominance**: The largest credit rating agencies (Moody’s, S&P, Fitch) are all American, and their assessments of creditworthiness play a significant role in shaping perceptions of national and corporate risk. The US benefits from this, as US government debt is often seen as a safe haven despite its massive levels of debt, in part because of the trust in the USD as the world’s reserve currency. The fact that the US hasn’t been downgraded severely despite its debt issues is influenced by this broader confidence in the USD and the global reliance on US financial systems.\n5. **US Financial Power and Global Influence**: Visa and Mastercard, along with credit rating agencies, benefit from a global financial architecture where the US holds significant influence. This includes control over global institutions, regulatory frameworks, and trade systems that uphold US economic dominance. The US’s ability to impose sanctions through financial mechanisms (often cutting off access to Visa, Mastercard, or SWIFT) demonstrates the global influence these companies wield on behalf of US financial power.\n\nIn essence, Visa and Mastercard's success is not just a result of their business models and network effects but is also tied to the larger role that the US plays in the global financial system. The dominance of the USD, the strategic role of the petrodollar, and the influence of US financial institutions all indirectly reinforce the position of Visa and Mastercard on the global stage. So make no mistake. The US government , which is the largest corporation in America with an estimated Market Cap of about 30 Trillion USD has one single purpose. Promote USA beyond its borders to generate revenue for American companies. If they dont create a fertile environment for American companies to thrive whether it is via supporting covert operations even against corporate entities or even creating monopolies of american products outside the USA , then they are not doing their job.",

Visa laughed it off and said, \"Too bad, just push it off on your customers like the rest of the corporations.\" Kroger said no. If you don't lower the percentage, then we'll stop allowing customers to use your cards in our stores. Visa tried to call them on what they thought was a bluff, but Kroger implemented it in their Smith's stores in Utah and Nevada. Visa took a huge hit and ended up reducing the percentage like Kroger wanted because the plan was to go across all of Krogers chain stores (Ralph's, Food4Less, Dillon, etc) they just started at Smith's. Visa couldn't tolerate such a loss due to the fact Kroger is one of the top 3 grocery chains in America; like all of the stores nor accepting Visa would result in a huge decline of Visa cards all together. \n\nAnyways it takes a huge corporation to fight a huge corporation, but it's funny when they do!",
