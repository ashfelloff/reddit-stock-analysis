  "selftext": "Payrolls downward revisions of 818,000 fewer jobs (an average of 68,167 fewer net jobs added per month) created between April 2023 and March 2024 put great pressure on the Fed to go down either 25 to 50 basis points on September 17th and 18th as the previous rosy picture of employment was overblown.\n\nThis will likely cause Powell to be less hawkish on the outlook and the Fed has to pivot speedier to ensure a soft landing instead of a recession.\n\nCurrently, there is a 69.5% likelihood of a 25 basis-points interest rate cut by the Fed in September, with a 30.5% chance of a super-sized 50 bps cut.  It is 69.5% +30.5% = 100% of probable rate cut in September, and the revision should only increase the 50 bps of 30.5% even higher.\n\nThis is ahead of Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole economic symposium on Friday\n\nThis revision should not spook the market as Goldman Sachs already expected 600,000 to 1 million fewer jobs created between April 2023 and March 2024.",

If we assume the labor market has decelerated since March 2024, and that the \"breakeven\" nonfarm payroll is around 100k historically, that means there's less \"runway\" for the soft landing, or the no landing scenario that the market has been pricing for months now.\n\nSept cut has already been confirmed since last week, especially when the hawks like Kashkari and Bostic came out and said open to rate cut in Sept. Don't think they're gonna start with a 50 basis point cut though because they will have a lot of hawks dissent on that decision. Remember in Mar 2022 when it was obvious they were late to the inflation fight, and they still started with 25 basis point hike. So if your first decision to cut just a month before an election has a lot of committee members dissent, that's just an easy target for either Trump or Harris to accuse the Fed of playing politics.",

If the Fed \\_was\\_ accounting for lagging data, they would have cut at least one meeting ago, if not two.

That means if they go big and hit 50 in September, still restrictive, hit 50 again the next time, still restrictive, hit 50 again, now we might be getting close to neutral but I think neutral is probably still a little bit lower, there's a ongoing debate where the neutral rate is right now but it's somewhere between 3 and 4% and quickly trending down with inflation. I think there's the possibility if this continues to get worse that we might see the Fed do a reverse of what they did raising rates and if that's the case, those of you holding a good deal of TLT are going to be smiling",
