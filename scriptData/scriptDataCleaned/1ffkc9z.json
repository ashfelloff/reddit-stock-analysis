Then you will have money and\nyou will be happy.”\nAnd so the boy climbed up the\ntree and gathered her apples\nand carried them away.\nAnd the tree was happy.\nBut the boy stayed away for a long time....\nand the tree was sad.\nAnd then one day the boy came back\nand the tree shook with joy\nand she said, “Come, Boy, climb up my trunk\nand swing from my branches and be happy.”\n“I am too busy to climb trees,” said the boy.\n“I want a house to keep me warm,” he said.\n“I want a wife and I want children,\nand so I need a house.\nCan you give me a house ?”\n“ I have no house,” said the tree.\n“The forest is my house,\nbut you may cut off\nmy branches and build a\nhouse. Then you will be happy.”\n\nAnd so the boy cut off her branches\nand carried them away\nto build his house.\nAnd the tree was happy.\nBut the boy stayed away for a long time.\nAnd when he came back,\nthe tree was so happy\nshe could hardly speak.\n“Come, Boy,” she whispered,\n“come and play.”\n“I am too old and sad to play,”\nsaid the boy.\n“I want a boat that will\ntake me far away from here.\nCan you give me a boat?”\n“Cut down my trunk\nand make a boat,” said the tree.\n“Then you can sail away...\nand be happy.”\nAnd so the boy cut down her trunk\nand made a boat and sailed away.\nAnd the tree was happy\n... but not really.\n\nAnd after a long time\nthe boy came back again.\n“I am sorry, Boy,”\nsaid the tree,” but I have nothing\nleft to give you -\nMy apples are gone.”\n“My teeth are too weak\nfor apples,” said the boy.\n“My branches are gone,”\nsaid the tree. “ You\ncannot swing on them - “\n“I am too old to swing\non branches,” said the boy.\n“My trunk is gone, “ said the tree.\n“You cannot climb - “\n“I am too tired to climb” said the boy.\n“I am sorry,” sighed the tree.\n“I wish that I could give you something....\nbut I have nothing left.\nI am just an old stump.\nI am sorry....”\n“I don’t need very much now,” said the boy.\n“just a quiet place to sit and rest.\nI am very tired.”\n“Well,” said the tree, straightening\nherself up as much as she could,\n“well, an old stump is good for sitting and resting\nCome, Boy, sit down.

They see soft demand in China, which should've been a given with their current economy and push to EVs etc. OPEC is hurting for money again, so they're going to have to increase production again regardless.
