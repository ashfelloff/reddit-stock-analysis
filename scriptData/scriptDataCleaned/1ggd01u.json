Even more complex jobs think construction or military etc are performed by people who aren't really much more aware or intelligent just more disciplined and thus focused, the gap here rests in functional robotics (Musk already gets this). \n\nSo basically, the most productive use of AI would be to make about 80% of all human professions obsolete. The problem with that as much as I'd enjoy the more efficient services, is that the rich rely on that 80% of humanity to keep making very bad decisions when they don't have an algorithm to operate by, thus continuing their own enrichment. \n\nThat's the delicious irony of our civilization, that most of humanity isn't very useful objectively and would not survive under their own power, but they always serve the Very useful subjective purpose of serving the elite of the era.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how adding AI to that dynamic plays out over time.\n\nThe most positive path I imagine is something a long the lines of Neuralink or however thats spelled (musk again) where in theory you could implant a.i./tech into an otherwise average human and turn them into a smart person who makes good decisions.\n\nOr to put it another way Artificial Intelligence rather than Algorithmic Intelligence. \n\nThat would make humanity exponentially more productive in theory, but smart people don't typically enslave themselves, so that creates another ironic deadend.\n\nInteresting times indeed.",
