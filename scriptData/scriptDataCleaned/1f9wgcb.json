Keep experimenting though, that’s how you learn.",

THE ACTUAL returns would have been almost the same as the s&p, but with the tax on profits owning the s&p would have been better from a management point: we start in 1981 with IBM in top spot and a market cap of 34.6 bn\n\nToday the top spot is apple with 3,400 bn circa\n\nSo we went from 34.6 to 3400 in 43 years\n\nSo if we held this hypothetical sp1 switching exactly when the companies take top spot it wouldn’t do better than a 11.25% cagr before taxes, dividends and transaction costs( which I personally ignored because my broker has zero commissions). \n\n\nHowever I don’t know where you got your data from as some of the yearly returns seem WAY too low.\n AAPL became the biggest market cap stock in 2012 and held it until 2018: your returns would have been  +32.59%; +8.06%; +40.62%; -3%; +12.48%; +48.48%; -5.39%.",
