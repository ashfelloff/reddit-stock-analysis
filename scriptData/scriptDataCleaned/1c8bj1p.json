      "body": "Oh hush‚Ä¶.many have done more with less lol.\n\nYou need to stop being a leader or trendsetter and start being a follower.\n\n3 great examples this week: ARM, NVDA, SMCI. All 3 had at least 1 bloody day (arm had 2-3!).\n\nWhen the sell off happens, stop taking a look at what the option was the day before. Yeah a 50,000% gain is SEXY AF, but you know what else is? Hopping in when it‚Äôs got this vortex of doom in the middle or first third, riding it down, setting a stop loss and seeing what happens.\n\nOn the flip side, look at MARA today or AXP. They jumped, kept moving up, don‚Äôt immediately think it‚Äôs gonna reverse and let it ride a little bit.\n\nPlenty of ways to make 20-100% in literally an hour.\n\nI missed out on this 3 times today. Wasn‚Äôt touching  ARM but planned entry around 9:45\n\n1) tried HOOD 17c 4/19, it was $0.09 and volume wasn‚Äôt large enough for me so I waffled and‚Ä¶.like 30 minutes later it was $0.25+. Easy double+\n\n2) pissed I didn‚Äôt get those HOODy calls, I moved to QQQ. This was a lucky play because I grabbed $442c 4/19 and sold almost at the peak. 7 minutes later 23% gain.\n\n3) saw SMCI and had a bid or two on puts between 830-850 but spread was big. Fuck I wish they filled so that‚Äôs a miss\n\n4) SPY reversals are almost guaranteed between 12:40 and 1:15 start. I missed the 12:40 and was miffed it fell that much in the AM but targeted $498c 4/19. Told myself I got lucky on #2 don‚Äôt press it and boom within 45 minutes this was up like 150%.\n\nAm I bummed I missed out on 1 3 and 4? Yeah you bet my account would‚Äôve been bussing today!\n\nBut I got #2, yeah I made money on QQQ calls today of all days. So I count it as a W. \n\nMoral of the story is this market is fucked up. And since you‚Äôre playing options time in the market is just as important as timing the market. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to hold contracts for very long due to volatility, could help you but also could totally F you sideways. \n\nTo give yourself some confidence, look to play options in the coming week with one of 2 approaches: contacts expiring no sooner than 5/3 or contract entry exit occurring within the same day. The benefit of the ‚Äúlonger‚Äù options is you can fuck up and not lose it all. Target close to ATM and get your 20% gains, get some momentum, get some confidence, but also know when you aren‚Äôt feeling confident and TAKE A BREAK. I hit my PDT limit and just bought some boring stuff, actual stocks, just so I wouldn‚Äôt end up holding contracts over the weekend cuz Lordy only knows what‚Äôll happen the next few days.\n\nBest of luck bruv",
