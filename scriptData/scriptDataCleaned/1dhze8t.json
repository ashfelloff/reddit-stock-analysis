Check my previous detailed DD right here:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/112bmqe/how\\_asts\\_will\\_become\\_one\\_of\\_the\\_best\\_investments/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/112bmqe/how_asts_will_become_one_of_the_best_investments/)\n\nThere are many more high level DDs on why ASTS is a screaming buy but here's the TLDR for those lacking basic browsing skills:\n\n1. AT&T and Google are onboard\n2. Verizon is onboard\n3. Vodafone is onboard (early investor)\n4. FirstNET is most likely onboard (check AST sub for most recent tweets)\n5. 5 BB1 satellite launch happening in 2-3 months\n6. 25% of float is currently short and ALL are underwater since price is rocketing. Talk about rock and hard place.\n\nLike everyone here I've had my fair share of laughs around ASTS but this is no longer a joke\n\nPositions or ban:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/kekur151657d1.png?width=1090&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea242edcf227077186889abed7300b05cb7b213a\n\nDisclaimer: None of this is financial advice.

It would take something truly catastrophic to fall under $4 in six months so having the calls vs the shares doesn't really help your downside risk.  The biggest upside happens 5-6 years from now not in the next 6 months.  If you want to pat yourself on the back and sell for a huge profit that option is available to you and you don't have to worry about a possible negative catalyst like a delay between now and then.  At the very least I'd think about whether or not you want the shares from those calls or not.",

MNO do not have to build and maintain infrastructure in remote areas, AST do not have to advertise, acquire and manage end users as costumers, they just collect their share of the revenue from MNO with little operational cost (~90% gross margins).\n\nSay ASTS gets to 500M subscribers through their MNO partners worldwide, and get $2 per month per susriber, your are looking at 12B revenue with less than 1B costs. Not saying 500M subscribers will happen but you get the picture. \n\nIn reality there will be too much demand for the satellites capacity for a long time, especially if Dod / firstnet is involved on top of MNO subscribers. But I guess that's a good problem to have.\n\nThis is a new market and business model. But very little doubt that space broadband will be part of the future of mobile telecommunications.
