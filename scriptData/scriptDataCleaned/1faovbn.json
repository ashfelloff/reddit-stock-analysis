You lose a percentage, but if you have your risk reward ratio and risk management dialed in you can leverage your wins to more than cover your losses. No one can predict the market 100% so any decent trader factors in losing with tools like stop losses.\n\nExample:\n-Bought 50 puts at .37, set stop loss at .25.\n\n-If stock moves enough that option value drops to .25 he sells for a roughly 33% loss. Instead of losing the whole 1850 he loses 600. \n\nItâ€™s especially helpful if youâ€™re watching other stocks/news/whatever, that way you donâ€™t have to keep jumping back if the market moves against you.

Now I know past performance doesnâ€™t dictate future performance but if you look at the past 5 years of SPY in september the price went down. Now look at a few other S&P500 companies. For the most part you see the same thing. Itâ€™s not guaranteed but itâ€™s a damn good guess that this year will be no different.\n\nNext look at the news. Nvidia earnings wasnâ€™t that great for the big wigs and theyâ€™re getting investigated by DOJ. SPY has a good amount invested into the company so if Nvidia drops you can expect SPY to drop too. \n\nLastly (take this with a grain of salt), something I noticed during the trading day is if u look at nvidia stock price curve and another big company like google or amazon, they look almost identical. I heard a few times on here that nvidia is propping up the entire market and Iâ€™m not sure how or why that is or even if itâ€™s true but I used this idea last week with apple and profit 1k. I used it yesterday with amazon and made another 1k (I wish I had more capital to useðŸ˜­). This could all be in my head and Iâ€™m missing something but it worksâ€¦.. for now\n\nNot financial advice",
