  "selftext": "Driverless cars are speeding onto America’s streets, but whether the public will trust robotaxis remains an open question. \n\nNearly two-thirds of Americans said they would not want to ride in a driverless passenger vehicle if they had the opportunity, according to a Pew Research Center Survey. That’s because residents in cities that have yet to experience robotaxis remain unfamiliar with the technology while those in cities with driverless cabs have not yet forgotten about high-profile accidents involving other companies, like GM-owned Cruise. \n\nNow Tesla, the loudest and most bullish self-driving proponent of them all, is due to unveil its long-awaited robotaxi after years of unfulfilled promises.\n\nThe company’s existing autonomous driving technology, where a human is still at the wheel, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and multiple lawsuits after hundreds of crashes. Experts say a great presentation from CEO Elon Musk won’t guarantee a safe robotaxi network.\n\nTesla’s upcoming robotaxi launch threatens to throw the whole autonomous vehicle space off course. \n\nAlphabet-owned Waymo is the leader in the space, with the company claiming it has notched more than 22 million driverless miles. It has proven that there is strong consumer demand, with weekly paid rides in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Austin doubling in just a couple months. And Waymo has worked on building its reputation, launching an online safety hub with data arguing that its cars are safer than human drivers.\n\nBesides Tesla, other competitors are also looking to jump into the race.\n\nAmazon says it is getting ready to roll out its fleet of Zoox cars, and Cruise is resuming operations after a 2023 accident led regulators to ground the fleet. Wall Street is already looking ahead to a driverless future, with one analyst arguing that if it hadn’t been for generative AI, 2024 would have been the year of the robotaxi. \n\nAs driverless networks scale, one of the fiercest debates is whether ride-sharing will survive. Robotaxis may cause consumers to question if they really want to book an Uber or Lyft and talk to a stranger, sit in someone else’s car and tip a human if there is a driverless alternative. Uber has hedged its bets by inking high-profile deals with autonomous vehicle companies, but it’s unclear how long those partnerships will last.",

Which is quite fascinating, as people really are ready to pay for such options more.\nAs soon as they start making rides to / from the airport it will be a real deal breaker as comfort in longer rides is much more valuable than 15min city hop.\n\n\n[proof with screenshots ](https://imgur.com/a/dmODCCz)",

Because that will determine if it's actually a viable business model or just another  silicon valley solution in search of a problem.\n\n\nMy guess is it's not. Drivers aren't the only cost to a taxi business and do a lot of stuff you take for granted (cleaning, arranging servicing and off duty storage etc). Self driving taxis remove the driver cost but then add in a whole bunch of extra costs - cleaners, fleet managers etc - plus the rather sizable costs of the extra hardware plus software and dev costs. If it's viable at all it would only be at huge scale with immense capital costs. With the inevitable low margins it's hard to see who that business would appeal to.\n\n\nThe benefit to the customer is also marginal. Is your driverless taxi offering your a significantly better service or outcome than a drivered one? No. They both get you to where you want to go for a small amount of money. That's it.\n\n\nAnd for cities they will simply make congestion even worse. America doesn't want to hear this but the solution for moving large numbers of people around quickly and cheaply is more public transport and fewer cars (of any kind).",

Looking at your phone or reaching for something will trigger the nag, but it's getting better on tracking driver awareness. \n\nI still saw some issues with regressions on managing staying in the lane on mountain curves with this update, but most things are far improved. That was a big regression the couple times it happened. \n\nI have FSD HW3 which is nearing end of life, but Tesla will be capable of far more advanced computations with HW5 for the robotaxi. While I know my car will never be driverless, Tesla is clawing closer and closer to getting ready for driverless robotaxis. That's now the direction they are prioritizing over expanding manufacturing facilities. \n\n!remindme in 2'years, I think they will have robotaxis beginning operations by then, and that will be able to scale up massively.",

Taxi's are never going to replace car ownership like some who live in an urban bubble insist, car ownership is way too big of a part of our culture. IMO there's far more lucrative uses for a self driving vehicle that will only be possible once they can safely drive anywhere in the US (instead of a few geofenced big city areas), including:\n\n* Replacing truck drivers with self driving vehicles. This alone would probably be at least a $100 billion dollar industry.\n\n* Combine self driving vehicles with drones to replace delivery vans. Last mile delivery is insanely expensive, self driving vehicles and drones could cut this cost down a lot I imagine.\n\n* Consumer owned self driving vehicles, sold as a safety and/or convenience feature. I can't imagine many people wanting a bunch of strangers to ride in their cars even if it can make them money, but I can definitely imagine people being willing to pay up for their own self driving vehicle that can take them to work while they sleep/etc.",

The current vehicles on the road were advertised as one day being an \"asset\" that was going to generate the owners money for taxi-rides instead of just sitting in their driveway. I wanted that to be true but I am not a big fan of being sold on ideas that continuously prove to be false. It's been almost 15 years of the same trope. Eventually I will be wrong but I can't put my money in this until I see huge strides on progress.",
