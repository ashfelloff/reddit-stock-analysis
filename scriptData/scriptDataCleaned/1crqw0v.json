Then, I developed ulcerative colitis that is triggered by NSAIDs. So, I lost the tool that I was using to manage my pain. I have been in bed since 2018. First, it was my lower back. Nothing helped. Since then, I've been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic fatigue syndrome. Turns out, the pain I was using NSAIDs for was undiagnosed RA and CFS. My biggest issue is CFS. Part of that is something called post exertional malaise. In essence, any physical movement or mental activities causes me to start feeling bad. An example... a 5 hour car ride causes me to feel like I have an intense influenza infection minus the nausea where i sleep 16 to 18 hours a day, and it takes at least two weeks to recover.\n\n\n\n\n\nI'm basically one of Charlie's grandparents that is not able to get up, dance around, and explore candy factories. I'm only nearly 50. I literally, while i was typing this, just told my wife that my appointments today were too much, and the way I'm feeling means we should cancel our plans to go to dinner for my birthday this weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo yeah... live your lives to the fullest while you're still healthy!",

Take spend some time off, travel, spend some time with family/friends, and enjoy yourself. But I think folks are dunking on OP because of the combination of: \"yolo\"-ing your life savings, quitting your job the second you see some cash, that amount being a small $15K gain, and the general attitude of it.
