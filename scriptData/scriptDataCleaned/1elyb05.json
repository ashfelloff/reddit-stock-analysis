Biggest customers hyperscalers and research in Unis.\n- They have partnered across tech companies to push their abilities in other products.\n- They have a ARR in their software for enterprise for building AI models.\n\nSo picks and shovels are sold. Companies try the platforms and see what they can do. Partnerships are fostered. The fostering takes time and I would so does seeing what can be done.\n\nOutlooks by NVDA will be hot and current will be beat. Like I said call it what we want, but the story wonâ€™t break now. It could break in 12months or 6months if people canâ€™t do whatâ€™s intended with it.\n\nWe have a cultural problem today, we buy and tomorrow we expect results.
