Both of these mean a stronger dollar. \n\n\nAt some point the deficit becomes unaffordable (debt servicing is 15% of government spending already) and the fed has to bailout the government with QE. This will mean even more inflation and higher rates... It's a positive feedback loop that can only be broken by reducing the deficit, something Trump is very unlikely to do. \n\n\nThe theoretical end point (and it might take longer than 4 years) is basically a financial singularity, which is impossible, and thus something will give before then.

For instance, with a democrat controlling the judicial and republican controlling the senate, historically, the market will be up 12+ percent. With a republican controlled government (judicial & congress) like with what we have for the next four years, it’ll be up 9+ percent. Anyhow, good luck everyone.",
