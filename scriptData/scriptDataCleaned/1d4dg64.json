MongoDB served it's purpose, and you can ride that schema-less wave until you actually hit a wall.  This literally means you have made it, and your business is worthy of doing something special.  Pre-mature optimization is one of the biggest cognitive biases that engineers have to overcome, and if they can't overcome this near, I dare say inherent, flaw, they will KILL the business before it ever scales to a point where MongoDB is truly causing problems.
