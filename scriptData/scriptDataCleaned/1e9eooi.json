Which is the side of the market that people claim to actually move the needle.\n\nBefore, when you needed a server chip, you went with Epic or Xeon. Desktop chips lacked the core count and/or frequency. But modern desktop chips now have enough cores and frequency to sidestep the need to use the far more expensive server dedicated chips.\n\nOn the personal/gaming side of things, Intel had been blaming the crashing on Nvidia gpus, and that's how they were able to sweep it under the rug for the better part of a year. So when servers started crashing, people realized Intel was lying.\n\nSo you got a bunch of companies running Intel K chips as servers, and they're crashing left and right. Forget retail customers. If Zen R9 offers better MT/ST performance than 13th/14th gen, which is pretty much a garuntee, those companies will offload Intel for AMD.  \n\nFYI, the failure rate on the professional side is [50%](https://youtu.be/oAE4NWoyMZk?si=FX6uqdhoHK7XYFIk).",

I'm an SWE in the systems infrastructure space (I write software that manages datacenter and cloud platform stuff), and I haven't heard of anyone trying to use desktop CPUs for large compute environments, but with high core counts on desktop CPUs these days I can see physical density no longer being a concern that trumps the lower cost of desktop CPUs.  It's also much easier these days to engineer workloads to be extremely fault tolerant, so reliability also doesn't matter for workloads engineered to handle compute node failures, eg a K8s node fails and a cheap technician just replaces the node without any downtime for the workload and without the technician needing to know anything other than how to physically replace the hardware. \n\nI question how common this approach would be outside of massive compute farms, though, and I would speculate that only companies utilizing massive on-prem custom hardware deployments would do this (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon).  I work for a company with a six figure on-prem node count, but our stuff is standard Dell and Cisco blade servers and I can't see us doing anything like this.  More and more we're moving workloads to the three major clouds anyway and our hardware purchases have gone way down as a result.  On the other hand cloud costs are astronomical and I suspect someday we might have to move back to on-prem as a cost saving measure.",
