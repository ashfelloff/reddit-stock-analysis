The places where there is a demand like rooftops in major metros already have them. EVTOLs aren't going to open up new flight routes. The only thing they'll do is replace existing helicopters, and other than maintenance, I don't see the advantage of it. With fuel you burn it off, the aircraft gets lighter as you expend it. With EVTOLs you're forced to continue to carry dead weight as the battery depletes.",
