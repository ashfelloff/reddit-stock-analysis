  "selftext": "Hello, fellow regards. I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  \n\n\nThe potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...\n\nHere are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:\n\n​\n\n# Report 1 (Financials) \n\nAdeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.\n\nFinancially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).\n\nThe valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia’s trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.\n\nOn the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.\n\nGiven its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.\n\n# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) \n\nBased on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.\n\nAdeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs​​​​.\n\nAdeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies​​​​. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future.",

You do not want to fuck around and accidentally buy on margin or sell options where you don’t understand what your actual risk or upside is.\n\nThe very very basics are: if you BUY an option contract (the right to purchase or sell x amount of shares of a stock x date for x price), you can’t lose more money than the cost of the contract. That’s because you don’t own any shares of the stock, you own the contract itself. The contract can and will often go to $0, as in, lose all its value by expiring worthless, but it can never go negative (I.e the the contract can’t cost you more money in the future, it can only lose value). \n\nThat is only the case if you BUY a put or a call contract (option), SELLING these contracts is a very different concept (unrelated to most wsb posts)",

They design stock library circuits, then license them to big boys so the big boys can either lay off their own design teams, or put those designers to work on higher-value stuff.\n\nPut a different way. If you want a USB port on your new smartphone, you can either pay maybe half a dozen engineers to make a stock-standard USB circuit, or you can pay these guys to use their pre-built USB design.\n\nTheir business is literally reinventing the wheel. There is no innovation at these shops, and they play a low-margin game. Basically, they bet that their circuit design teams in India can work cheaper than Samsung and Qualcomm's design teams in India. \n\nIt's a race to the bottom kind of business. Not a hidden, explosive growth stock that's going to make us all rich.\n\nThe charitable way to look at this is that OP is regarded and doesn't actually understand semis. The more cynical way to look at this is that he's using WSB to pump his penny stock play. Either way, I'd advise everyone else to stay away.",

If you make 1 giant chip on a wafer, and it has 1 defect, you have to scrap that whole part. If you make say 8 chiplets on the same area, and it has 1 defect, you just scrap or replace the crappy part and keep the 7 good ones. \n\nThe problem is, how do you stick those chiplets back together and get them talking to each other. There isn't a standard solution yet, and everyone's taking their own approach.\n\nPer [this source](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/hybrid-bonding-process-flow-advanced), it sounds like they are literally going to glue the chiplets together, then bond a permanent metal layer over the glue. Depositing metal onto the glue requires fab-level equipment and clean rooms, which of course will come at fab-level expense. \n\nWhen I worked with normal packaging and boards, bean counters would give us crap about adding a 1 cent capacitor to the PCB, because that expense would add up over a million units. I can't imagine how much extra expense that hybrid-bonding a million units in a fab would cost... it just seems like a nonstarter.\n\nI got laid off from that big-tech company in October 2023, and it was actually because they hired an Adea type company to replace the entire multimedia-circuit team I was on. That's one reason why I'm such a salty MFer. But at the time I was shown the door, we were attacking the chiplet problem from a very different angle.",
