In reality, market makers are probably pumping this and getting ready for the dump. They use tricks like TA to convince retail investors to pour their money into it. \n\nThat’s their job, to take money from retail accounts and put it into theirs. It’s that simple really, and they have a lot of really well paid guys to (legally) manipulate the system.\n\nOtherwise, what’s going to happen, TSLA jumps another 33% and becomes a trillion dollar company again? For what? The dilution is probably coming hard and fast too. But these TA guys will be drawn to it like a moth to the flame. All it takes is a couple of YouTube videos.\n\nSo I don’t think you’re wrong, I just think you’re too early. Let it breathe a bit…let the bulls blow their load.",
