  "selftext": "\nBackground:\nI’ve been in Automotive Sales for 4+ years. \nI have been in sales, finance and insurances.\n\n2020-2023: If you work in the business then you recall during this time you could not even buy a lot of cars from auction due to getting outbid by Carvana and Carmax. They would go 1000-1500 over retail book value which already sets them back if they want to have volume based pricing. \n\nCarvana stated they averaged $6432 per copy. Now either they are straight up committing forcible sodomy on way too many people or they are full of 💩. I’m leaning towards the 💩. \n\nThe average dealership should run 3000 a copy split between the front and back. A great dealership will run 4000-4500 a copy between the front and back. The front gross is determined by the sale of the vehicle and the back gross is your finance and insurances. \n\nHere is the catch. Book data on cars is still rough. Buying cars from the auction is STILL rough. Dealers are still paying a fair share of money just to acquire used cars. Carmax who is the number one automotive group in the country didn’t even put those numbers up. Yet Carvana is magically the highest grossing store per unit in the entire country. \n\nI’m considering going into a short position because this has fraud written all over it. \n\n\nhttps://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/documents/cvna-shareholder-letter-q1-2024.pdf\n\nUpdate: Set 10k to the side before market close. May look at going 08/16/2024 110p \n\nWhat better way to shine a light on their cooked books than price action.",

I agree it's unlikely but considering they don't have to pay commissions to sales reps and even more importantly they don't have to pay managers I could see how that could lower their \"net net\" cost per unit drastically.

              "body": "I work in the bond market and I've been following Carvana for a while. Carvana is basically an subprime lender that cosplaying as an used car company. A big part of their business is orginating car loans, warehousing the loans, and then securitizing them to sell to bond investors down the pipeline. They did 11 of these bond deals last year and 1 deal last quarter. These bonds are very attractive because they are a mix of credit risk and pay out double to triple Fed rates. \n\nThe average APR for Carvana loans is 7.95%–27.95% - their car loans are grossly overpriced. I think they are vultures selling cars to people that can't get approved for a car loan from anyone else. My bet is Carvana reposses's a large number of subprime cars and then just recycle inventory. It's not illegal but just extremely shady. Their entire business model enables this - they can repossess a car and have the car back in inventory and sold with a new car loan in a short period of time. Doing it all through an app just lets them scale this at a massive scale. \n\nMy guess on where the fraud is occurring in how these loans and sales are moved between companies. Garcia also owns BridgeCrest Acceptance who is Carvana's loan servicer and also originates their own subprime loans. With BridgeCrest, Garcia has a private company where he warehouse bad loans, and with Drivetime he can move inventory/sales from them to Carvana. All these corporate entities and structures to me smells like bad doo doo on a hot humid day. \n\n[https://investors.carvana.com/\\~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/reports-and-presentations/carvana-101-pre-securitization-financing.pdf](https://investors.carvana.com/~/media/Files/C/Carvana-IR/reports-and-presentations/carvana-101-pre-securitization-financing.pdf)",

                      "body": "I'd start by saying that shorting this stock is going to be a mofo. Garcia Sr. cashed out 3.6B of Carvana stock and he's still holding 10B+ in stock. If you look at his business history it's littered with shady behavior and Carvana is his biggest payout. My entire interest in Carvana started when I found out about Garcia Sr. was indicted for being a strawman for Lincoln Savings and Loans - the SL that was the epicenter of the Savings and Loan crisis in the 80's. \n\nTheir auto/asset backed securities - ABS -are SEC regulated instruments so they do list them on their site and the rating agencies have pretty detailed prospectus on the details of their structure and performance. They structurally are a lot like how MBS were securitized. Fitch, SP and other rating agencies regularly get paid to give these ABS(es) ratings and review credit risk. \n\nIf you are tracking their financial health I'd look at their upcoming ABS propectuses and compare them to CarMax. Carvana and CarMax have very similar models outside the fact CarMax has dealerships and lots. They both orginate and securitize car loans. The number I keep track of is reported car delinqunices. It's not a complete apples to apples comparisons but it provides a separate data point to compare Carvana's numbers. \n\nCarvana's lastest bonds had a delinquency rate of 3.01% vs CarMax's 5.36%. I'm going to keep watching to see if this spread between the delinquencies keep going up. To note - the spread itself is interesting because CarMax is the larger of the two and yet Carvana's been able to keep delinquency rates far lower. All things being equal I would think it should be the other way around. Carvana's ABS bonds are paying a higher overall yield and also their asset recovery is below CarMax. All that to me would indicate their underlying assets/loans are of worse quality so there should be higher delinquency rates. So where are the bad loans?\n\n  \nCARVANA Securities - [https://investors.carvana.com/securitization/securitization/2023-prime](https://investors.carvana.com/securitization/securitization/2023-prime)\n\n  \nCARMAX - [https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/delegate/getPDF?articleId=3151332&type=FULL&subType=PRESALE&defaultFormat=HTML](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/delegate/getPDF?articleId=3151332&type=FULL&subType=PRESALE&defaultFormat=HTML)\n\nCARVANA - [https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/delegate/getPDF?articleId=3135034&type=FULL&subType=PRESALE&defaultFormat=HTML](https://disclosure.spglobal.com/ratings/en/regulatory/delegate/getPDF?articleId=3135034&type=FULL&subType=PRESALE&defaultFormat=HTML)",

It's not a mistake though:\n\n>**Total Gross Profit per Unit**\n\n>We define total gross profit per unit as the aggregate gross profit in a given period, divided by retail units sold in that period including gross profit generated from the sale of retail vehicles, gains on the sales of loans originated to finance the vehicles, commissions on sales of VSCs, GAP waiver coverage and other ancillary products, and gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles. We operate an integrated business with the objective of increasing the number of retail units sold and total gross profit per unit. Gross profits generated from the sale of retail and wholesale units are interrelated. For example, our nationwide reconditioning and inspection centers are designed to produce vehicles for both retail and wholesale sales, our vehicle storage locations have shared parking for both retail and wholesale vehicles, and our integrated multi-vehicle logistics and last mile delivery network is operated in service of both retail and wholesale sales. Such interrelationships require us to share finite operational capacity and optimize joint decisions between retail and wholesale sales, in order to position us to achieve our objective of increasing total gross profit per unit. As a result, the inclusion of gross profit generated from wholesale sales of vehicles in total gross profit per unit reflects our integrated business model and the interrelationship between wholesale and retail vehicle sales. We believe the total gross profit per unit metrics provide investors with the greatest opportunity to view our performance through the same lens that our management does, and therefore assists investors to best evaluate our business and measure our progress.\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000165/cvna-20240331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1690820/000169082024000165/cvna-20240331.htm)",

The counter is I would only take carvanas offer if I knew something was wrong with my car they couldn’t catch before purchase. ….  So the ‘buy puts’ option to print depends on whether you think their inventory is actually correctly valued.  It such a big ass number it could hide a ton of crap.",
