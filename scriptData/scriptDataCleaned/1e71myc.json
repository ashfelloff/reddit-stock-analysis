Keep in mind you cannot just walk away from crowdstrike.  There are long term 3 year contracts in place and it takes months to replace this technology. \n\nSentinelOne - EDR with MDR services.  Burning a shite ton of cash annually.\n\nMicrosoft  - EDR only, Defender solution comes with E3/E5 subscriptions.  Microsoft security for Microsoft vulnerabilities!\n\nSophos - EDR with MDR services.  Privately owned and cannot enter the casino.\n\nPaloAlto Networks - EDR with really expensive MDR services.  Palos Cortex offering is one of the newer solutions.\n\nTrendMicro - EDR with MDR services.  I rarely run into this one.\n\n",
