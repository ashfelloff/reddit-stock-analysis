  "title": "AAPL - cashed out",
  "score": 38,
  "selftext": "Despite my belief that Apple's stock (AAPL) will reach $210 as we approach the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), I decided to cash out my position on the recent price surge. Here's my reasoning:\n\n* In the lead-up to WWDC, I expect AAPL to trade more on news and speculation rather than fundamental business factors. For instance, reports of lackluster iPhone shipments in China are likely to disappoint investors again, potentially driving the stock price back down towards $168 or even lower.\n* I also anticipate some profit-taking from investors who were waiting for this recent price increase to sell their shares.\n\nWhile I believe the long-term fundamentals for Apple remain strong, and the stock will move significantly higher over the course of the year, I felt a 4% gain was a good enough opportunity to cash out for now. Investors who maintained a long position have little to worry about, but I think the stock may tread water a bit further before resuming its upward climb. Whether to cash out or stay invested depends on one's risk tolerance and investment time horizon.",
