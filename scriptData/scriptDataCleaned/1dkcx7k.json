  "selftext": "EDIT: I bought 10 MSFT, thanks for the advice!\n\n\n\nHi all, I am investing $15k today for some long term stocks. I already put about $7k of it into 50 NVIDIA, $2.6k into 100 Palantir, and $480 into 100 RKLB. Was wondering what would be good to invest the remaining $4.9k? I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?",

Pinterest business model which is targeted to both shoppers and business owners uses pretty cool visual discovery engine to suggest things that you might like and LET ME TELL YOU, if you know how good Facebook/metaverse suggests things to you wait until you use Pinterest. Not only does it suggest things to you, it will also let you click on items and it will direct you to a website that you can purchase it at. Yes it might have some flaws and bugs here and there but it is still a fairly new company and they are working with some of the best people that use to work for google. \nI’m also aware of market manipulation so remember to have a long term approach and play it strategically.
