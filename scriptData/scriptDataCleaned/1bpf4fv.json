  "selftext": "**Disclamer: this DD includes leaps.**\n\n**The US oil industry is booming.** Since 2022 the international energy markets have been going crazy. Firstly because of the sanctions on Russian oil, and secondly because of the supply cuts done by Saudis and Russians. To combat the problem of rising oil and gas prices the US has increased its oil production to a record high making it the largest oil producer in the world. This is quite funny considering that the Biden administration has also done more work towards cutting the emissions than anyone before. There is no going back to Russian oil for Europe and the tensions in the Middle East makes US the most important and reliable supplier. Even if Biden gets re-elected, the oil boom will likely continue for the upcoming years because of the geopolitical factors – US is the safest supplier and everyone still needs oil. Now the wild card is if Trump gets re-elected. The political climate will go from saving the planet to a complete climate change denialism and the consequences will lead to a rally like never before. Trumps re-election cannot be priced in until it is certain but the expectations will be very high and thus the premiums will be through the roof. Now my strategy is to buy leaps right now so I will be positioned beforehand. This cannot go south because we are booming already and the pressure of inflation will force Biden to keep it drillin’ in any case. If Trump wins it's only extra.\n\nAnd I know what you are thinking. What’s the point of buying leaps? they are too expensive and I can’t lose my account in a week with them… but they are not. At least this one isn’t. Plains All American, Ticker: PAA, PAGP(holding company).\n\nThe industry is divided into three segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. I know you don’t care about this but the point is that midstream companies are more stable against commodity price fluctuations and they benefit from increased demand. The politics almost guarantee the high demand. Here is the list of the biggest midstream companies:\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/r1r1xrkbayqc1.png?width=250&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe0fe9e0679dbefcf47b173c0a109a0b27031443)\n\nPAA is the 11. largest on the list. I looked through the options on all of these and PAA has dirt cheap premiums. EPD, ET, KMI had also low premiums so I suggest you look through the others too. The PAA stock is doing good, 9/10 positive earnings streak, doing good financially, couple of oil spills to make a reputation, no former employees assassinated etc. The stock has already gone up by about 50% in the past year and is at 17$. I bought jan/25 20$ calls for 20c and jan/26 22$ calls for 25c a piece. The stock has ATH at 61$ and if it goes to 25$ for example that’s already a 25-bagger. Now I know that's a big increase, about 50% in 10 months, but think about pricing in 4 years worth of oil drilling heaven. And If Trump doesn't win, OK, we are still going to go up since the demand just keeps growing. The premiums should really be 10x higher this far out. The upside leverage is just insane.\n\n**My positions:**\n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/xkujm6lcayqc1.png?width=672&format=png&auto=webp&s=7f7f50373da4329223c045078974d184715a0f09)",

      "body": "Oil investor here. I like this strategy. Nice find, Op. Plains All American runs some of the top crude pipelines out of the Permian Basin and into the Gulf Coast. They are extremely full, meaning that PAA’s getting all the fees they want and then some. \n\nVery low premiums on these LEAP’s. I would also buy the stock, as they just bumped their dividend up. 7% yield isn’t anything to be disappointed in. \n\nOil growth in the Permian will persist regardless of who’s in office, and your time horizon is such that Washington won’t be a factor. For PAA, keep an eye on the frac spread - relationship between Natural Gas and NGL’s. It’s nice and fat now, which is great for Plains’ margins. But a tightening will cut into their earnings. Also, keep an eye on what they’re going to do with their excess free cash flow. They’re a bit more levered than their peers, which keeps investors a bit antsier on them vs. Energy Transfer/Kinder. If they wind up paying down to a level below 3.0x, that’ll really help the stock out.\n\nI worked for one of Plains’ competitors a few years ago, and they were always winning incremental business off the back of their gathering platform. It is extremely versatile. And their management team makes good acquisitions.",

              "body": "I’m not sure what you mean by ‘rolling over’ here, but nowadays, the Permian is expected to grow crude production at a more modest pace than over the past few years. Much of the most productive acreage and reservoir targets have been drilled out. The basin consolidated heavily from 2022, which will concentrate activity to a small handful of players - Exxon, Chevron, Oxy, Diamondback, Devon, Apache, and a few fringe guys on the edges. They all now have 20-30 years of inventory to drill out, assuming they develop at that more modest pace. \n\nThe frac spread is only indirectly affected by that production growth, though. Permian E&P’s are more interested in the crude oil that comes out of the ground, so they aren’t too concerned about Gas & NGL supply/demand dynamics as they are with Crude dynamics. 60-70% of the molecules that an average well produces is crude oil. The remainder is natural gas (15-20%) and NGL’s (15-20%). The frac spread is a relationship of Natural Gas pricing compared to NGL pricing. A ‘positive’ frac spread means that the NGL components (Ethane, Propane, Butane, Isobutane, Pentanes) are each worth more as liquid products than as Natural Gas (actual methane gas). When E&P firms sell their Gas and NGL’s, they usually sell the Natural Gas to large counterparties and the NGL’s to the company processing the NGL’s into Y-Grade (basically separating gas and liquids for further fractionation later). The processor in this scenario is Plains All-American. They handle the two most valuable commodity sets - Crude Oil, and NGL’s. \n\nRight now, Natural Gas supply is way higher than demand, so prices are very low. In the Permian, they’ve even been *negative*; the stuff is so oversupplied that there isn’t enough pipeline capacity to even transport it out of the Basin. So E&P firms have to *pay* companies like Energy Transfer and Enterprise to transport it. NGL’s, meanwhile, do have a bit better commercial demand, ergo, their prices are higher relative to a gas equivalent price. And this benefits PAA. They can buy NGL products (mainly Ethane, the ‘gassiest’ of the NGL components) at cheaper nat gas prices, and then sell the liquified Ethane as an NGL product. This is called frac spread arbitrage, and it hugely benefits PAA. The wider the spread, the greater profit margin they enjoy. The narrower the spread, the tighter the margin they enjoy.\n\nThe frac spread’s future ‘fattiness’ or ‘leanness’ really depends on whether Natural Gas pipeline capacity can keep up with production growth (tough ask), and how soon we can start exporting the stuff to Europe at the big Gulf Coast LNG terminals. The latter is the biggest issue. We don’t have enough export capacity to handle all the gas coming out of the Permian, so prices will stay low for a while. Meanwhile, petrochemical demand for NGL’s is firmer, so those products will stay more valuable. All that to say that PAA’s frac spread benefits will stay in place for a good while. Definitely wide enough for Op to stand a good chance to see their LEAPs print.",

When I was in school for a geology degree between 2016 and 2020, it was almost impossible to get an internship in oil and gas. It was super competitive because of the downturn which started in 2014. Just last year, in 2023, I finally started seeing geology students getting internships in big oil etc. The industry is definitely recovering, and it’s continuing to head up toward because of Russia and OPEC cuts.\n\nAnother important thing to consider is that we will likely face higher than usual energy demands this coming summer (and years) due to the AI-led brand new Industrial Revolution. The new chip announced by NVDA, which other companies will follow, will eat up electricity like crazy. Keep in mind, these chips run hot which will also need to be cooled—again boosting the energy demand. Before we truly have nuclear energy on the table, they will be relying on oil and gas. Other alternative energy might look good on paper, but they are still facing many of their own obstacles for the time being. \n\nAll in all, I will be getting in on this with OP.

As of the latest data available, the US has been a significant producer of oil.\n2.\t**Reasons for Energy Market Volatility**: The reasons for the recent volatility in international energy markets, including sanctions on Russian oil and supply cuts by Saudi Arabia and Russia, are accurate.\n3.\t**Biden Administration’s Emissions Cuts**: The statement that the Biden administration has done more work towards cutting emissions is subjective. The administration has certainly emphasized climate action, but the extent of its impact on emissions reductions compared to previous administrations would require more detailed analysis.\n4.\t**US as a Reliable Oil Supplier**: The argument that the US is becoming a more important and reliable supplier of oil due to geopolitical factors such as tensions in the Middle East and the unlikelihood of Europe returning to Russian oil is a valid point.\n5.\t**Potential Impact of Trump Re-Election**: The speculation about the potential impact of a Trump re-election on climate change policy and the oil industry is subjective and speculative. It’s uncertain how policy changes would affect the oil market.\n6.\t**Plains All American (PAA)**: The information about PAA being a midstream oil company and its position in the industry is accurate. However, the projections about its stock price reaching $25 or $61 are speculative and should be taken as a personal investment opinion rather than a guaranteed outcome.\n\nI then asked it to explain point 1, 2 and 4 more: \n\nCertainly! Here is more information on points 1, 2, and 4:  \n                                    \n**US Oil Production**:\n\n -The United States has experienced a significant increase in oil production in recent years, largely due to advancements in drilling technology such as hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and horizontal drilling.\n    \n-\tAccording to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. became the world’s top producer of crude oil in 2018, surpassing both Saudi Arabia and Russia.\n    \n - As of the most recent data, the U.S. remains a major player in the global oil market. In 2020, the U.S. produced an average of about 11.3 million barrels per day (b/d) of crude oil, making it the largest producer in the world\n    \n-\tFactors contributing to this growth include increased production in states like Texas, North Dakota, and New Mexico, as well as investments in infrastructure to support oil extraction and transportation\n    \n2: **Reasons for Energy Market Volatility**:\n    \n  The international energy markets have indeed experienced volatility, particularly since 2022. \n    \n  One significant factor contributing to this volatility is the sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas exports by various countries, including the United States and European Union, in response to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and other geopolitical concerns.\n    \n-\tAdditionally, supply cuts by major oil-producing nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Russia, have also played a role. These supply cuts are often coordinated through organizations like OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and OPEC+.\n\n-The combination of these factors has led to fluctuations in oil prices and market uncertainty, impacting both producers and consumers worldwide.\n    \n3.\t**US as a Reliable Oil Supplier**:\n    \nGeopolitical factors can indeed influence the perception of certain countries as reliable oil suppliers. Tensions in the Middle East and geopolitical events, such as conflicts and sanctions, can disrupt oil supplies from traditional sources.\n    \n-\tThe U.S. has positioned itself as a more stable and reliable oil supplier in recent years, especially as it has increased domestic production. This has been particularly relevant following events such as the Arab Spring, which affected oil production in some Middle Eastern countries. \n    \nEurope's reliance on Russian oil has been a point of concern, especially considering geopolitical tensions between Russia and Western nations. The U.S., with its growing production capacity and political stability, offers an alternative source of oil for countries seeking to diversify their supply.\n\n   \n\nAnd finally.. I asked it *would PAA be more stable against oil price fluctuations?*\n\n>\tPlains All American Pipeline, L.P. (PAA) operates in the midstream sector of the oil industry, which is generally considered more stable against oil price fluctuations compared to companies in the upstream or downstream sectors. Here's why midstream companies like PAA are typically more stable:\n                                                              1.\t**Fee-Based Business Model**: Midstream companies primarily earn revenue through transportation, storage, and processing fees rather than direct commodity price exposure. This means their income is less directly tied to the volatile swings of oil and gas prices.\n                                                              2.\t**Long-Term Contracts**: Many midstream companies, including PAA, enter into long-term contracts with producers, refiners, and other customers. These contracts often have minimum volume commitments, providing a stable revenue stream regardless of short-term price fluctuations.\n                                                              3.\t**Critical Infrastructure**: Midstream assets, such as pipelines and storage facilities, are vital components of the energy supply chain. They play a crucial role in transporting oil and gas from production areas to refineries and distribution centers. As a result, demand for midstream services tends to remain relatively stable even when oil prices are volatile.\n                                                              4.\t**Diversification**: Midstream companies often have diversified portfolios of assets across different regions and commodities. This diversification can help mitigate the impact of regional price disparities or fluctuations in specific energy markets.\n                                                              5.\t**Regulated Assets**: Some midstream assets, particularly those involved in interstate transportation, are subject to regulation. This regulatory environment can provide stability and predictability to cash flows.\n                                                              While midstream companies like PAA are generally more stable than upstream (exploration and production) or downstream (refining and marketing) companies, they are not entirely immune to market risks. Factors such as changes in energy demand, regulatory developments, and broader economic conditions can still impact their performance.",

If you are thinking about buying any of the stocks, just make sure you are ok getting a K-1 at tax time.  Many of these are limited partnerships and so they issue K-1s which are a pain in the a@$ at tax time.  It is also not a good idea to hold these stocks in IRA or retirement account.\n2. Personally, I don't think the election (Trump vs. Biden) is the biggest thing which will make these stocks move.  Interest rates will probably have a greater effect, since most (if not all) of these stocks are valued for their distributions/income.   They are also very captial intensive and have a lot of debt.

I looked into some of the other midstream companies - specifically their fundamentals - and asked a relative of mine who works in the industry.\n\nSome of these are part of larger, more diversified oil and gas companies. $MPLX is one example of this; it's owned by $MPC. I think I saw somebody on here giving their regards to that one a couple months ago. These are more expensive with less chance for upside, but if you're looking for blue chip investments, there you go. $OXY (of which I own 1 share) also owns 48% of $WES, according to the latter's website.\n\nI've been in $KMI shares for a while now, and last I looked the LEAPs are still pretty cheap for it, so I think I'll get in on that action. It's also a good play for 2025/6 given that the Trans Mountain Pipeline is due to come online anytime now. I also own 1 share each of $ET and $ETRN, both of which I intend to buy LEAPs for. The other companies of this type that I looked into based on OP's list that I felt were solid were $WES, $NS, $OKE, and $WMB. Their financials look pretty good *prima facie*, and the kicker was this: they're all involved somehow in the Permian Basin. For those of you that don't know what that is: basically, it's some of the best oil and gas anywhere in the world, and it's not far from the Gulf Coast terminals, in which some of these companies are also involved.\n\n(On this topic, if anyone here owns $NEP, I read through the stuff they sent me for their upcoming AGM. As it turns out, in about December of 2023, they sold off *their* midstream capacity, and they're only in wind and solar now. I sold my share after that, and used the money to get into this.)\n\nNext time I get a bit of money, I'm going in heavy on oil and gas, but for the moment, I'm still trying to recoup my $NVDA losses.",

The biggest risk is if something bad happens in the company itself, major oil leak etc. They have had incidents like these in the past but so have many of their competitors. You could diversify the bet to multiple oil industry companies if you want to avoid that risk. There is also no guarantee of the stock continuing its run, 25$ price is very optimistic but I wouldn't bet against it either considering the chance of Trump winning.

          "body": "Yes, this is how it should be done. I chose to bet on only one stock because it's easier to manage and also easier to promote. The premiums were so deflated that there is no point in staying out untill they reach a \"normal\" state which might be like 2$ or more. The play is real but promoting it allowed me to do the arbitrage which my poor ass alone couldn't afford to do. Now that +300k people have seen this, the options will get bought untill the premiums are in line with the actual value of the contracts. I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of volume but at this point my position is quite risk free because the premiums have already more than doubled. If I would've tried pumping every other oil stock, that would not have worked out as good, so I picked the single best one in terms of potential thinking that if this picks on we might have a chance to actually affect the premiums. So this is a kind of a pump play but the contracts don't get overvalued rather they go from undervalued to their actual value. And the actual value is there too because the fundamentals are real.

I think a lot of these mid-stream companies are positioned well through this Q2 and Q3. \n\nI think Schlumberger Limited (SLB), another mid-stream company, is poised to do well this year. Up 9% the past three months. These mid-stream companies benefit when oil prices are high and you very well know that prices will spike with it being an election year and oil companies doing everything they can do get Trump elected. \n\nSLB recently agreed to acquire Champion X which will strengthen their position as a leader in the production space. Calls aren't as cheap as they were with PAA but I'm going in on shares. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/rrth1z696atc1.jpeg?width=642&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=195936a1c97fde1c7823106b2f8bd9da83e930f7",

This is because the value of the option when it expires is the benefit you get from owning that option. If the stock trades at 25 for example and you have calls with a strike price of 20, the value of the option is 5$ because that much someone would be willing to pay you for the right to buy the stock with a discount of 5$. \n\nThe options in this trade were worth 0.20$ with a strike price of 20$, this means that if the stock goes up to lets say 22$, the premiums will be worth 2$ and thus they would have gone up 10x in value. The calls would be 25 baggers if the stock reaches a price of 25$.\n\n0.20$ x 25 + 20$ (the strike price) = 25$\n\nThe possible profitability of this trade is based on the very low premiums, which is also partly because the options are above the stocks current price, that is out of the money or OTM.\n\nI hope you can understand from my explanation. I do not suggest that you enter any options trade before you understand the trading instrument and the risks completely.",

      "body": "Sounds great and all, but PAA is beholden to oil prices like any oil company. Oil crashed multiple times in the last 18 years: 60+% during the great recession ($120 -> $40), and then another 60+% drop again after the supply shock of 2014-2015, and then another 60+% drop again during COVID. Each time, oil stocks, including PAA, suffered. PAA fell 50% during the great recession, 60%ish during the supply shock, and then close to 70% during COVID. Oil prices fall during a recession because demand declines (whether it actually declines doesn't matter, it is just the speculation that it will decline).\n\nSo if you think that oil prices will hold up, i.e. there will be no major recession / decline in the stock market, then yes, PAA should be fine. But if we run into trouble, oil prices will fall and subsequently PAA will suffer.",

              "body": "Trust me, I'm an oil bull. I'm invested heavily in energy. But I'm a realist. Saying that midstream companies like PAA are \"more stable against commodity price fluctuations\" is incorrect. Logically, midstream shouldn't be majorly effected by price fluctuations as they are just involved in transport - they make transport fees whether oil is cheap or expensive - but the data shows otherwise. EPD and ET had similar price actions in 2007/2008, 2014/2015 and 2020. KMI only started business in 2011 and had similar price action in 2014/2015 and 2020.\n\nIf you are interested, click the Crude Oil price chart in Yahoo Finance and then add PAA, among others, to do a price comparison. The price of PAA closely follows the price action of crude oil.\n\nSo basically, if you are one to believe there will be no recession before January 2025 then this is a good options bet (of course all stocks are a good bet for that matter too, although I guess the PAA bet is a larger return vs other sectors?). Bearing some sort of shock by OPEC increasing supply or something related to the ongoing wars, oil price should stay stable at current levels throughout the year. However, if you believe there is a recession coming this year (I presume most of us do) then, given historical precedent, oil prices will fall, and subsequently all oil-related companies (upstream, midstream and downstream) share prices will fall too.",
