Best case, the stock never falls there, the Put expires worthless to the buyer, and you’ve already collected the premiums for selling the Put contract. Worst case, you’ve already collected the premiums for selling the contract, you get assigned and are required to buy the stock at $100 per share, and you now own a stock you like at that basis (assuming the stock doesn’t entirely collapse way below that strike).",
