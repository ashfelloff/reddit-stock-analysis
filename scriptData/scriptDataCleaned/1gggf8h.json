Up 84 percent on the Jan 26 12C that I added to the Watchlist when I made that comment (EDIT: did not see the 2.00 wide bid-ask spread) . Kinda regret not pulling the trigger there lol.  But I think you're right at least for now, no tech-adjacent company from the last 15 years is going bankrupt. If they didn't go out in 2022 they definitely aren't going out now. Whatever data they have has got to have some value to some bigger company out there somewhere that probably wouldn't mind picking up PTON for sub 10b mkt cap at some point soon ",
