It’s wild having FSD drive me around like a hired driver I don’t need to interact with. The investment premise for me is to buy it for the tech and delivery platforms (cars, trucks, suvs, robots, etc), and complete an iteration of purchases every time people focused on near term vehicle manufacturing fundamentals bring the price down. I thinks that’s the way to play the stock. Sell covered calls during brief periods of awakening when the masses start to get a sense of what they’re positioning the company to accomplish.",
