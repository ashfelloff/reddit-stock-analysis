  "score": 549,
  "selftext": "The stock is down this week, and I'm convincing myself this is a buy-the-dip moment.\n\nThe reason for the dip is not revenue, which beat expectations. It is because the forecast from analysts for the *next* quarter is above the *company*'s expectation. But this does not concern me because of how close the numbers are. Analysts expect 75.5 B in revenue, the company expects 75.\n\nThis ratio would be maintained in a scenario where my spouse expects me to make $100K in a year, but I only make $99,337.74. This difference is equal to the amount I would pay in taxes if I made only $17,118.75 for the **year**. To me this indicates that the analysts and the company are in complete agreement. Therefore, the stock should not be volatile based on analyst-vs-company expectations. But it is?\n\nAm I crazy, or is this dip insane? Definitely time to buy.\n\n",

I am not even sure about the forward PE being supposedly low because I've failed to see market expectations being met for the last few quarters. \n\nI didn't like the mediocre guidance so I sold at a loss.\n\nThis fucker cost me about an 80k loss from my peak and I'm down ytd due to unfortunately holding leaps on it throughout the year and not taking profit when I should've. \n\nI waited for this ER as a confirmation for whether I should continue to hold or to sell. And I sold after I saw the numbers and earnings commentary. \n\n\nWould rather be in either index etfs, ai companies like nvda or avgo that have actual solid ai revenue, or other large companies consistently growing revenues and earnings like meta/msft/tsmc etc.\n\nI hope you can make money on it and probably buying shares for the LONG LONG term like 2-3 years out will be profitable if they can actually stop the mediocrity during that time...",
