  "title": "Robinhood Q1 Earnings - Is It A Trap?",
  "score": 37,
  "selftext": "**Summary:**\n\nI believe Robinhood is poised to blow expectations out of the water for it's Q1 earnings after hours today. The question is whether Q2 guidance is just as promising.\n\n* [Positive GAAP Net Income](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_financials/2023/q4/Q4-2023-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) in two of the last three quarters - growth in profitability will show Robinhood has turned it around for good\n* Strong product velocity with introduction of it's Gold credit card and growth of it's Retirement Products\n* International expansion into the UK and EU will grow user base\n* Promising [January and February 2024 metrics](https://s28.q4cdn.com/948876185/files/doc_events/2024/Mar/13/robinhood-markets-inc-february-2024-monthly-metrics.pdf)\n\n**Background:**  It doesn't take much to convince WSB to be bullish on $HOOD. Both equities and crypto have been reaching new all time highs in 2024. A telltale sign is the reemergence of meme stocks and alt coins - degenerate gamblers are once again watching their lifesavings bounce up and down on a stupid green app on their phone.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dvtszvfdd8zc1.png?width=2762&format=png&auto=webp&s=4cf88eeab30867c40464f42ab2f3ae47332e9db1\n\n**Reaching Profitability:** In Q4 2023, Robinhood posted it's second profitable quarter ever with a net income of $30M. Additionally, both equities and crypto have been skyrocketing all of 2024, which drive more active users and more transactions on their platform. Favorable market conditions will likely show Robinhood is maturing out of their growth-at-all-costs stage.\n\nMore importantly however was a decline in Total Operating Expenses. In 2023, Robinhood had $2.4B in expenses, resulting in negative profitability accounting for the whole year. However for 2024, the company projects only $1.9B. This shows the company is finally maturing as a company and will continue to focus on delivering profitability over growth-at-all-costs. If revenues are up and the company has accurate projections on operating expenses, the company will have positive net income again.\n\n**International Expansion:** Some important metrics to look out for are related to Robinhood's expansion of stock trading into the UK and crypto trading into the EU. This is the app's first expansion into the international market.  The number of users only grew 2% (400k funded accounts) year over year between 2022 and 2023, and has essentially become stagnant after Q2 2021. This app desperately needs new users for growth. To determine how much it will grow we can look at a failed attempt to expand in 2019 (due to regulations) - Robinhood announced a 300k waiting list for the UK. Lets be cautious and use this same number despite it likely being higher in 2024. 300k extra users would 1.28% growth in funded customers in the UK alone. We know from it's Q4 report that it generates $81 per user however nearly 60% of revenue comes from margin investing, which is not allowed in the UK due to regulations. Now for some math:\n\n300,000 new users x ($81 rev/user x 0.4 excluding margin rev) = $9.7M additional revenue from the UK expansion. Q4 had $471M in revenue.\n\nNote: This plans were announced last quarter but actually launched in March 2024. These number are more useful in predicting guidance for Q2 rather than earnings for Q1.\n\n**Possible Speed Bumps:**  We've seen many times over the last few weeks where beating earnings expectations has an inverse affect on the stock price. META, TSLA, NFLX just to name a few. Although I am fully confident Robinhood will meet and exceed expectations, I'm concerned it could still tank after hours if it does not forecast another stellar Q2. \n\nConsider that the stock has already gone up 61%(!) over the last three months and is valued at $15B. It is trading at 64 forward P/E. For context Paypal is 12 and Square is 21. It must has very very strong Q2 forecast. \n\nIt's possible Monthly Users and Trading Volume will shrink in Q2 due to the recent slump both equities and crypto. The question is can international users and new products like the credit card offset these losses?\n\n**My Position:** Long 2000 Shares @ 17.82",

In Jan 2021 Robinhood wasn’t public yet. This could easily be a “dump while taking profits, open short positions” aspect for Wall Street. IF it drops tonight, I don’t expect it to stay down forever but will let the blood drain out for the rest of the week before I enter a long position next week.",
