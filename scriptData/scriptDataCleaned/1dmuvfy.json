  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "As it stands, I understand that humanoid Robots(Digit)are operating in Amazon warehouses and that would contribute to cutting down cost and improving Operational efficiency. \n\nIt makes me wonder about whether or not Amazon would ever sell humanoid robots to the retail customer. Did Amazon ever announce such a plan?. \n\nWhat does the community think about Amazon selling robots in the future?",

      "body": "Current humanoid robots are very far from the generalized tasks that warehouse workers complete in a given day. Currently the demos show a humanoid robot slowly moving a standardized box from one place to another. They cannot grab a pallet jack to adjust the position of the pallet, snip packing straps and remove plastic wrap, cull damaged boxes from the pallet, and so on.\n\n  \nIf and when Amazon introduces humanoid robots to their fulfillment network, it will likely be via purchase of the company developing the technology, like they did with Kiva. \n\n  \nThey also do a lot of work with automating fulfillment processes. They group these under Mechatronics, and they are much closer to the kinds of robots you associate with auto manufacturing. I suspect they'll continue to introduce solutions in this space vs. actually rolling out humanoid robots.",

You don’t have to retool a factory that already used human workers, instead you just buy an android and slot them in the same place a human would be.",

Completely avoidable reasons. The leadership staff they have now is barely capable of managing and maintaining a human employee. The leadership staff in charge of a robot damn well wouldn't know what to do with it. The whole company is set up so it looks good on paper but would implode if someone took away the singular rubber band holding it together.\n\nPlus %100 automation is unrealistic and probably impossible. Some tasks will always need human input, flexibility, supervision and intervention. One thing would be certain is that it would open up a hell of a lot of engineering and mechanic jobs as well as programming. Not to mention the ideas for robots and robot behavior you see in media wouldn't be the case in reality. At best we could program them for basic tasks but unless we could ever do true artificial intelligence, which brings its own issues, they'd cost more than the revenue they could generate. They can't or won't even build their conveyor belts in a way where they won't jam every 10 minutes.\n\nThe only real future is to r&d exoskeleton technology to boost the performance of regular employees. Productivity increases and medical costs go down from wear and tear. I think some companies started toying with this like Boeing for example but in recent light that might have been for show.",
