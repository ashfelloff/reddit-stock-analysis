  "title": "Smaller Companies With Long Term Potential?",
  "score": 63,
  "selftext": "This is a continuation of a post last year: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller\\_companies\\_with\\_long\\_term\\_potential/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/16jn32s/smaller_companies_with_long_term_potential/)\n\nIf you read the comments you will notice a lot of the companies mentioned performed exceptionally well for the most part. Figured it would be good to continue this tradition as we approach 2025.\n\nFrom the post:  \n\"This is Stocks, would like to see discussion outside of tech and ETFs. I'd like to try to identify smaller companies with long term potential, there's a few which am considering investing for next decade.\n\nI'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.\n\nRational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap. There's also too much concentration in these massive behemoths which makes me rather want to invest in ETFs like QQQ and then have few moonshots on the side such as listed. What companies do you have in mind? Thoughts?\"",

Some of the others I had owned but sold for various reasons, would still buy FROG, MNDY, or DOCN at the right price. Perhaps PATH if  I felt better about their tools beyond just rpa.\n\nBetween the last post & now I bought the dip on \nU, believing the company can right the ship. SYM, because I like the clear backlog view/institutional support, and S as iâ€™d always liked the company/metrics. I liked my entry points, idk that Iâ€™d buy at current entry.\n\nRight now, I like: \n\nIâ€™ll add PCOR on any dips to the lower 50s.\n\nESTA, MBLY, & RBRK as higher confidence picks at current prices.\n\nNVTS as my tiny semiconductor upside pick at current price.\n\nEXFY & SHLS as what Iâ€™d deem higher risk value plays, but companies Iâ€™d likely sell at a defined return %.",

Some volatility around whether they can continue selling GLP-1, but they havenâ€™t actually had a Q report with the sales added and still had 70%+ growth so keeping GLP is just a cherry on top tho most people probably donâ€™t realize that and it will likely dip if they lose access to GLPs. \n\n\n\n\nRMAX: Iâ€™m really thinking more a 5x, but if they kick in the dividend again and I keep the low cost basis then the dividend returns will be huge. \n\n\n\n\nRDW: still researching, but strong analayst expectations and micro cap space stock.

They sold some equity for cash a few years ago and used it to expand their factory as well as convert what was a very manual process to what is now a automated lines. What was also a huge money pit was trying to build a US factory. Since then they have stopped all US expansion. \n\nAlthough the company is US registered, pays US taxes, and collaborates with US universities, it's been targeted by Two anti-EV senators. It is an easy target because the CEO is Chinese and although it has a global footprint it's main cell plant is in China. They have had a hard time getting US government support, but simultaneously cannot get support in China due to it being considered a foreign company.\n\nI believe the plan now is to pause the US plant, which included selling some assets. They will build a plant in South Korea. In addition the automated lines are now online. They were at rush of bankruptcy but then last quarter they went from $30M to $60M can. The CEO in addition personally gave the company additional cash. I expect that this quarter they will go from $60M to $110M+ plus while also being cash flow positive, alleviating any bankruptcy concerns. \n\nIt's down because it's been shorted to hell for to how it IPO'd. Rightfully so most deserved to be shorted but like ASTS there are a few that are diamonds in the rough. I think this is one of them. E.g they most likely are the ones providing all the battery systems for the USPS EVs. They claim they've never had a system catch fire. Unfortunately due to politics it's all under NDA.",
