These are long options, so max loss is what you paid. But you don’t want to lose it all, so as SPY starts to dip, you sell 10x 556c at 0.50 to recoup $500. Because you sold a higher strike, max loss is still what you paid (net $500 now), and if there’s a reversal, you can still come out ahead. If instead you decide, moon mission scrapped, I’ll sell 10x 554c at 0.7 to recoup more, then you’re looking at a potential for an additional loss with a reversal (only down $100 that you paid out, could lose another $1k tomorrow). \n\nOr, big brain, SPY around 550, you see the sell-off coming, and buy 10x 545p at 1.10, for $1,100. You go ITM, and hold all the way to 540, and now your Monday 545p is at 6.00. You sell 10x 544p (also ITM) for 5.10. You lock in $4k profit, and stand to gain another $1k if the options stay ITM. Or, betting on a reversal, you sell 10x 546p at 6.90. Your cash is up now by $5,800, but you’ll give back $1k unless the options go OTM.",
