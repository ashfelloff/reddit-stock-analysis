It's not battle tested, it's not well led, it's rife with corruption, it's modestly competent core is diminishing as China's demographic problems increase.\n(B) An amphibious invasion is freaking hard, go back and watch the beginning of saving Private Ryan or any videos about storming beaches and making beachheads. It's just about the hardest thing for a military to try and do. In particular, invading an island nation even one not that far away from home, is going to be extremely hard. And it's not like Taiwan isn't prepared to some degree for this possibility. Which makes it even harder. Never mind the fact that the United States and the rest of the world would be right there to help defend Taiwan.\n\n(C) The catastrophe that is Russia's invasion of Ukraine, is further disincentivizing any fantasies Xi might have had about Taiwan. This is what's at stake with the West continuing to support Ukraine, it sends a message to would-be Invaders around the world, such actions will be met with global resistance.\n\nThus (A) + (B) + (C) = NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN or at least not anytime soon, maybe next century maybe the end of this one.\n\nNext, such an invasion would be a problem not just Nvidia but many companies.",
