I am curious what their criteria is to add a company.  Is this as a show of confidence in the company’s future?  They seem to have made good strategic decisions and are positioned well for growth.  We will see.  ",

This is a good thing for the stock. The issue is that it doesn’t come overnight and takes a long time to make a difference. But people used to be able to buy the stock and hold it, and the stock would appreciate over time. \n\nIn recent times, arbitrage funds have been ‘buying the rumor, selling the news’ and basically they will buy the stock when the announcements about reallocation are announced. And then the stock will pop and then they short the stock after the day the index allocations go live, and the stock tanks.\n\nEdit: I’m a former Wall Street analyst and investment banker and I ran investor relations for a small cap that got added to a couple Russell indices and our stock got manipulated to fuck around that announcement",

At the time I thought the Texan management team was oblivious to what was about to happen to them, these were old timer retail folks who had zero foresight about tech trends, and I thought there was no reason for GameStop to exist given the trends towards digital downloads. Management teams are hugely important to me and the contrast between GameStop leadership and leadership at tech companies like google or Amazon or activision was just astounding \n\nI like to buy shares in companies where I see an obvious no brainer opportunity for the company’s sales to explode - I am a fundamental analyst. Stuff like DraftKings where my experience watching mobile gaming explode in the 2010s alongside smartphone adoption - this informed me of what is going to happen when you put a casino into everyone’s pocket, the betting market should certainly see robust growth across multiple kpis: more bettors, betting more money each year, in more states than ever each year. I like investing in market leaders who are set to grow into large go forward opportunities. I am less sensitive to valuation and generally when buying growth stocks it is worth it to pay the pe premium for the higher growth stocks. I like to buy and hold no brainers. I don’t like to day trade. \n\nGme’s go forward prospects look dim to me at best? And there is so much vol due to technical reasons it’s just not a stock I want to own. I don’t do technical analysis and many many others are much much more knowledgeable than me on that front.",
