That means unless the share price hits $60 whoever ends up with that call will lose money.\n\nThe more fluctuations of the underlying share the higher the option price since the market expects that stock to move in big jumps. That's called inherit volatility. This is true for both calls and puts. \n\nThat's how people screw themselves. They buy calls/puts on a stock like Reddit expecting if the price goes down to make money on puts. If a share is going down by %10 a day though you might need it to start going down by %50 a day to start making money since the market is already pricing in daily drops in excess of the normal %10.",
