  "score": 579,
  "selftext": " The Bank of Canada cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point for a third consecutive meeting, and reiterated that it's “reasonable” to expect more easing to come if inflation keeps decelerating.\n\nPolicymakers led by Governor Tiff Macklem lowered the benchmark overnight rate to 4.25% on Wednesday, as widely expected by markets and economists in a Bloomberg survey. \n\nOfficials' communications were little changed since their July meeting, and highlight the central bank's increased focus on balancing the upside and downside risks to inflation, even as they see “little evidence” of broad-based price pressures.\n\nBut policymakers also reiterated they're concerned about undershooting their 2% inflation target.  “We need to increasingly guard against the risk that the economy is too weak and inflation falls too much,” the governor said.\n\nThe communications reinforce officials' shift in thinking about inflation -- policymakers are increasingly concerned about downside risks to the economy, and have started gradually loosening monetary policy to engineer a soft landing.\n",
