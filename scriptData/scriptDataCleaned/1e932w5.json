Thereâ€™s a chance that Jensen and GS reports of AI developments and the announcement this quarter is just hype but I think theyâ€™re going to blow out their number again.  Mostly I play leaps but wanted to juice up my returns a bit by holding shorter term calls (although not by this subs definition)\n\nShares > leaps > earnings options > weeklies.
