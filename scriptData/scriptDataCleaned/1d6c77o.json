I don't remember the specific numbers but basically when you're something like Berkshire the amount of money you manage makes it so this can very easily happen.\n\nAlso keep in mind some of the \"great plays\" you might think of aren't relevant for them. Berkshire has over $1t in assets. Let's say that to buy 10% of a company you have to go through regulatory hoops and whatnot.\n\nPick a company you think can be a good play, worth $1b, you either do very proper research and make a big investment or you make a smaller one. Say you invest $100m and then that makes you 20% a year. That's great, isn't it? After 10 years you'll have $620m, this is insane returns you couldn't really have predicted, you made half a bil over 10 years while, at the time of the purchase, you were managing over 2000 times that. If you that confident in your investment you would've invested a lot more, basically bought the business assuming it was for sale which is what Buffet says he prefers doing. If he finds a great small business he doesn't invest in it, he buys it assuming they're willing to sell.\n\nIt's not that they can't find anything, it's that they already own most of what would be a great play for them one way or another. AFAIK he's invested in VOO and SPY... which means he basically owns most of the \"good things\" through that already. What else is there to buy? He does own AFAIK shares of certain companies, say Apple, but owning ETFs that are already overrepresented by tech anyways means you own most of the good stuff.",

He also is still making a ton of money, so that’s wrong too. Is there anything you’ve done good for society? \n\nWhat if people just complained you didn’t do it well enough.
