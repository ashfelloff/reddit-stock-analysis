  "score": 702,
  "selftext": "Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimate consumption of fizzy soft drinks, baked goods and salty snacks in the US could fall by up to 3% by 2035.\nThey estimate that 24 million people, or 7% of the US population, will be taking the new GLP-1 drugs by 2035. A survey carried out of 300 patients taking the shots showed they ate less and cut back the most on foods high in sugar and fat. About 90% of those using the drugs said their snacking declined and 77% said they visited fast-casual restaurants less often.\n\nObviously this hides poorly for many companies in these sectors. McDonald’s has tried healthier menu items and they have largely failed. Weight loss drugs are getting cheaper and will be used widely. \n\nThe fast food and junk food sectors are ones I am going to stay away from.",

                              "body": "> Remember, the mortgage is only part of your housing expenses if you're a home owner.\n\nThis is basically the crux of my argument.\n\nThe mortgage is just one little part of the expenses. Where I'm living, property tax is 1.25 percent.\n\nThus, if I bought a 600k home (which would actually be a really shitty 3/2 with 1500sq in a below average neighborhood sadly), my property tax per year would start out at $7,500.00 which translates to $625 per month. \n\nThen the next biggest expense would be the home repairs/maintenance. The rule of thumb is to set aside 1 percent of your entire properties value per year, towards a repair fund. 1 percent of 600k is of course $6,000.00, so that's another $500 per month.\n\nThat's already a total of $1125 per month, and I haven't even mentioned Homeowners Insurance, Water/Sewer/Garbage, Landscaping/Mowing services, HOA fees (if applicable), Mello Roos Fees (if applicable), and probably a few other things that are slipping my mind right now.\n\nMy current rent is $1425 and just property taxes and repair fund would be $1125, leaving me only $300 left over, which would probably barely cover the water/sewer/garbage cost.\n\nHome ownership is a joke.\n\nThere's so many hidden costs that new and recent home owners try to pretend like they don't know about them.",

I lived in a modified tent for the first year - in Wisconsin, in winter!. \n\n The I salvaged materials from curbsides to build a shack, that had a wood stove but no running water or septic, and no electricity.  I lived there for 8 years.\n\nFinally I was able come up with sufficient down payment for a construction loan - to build a house that did have electricity and plumbing - and heat that stayed on even if I fell asleep!), at 8% interest with a balloon payment after 2  years.  \n\nThen I had to pay $2000 to refinance and was able to get a 30 year mortgage for 6.75% interest.  \n\n8 years later, I had to pay another $2,500 to refinance THAT mortgage at 4% interest.  \n\nThen another 7 years later, I paid ANOTHER $3,000 to refinance my house at 2.75%!  \n\n  \nWow am I ever lucky to have a house at 2.75% interest!

And trying to build a shack out of boards and pieces of wood other people threw away, while possessing no carpentry or building  skills!  That shack would get down to 20 F INSIDE during the winter!
