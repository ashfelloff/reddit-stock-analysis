  "score": 106,
  "selftext": "Judging from the technicals where would meta go in your opinion? Up? Down? Well I’ll like to give my input.This is a 10 year weekly chart of meta as I chart it up I notice meta has been in a strong up trend since 2023 with no major correction         (pull back). As u can see every time it touches that up trend line it backs off. Meta strong move allowed price to be way above the long and short term moving averages, whenever a stock is that far away from its moving averages for this long it checks back completing sequence of a up trend which goes up and down for the most part or a down trend which goes  down and up. With all this things I see as I chart my decision or direction I’m choosing  for meta is that it has down side to it but who knows? Earnings tomorrow tell me what do you think? Do you have charts to share or even looking at mines I’ll love you take on what you think about where this stock can go ",
