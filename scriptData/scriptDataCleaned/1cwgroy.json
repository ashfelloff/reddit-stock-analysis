That's not how it works. You know this immediately when you lose the leg. It remains true, regardless.\n\nAlso in the mix, probably the second main driver here, is missed opportunities or errors are infinite....there is absolutely no limit to how much you can 'miss out' on. \nYou lose 3K. Ouch. It can't happen again, it's over. Yeah, sure, you could lose 3K again, but that's a different instance. It's finite, but repeatable. Not infinite. Done.\n\nInfinite > finite. \n\nA third factor is that the unknown isn't exactly \"scary\" by nature (side effect of our pal Negativity Bias again, actually) but just \"unknown\". If you need something, like to know exactly what all is in your room, then the dark is scary indeed. But if you don't, it's simply unknown. \n\nSituation 1: I lost 3K this fucking sucks ass.\n\nSituation 2: I could have made 3K but didn't.
