RADAR is a far better companion to vision than LIDAR and in fact would complement LIDAR as well because both LIDAR and vision based approaches can be impacted by weather conditions and intense light.  \n  \nwhile I enjoy FSD for what it is I have always been under the impression than any feature advertised to make cars safer should just work in all conditions and not have a giant asterisk next to it. Examples, ABS and traction control are designed to handle the worst of conditions but if FSD disables or degrades significantly in poor weather then safety should never be ascribed to it.",
