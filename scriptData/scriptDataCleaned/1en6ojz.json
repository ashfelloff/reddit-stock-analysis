He also completely lacks any imagination if he thinks an alpha version of an unreleased product can't fix some of the issues he is talking about. Especially as film has many of the exact same issues but they have been solved at considerable expense (consistency between shots for example has a team of people who work to ensure this, and cost of filming a scene is reduced by teams who storyboard and meticulously plan shots long in advanced) - if a director tried to change a camera angle during a live shot it would be impossible, potentially the whole set would need to be rebuilt and it would take weeks and cost millions. So complaining about minutes and a few $ in power cost doesn't really make sense to me as a complaint.\n\n\nSo ignoring that and assuming these things can't be fixed (which I don't think is a valid point of view), it still has huge room to completely change film making forever. \n\n\nIn this scenario it might not replace big budget films, it could start a new genre of small scale film production. A creative idea could now potentially be made by an individual with a few prompts adjusting the script and visuals to tell their story. They might not have control over camera angles, or assets and some items might not be as consistent as they'd like but not everyone cares about that. The story is what's important.\n\n\nI could go on with many other ideas for the technology as it exists today, it's already changing how I work. And it's getting cheaper still - I'm still shocked at the cost of 4o-mini - it's amazingly cheap for what is does. Thousands of requests cost a couple of dollars.",
