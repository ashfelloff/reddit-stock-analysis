Usually with earnings plays, the extrinsic value (IV at extreme levels causes the option price to rise even if it is well out of the money) is extraordinarily high. You bought a 315 call for 14.10 per which means your break even is 315 + the cost paid (14.10). Unfortunately with earnings plays IV drops in very dramatic way, decreasing the value of the option if it’s out of the money. As of reading this right now, CRWD is at 340 which makes this a successful yolo. Your breakeven is 329 and it’s 11 above that. The options is therefore intrinsically worth 25 per contract. As you paid  14.10 for a 315 call that is now worth 25, you made like 80% gain if it stays at this price :) congratulations and FUCK you.",
