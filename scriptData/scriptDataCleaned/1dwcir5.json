  "selftext": "Why do passive index funds beat active investors in the U.S., yet the opposite is true for foreign markets? In the U.S. S&P index investing beats the vast majority of actively managed funds.  Yet in foreign investing, active management often produces a better return than indexing.  \n\nWhy is this?  Is it because foreign markets are relatively inefficient compared to the U.S., thus opening up mispricing that can be exploited by the active investor?  Or are foreign markets in a different stage of their life cycle?  \n\nEveryone \"knows\" S&P indexing is the best approach for U.S. investing, but consider the market life cycle could change ...  \n\nInteresting article here [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/heres-when-active-mutual-funds-tend-to-outperform-index-funds.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/24/heres-when-active-mutual-funds-tend-to-outperform-index-funds.html)",

All you really have to do is just kick back and invest in the largest companies and hope that they aren't managed by morons and expand even further.\n\nThe US also has STRONG investor protections so you don't wake up tomorrow and find out the government has seized whatever company you invested in. (Partially explains why investing in China isn't more popular but that's one of the main reasons).\n\nAlso, other countries don't have as stringent auditing standards as the US (even the US has fraud companies sometimes) but it's VERY difficult to get far doing that.",

Without the other 493 companies to drag down the average, their M7 would outpace the S&P 500. S&P puts out a monthly report showing how the S&P 500 beats most active managers.\n\nI think the original question is why active managers do better than indexed funds in foreign markets. Why can an active UK manager beat the FTSE 100, or a German manager beat the DAX 40 ? The r/Boglehead idea is that the SP500 is a broad index of large companies. Maybe the FTSE or DAX aren't broad enough? Maybe foreign active managers can get inside information that would be illegal in the US. I don't know.",

People also forgot when sp500 and Nasdaq introduced, they were active investing too at the time because they only let stocks that suit their criteria to go into the index. They don’t just pick anyone. With more and more stocks iPo, sp500 and Nasdaq 100 will become more and more like aggressive active investing because the total amount of stocks will only go up but similar amount of stocks can be included in these big name index.",
