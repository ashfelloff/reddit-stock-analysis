The fact that goods can’t be unloaded is a problem for American consumers—but there’s the other side of that supply chain too—and if containers aren’t being unloaded at the destination then that means they’re being stacked up on the production side, and that never looks good when you’re the one making all that stuff and it isn’t going anywhere to be sold. Same thing with India, which explains the Sensex today as well as more than profit taking. That’s part of it I’m sure, but this is starting to look like panic selling and the orderliness in general is deteriorating day by day with not knowing the full economic impact.",

                          "body": "I know it might seem that way intuitively, but in fact it’s completely untrue.\n\nYes, most container ships from China enter the west coast terminals, but more than [50%](https://www.ifpri.org/blog/the-likely-u-s-longshoreman-strike-and-its-implications-for-agricultural-trade/) of Chinese commodities enter through gulf and east coast ports. Additionally, there’s a lot of finished goods from Europe and South America that rely on Chinese input from international sources. Brazil alone sends 82% of their production through the East and Gulf, and 25%+ of that production relies on Chinese commodity inputs—think fertilizer, potash, aluminum, etc. It’s not even the direct impact necessarily as much as it is the ripple effect, which can be just as displacing over the long term. There’s always an effect down the line, even if it isn’t direct.\n\nBut also, it really is direct, even if it might seem counterintuitive, largely because the costs of unloading the ships are not evenly distributed across port operators, so there is often a cost/benefit analysis that goes into deciding where they unload. It’s more than just geography.",

Who tells you that a US staff member didn't call his Chinese counterpart and went \"Listen up, bitch, did you see what we can do to your stock market? You better stop your crap or we'll turn it up a notch.\" but didn't do that in public to let the Chinese government keep face. Kind of what happened during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nAnd no, it's not a zero sum game. It's not even a perfect information game, it's geopolitical strategy. We (as in the public) aren't made aware about everything that is going on behind the scenes. E.g. we don't know which deals the US has with Russia as to why they are not giving Ukraine the green light to use long range missiles on Russian soil. We most often don't even know all the contracts the government hands out to specific corporations.\n\nPoint being everything is possible and everything is deniable.
