  "title": "Cisco cutting 7% of workforce, reports earnings and revenue beat for quarter ",
  "score": 551,
  "selftext": "Cisco shares popped 6% in extended trading on Wednesday after the networking company said it’s cutting 7% of its global workforce and reported quarterly results that topped analysts’ estimates.\n\nHere are the key numbers:\n\nEarnings: 87 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 85 cents per share estimate, adjusted, according to LSEG.\n\nRevenue: $13.64 billion vs. $13.54 billion estimate, according to LSEG.\n\nCisco said in a filing that it’s implementing a restructuring plan that will result in $1 billion in pre-tax charges to its financial results and will “allow it to invest in key growth opportunities and drive more efficiencies in its business.” \n\nSales fell 10% in the fiscal fourth quarter from $15.2 billion a year earlier, Cisco said in a press release. It’s the third straight quarterly drop in revenue and the first time the company has reported a decline for a full fiscal year since 2020.\n\nThe slide is projected to last for one more period. For the first quarter, Cisco said it expects revenue of $13.65 billion to $13.85 billion, down from $14.7 billion in the prior year. Analysts were expecting $13.7 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nCisco said in previous quarters that the revenue slippage stemmed from certain clients setting up equipment that they’d received in previous periods.\n\nWhile the downward trajectory has continued, Cisco outperformed expectations with the help of increased subscription revenue from the $28 billion acquisition of Splunk, which closed in March and was the company’s biggest deal ever.\n\n\nCisco’s core networking business, which includes switches and routers, has been in decline since large enterprises started moving to the cloud years ago. The company has bolstered its software and securities business to diversify and bring in more recurring subscription revenue.\n\nShares of Cisco were down 10% this year, prior to the close, while the Nasdaq was up about 14%.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/14/cisco-csco-earnings-report-q4-2024.html",
