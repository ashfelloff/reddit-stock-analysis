  "selftext": "Hi! I am an ex-prop trader that trades equities.\n\nThis is a daily watchlist for trading.\n\nI might trade all of the stocks on here, or none of them, on any given day. I might trade stocks that don't appear on here! I hold no positions in any stocks long-term but Amazon/Mag7/general broad market indices. (unless otherwise noted in these tickers). If you‚Äôre on old reddit, click ‚Äúshow images‚Äù at the top to see all the charts quickly.\n\nI usually make these watchlists premarket, (or from 6:30 to 7 as time permits), but can be delayed if I'm trading the open. These aren't mean to be taken as gospel or any recommendation to buy/sell.\n\nMany stocks I post are <$500M market cap. Most are NOT good long-term investments but are good candidates to day trade. If you have questions to ask, PLEASE ask specific ones. Questions like ‚ÄúThoughts on \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_? will be ignored unless you add detail to the question.\n\n[Cooler US CPI Data Bolster Disinflation Narrative](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-13/us-producer-prices-surprise-with-biggest-decline-since-october)\n\n**AAPL-** We saw AAPL hit ATH yesterday, and top out at $220. That‚Äôs the level I‚Äôm watching, but likely this will just trade sideways today.\n\n**TSLA-** Elon Musk‚Äôs $56 B pay deal is backed by shareholders. TSLA also likely to raise prices in Europe due to tariffs on Chinese EVs announced yesterday. ¬†\n\n**AVGO-** Reports earnings that are $10.96 vs $10.84e. Revenue of 12.49B vs 12.03B exp. Also reported $5.25 dividend and a 10 to 1 stock split occurring July 15^(th). Worth watching at open.\n\n**GME-** We‚Äôll be able to see the open interest in the June 21^(st) 20C at the close to determine for certain whether DFV sold his calls or not. EDIT: open changed to close, my mistake. \n\n**PLAY-** Missed Q1 earnings/revenue. EPS of 1.12 vs 1.56e. CEO states that company was hit by incremental labor and marketing costs that won‚Äôt repeat this quarter.\n\nEarnings today: **ADBE, RH,**",

They can create better online channels for sales, leave the physical stores for card traders, maybe start accepting cash for cypto like btc or eth‚Ä¶ rather than having to go to those atm. \n\nThen use the 4 billion in either treasury bonds or look for an acquisition. For further revenue streams. \n\nShort term: I‚Äôm hoping they put some of that cash in crypto just to bring new buyers. And do some low .01 cash dividend with subscription rights for the shares. \n\nLong term next year their eps should be 1.02 plus in June. \n\nGood luck with everything mate.\n\nEdit: you mentioned cutting costs. They cut costs to the tune of like -360M 2022 to 6.1M 2023 for their net profit. In the past year. \n\nSo if they change nothing and repeat‚Ä¶ they would be profitable with the new cash on hand 4 billion and 361M if their operation stays the same.",
