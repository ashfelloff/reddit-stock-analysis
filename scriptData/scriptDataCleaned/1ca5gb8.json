So, that’s going to be more people to hire and manage, and compensation is by far the number one expense of trading firms.\n2. Liquidity has never been there. Just look at the VIX and SPX overnight sessions, nothing trades and markets are wide. Most trading happens at the open or near the close, even during the middle of the day relatively not much happens.\n3. Firms entire technology stacks depend on a long overnight window, and applications and algos expect to restart nightly. We don’t need to optimize for certain situations because we expect a 15 hour maintenance window. Moving to round the clock trading means a huge expense of upgrading systems.\n4.
