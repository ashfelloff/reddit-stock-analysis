I am fully prepared to lose my entire investment and I will not sell no matter what.\n\nTbh, I have no idea what will happen. It is very speculative and volatile. \n\nIf you buy in, be prepared to be whipsawed back and forth until the company starts posting some actually decent fundamentals.\n\nIt’s too soon to say what will happen with it. \n\nI bought it because I really enjoy Reddit. And also because Meta is valued at $1.3 trillion versus Reddit at $9 billion. Hell even Pinterest ($30 billion) and Snap Chat ($26 billion) are valued higher.\n\nSomething just seems way off to me.",
