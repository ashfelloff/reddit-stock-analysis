(NASDAQ: RIVN) today announced production and delivery totals for the quarter ending September 30, 2024. The company produced 13,157 vehicles at its manufacturing facility in Normal, Illinois and delivered 10,018 vehicles during the same period.*\r  \n\r  \n*Rivian is experiencing a production disruption due to a shortage of a shared component on the R1 and RCV platforms. This supply shortage impact began in Q3 of this year, has become more acute in recent weeks and continues. As a result of the supply shortage, Rivian is revising its annual production guidance to be between 47,000 and 49,000 vehicles. The company is also reaffirming its annual delivery outlook of low single digit growth as compared to 2023, which it expects to be in a range of 50,500 to 52,000 vehicles.*\r  \n\r  \n*The company also announced that on November 7, 2024, after market close, it will release its third quarter 2024 financial results. Rivian will host an audio webcast at 5:00 p.m. ET the same day to discuss the performance and outlook for the business. The live webcast will be available at https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/2m7m5wyb and a replay will be available for four weeks at www.rivian.com/investors following the webcast.*",
