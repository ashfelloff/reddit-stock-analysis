  "selftext": "The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) sets monetary policy to meet the 2% inflation target, and in a way that helps to sustain growth and employment. The MPC adopts a medium-term and forward-looking approach to determine the monetary stance required to achieve the inflation target sustainably.\n\nAt its meeting ending on 31 July 2024, the MPC voted by a majority of 5â€“4 to reduce Bank Rate by 0.25 percentage points, to 5%. Four members preferred to maintain Bank Rate at 5.25%.\n\nSource - https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes/2024/august-2024",

              "body": "Agree 100%, they are being downvoted by people who dont realize the two situations are different. UK is struggling, Brexit, debt, energy costs, demographics and no productivity growth is killing the economy. Very few have longer term mortgage rates (most 2-3 years) and rates are having a big impact.\n\nThe only reason rates havenâ€™t fallen yet is pay rises are still relatively high and government spending mixed with high immigration has been enough to stop the economy tanking. It also didnâ€™t rebound as strongly post COVID which meant a shorter distance to fall. People expected the new Labour government to increase investment but itâ€™s been forced to make cuts after it was found the previous government had been playing with the figures. Public services are on the brink. A stark difference to the US.\n\nThe only thing stopping ZIRP or near is the high exposure to the US and world economy. If it was on the strength of the domestic economy solely that would absolutely be a possibility.",
