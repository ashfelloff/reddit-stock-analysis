He's a value investor who buys at low P/E or P/Ebitda and then reinvests many of his earnings to either buy back Berkshire shares from the market, or to buy other attractive cash cows that cannot grow their revenues or their earnings very easily. \n\nWhat he doesn't ever do is pay out earnings as dividends, but otherwise he appears to be a value oriented instead of growth oriented investor. I guess that makes holding Berkshire very tax efficient. It's weird because value investing has done pitifully over the last 10-15 years. But it hasn't always been that way.\n\nAlso, notice how the number of outstanding shares has barely increased. This brief excerpt is from today's Barron's online:\n\n>Buffett has built Berkshire into the largest U.S. company based on shareholder equity at $601 billion and he has done it the old-fashioned way by painstakingly adding businesses and investments to what he has called his Mona Lisa.\n\n>The company’s operating profits after taxes now are running at an annual rate of about $45 billion.\n\n>Buffett has shunned debt and **issued very few shares to build the company, relying instead on retained earnings** and the compounding effect of smart business and investment decisions. Buffett likes the sleep-at-night comfort of cash, which is nearing a record $300 billion.\n\n>**Berkshire had about 1.1 million shares outstanding in 1965 and it now has about 1.4 million outstanding based on the A shares, when the B stock is converted into an equivalent amount of the A. So the share count is up just 30% or so over nearly 60 years** while the market value has gone to $1 trillion from under $25 million.\n\n>Unlike many CEOs, Buffett hates issuing shares—viewing every Berkshire share as precious. **He likes to pay for businesses with cash** like he did with Alleghany, which cost about $12 billion, in 2022. Alleghany’s board of directors at the time asked Buffett to include a stock component so that longtime Alleghany shareholders could get a tax-free exchange, but Buffett wouldn’t budge.\n\n>Berkshire has been repurchasing various amounts of stock in recent years including $27 billion in 2021 but the amount fell to $9 billion last year and just $2.9 billion in the first half of 2024.\n\n>There doesn’t appear anything specific that accounts for the recent strength in the stock.\n\nMy guess is today's activity is largely just Berkshire buying back a few of its shares. I'm surprised there aren't a lot of imitators who practice the same investment style.",
