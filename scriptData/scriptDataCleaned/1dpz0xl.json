  "selftext": "Hi, HIMS down a lot premarket due to an article here: [https://hntrbrk.com/](https://hntrbrk.com/)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/unvkzvkzs59d1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=38911f5ecf45fe0235e4c17d14b0455e6e2afea8\n\nThey quoted from a reddit post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HimsWeightloss/comments/1dn0a0t/glp1\\_week\\_1/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HimsWeightloss/comments/1dn0a0t/glp1_week_1/) without mentioning that the guy accidentally took double the dosage. No true journalist will miss that. The entire article from Hunterbrook smells like hit piece to me. People on the subreddit have already spotted these so called journalists a week before this article was posted: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HimsWeightloss/comments/1dkhxx3/beware\\_theres\\_a\\_journalist\\_sniffing\\_around\\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HimsWeightloss/comments/1dkhxx3/beware_theres_a_journalist_sniffing_around_this/) .\n\nIn addition, saw this on twitter: [https://x.com/OptionsHawk/status/1806315431994761525](https://x.com/OptionsHawk/status/1806315431994761525)\n\nSomeone loaded up 500k+ July puts late day before the article was released early this morning. I'm not into conspiracy but this looks kinda fishy.\n\nI'm pretty bullish on HIMS and GLP-1 drugs. Call Option IVs are crazy but I snatched 20 August 16 19 CALLs cuz I'm poor. I suggest doing shares if you think IV is too high and you are also bullish.\n\nNot Financial Advice.\n\nThanks for reading and have a blessed day.",

Literally anyone can go to the internet or the dedicated subreddits of these non-compounded GLP-1 medicines and see the same experiences. Most complain of nausea, constipation, lack of energy, and so on. Also, the FDA doesn’t approve compounds but it doesn’t make it illegal. It’s just not stamped with the approval of “safety” from the FDA. \n\nhttps://www.fda.gov/drugs/human-drug-compounding/compounding-and-fda-questions-and-answers",
