Personally, it strikes me as reasonable to expect some movement beyond the \\~6% increase since 7/26, given that they just released the first ever OTC CGM.\n\nI'm curious if anyone else has been paying attention here or has expectations for price movement.",

Dexcom has markets in Africa, which definitely don't have the state infrastructure to support covering GLP-1 agonists, but type 1 diabetics are being born daily and I assume type 2 diabetes will [continue to increase lockstep with obesity rates in the African continent](https://www.afro.who.int/news/obesity-rising-africa-who-analysis-finds).",
