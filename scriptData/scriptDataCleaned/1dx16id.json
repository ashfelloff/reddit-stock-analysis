He follows the data and remains open minded to change. \n\nI started watching his vids during Covid. The bottom was in but everyone and their grandmothers still believed there would be a new low. Ciovacco, the sexy beast, said the data was saying otherwise. He spouted off about indicators being flashed that had only flashed twice previously prior to massive bull runs. We then had a massive bull run. \n\n18 months ago, when this bull run started, again there were non believers left and right. Ciovacco, being the vigilante he is, said ‘I like the data’, ‘data says bull’ and what do you know, another bull run. \n\nIn all seriousness, this guy is legit. He also has a Twitter (and he is followed by some reputable names in the financial market) but his YouTube videos are most informative. When the bull market is ending, and the data/technicals/indicators/whatever else magic he uses, all say so, Ciovacco will let you know.",
