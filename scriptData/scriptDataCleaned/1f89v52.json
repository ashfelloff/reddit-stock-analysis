Do not gamble thinking u will make these kinds of roi, if u look at history of big red days like this or green, they dont happen too frequently. given his chart, he had no stop losses set he rode it through the ups and downs and consolidation on high theta 0dte options. chances of repeating this long term is slim to none and very infrequent. Do not let this post turn on ur greed side of ur brain, u will go into inevitable account demolition if not a life altering event trying to hit home runs. Speaking from 7 yrs of experience. Slow and steady wins the race, hate to be that guy, but yeah he had no stop loss, all in on options and probably blew up many times before this result came about. I don't know what his ALL-TIME pnl is but i can assume it is still very much in the red. Again if the market ran up middday, this dude's pnl would be back at 1.5k if not lower than his starting balance. It is very clear 0 stop losses were set.",
