      "body": ">In approximately June 2022, Federico Nannini began advising Coral Gables based MasTec Inc. (MasTec) about the company’s proposed acquisition of Infrastructure and Energy Alternative Inc. (IEA). At the time, both MasTec and IEA traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market.\n\n>Immediately after, Federico Nannini began sharing confidential information about the acquisition with Mauro Nannini and Thermiotis. Federico Nannini, Thermitois, and Tonarely had attended high school together in Pinecrest, Fla.\n\n>Mauro Nannini bought shares the day after Federico Nannini received access to financial information about the proposed acquisition. Thermiotis also passed the confidential acquisition information to Tonarely, shortly after Tonarely texted him: “I want to make some money right now . . . What we do?” After Thermiotis passed the confidential information to Tonarely, he texted: “Not a soul okay.” According to the indictment, Tonarely responded back: “Obviously . . .  You told me not to.”  Days later, Tonarely’s family member signed a letter sponsoring Thermiotis’s membership at a Miami yacht club.\n\n>As the acquisition progressed, Federico Nannini updated his father and close friend about the transaction. Thermiotis, in turn, continued to update Tonarely.\n\n>At one point in July 2022, when Federico Nannini became worried the acquisition would not go through, Mauro Nannini sold his IEA stock, according to the indictment. \n\n>When Federico Nannini received confidential financials that indicated the acquisition was going forward, he texted Thermiotis: “Its going thru . . . Holy shit bro.” Thermiotis responded: “Don’t text . . .But lfg.” At that point, Mauro Nannini began to buy back his position in IEA stock and options.\n\n>When MasTec’s acquisition of IEA was reported publicly on July 25, 2022, Mauro Nannini, Thermiotis, and Tonarely all sold their shares and option contracts in IEA at a profit. Two days later, on July 27, 2022, Federico Nannini texted Thermiotis a picture of a Rolex Daytona, saying “You wanna hook it up for the boy. I know it’s a little over budget but this is the one.” Thermiotis responded: “Haahaha yeah but give it a bit . . . Prices should come down a bit on everything.”",
