AppLovin stock surged to record heights in extended trading.\n\nThe Palo Alto, Calif.-based company earned $1.25 a share on sales of $1.2 billion in the September quarter. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 92 cents a share on sales of $1.13 billion. In the year-earlier period, AppLovin earned 30 cents a share on sales of $864 million.\n\nAppLovin's software platform enables app developers to market, monetize and analyze their apps. The company also makes mobile games such as \"Wordscapes,\" \"Matchington Mansion\" and \"Game of War.\"\n\n\"We had another fantastic quarter in Q3,\" Chief Executive Adam Foroughi and Chief Financial Officer Matt Stumpf said in a shareholder letter.\n\n\"Our Axon models continue to improve through self-learning and, more importantly this quarter, from technology enhancements by our engineering team,\" they said. \"As we continue to improve our models, our advertising partners are able to successfully spend at a greater scale. We're proud to be a catalyst to reinvigorating growth in our industry.\"\n\nAppLovin's Axon technology facilitates matchmaking between advertisers and publishers.\n\nSource: https://www.investors.com/news/technology/applovin-stock-app-q3-2024-earnings/",
