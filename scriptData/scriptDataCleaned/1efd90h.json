Their *software* was the impressive thing.\n\nIntel is actually in the process of producing ARM chips now.  If and when they come out, I would absolutely bet that in terms of raw power, it would be comparable to what Apple has.  The difference is that Windows for ARM isn't all that robust, tons of Windows applications don't work on ARM, and there isn't a decent translation layer for x86 to ARM to be able to run legacy software reliably.

                  "body": "look at the price-per-chip here: [https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing](https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing)  \nPrice per h100 gpu [on Lambda](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) is about 2.49 $/hour (on-demand)  \nPrice per h100 gpu [on this other vendor](https://www.runsuncloud.com/) is 2.48 $/hour (on-demand)\n\nLet's limit the comparison to bf16. At bf16 precision, a single H100 gives you 1979 TFLOPS: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/)  \n\n\nto get the same bf16 TFLOPS with a v5p TPU, you need to get a VM with at least 4 chips: [https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/google-announces-the-cloud-tpu-v5p-its-most-powerful-ai-accelerator-yet/?guccounter=1](https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/06/google-announces-the-cloud-tpu-v5p-its-most-powerful-ai-accelerator-yet/?guccounter=1)\n\nThus, renting the equivalent TPUs would cost you between $16.8$/hour (on-demand) and 7.56 $/hour (if you commit to use them for 3 years). This is between 8x and 3x the cost of renting a single h100 on demand, for the same computing power. And you can probably get cheaper for the H100s.",
