TSLA is now more speculative as their car sales have peaked/dropped and the Musk effect of building robots is obviously going to take years to play out.  RIVN has the potential for huge growth as it rolls out the R2 models in 2025 and tries to build a new, large factory in Georgia.  They have scaled back the investment and timing on their Georgia factory and are building out their Illinois plant to start building the R2 models.  They have made gains in efficiency and optimization of their vehicle builds and their process.  They expect to be cash flow positive in the fourth quarter this year, but don't hold your breath on that.  They will probably be cash flow positive in 2025 is my bet.  Profits should grow in 2025 as their improvements lower their costs and especially once they roll out the R2 models off the floor in 2026.  If you want to buy now and hold for the next 2 to 4 years, I would invest.  If you want the potential for short term gains, look elsewhere...but those long term gain potentials have me holding and buying 50 - 100 shares on down days as I continue to grow my a long-term position.",
