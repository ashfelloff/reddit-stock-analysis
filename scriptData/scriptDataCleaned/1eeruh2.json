When his first sell orders showed up at the nice round number of $200 on the SEC system, this info gets forwarded to the trading analysts, having worked in a hedge fund, what usually happens is that trade desk will SHORT the stock (because they know there is a big seller at $200 acting as good resistance), however, if you look at the chart, all the shorts are bought up, there is very clear strong bullish momentum.\n\nThe last higher high happened on July 11th premarket at 201.33, which is actually the ATH, trend line rules (ie. rules for the algos, who are actually the mainstream traders now) says that we should look for new low extremes, which i believe was found at 176.8 on Wednesday July 25th. Thursday and Fridays trading sessions short entries were all bought up, the next key level short entry is at 188 for the hourly players, which could be significant, so i will be watching that closely, if that one fails, we could easily break in to 193-200 trading range again.\n\nBeing this close to earnings, i reasonably believe that the bulls (who are showing strong sentiment) can neutralize the 1Hr bears and stabilize the price at around 190 right on earnings, which sets up for a very nice breakout to 200-210 range.
