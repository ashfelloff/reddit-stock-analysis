Now if you try to do that it is easily over $10.00 a person if not more.  Most fast food places have cut value menus completely and only offer over priced meals.   \n\nAnyways I haven’t been to a Wendy’s in years at this point and don’t ever plan on going again.   Taco Bell is the worst though.  They went from a really cheap and low cost food to being a really cheap and high cost food almost overnight.  Their ingidients are so bottom line I don’t know how they think they can charge $20 a meal and people will continue to buy.   I’ve talked with people and everyone is the same, Taco Bell is priced for the rich and famous these days yet I don’t know anybody rich or famous that would take time out of there day to go to Taco Bell.",

After tip, (I do tip Sonic car hops.) it was around ten dollars.\n\nFor less than a dollar's difference, I could have had a nice sit down breakfast at a local restaurant which would have been more food and *better*, but I was in a hurry. \n\nThe *only* thing the fast food restaurant had going for it was speed. That's it. Today, that was enough to get my business. However, most days it isn't. Most of the time when I go for breakfast I go to the nicer place. I was just running late. \n\nSame goes for lunch and dinner. If I have the time, I can find better quality food and better portions than fast food and have better service and an overall experience just paying the extra dollar (literally) and going to a real restaurant. \n\nIf I want to eat cheap, I just throw some crap into the crock pot or rice cooker. It's much cheaper, healthier, and much more convenient. \n\nFast food is going to see their business lose to either better or cheaper options until they lower their price point, which they will eventually do (eventually). \n\nHowever, surge pricing can kiss my ass. I would rather go hungry for the short time it takes to find something other than a fucking Wendy's.",

The prices at McDonalds and Wendys with crap food, that is loaded with ingredients that is bad for you, hmm I will pass. I think these fast food restaurants need to wake up, they are charging as much for a meal as going to a regular restaurant with much higher quality food. Salad & Go and Chipotle are my go to if I need something fast. Way healthier and the same price if not less for a meal. Fast food made their niche from being fast and cheap. They are not longer on the cheap side and I think with the economy the way it is, they are going to feel the struggle really soon.",
