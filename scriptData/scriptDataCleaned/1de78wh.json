  "selftext": "Hello fellow regards,\nCurrently SMCI is trading around the $770 to $800 range and is crucial to the future of AI as they have partnerships with Nvidia and AMD, due to providing complementary AI server systems. Due to their partnerships, and the increasing demand for AI server systems, SMCI had their EPS increase significantly as their EPS forecast is around $8.00 per share, which is a major increase from last year, which was $3.51 per share. They also have a PE ratio that is lower than Nvidia and AMD at around 45, a foward PE of 21.79 and a PEG ratio of under 1. As a result of their PEG ratio being below 1, it means that the company is considered as undervalued, and a good investment to have. The stock is down 40% from ATH and i personally believe that it could reach over $1000 by their next earnings release which is in the end of july. \n\nCurrently holding 20 shares of SMCI at an average of $776 per share.",

That is unlikely since Dell and HPE finally joined the AI server market, so the first assumption seems unlikely.\n\nSMCI makes good product, but they simply enjoyed a temporary market position of being the only game in town. They no longer are.",
