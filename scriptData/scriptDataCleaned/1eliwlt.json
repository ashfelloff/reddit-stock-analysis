Even if Apple can’t match Google, they could create their own search engine and capture a fraction of that. If Apple search makes just $5B, that’s more than $0, so they’ll do it and cost Google to miss out on that $50B in revenue.\n\nApple isn’t going to give up that $18B and still let everyone default safari to Google. They will monetize that themselves one way or another.\n\nProbably will buy Perplexity or make something like SearchGPT and call it “Spotlight” or “Siri Search”",
