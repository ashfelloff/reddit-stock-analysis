All financial institutions are bullish on AMZN and have been buying.\n\nIf you actually did your research you would know that Amazon had previously charged less on shipping to encourage sellers to join and we're not making profit. Now that they feel they have enough if a customer base they raised prices back to not been on a loss. Sellers in Amazon threw a fit and spread some videos saying Amazon is greedy is over but the actuality is that Amazon shipping is still cheaper than if they did it themselves so they have kept with using Amazon. \n\n2024 is the first year they are taking profit instead of reinvesting everything back into research.

A lot of their profitability came from making their own data center chips but I don’t think replicating that with GPUs is going to be quite as easy. Buying Nvidia chips might be more cost effective than putting hundreds of billions into GPU R&D. I expect their margins to shrink over your time horizon.\n\nI’m middle of the road on AAPL.

But its best if you can buy them during macro-economic downswings, because they are very, very, likely to go back up when things return to normal.  Also, these companies are big enough and have enough cash on hand to buy their competition before they become competition.  Also, they can R&D into new products/sectors more easily than smaller focused companies.   Lastly, if you can keep accumulating into them, a small, good day becomes a very good day (like any other stock, but this is more like easy mode because of their relative stability).",

                  "body": "I see what you're saying, but there's some other problems besides shipping times. Shein is only clothes so unless they expand, they aren't gonna take down Amazon. I've never shopped on there personally, but I know a lot of people who do and there's many times where I've complimented a friend on their clothes and they said it was from Shein, so it seems like they have some good quality stuff. But it's still shipped from China which means returns are a hassle and generally not even gonna be worth doing unless you live in China. That goes for Temu too of course, but it has a lot more drawbacks that I'm aware of. The app is horribly spammy and ugly and riddled with annoying popups and other garbage that try to get you to buy whatever bullshit possible, lol. Not to mention a lot of the stuff on there is complete garbage, making that lack of easy returns even more prominent. It's really just a massively downgraded AliExpress. Also I wouldn't say any of the China sites are exactly the same stuff as Amazon. While there is indeed a lot of the same stuff and more of Amazon's stock becomes whitelabeled generic Chinese stuff, there are still numerous American brands and such you just can't find on Shein, Temu, AliExpress and the like because literally all of their stuff is Chinese products (as far as I've ever seen).\n\nOn the other hand, I can buy a ton of clothes or anything else from Amazon and return anything or everything very easily at no cost if it turns out to be garbage or not fit or if I simply changed my mind fro any reason. The experience is miles ahead. Same goes for their reviews; while they're not as great as they once were and definitely are subject to seller manipulation, if you actually read through them and use your best judgement, they are overall reliable and more useful than Temu.\n\nBut I don't shop on Temu because one time was more than enough. 😂 AliExpress is MUCH better. It has a few of the problems Temu has like being shipped from China (though they have some stuff shipped from the US too), the reviews usually being not too helpful or non-existent, as well as listings sometimes having wrong or misleading mockup photos and things like that (I still find it less deceptive than Temu though). If anything they are far better positioned to take away from Amazon, if only they marketed more like Temu does.\n\nI'm constantly blown away by how many people don't know about AliExpress or have heard of it but still don't shop on there. I think they just don't realize how good it actually is. Still though, Amazon's amazing logistics and all the benefits than come with can't be beat unless the gov decides to step in and break them up or allow Chinese companies to set up more shipment centers in the States. And as much as our gov likes to pick on big tech, they like to pick on China more and surely won't let a Chinese company overtake an American one if it has to happen on our soil. \n\nI've used AliExpress for years and always loved it for things I could wait on, and recently they've totally upped their shipping game. Now they've got a lot of stuff in their \"Choice\" program which is a bit like Amazon's fulfilment service where Ali handles the logistics so it's quick. The shipping is only $2 or free if you spend >$10 which is easy to hit without trying. And no annual subscription for that service so it's quite a nice option compared to Amazon especially if you don't have Prime. And I've found it to be very fast every time. They've really done an impressive job with it! I get Choice orders in about a week usually, which is on par with more and more stuff on Amazon these days as Prime gradually falls more victim to enshittification. \n\nWhew that was a lot.
