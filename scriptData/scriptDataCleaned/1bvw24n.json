They went down to 4.307 today - still way higher than when week began …\n\nBesides that, banks and funds are the big movers in the bond markets - not much if any retail moving the bonds markets. \n\nBanks and funds are a little more sophisticated than most equity market investors - they know Kashkari has no say in the matter, but equity investors (especially retail investors) see “fed” next to Kashkari’s name and assume he has a vote (which he doesnt) - that is why equity market dropped.\n\nBonds likely dropped some because they have a better idea of what the jobs report will say tomorrow … My bet is the jobs market will show some kinks in the armor of the economy, which will make it (somewhat) more likely for a rate cut … Banks have access to that kind of info - so that tells me they may know something about jobs info that the rest of us havent been able to piece together yet. \n\nAdditionally, bonds investors probly saw what happening with equity market, so some probly getting cash ready to buy up some of the dip in equities if jobs report has info indicating rate cut more likely. That likely caused some of the dip in bonds as well - gotta have some cash ready to swoop in and take advantage of yesterday’s dip in equities if jobs report indicates it.\n\nWe will find out tomorrow.",

I dont know that we have actually caught up to the 2021 highs yet (despite the numbers).\n\nNasdaq for instance, it is above 16,000 now … about the market cap it was in 2021 at the high … But we have had about 17% inflation since 2021 - even though the market cap is close to the same as in 2021 - to really catch up (in my mind) it needs to get up over 18,700 to be equivalent to where it was in 2021 (due to inflation).\n\nWe may have a flat (flattish) market in general till close to the summer … but the first rate cut should help infuse the market with capital.
