  "selftext": "So obviously GME blew up the last couple of days. But it looks like short interest has also doubled in that time according to fintel.io (unless I'm reading it wrong).\n\nShort interest, I assume, is going up so much because more people are jumping in on the shorts now that they see the price getting so high.\n\nIf more people are buying and more are also shorting, we'd expect an increase in volume. Volume does seem higher than it's been since 2021. So that tracks. \n\nBut does all this suggest the volatility will increase even more? I expect large bets going both ways would increase volatility?\n\nSorry if I'm a noob about certain aspects of stocks.",

After all, who cares if the employees get caught in the crossfire?\n\nI feel dirty.\nAnywho, over 2000 plus companies are zombiefied in the USA. solely shorts?

In short selling, a realized loss occurs when you repurchase shares to close your position at a higher price than the original selling price.\n2. For example, let's say you shorted a stock at $6 per share and then repurchased it later at $64 per share. You would incur a realized loss of $58 per share.",
