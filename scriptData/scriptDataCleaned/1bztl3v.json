The goal is low unemployment—that the economy doesn't have a bunch of people who want to work but nobody has money to employ them. That's an inefficient economy. It's like running a factory where people are standing around with nothing to do. It's bad... for the factory (or the economy).\n\nYou have some naive understanding of how any of this works. The Fed is not trying to give you a nice job so you can live a happy life. The Fed is trying to give the US a healthy economy for everybody. And their MANDATE is low unemployment and stable prices. The Fed does not care about \"consumers\" or \"whose cash\". China is the 2nd largest holder of US cash. The Fed does not give a shit about China. Mexico and rich people are huge consumers of US products. The Fed does not care about Mexico and rich people. They care about the health of the US economy. They have a mandate and a few large levers with the sole purpose of low unemployment and stable prices.",

Like what happened to a bunch of the US shipyards post WW2 and Cold War, or to the manufacturing of certain systems (like Stinger AA manpads, they pretty much can’t be made anymore, the companies that made the sub components either moved on and got rid of the tooling or went out of business. Development of a 1 to 1 replacement with modern materials is costing millions now that the need is recognized). There is no such thing as a peace dividend, it’s a complete fallacy, a country that banks on that is just shedding away capacity and capabilities in the interest of saving cents now to only have to turn around and have to spend millions later when suddenly they need them again and hope and pray they get those back in time to do some good.",
