  "selftext": "After a string of softer data: CPI, PPI and Retail sales for May, a dovish pivot from Fed is all but certain.\n\nIn fact, I am inclined to argue that 1 rate cut for 2024 is the worst case scenario. \n\nThis development is bullish for equities with new all time of high for S&P500 [in short order] is on the cards.\n\nUS companies have continued to perform well and this give confidence to investors [even at expanded PE multiples].\n\nIn this exuberance, please remember to diversify [beyond tech/AI], and seek different opportunities.\n\nWith meme stock bubble at its end, investors has no distraction and may focus on long term/durable opportunities.\n\nHappy Investing!

Inflation being more of an issue for us as a country and unemployment so it gets priority. Until we are solidly there. I expect papa Powell to rip the rug out and raise rates at the end of the year.
