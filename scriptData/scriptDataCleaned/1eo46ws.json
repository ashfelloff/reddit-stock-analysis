I work in corporate finance and it is scary how reliant the entire financial world is office 365. They have been using the same excel workbooks for 10+ years (probably more in some cases), carrying over the same macros and making everything run off of the out of date macro/workbook some analyst made a decade ago. The switching costs would be enormous and the process of switching could create tiny errors that are very costly for corporations.\n\n2. From my experience and general talk around the office, Google workspace simply isn’t advanced enough for large scale corporate use. It doesn’t have all of the functions and safeguards in place that Microsoft has. Microsoft 365 has created and entire ecosystem for corporations that has email, teams, office, cloud computing, etc. all functioning decently and works together. Most companies all use it and makes working with them easier too. \n\n\n3. The act of switching could leave gaps that people didn’t even know existed because some macro or whatever from 20 years ago was doing 1 thing that no one considered and now the whole process is paused until they figure out what’s happening. Or simply just the time it takes to switch and human error while moving everything over and learning a whole new eco system.\n\n\n\n4. In Google workspaces defense it is impressively simple and very user friendly. I use it for all my personal finance, data tracking, emails, and Google docs. It is perfect for personal use and it doesn’t surprise me that it now has 70% of the market as I bet that is the majority of normal people and excludes most businesses. Unfortunately most people wouldn’t pay to use Google workspace. It isn’t good enough for me to  pay for it, if I’m paying money I want all of the functions that Office.

Why would real-time online/offline status be available inline in an email?\n\nRecipients are not email.  They are (usually) people, and those people often have availability statuses.  Outlook displays those statuses in the  header of the email so you can see what their status is in case you need to, or prefer to, communicate in real time with some or all of them.  This is an older image from a few versions ago but the same idea.  The green indicator is that the person is currently available, has no meeting scheduled, it is between their working hours, and are currently not in a meeting with someone else.\n\n[https://i.sstatic.net/dXTEw.png](https://i.sstatic.net/dXTEw.png)\n\n>I can see anyone I need to meet with easily in the calendar, what are you talking about?\n\nGmail does not have a calendar.  You are probably thinking of Google Calendar.  Different product, same company.\n\n>Everything you listed there makes me believe whatever company you used to work for doesn't do anything but schedule meetings and have 25+ person email chains about meetings. Literally, how many hours per day are you screwing around in your email client versus, I don't know, producing something?\n\nI get a lot of emails, and I mean a LOT of emails.  But that is partially because I sit in 4 different teams across the company and one sub company.  So yes, having access to people on those teams and having their availability, and being able to see quickly who everyone is in an email is very important to me.  So yes everything I listed there make me be able to be more productive by not having to spend extra time jumping into other programs, digging though menus, or having to play email tag with people trying to get a schedule that works with 3-4 different email chains getting spawned.\n\nSo back to the original question, why outlook?  Because it saves me time.  A TON of time, everyday.",

It’s not based on paid subscriptions. \n\nThis would seem to mean that anyone that’s ever used Google drive or Chrome, for example, could qualify if they’ve opened a PDF in the browser.\n\nAccording to a Gartner report from a couple years ago, MSFT has 89% market share to Google’s 10%. This seems to be a much more accurate number.\n\nThe only contention that I could really see (and pretty much the only chance Google could overtake MSFT) is that Google has a dominance in education.\n\nYounger generations are learning using Google and they could bring that familiarity into the workforce.\n\nOverall, I think it’s much more likely that a newcomer would overtake MS Office by fundamentally changing how we operate. It’s less likely that a well established, not particularly interesting productivity suite is going to magically gain that many new users. \n\nHumans don’t like change. Unless something completely uproots their life and makes it significantly easier, they’re unlikely to make the switch.\n\nEdit: Also, Google’s business model is geared toward ads.
