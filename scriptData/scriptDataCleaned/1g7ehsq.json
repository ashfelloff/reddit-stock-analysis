That covers maybe 30% of any procedure you have to have done, which means thousands more out of pocket to actually see a doctor for anything other than a basic checkup (for example, I banged my head while on vacation a couple of years ago and had to go get some stitches, that cost $900 out of pocket, after insurance covered their part).  It only really kicks in once you hit the yearly out-of-pocket maximum, which is around $10k.  After that the insurance picks up the rest, so it's critical for any serious illness or emergency or the $500k+ cost will destroy you.\n\nEdit: actually those were last year's prices, my insurance costs have gone up about 10% this year, so it's more like $1320/mo now.  Again, my employer pays half, so my share is around $660/mo.  My wife has her own health insurance through her employer and pays a similar amount.",

I couldn't get in quickly unless I went to urgent care, still had to wait until the weekend was over so I just suffered for a couple days.  It was either that or weeks.  I checked to make sure the clinic was in-network (insurance covers in-network places to a much higher amount than out-of-network places), so it should have covered 100% of the cost with the exception of a $25 out of pocket expense for me. \n\nWell... That's not what happened.  The doctor that I saw was out-of-network.  The clinic never told me, my insurance never informed me, I didn't know until a couple months later when the bills finally started rolling in. What should have been $25 turned into thousands of dollars in debt, and I had another couple visits planned which would have pushed me well over a $10000 mark.  All the while I'm fucking insured and going to a clinic that is \"in-network\" and supposed to cover nearly all costs.  That was my \"premium\" insurance plan, I couldn't get a better plan through my job.\n\nThe entire system does everything it can at every turn to fuck us.  I'd rather take that hefty cut and not get fucked like this, it's just completely wrong.",

I pay part of the insurance, they pay the rest, and that amount isn't known by us workers.  I'd insurance wasn't handled in this manner, we would likely pay significantly more for insurance, and then we would (in theory) get paid more to cover those costs.
