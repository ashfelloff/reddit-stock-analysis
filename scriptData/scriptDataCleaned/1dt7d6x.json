  "selftext": "Based on 73 years of data, this next Wed. July 3^(rd) is historically the best day to be long for several months.  July, especially the first two weeks, is historically one of the best periods of the year.  QQQs have a large gap to close still, so pushing hard on IWM options for the next few weeks.  I opened several large short-term IWM call spread positions with profits from the last two weeks and will add in size to any weakness tomorrow. Good luck to the longs, and may history be on your side.  Slam away.  \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hub7ps1prz9d1.png?width=2878&format=png&auto=webp&s=5ce3bdf4ffbf783cd829dc76be84b7169b686c15\n\n",
