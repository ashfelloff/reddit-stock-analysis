I see it more like El Pollo Loco, not many, good quality, if you want roasted chicken you can go there, but if too many they would be ignored in large part.

Debt never makes sense unless you are pivoting into something new and need a huge initial investment. And even then I’d argue taking as little debt as possible is the best thing to do as, you don’t have to close/ reduce operations because the cost is so high. So many successful and excellent businesses have gone under because of high debt load. \n\n  What do these armchair entrepreneurs think? They accumulated all that debt in 1 day? And it’s really funny when you talk about say the government then all these lunatics come out and cry about high debt and deficits… but then bitch and moan when companies go for the sensible approach and avoid debt.",
