If you recall 3 years ago containers peaked at $25k-$28k where they made all time revenue and profits!!\n\nFurthermore on June 14th Bidens team has decided  not to continue the exemption of 25% duty on goods that has been exempt for the last 3 years… \n\nBrands and retailers cannot take the hit of 2x-3x container prices plus duties so prices will be going up…\n\nA slowdown in the economy is coming… \n\nUpdate 1: \n\nIn my industry all deals are closed with retailers in q1 and halfway q2.. so all brands are going to go back and ask for price increases hence retailers will have to adjust their q4 BF pricing deals.\n\nShipping companies will def be printing money.

Importer stock levels in Europe and the US have come down quite alot in the slowdown of the last year. The restocking phase started in Jan-Feb. I can’t see any jump in demand from actual consumers.\n\nAnother reason is that Chinese domestic demand is way down, so companies are rushing out goods to Europe and US, part of this is preparing for the peak season in shipping in July-August but another trigger can be panicky expectations about tighening import taxes especially in the US. \n\nAlso container shipping lines have been absolutely destroyed by oversupply due to new capacity coming online while global demand cratered a year ago. Red sea situation ’eased’ carrier oversupply situation a bit, but the situation is far from over for container carriers.\n\nThis is a short-term spike and I hope it won’t run into another carrier-caused bullwhip like seen in summer 2020.",

          "body": "So (at least from my little view of the world) retailers are pretty understocked at the moment. They struggled to maintain stock through covid, then massively overcompensated in 22 and sort of drew back to normal in 23. \n\nThat's creating pretty strong demand this year and most of those goods have to come from China. The Red Sea largely means the Suez Canal is out of action so shipping lines are moving a lot of boats to the Europe-China route since they have to go round Africa instead and that adds significant delays. \n\nI also heard a comment in passing that extra routes were being added between China and South America to cover the uptick in demand for low cost EVs, and those are being serviced by the same boats that would service the US.\n\nPlus there are significant tariffs being added to lots of goods this year and next and that's creating an incentive to try and bring in as many products as possible ahead of the rate increases.\n\nFeels like a perfect storm. Every week our carriers tell us they expect it will get better and every week it gets worse. \n\nNot sure how best to profit. There's obviously BDRY which is a useful ETF and seems to track pretty closely, but who's going to be the big winner here?",

      "body": "Okay, I work directly with those shipping lines and the customer base. Here's why your spot rates are going up:\n\n--Container crunch in China overall\n\n--Drought in the Panama Canal\n\n--Baltimore bridge collapse\n\n--Risks of an east coast port strike in September.\n\n--Avoidance of the Red Sea- longer transit times means containers are on the water longer, which means less availability.\n\n--Anticipation of the worst hurricane season ever on record, which will again, cause more diversions and more containers on the water for longer.\n\n--And finally, inventories. There was way too much on hand and over ordering during January 2022  to July 2023 timespan. Companies weren't getting things in time and just ordering constantly. They were SO used to \"just in time\" and had no idea what was already on the water or stuck at a port so they just kept spamming the order button. ZERO controls over that led to a glut of inventories that needed to be worked through over time. Those local inventories being gigantic was a major reason for the price decreases on containers, and those inventories are finally now depleted and those companies are ordering again. \n\nThey're not \"creating issues\". I could tell you how your company could have avoided some of these price increases but that's another conversation and you probably won't like the answer.",
