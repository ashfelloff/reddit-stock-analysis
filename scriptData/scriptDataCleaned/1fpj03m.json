  "selftext": "“The new Xeon 6 AI performance, which Intel claims is over 5 times faster than the current AMD EPYC CPU, is due to further exploitation of the matrix processors on the Xeon.”\n\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2024/09/25/how-to-write-amazing-generative-ai-prompts/?\n\n“Intel is betting the success of its Gaudi 3 on its lower price and lower total cost of ownership […] Intel indicated that an accelerator kit based on eight Gaudi 3 processors on a baseboard will cost $125,000, which means that each one will cost around $15,625. By contrast, an Nvidia H100 card is currently available for $30,678, so Intel indeed plans to have a big price advantage over its competitor”\n\nhttps://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/intel-launches-gaudi-3-accelerator-for-ai-slower-than-h100-but-also-cheaper\n\n\nRe-posted to reformat.

You have hope if you just do your research first.\n\nThe Intel forums on the other hand...good luck! I know because I had some junior engineers research the different AI hardware paths we could take about 5 years ago and the Intel stuff was sooooo bad for even basic support, like getting started. Part of my final recommendation showed that the number of total forum posts was at least 2-3 orders of magnitude higher for Nvidia than Intel. If that doesn't show you where developers are going, what else will?\n\nI suspect this half price AI chip that just came out of nowhere is Intel taking a huge internal hit on costs to try to gain some market share in that environment. It is unsustainable for them and we'll see that in 1-2 years when all of a sudden some yearly fee, or the initial costs skyrocket.\n\nBut the schaudenfraude is that they already missed the boat! The AI bubble is on the downslope and the only ones who will remain in it are the ones that don't care as much about the cost of a single unit!",

          "body": "I'd be happy to explain this in simpler terms for someone who's not familiar with coding or technical jargon. Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. Processor comparison: The person is saying that comparing a new chip to an EPYC processor (made by AMD) for AI tasks isn't meaningful. It's like comparing a sports car to a truck for a race - they're not typically used for the same purpose.\n2. What's actually used for AI: Instead of regular processors, AI tasks usually use specialized hardware called GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). These are much better suited for AI work because they can handle many calculations at once.\n3. Adoption challenges: For a new AI chip to be successful, it needs to be significantly more efficient (faster and use less power) than existing options. Also, companies need to trust that the technology will stick around for a while. The person suggests that Intel, who's trying to enter this market, doesn't currently inspire this confidence.\n4. Big tech companies' strategies: Major tech companies like Google, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are developing their own specialized AI chips. This means they're less likely to switch to a new option from another company.\n5. AMD's advantage: The person believes AMD (another chip company) has a better chance of competing with NVIDIA (the current leader in AI chips) because their technology is similar and can run the same software with minimal changes.\n6. Intel's approach: Intel's new AI technology (called Gaudi) requires users to modify their existing code to work with it. The person suggests this extra step might not fit well with how companies currently develop AI systems.\n\nIn essence, the main point is that entering the AI chip market is challenging. It's not just about having fast hardware - it's about fitting into the existing ecosystem, being efficient, and gaining the trust of big tech companies who are also developing their own solutions.",

Anyone could come along and design a better stack than CUDA and have an equally good chip knocking Nvidia off the top spot.\n\nI’ll put it this way. Sony has sold the PS5 at a loss as hardware sales but they make up for it on the backend by requiring PSN subscriptions for almost anything you do gaming wise. PSN being the software.\n\nXbox has done the same thing. There’s hardly anything unique about Xbox live or PlayStation plus that would drive someone to go one way or the other and both consoles on a hardware front are on par with each other so it’s mainly exclusive games and brand loyalty that drive consumers one way or the other.\n\nSo in the instance with Nvidia CUDA (software) is so good that no one is willing to leave the software stack and thus Nvidia can continue to leverage high margins on their hardware sales. That is what makes this announcement a nothing burger. It’s irrelevant on multiple levels.\n\nIf Intel came out and said our software stack is light years ahead of Nvidia and AMD then sure that would be worthy of news. It’s also laughable that they are claiming to be the H100 when again, Nvidia is set to release the GB200.\n\nGoing back to the PlayStation analogy this is like Nintendo coming out and saying we’ve designed a new Wii and it’s better than the PS4. Meanwhile Sony is releasing a PS5 pro and designing a PS6.\n\nSee how stupid it sounds now?",

Once again, by this logic, nobody will ever launch anything because somebody’s future work might be better.
