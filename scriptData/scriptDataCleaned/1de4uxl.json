BYD’s additional tariff is only 17.5%, Geely is 20%, but state owned companies like SAIC will be paying an extra 38% because it’s got more government subsidies and didn’t cooperate with the probe.\n\nAnd many EU countries, including France, have openly said Chinese companies are welcome to build factories there. \n\nConsumers will get more choices, Chinese companies get to profit and more jobs will be created in Europe. That scenario would be good for everyone in the long run.\n\nThis isn’t a trade war, it’s reasonable trade policy and very much different from the 100% tariff the U.S levied, which might as well be a message of “fuck off and stay away”.\n\nEdit: However it is interesting to note that Germany and most of the large EU automakers are against the tariff. Internally it turned into a bit of a fight between Germany and France: https://www.politico.eu/article/france-germany-conflict-eu-chinese-ev-electric-vehicle-duties/",

We've got firms buying up residential real estate left and right to turn America into a permanent cash cow as renters. However, stopping foreigners from buying up SFH en masse would be a good start. The only politicians talking about that are right wing lunatics, and the liberals are saying its racist. No one gives a shit if someone wants to buy a vacation home in Florida to use 6 months out of the year. But it is baffling how America allows businesses and individuals from a foreign adversary (China) to buy up all of the single family homes on the West coast, to gouge Americans. At least BlackRock buying houses mostly stays in the US. Americans renting to Chinese landlords is just money being siphoned from the US consumer directly to the coffers of a geopolitical rival.",

There are tons of places in South FL (I’m in north FL but my parents are still down south) that have been torn down and created into houses and apartments or bigger and better chain stores (Publix, Walmart, Wawa?). If your a small business or a now useless office building, there is a huge chance that will be torn down and turned into housing as quick as possible to take advantage of the high housing prices.\n\nIt’s crazy to see my childhood city be turned into “affordable housing” when the truth is everything was way more affordable back in 2018, and we had way less housing.

      "body": "China has imposed significant tariffs on imported vehicles for decades. Foreign companies wishing to enter the Chinese market have been compelled to manufacture locally, relinquish 51% ownership to a Chinese partner, often aligned with the CCP, and transfer their intellectual property to this partner.\n\nIn response, Western nations should adopt similar measures for Chinese companies accessing our markets. We should require Chinese firms to establish operations locally, mandate 51% ownership by local entities, and enforce IP transfer. This approach mirrors China's long-standing practices.\n\nChina should be able to compete under these conditions without complaint, as it has imposed similar requirements for the past 40 years. The EU should consider raising tariffs to 100%, in line with the USA. China's support of Russia has enabled ongoing destruction and war crimes in Ukraine, and both nations are responsible for widespread disinformation and propaganda in our media. It’s time to remove China's influence from our markets.\n\nChina has chosen to align with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, viewing the West as an adversary. It is crucial for us to acknowledge this reality and adjust our policies towards China accordingly.\n\nChina’s state-backed subsidies to its industries create an unfair competitive landscape, undermining Western manufacturers. Enforcing similar regulations would help level the playing field, ensuring fair competition.\n\nAdditionally, intellectual property theft by Chinese entities remains a significant issue, with substantial economic losses for Western companies. Requiring IP transfers from Chinese companies could mitigate this problem and protect our technological advancements.\n\nEnvironmental concerns also warrant stricter measures. China’s lax environmental regulations and carbon-intensive manufacturing processes have led to significant global pollution. By compelling Chinese firms to adhere to our standards, we can promote more sustainable practices.\n\nFinally, national security concerns arise from the integration of Chinese technology into critical infrastructure. Insisting on local ownership and IP transfer would provide greater oversight and security, protecting our interests against potential espionage and cyber threats.\n\nBy adopting these measures, we not only address economic and security challenges but also promote fair competition and sustainable development.",

China accounts for around 33% of global manufacturing exports, but only imports around 14%, and they're trying to widen that gap further. Many countries don't have manufacturing industry to cede, so there's predictably pushback.\n\n\nFree trade is not, and has never been, a case of unrestricted access to foreign markets. Balancing imports and exports has always been done. There is no rule that says no tariffs, where did you even pull that from?
