So how would you rate a strategy where I take profits from an Nvidia or Meta and reinvest it in SPY or an all world ETF. I’m thinking that way I’ve reduced the risk for myself but also haven’t liquidated the positions entirely. Especially keen to hear - Has anyone else used this strategy? How has it worked for you? ",

Way less stable and unpredictable than now.\n\nThe positive scenario is the US being able to eliminate their presence (and by nature blow-back) and allow their regional powers to take up the mantle all while working under a common framework. This would still be a net positive for the US.\n\nIn general I am just extremely bullish on the USA for the coming decades. They still possess a massive competitive advantage across every metric.\n\nMy biggest issue with the US are it’s debt…and how so much of the capital is coming from\ncentral government vs the private sector. In general this could be solved but there are issues for sure. Just read up on demographics more outside of the Americas.\n\nI’d be bullish on LATAM (long term), South East Asia and parts of Africa in terms of international markets.
