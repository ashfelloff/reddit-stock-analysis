Another reason to exercise is that  sometimes spreads are super wide on options. With Jan BABA, that is not the case, so it is easy to sell and not lose much due to spread. And again, that would be more if you were trying to close a position early, but spread was silly wide, so you exercise early (also want to factor brokerage fees into that decision) then just sell shares. Like when I say sometimes it makes sense to exercise, I'm probably talking less than 1% of the time.",

      "body": "I‚Äôll give you a serious answer though that may help you understand‚Ä¶\n\nLet‚Äôs say that PLTR trades flat everyday all the way to contract expiration date. Every single day your cons will decrease in value even though the stocks not moving. If PLTR stock went down by a $0.10 to $0.15 everyday for the next two months or more, You lose money. \n\nIf PLTR goes up in the same increments you make slightly more money. So in 2 of those 3 scenarios you lose money‚Ä¶ see what I‚Äôm getting at?\n\nSo the most likely outcome of every options trade is 33.3% chance you win and a 66.6% you will lose. It gets more technical but for your current situation these are your odds now.\n\nIdeally if you have 2 cons you would sell 1 and let the other run. In the case of a 100% trade absolutely sell one and play with house money. Now you can‚Äôt lose. In your case you have 3 and you have achieved 200% which puts you way above average market investment returns.\n\nSo you should sell 2 cons and basically lock in a 100% trade and see how much higher PLTR goes. If your runner drops to 50% sell it and lock in 150% gains and be happy. If it continues up just move the goal post higher till it drops and touches it.\n\nJust my advice",
