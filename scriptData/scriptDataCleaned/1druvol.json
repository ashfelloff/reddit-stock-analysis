Let's not act like this was the sole reason the bank failed every single large bank had more than their fair share of dogshit bonds.  It was a systemic failure and if they didn't acquire that bank that wouldn't have stopped them needing a bailout.  And also what do you people think we should have done just sat by idly and told everyone hey fuck your retirement we are going to implode the entire worlds economy to teach banks a lesson.  It's like COVID stimulus and loans yeah it's not the best solution but what's the alternative just let everything fail?\n\nAnd again RBS made the deal and clearly didn't do anywhere near the level of insight they should have because they like the Bear Stearns of the world just thought the party would keep going.\n\nSo you are back to square one with one asshole ripping off a group of richer assholes.  Hard to find a sympathetic figure in any of that when the end result was always going to be taxpayers paying for bad business decisions",
