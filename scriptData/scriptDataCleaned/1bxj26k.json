So an adversary has incentive to try and break ECC and sha256 on the largest addresses. That hasnâ€™t been successful. There are other bounties like sha1 and sha256 out there if you solve a collision in sha1 you get the bitcoins that are secured by that script. I think there is one for sha 256 that hasnâ€™t been broken yet. I think the sha1 puzzle was solved a while ago.",
