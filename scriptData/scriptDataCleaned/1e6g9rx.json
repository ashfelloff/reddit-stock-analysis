Especially for small transactions--and when it comes to insider trading $35k net profit is pretty damn small.\n\nMy guess is that this is a practice that this person engaged in prior to being caught, and that other people with whom he either worked directly, or who worked in the same industry and he knew personally, often engaged in.\n\nSo when you see everyone else doing it and not getting caught, you have done it yourself before and not been caught, and you say to yourself \"there is a less than 1% chance this trade will ever get any scrutiny,\" it probably feels like prison is something you will never have to worry about.\n\nA person with a particular mindset might even get pretty stupid and bold about engaging in insider trading under those circumstances.",
