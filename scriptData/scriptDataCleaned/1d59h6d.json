You wrote up a amazing post about buying put options on CRM (Salesforce) and how and why.  I read your whole post, then followed up and did my own digging, and really feel in love with the play.  I went forward with it for a huge gain.  I then took that knowledge and momentum towards enterprise software and found MDB (MongoDB) and again and even bigger score.  I am so grateful and amazed by what happened.  I am Dad and expecting another Baby boy on the way. This is will certainly help me massively.  Keep strong ya'll.  It only takes one ( maybe two ) trades to change everything.  I am going to protect this like my kids.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8la96mnfmu3d1.jpg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aca89057a472d786f46f74c7b7c97eab98369e70\n\n",
