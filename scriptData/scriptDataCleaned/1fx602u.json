I’ve had 3 Teslas in 10 years or so. Bought stock when I got my first one because I loved the car so much. Now I vacillate. Still love the car and I’ve done well with the stock but keep thinking it may be time to bounce. Don’t want to sell my car and take a loss though, and not sure what to do with the stock. I was once fascinated with Elon. I’ve read the Isaacson book and admired his thinking and ability to actualize. I got worried with his twitter habit and ever since he opened his mouth and got backed into buying that company, I’ve slid into a world of tremendous disappointment and disenchantment with the man. Not sure what my point is here, but I’m conflicted. Just doesn’t seem like Wall Street or the world outside of the USA is.",
