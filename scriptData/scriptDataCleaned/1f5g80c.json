      "body": "Thanks for your submission! \n\nr/WallStreetBets is known for making absurd but sometimes profitable trades that no one ever considered possible.\n\nTo keep making that possible, we need your help in keeping the feed of threads interesting and exciting.\n\nWe try to move all the short and basic questions, analysis, or jokes to the daily thread so that the best quality content can stick around and be more visible. \n\nThis is definitely a bit subjective, and there are no hard and fast rules, but a few indicators that your post should have really been a comment in the daily thread include:\n\n* Asking a question that is easily googleable or has likely been asked before. E.g. \"What app should I use?\", \"What should I invest in?\". \n\n* Beating a meme to death, like the 10 millionth, \"inverse cramer\" joke again. \n\n* Reposting jokes from the front page but slightly altered to be related to trading. \n\n---\n\nAll that being said, we are here to help. We want to make it as easy as possible for you to post to our community. We have to balance this with making the subreddit interesting for our readers. \n\nIf you need some guidance, don't hesitate to [reach out to modmail](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) and we'll give you some pointers!",

There are many options but the 2 year bond and the 10 year bond are important. If you were to buy a 2 year bond, and your money is locked for that period of time, would you assume it should yield more interest than a 10 year bond(your money is locked up for 10 years on that one)?

So breaking up alphabet into YouTube and the search engine etcetcetc won’t change any of that “problem”. So I don’t think a break up is coming as it makes no sense, or do I get this wrong?\n\nSecondly I also doubt the US gov will want to put stones into Google the search engines way. It’s an American company with a world wide monopoly (besides some cases in Asia that just straight up ban it). It’s not worth it for the US to break up the monopoly at home if that breaks the companies stance in the world. The US over all would loose out. \n\nI’d like to think that the line of argument will be: yes Google is a monopoly on the surface, but looking at the underlying factors of a monopoly Google cannot be seen as such. In contrast to a let’s say oil monopoly where a company would control the entire oil supply with no other company having access to the market, Google does not hold this power. It does not own the supply. It’s simply a superior product. To me, IF they end up doing something about it which I highly doubt, it would be to create Google and Boogle two identical search engines that can fight it out and develop against each other.",

Other search engines have said themselves it would take 20 years of burning money with no profit just to catch up to Google in terms of data and indexing. Then there is the situation of all websites letting Google scrap there websites for free but other search engines have to pay a licensing fee. Why? Because every website knows if Google doesn't scrap their website for indexing reasons they become obsolete. Let's also talk about how Google is saying if websites don't let them use there data for AI, they will push them back into unseen search results (using their monopoly status to get what they want and lock out even more competitors). And finally just some quick numbers. Google has 95% of the mobile search market and 82% of the desktop market. How is this not a monopoly? It is literally impossible for another company to compete.",

      "body": "I am also 100% in Alphabet due to several reasons. I think we are in a similar situation to Meta when it was faced with law suits, reached 90$ last year and everybody said it would die. \n\n1. Alphabet is growing in the double digits every year since its inception. Its PE is laughably cheap for a tech company with that growth. \n\n3. They crushed earnings and the only reason for their slump afterwards was their heavy AI spending, which they can easily cut if they see its not worth it anymore. Also comparable to Meta.\n\n2. Alphabet is a leader in innovative technologies such as autonomous driving. Tesla shot up 40% or something when Elon made another promise towards autonomous driving, while Google actually is the first mover and build up a network with hundred thousands of paying users. \n\n3. I dont think that AI will be as useful as some still expect. But in no way Google is endangered by that. I dont have more recent numbers, but in July Googles market share in the search business grew slightly, while ChatGPT declined by 12%. I think the summarised answers in Google search are already way more useful and convenient than what Bing or ChatGPT offers. \n\n4. If AI presents itself as useful Google and Meta will have the best model. People misunderstand how AI works. Its not the model which is important, its the underlying set of data. With the deal it closed with Reddit beginning of 2024, google honestly struck Gold for a really cheap price.\n\n5. Tech companies are literally what keeps the american economy and influence in the world right now alive. I think its not realistic to think that the DOJ will do anything which substancially weakens an american tech company at this point. They will probably get a slap on the wrist in a way of a (big) fine. But priced in is currently a potential break up.\n\n6. Atleast for the next earnings I expect an ad revenue \"short squeeze\" because of the really polarized american election. Way more money will be invested in ads than in previous elections, and while the sum on its own isnt that much, depending on how elastic the ad market is, it will drive up ad space for everyone involved.",

Tensorflow, the OG deep learning framework isn't even being used by Google anymore except for legacy products.\n\nTheir attempt at social media? Busted years ago.\n\nAndroid and Fuchsia development? Stagnant for years. The current Android market share and income is momentum from the monopoly they built years ago.\n\nThe cloud? Everyone prefers AWS or Azure to their insane big brained billing.\n\nTheir customer service is so bad it's virtually non-existant. They are so incompetent that trolls and scammers run amok in Youtube ads and no amount of reporting helps.\n\nAnd what about the very thing that made them what they are... SEARCH. You can't find shit anymore on google. It's all ads, clickbait and no useful information. They lost the battle to SEO and AI search is on the rise to combat it, but they don't seem to be participating in it.\n\nThey keep doing the same they've doing for years, dumping the price with their \"free\" products to squash the competition and then hoping they will become paying customers. Except it's not working anymore and free users don't really give money except for selling their data. And about that... They have lots of lawsuits coming for their shady business practices.\n\nCurrent CEO Sundai Pitchar is a tool doing nothing to fix things and only interested in milking the cash cow riding on the monopoly they built over 10 years ago. I wouldn't touch the stock even with a pole.",
