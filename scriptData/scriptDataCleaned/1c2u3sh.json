But Steiner a genetic freak and not normal, so that's actually a 75/25 fight in Steiner's favor.\n\nThe fight they're about to do is a 1 on 1 on 1 at Sacrifice. Kurt knows he can't win against him, so he won't even try, so it's actually a 66.6%/33.3% instead of the 33.3/33.3/33.3%.\n\nSo you take the 33.3%-25% chance due to the 1 on 1 fighting ratios, and it's 8.3% chance of winning the 1 on 1 on 1 fight at Sacrifice for Samoa Joe\n\nBut you also need to add the 75% chance of winning to that 66.6% chance of winning, because of the 1 on 1 fight ratios as well as the 1 on 1 on 1 ratios, which gives Steiner a 141.6% chance of winning.\n\nI don't get what's so confusing about this, he explains it very clearly.",
