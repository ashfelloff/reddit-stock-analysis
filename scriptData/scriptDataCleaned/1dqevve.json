They have won a few big government military defense contracts recently and have become profitable. One future catalyst is also their inclusion in the S&P 500. One downside of the company is their stock based compensation which they have cut down on in the past year. There hasn’t been also as much insider selling. I plan on holding for 3-5 years at this point. \n\nRegarding Adobe, I only own a few shares but took a risk and bought before their recent earnings.

      "body": "There are things here that are a little late here imo (cybersecurity - I own CRWD and I'd like to own a bit more but I'm not chasing it at this point; much of technology, parts of healthcare) and a couple that are problematic themes that people keep wanting to be a thing because they were growth stories years ago (fintech, evs.)\n\nThe automotive industry has - with a couple of exceptions - never been a good place to invest and EVs don't change that. It's remarkable to me that you have this list (and many of these companies that are now either bankrupt or near bankrupt only went public in 2020/21): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GQvwk3Xa0AAXDO9?format=jpg&name=large and that there's still so much eagerness to throw money at EV names. \n\nGiven that EVs are being written off at the slightest ding given the added complexity and cost, Copart (where so many cars go that have been written off) has been a winner but that's not something people talk about because it's not slick.   https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/scratched-ev-battery-your-insurer-may-have-junk-whole-car-2023-03-20/  \"Insight: Scratched EV battery? Your insurer may have to junk the whole car\"\n\nFintech has largely turned into either being largely commoditized (payments) or unappealing (lending, digital banks; the market massively underappreciated the risks inherent in both during the \"distruptive growth\" bubble of 2020/21 - \"The AI way to lend\" turns into \"holy shit\" the moment the economy cools and it's revealed that the \"AI way to lend\" suddenly had to take a lot of loans on its books that it didn't think it would, not to mention if anyone read the S-1 they would see that the company's algo had little experience with downturns.)\n\nTelecom isn't a good business, people think it is because the services are so ubiqutious.\n\n\"I'm looking for a mix of stability and growth potential, aiming for a diversified portfolio that can weather market volatility and tap into new opportunities.\"\n\nI agree with this - I think people often seem to either be more conservative or all growth but  rarely somewhere in-between. I think it's a good idea to have a solid core of well-managed companies with a proven track record of delivering over time along with some selected quality growth names where you think that the company has a significant TAM and is well-managed/built to last. Trying to achieve that balance in a way that matches your risk tolerance and gets allocation right takes some time and effort but I think is worthwhile. \n\n\"E-Commerce: The booming online retail space.\"\n\nUltimately, it becomes a play on the consumer and if the consumer is not doing well it isn't either. We're at a point where WMT/AMZN/TGT/COST are increasingly where people shop for everything.  SHOP went from saying that they were arming the rebels against the dark side (Amazon) to working with the dark side. SHOP is still sort of an interesting play on the rest of the internet, but I think for all the discussion of it being a potential AMZN challenger, that was questionable to begin with and after ending their attempt at logistics, AMZN's dominance of that remains a key element that it's going to be extraordinarily difficult for any younger company to even get close to. People's attempts to buy logistics robots companies has gone badly aside from SYM and that's really IMO just largely due to a heavily shorted small float and the WMT stake. Someone can invest in Amazon landlord PLD but with that it's really why not just AMZN. \n\nThere's other physical retail tech names but they either haven't done that well or in the case of some of the names in other countries providing things like digital shelf tags, what is the long-term for that business after the rush of retailers buying them initially? \n\n\"Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, and other clean energy sources.\"\n\nPeople thought in late 2020 that clean energy would be a sure thing/easy money and you can literally see it on the chart of ICLN. That topped about a month or so after the pile in peaked and literally just continued South.  It's now down about 55% since January 2021. I think there's elements of renewable enegy that are interesting and doing okay and there are elements that have been obliterated (residential solar) that probably don't have too much more downside but it's very clear IMO that without lower rates they will continue to struggle/it will be difficult to sustain any upside. IMO, one has to question at least a little bit whether or not some subsectors of clean energy really are reliant on lower rates to be sustainable businesses.\n\n\"Emerging Markets: Opportunities in rapidly growing economies.\"\n\nEM and international imo remain name-specific and not something that I'd play with indexes, but even with that how many compelling single name opportunties have come up in recent years? China's regulatory issues towards tech remain a concern and elsewhere, there's ... MELI and NU, with the latter interesting as a smaller more speculative situation and the former as a rare EM name that has actually delivered pretty consistently over time and that hasn't really had regulatory issues (or at least major, sustained ones)?",

SQ down 77% from peak, ZM down 90% from peak, SNOW down 65% from peak, PYPL down 81% from peak, Docusign down 83%, TDOC down 97%, I can list many more. \n\nWhen you look at the value of a SAAS company, you have to consider how big the addressable market is and how much value is added(to determine pricing power), and then consider realistically what the barrier to competition is to determine realistically how much they can get away with charging for their product.\n\nI think a big mistake investors make is assuming that these SaaS companies can continue their growth in perpetuity, so they extrapolate growth out way longer than is realistic.\n\nPretty much the only SaaS stock that has done well for an extended period of time such that earnings actually materialized in a way to justify its peak valuation is Microsoft. But that's because they have a massive software ecosystem that businesses literally run on, and competing with that is near impossible. And their price to sales was never really that outrageous.\n\nIn the case of Crowdstrike, yes cybersecurity is a growing industry and important, but it's still ultimately an overhead expense for companies, rather than a driver of profits. So companies will look to cheaper solutions if Crowdstrike attempts to hike their prices too much, and there are only so many companies in the world that they can sell to.",

Obviously a company that is rapidly growing will have a higher P/E than a company that is growing slowly, or declining.\n\nBut at some point there's an extreme, where you need to consider \"how much does this company have to grow to earn a good ROI?\n\nFor example in the case of Crowdstrike, taking into account their 75% gross margin and assuming R&D/overhead stays flat, if they tripled their sales, they would still be trading at a P/E above 20. Then when you look and see how their revenue growth rate has been declining each year, despite their SG&A and R&D expenses growing substantially, you can see why this is a problem.\n\n>They have a ton of flexibility to make cuts to return money to shareholders once they've topped out on growth.\n\nI've seen this happen many times where a mature SAAS company gets complacent, and when they start trying to target profitability, they lose market share and become irrelevant. \n\n>Also, there are tons of SaaS companies where earnings have actually materialized. No idea how you think Microsoft is literally the only success story in this arena.\n\nName one that has had a P/S above 25 and a market cap above $50 Billion that actually managed to grow its earnings in a way to justify that high valuation.\n\nYou look at the big winners in SAAS like Adobe and Salesforce, that actually materialized, either their P/S was below 10, or their P/E was below 25.\n\nInvestors paying 40x sales and 800x earnings for SAAS stocks is a relatively new situation. There's a lot of fear of missing out that may be overcompensating for their business model.",
