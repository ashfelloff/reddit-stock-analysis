You massage your credit spread based on how bearish you're feeling with a further out negative breakeven, but on most days a take profit limit of 2%-3% (or less) is realistic will reduce your net debit by 20% to 35% easily.\n\n\nSure, take a punt if it's gonna be the next black Monday but saving $40-$100 per put spread is not chump change and can go towards more put spreads if you're so inclined.",
