  "selftext": "I've never eaten at a Wingstop. There is one near my office but I never thought it was a $10> billion company. But PER is at 150x. Chicken wings better than AI chips.\n\nBut the company has negative equity and it pays dividends and does buybacks by raising debt. Wingstop has a steadily growing cash flow from franchises and can meet the interest payments. But the stock price is supported by creditors who wouldn't be paid in full if Wingstop can't refinance. \n\nShould I be worried or is Wingstop the next Chipotle success story?",

The stock price is really held up by the amount of institutional ownership causing a bit of a supply side price increase, however I believe it is a total bubble that needs to pop. It will be a long squeeze down back to a respectable PE.\n\n(I'm guessing here)The stock price is also somehow justified because technically Wingstop is listed as a tech company because they have an app and algorithms have a much lower risk tolerance exchanging tech stocks at these levels of PE.\n\nThere ya go.

But inflation hasn't been quite as hot recently. The new platform seems to be something that adds value more for them than for me as a customer, so idk why it justifies a big price increase.\n\nPlus some of their stores seem to be in areas that a lot of fast-casual chains wouldn't locate in.

      "body": "Wingstop is a franchise so individual locations will probably vary.  My town has a BW and a Wingstop so I decided to try them both.  BW was overall better but I thought the flavor of the wings at Wingstop were slightly better.  Neither one was really good, though.  Personally, I think Wingstop is a tired brand.  I don't see what's appealing about them now vs 5 years ago.  I also think the restaurant sector is in for more pain until the rate cuts actually start.  They are facing higher costs and decreased consumer spending for at least a while, still.",
