  "selftext": "I already made a “DD” post last week so I’ll just link it in case any ghey berrs saw the new Mad Max this week and are looking for redemption — beats repeating myself on why you don’t bet against these United States of NVDA.\n\nOver this past week, and especially after this bullshit dip over the last two days, I decided to double down and buy more leaps to go from 36k -> $76k. \n\nThe writing on the wall’s clear to me — Jensen is using their piles of cash to return value to shareholders (that buy something called a ‘share’, I don’t fucking know). There was no other reason to go that aggressive with a 10:1 split otherwise. They’re also gunning for a DOW inclusion which’ll be bullish in its own.\n\nWhy is he doing that? Simply because they’re printing cash and they don’t know what else to do with it in the short term. Blackwell’s R&D for instance, cost $10B. They’re guiding ~$30B in revenue _next quarter_.\n\nPositions: 3x $1040 Feb ‘25 leaps, 1x $1240 Nov ‘24 call (looking to sell this one asa the split fomo kicks in)\n",
