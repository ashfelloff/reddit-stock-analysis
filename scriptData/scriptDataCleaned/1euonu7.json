  "title": "How common is insider trading really?",
  "score": 551,
  "selftext": "When I consider the millions of publicly traded companies worldwide, the countless accounting firms involved, and the myriad CFOs, CEOs, and board members—along with their spouses—it's hard not to wonder if it's naive to believe that insider trading is only a minor issue. The temptation must be enormous. Think about it: Analysts' targets are public, you already know whether you'll beat expectations or not, and it wouldn't be difficult to find someone on the other side of the world to execute trades on your behalf. Payments could be made in crypto, gold, freaking wine bottles or whatever. The opportunity to exploit earnings information seems so staggeringly easy and potentially lucrative that it's almost impossible to believe—given human nature—that this isn't happening far more frequently than we know.",

So I checked it out...and it was being bough pre-market. When market opened it was already 20% up... and there had been articles published by like MSNBC, New York Times, Yahoo, etc... and like I was checking the time stamps of when those articles had been published... and the time stamps had been at like 5am in the morning and stuff... And some had been published hours before others... Like I think New York Times had been first to publish. \n\nNow, my strat at the time was like... I'm not going to buy a stock that's already rocking a 20% pop... and the stock actually popped off another 20% on top of that 20%. Which would have been really nice gain. \n\nAbout 10 years ago, I was being recruiting into a trading firm - but I declined because they want you to trade their way. Which would be to basically ride momentum of stocks. So THEY most likely would have jumped on that FOMO. But not me. especially with a stock like DNUT... \n\nAnyways, I've been trading for over 20 years now... but that DNUT stuff was very damning evidence for me on insider trading... \n\nEspecially when, it was announced like 9 months prior that McDonalds was going to sell Krispy Kreme... so why just some random day did the stock decide to just pop 20% pre-market? And in the articles... they basically just talked about McDonalds to sell Krispy Kreme in 2025...",

Firms have a very tight grip on their employees in this regard and take it incredibly seriously.  Independence and integrity are at the heart of audit firm’s business and as organizations they need theses pillars to be strong and defend them with serious vigor.\n\nWhen you work for an accounting firm and reach a certain level, a level where advantages from being an insider could be obtained they start to track daily your ownership of securities, your business relationships with financial firms and other related interested parties.  They link your investment accounts and receive daily data packages from your brokerages to scrutinize you holdings.  Security purchases all have to be pre-cleared and depending on the status of the form with the security in question you are either able to purchase, not able to purchase or able to purchase with the caveat that you will be forced to liquidate if the firm takes on an engagement with the company you bought a security for.  Firms have entire teams dedicated to this task and the control doesn’t end with the employee of the firm, it extends to their spouse and children.\n\nThe consequences of being “offside” can be extreme.  If you knowingly violate the intent of the controls you can and likely will be fired.  If you do it accidentally they will hold back promotions, bonuses and raises.  Each tier higher you go in the leadership structure forces an extensive audit of your personal and business relationships and finances.\n\nThey don’t fuck around.",
