On the eve of what was said to be the largest IPO for Ant Financial, which baba owns like 30 something percent on, Jack Ma verbally shot himself by saying the Chinese finance industry operates like a pawn shop. \n\nChina immediately killed Ant’s IPO, launched an investigation, and went after baba. Many think Jack Ma was killed, but you occasionally hear about him every once n a while. Regardless, China won’t let baba make it. \n\nI finally sold, taking a 50% loss and a part time job tugging meat behind the dumpster at Wendy’s. I just can’t see baba doing anything other than being eclipsed by competition that hasn’t wronged the Chinese govt. that’s my take at least.",

Buying a put means you are paying a premium for the agreement to sell 100 shares of a stock at the strike price.   \n\n\nSelling a call means you collect a premium for accepting the risk of if the stock goes down (you profit 100% of the premium) or if the stock goes up (unlimited loss potential) and will buy 100 shares of a stock for someone else to sell. This is why covered calls are important because if the sold call gets exercised, you're only out what the stock originally cost you to buy. \n\n  \nSelling a put means you're agreeing to buy 100 shares from someone at a strike price. If the price goes up, you profit 100% of the premium. If the stock goes down, unlimited loss potential. This is why covered puts are important for loss mitigation.\n\nI.E if you buy a call with a week to earnings on TSLA, the IV (implied volatility) is likely around 100-150%, which in turn raises the premium price of the contract. \n\n  \nIf you buy a 2 year call on SPY for example. Say the market is pricing in a 20% increase over those 2 years. You are also pricing in a 20% increase over 2 years. It would make more sense to buy the stock outright because the premium for buying a call/put at exactly what the market thinks will lose you money. Yes, you only paid 1400 dollars and that was your risk, but if it rises that 20% you didn't profit anything because the premium priced that in. \n\nWith options, you want to buy at low implied volatility (IV) and sell at high. This would mean buying a call a few weeks before TSLA earnings and selling it at the peak, or vice versa if you think the stock will go down after earnings.",
