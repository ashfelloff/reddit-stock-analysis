When the market thing was just both parties putting in the trade then both clicking accept.  \n\nSo anyone reading this that didn't play runescape (talking mid 2000s or earlier i can't talk about recently).  Firstly folks would sell to nooks stuff that wasn't worth alot but sounded cool.  The other was trading something good, say a dragon scimmy for \"cheap\" so when the buyer would send the money and click accept, the seller would quickly switch it out for something crap and click accept, thus the deal goes through.  There was maybe a second chance window you had but if you weren't paying attention and the item looked the same then you're fucked.\n\nI got scammed like everyone else did at the start.\n\nDamn I remember a hustle I had where id get noobs to go mine runes.  There was an island youd go where folks needed blank runes to level up that skill. I forget the technical details but youd be alot of clicking in this with dozens of folks running these runes and then folks buying it (usually high levels with alor of cash who couldn't be bothered running themselves).  So id pay noobs tuppence to get me the runes, then pay someone else to meet me at the boat.  Id do to the grade make a few of then give em like 100 or 200 coins.  If they figured out all they had to do was go to the island the  rheyd just leave.  I done that hustle for a long time and got me alot of money in the game.",

And Roblox is not even a iPhone app. Its played more than 70% on iPad and PC.\n\n>On the iPad app store, Roblox is currently ranking as the top one grossing app (out of all applications). A similar pattern can be observed around the globe. Name your country, Roblox will likely be leading the iPad app-store ranking on top-grossing apps.\n\nGenuine questions: How does that compare to Q1 though? If it was always ranking that high and they still missed on Q1, then it's not necessarily a bullish signal for Q2. We need to see what the  qoq change is not just the absolute performance in Q2 because it doesn't tell us much about the results from their initiatives.\n\nLikewise, how much of the data you've looked at is actually from Q2 vs July? If most of the ramp up in activity was at the end of Q2 or even July, you may not see the juicy numbers come in until Q3.",
