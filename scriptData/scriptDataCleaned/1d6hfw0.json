  "selftext": "Ever wondered where that one good play is? That one gamble you‘d throw your whole life savings at? Well you sick apes if you listened to me last friday your calls would be already worth +30% . https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/vYojHVvnHl\n\nSo here‘s why I YOLOed my whole life savings into long term LULU calls (exp JUN07):\n\nThe market overreacted after the last earnings report, causing the stock to crash. Historically, the stock is now significantly undervalued. And looking at the chart, LULU has only dipped deeply below $300 ONCE, back in 2020. For the past four years, it has ALWAYS rebounded quickly from the $300 level, making this a prime buying opportunity for you apes.\n\nLULU also has a solid financial health, a strong market position, and high-profit margins. Their new products hit stores in May, which bodes well for the next earnings report. Regarding the product officer who left a few days ago: yes he left but that won't impact next week's earnings, not even Q2 but it will have effects in 2025. There’s no way this stock won’t go up after pricing in the worst of the worst\n\nTLDR: LULU‘s weakness is overstated. They have great fundamentals, solid financial health, consistently beat estimates, and after the market's overreaction last time, the stock is poised to rebound. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 \n\nPosition: 28k worth 72 350C for JUN07 balls deep already 11k gain printed. I‘ll post the screenshot below. ",
