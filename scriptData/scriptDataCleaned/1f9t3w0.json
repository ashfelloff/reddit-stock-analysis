  "selftext": "I bought some $PARA 15c 1/17/25 a few weeks ago on a whim just because they’re trading at $0.03-$0.07\n\nParamount produces big blockbuster movies like Top Gun, Indiana Jones, Transformers, etc. \n\nTheir streaming service is cornering the nostalgic millennial market with full seasons of All That, Angry Beavers, Aah Real Monsters, Avatar the Last Airbender, etc. \n\n With the NFL regular season set to start, they are offering live games on Paramount+ for $30/year, or $60/year if you wait until after the season already started. \n\nThis could potentially be the smartest dumb thing I’ve ever done. \n\nOracle stock is up over 35% since January. Let’s see if Larry can boost PARA too. ",
