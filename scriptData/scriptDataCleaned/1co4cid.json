  "score": 221,
  "selftext": "Hey fellow apes,\n\nJust wanted to share some exciting news regarding the MSOS ETF's top holdings, Trulieve and Green Thumb. Both companies recently posted huge earnings beats, crushing expectations and demonstrating their strong growth potential in the cannabis sector.\n\nGreenthumb expected to buyback 48mil worth of shares. Trulieve printed 134 mil in OCF. \n\nThe market is taking notice, with massive call interest for May 17 at 10/11/12 dollar strikes, indicating bullish sentiment and expectations for further upside. MSOS is currently trading at $9.20 and is poised to rise significantly in the near term, especially with such strong performance from its top holdings.\n\nKeep an eye on MSOS as it continues to ride the wave of cannabis legalization and expansion. This could be just the beginning of a major rally for the ETF and its top holdings. üöÄüåø",
