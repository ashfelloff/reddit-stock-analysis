And for upcoming earnings, it might (with the stock price run-up in advance, the market may be disappointed by anything short of a monster beat of earnings expectations).\n\nAlso, over-valued stocks don't necessarily need a \"catalyst\" to drop.  Stocks usually top on valuation first well before a catalyst or a change in sentiment occurs.  It's difficult to know at what P/S valuation the stock will top at in advance, but the extremeness of P/S over-valuation could often be a hint of how far the stock may potentially fall once the momentum flattens out and then reverses down.\n\nOne last caveat though:  Everything I said above generally only applies to stocks trading in large cap valuation territory (like $10 Billion or more in market cap).  Small-caps and micro-caps are a true casino that could rocket even on zero company revenues.  Also speculative pre-revenue biotech stocks with drugs pending FDA approval - P/S ratio can be meaningless for those too.",

Hence the dramatically lower P/S ratio of 2.25x  (vs. Palantir's 40x) and dramatically lower P/E ratio of 17.5x(vs. Palantir's 100x+).  KMB's $45 billion market cap is half that of Palantir (near $100 billion).\n\nPLTR mega-growth is priced in.  You end up getting mega-growth?  Congrats, you paid fair value and got fair value.  You get anything less than that, you over-paid.\n\nI'm also skeptical of the mega-growth story.  Too many red flags:\n\n1. Insiders selling like crazy.\n2. Tech guys (the ones not on investing forums) say their stuff kind of sucks and is nothing all that special.  Just aggressive sales & marketing for mediocre stuff.\n3. I see way too much \"marketing\" of the stock itself on social media.  Suspicious amounts.  Seems very cultish.  I've never seen so many investors naturally get excited about an esoteric niche B2B consulting company that... helps people spy on people?  Spouts weird techno-babble about \"[ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology)\"?  I dunno... but I doubt the vast majority of PLTR investors really know, either.\n\nMost important question I have though is:\n\nName me ANY company trading at a 40+ P/S that has worked out well as an investment on 1-10 year time horizon?  I can't think of any.",
