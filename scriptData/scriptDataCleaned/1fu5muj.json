Client is short a put that expires in the money. He doesn’t have the cash in his account to buy 100 shares. So at this point he will have to buy 100 shares no matter what. Well fortunately, I can place a trade for him in the after hours to sell the 100 shares before his exercise purchase goes through. That guarantees there’s no market risk for a position that the account can’t support. What we don’t want to happen is the client ends up with 100 shares at the strike price Monday morning and the stock tanks in pre market. Then they will sell at a potentially larger loss and may have an upside down account.",

If not then that’s very likely why it was closed\n3) there’s probably an option to tell them you want to let it expire even if you don’t have the buying power. \n\nBut again, if they see you can’t exercise the option, and you haven’t told them to let it expire worthless then they are assuming the best thing is to do close it early for you while it’s still worth something. Gambling with 0DTE on options you can’t even exercise is not why options exist as a tool in the market so your broker does not assume that’s what you’re doing with them unless you make sure your settings reflect that.",
