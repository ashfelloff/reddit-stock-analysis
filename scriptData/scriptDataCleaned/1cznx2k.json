When a call contract drops in price, the fundamentals of the contract have completely changed and thus it has a new price.  A call option that cost $0.01 is almost guaranteed to lose you money, unlike a stock.  You don't pile in to a $0.01 option because you think it's a bargain.",

But with option you lose money if the stock move the opposite ways. So for earning play just gamble 1 or 2 contracts of close to or at the money call or put (although they it’s more expensive) instead of 10 otm contracts. So if the stock move 1 way or another you will either make great money or lose it all. But OTM options will almost always make you lose all your money because IV crush on top of theta decay and most likely expire Out of the money and the small change of  you making money is only when the stock move 15-20% move which for a large cap like that it’s hard (although Nvidia did it before) . But that’s just my experience.",
