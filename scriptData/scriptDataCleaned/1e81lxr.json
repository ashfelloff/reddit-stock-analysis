The novelty wears off quickly - though they can still be fun its not **there.** \n\nThe biggest problem with these right now is \"human like\" memory over longer time. It can be super convincing in demo scale of minutes to hours, when you can fit everything in-context. But, when we look at days, weeks, months... the limits become obvious - and the user experience reflects this. \n\nSystems to manage context are making those days to weeks interaction better, however, invariably the longer these systems are used, the limits become blatant and the \"illusion of intelligence\" falls. We can still pretend to not see them and have fun - but it's not the same as actually being fooled and sucked into the illusion - **being there.** \n\nI think that LLM core based systems are going to be limited by this for awhile, even if just by cost at scale. Perhaps, alternative core may yield better (more humanlike) results (not necessarily LLM free systems, but not using it for the core). \n\nAnyone working on this right now is probably going to look like a steamy dump... its still unproven. Or, at-least a polished turd if they know what they are doing on the sales side.",
