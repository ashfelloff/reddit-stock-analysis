  "score": 2049,
  "selftext": "Today when there was a technical glitch, I put a market order on BRK A share, I had less than 500 in my cash account so thought if I’d get filled it would be great. But it filled me above 700k, almost had a heart attack when looking at my account which was displaying -700k. Broker said it’s under review. What do I do? What are the possibilities? Am I doomed or can I benefit from it? Attaching a screenshot as well. ",

Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)\n2. Public Works Administration (PWA)\n3. Works Progress Administration (WPA)\n\nSome of the projects were completed in various areas and then they would just bus people over to a side of the road and say \"You need to dig this ditch\". And they would. After a hard days work it was done. The next day a new pile of people were brought over to the ditch and told \"Hey you need to fill this in\" and so they did. And both teams were paid a living wage.\n\nEventually all this crazy started to help and progress was made to provide relief for the people and unscrew the economy.\n\nThis \"error account guy\" is the modern FDR at Interactive Brokers HAHAHAHA",
