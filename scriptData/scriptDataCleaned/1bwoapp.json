It's been trading below average volume for the past week and it's down 34%.\n\nOne negative catalyst is trump will eventually sell to cover the legal fees. Another is that trump will lose the 4/15 case, have to pay a massive fine, and will have to sell assets, which would be disastrous for the stock because any time trump fails, this stock fails. Another, later catalyst, is the election, if trump has a good chance to win, this will rip, and if he is likely to lose the stock will go down. \n\nThis stock won't just magically go up because a bunch of hedge funds forgot to read the fine print. They know the value is below 2$/share and they will hammer it down to 2$/ share. A short squeeze would happen if this stock was worth 50$/share but shorts insist on dragging it down like they did with GameStop, which was trading way below market value for years.\n\nTrump is also suing his own investors, for whatever stupid reason, which is another factor pushing this sit down as fast as it is.",
