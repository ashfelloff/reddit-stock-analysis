      "body": "Okay, if you want to have an honest conversation about gold, here goes.\n\nImo, investing has two sides, attempting to make money, and attempting to preserve value of money. On one hand, realistically, gold is an excellent way of making sure your money is *less* affected by inflation. It’s a great way of hedging against the economy when it’s on a downturn. Given fiat instability and the huge debt of the US Treasury, gold has been a great investment in that regard.\n\nBut, you’re not realistically making gains. What do I mean? Well, if you compare the value of gold to the value of the dollar, it’s inversely proportional. Value of paper dollar go down, gold go up. But if the value of the dollar goes down by half and gold doubles, you didn’t just make a 100% gain, you just kept the exact same value. All you did was protect yourself from inflation.\n\nSo, why do I say this? \n\nYou posted the question of “why aren’t you putting all of your money into a protection plan” in a subreddit completely dedicated to the other side of investing. This sub is where people go to try to make money, not protect it. You can answer your own question by simply looking at the sub. There’s plenty of subs to post in, namely r/investing, which would be more suited to this sort of post, but this is literally called wsb because people are betting their money to make huge gains or lose it all. Do you really think this is the place where people are going to put a lot into gold??\n\nFor what it’s worth, I think gold isn’t even a great hedge against the economy anyway. There’s plenty of ways to hedge against the economy, but in the next decade we will either have an economic recovery or a complete economic collapse, and respectfully the funny metal has no real value other than speculation and electronics manufacture, so if the dollar really does kick the bucket, nobody is going to give a shit about gold. You can’t eat it, you can’t use it for anything, it’s just shiny and historic. It’ll be about as worthless as BTC in the case of a collapse, and in the case of a recovery it’ll just return to a lower value. It’s only really good in this “are we in a recession?” interim period because there’s still room for speculation, but if shit really hits the fan, copper and lead will be significantly more valuable to hold physically than gold could ever be.",

And at the same time you had two huge back to back recessions in 2001 and 2008. So your numbers are accurate, but cherry picked.\n\nCheck out [this chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart), and you can see that gold had been dipping for nearly 20 years, and hit (nearly) rock bottom later in 1999. If you'd bought both gold and the equivalent S&P 500 in the decades before 1999, today the S&P would have been worth quite a lot more.",

Inflaction adjusted, its worth 3 times what it was in the 70’s, and its worth almost 6 times from the 2000 dip.\n\n\nSure, we can cherry pick numbers if you'd like. Gold is currently at $2,344.46 per ounce and was almost $2,700 per ounce in February of 1980 (inflation-adjusted). That's an inflation-adjusted loss of over 13% for the last 44 years.\n\nMeanwhile for the S&P500:\n\n>The average yearly return of the S&P 500 is 11.3% over the last 50 years, as of the end of February 2024. This assumes dividends are reinvested. Adjusted for inflation, the 50-year average stock market return (including dividends) is 7.18%.\n\nSo gold has lost over 13% in 44 years, while the S&P500 has returned over 7% per year during that time, both adjusted for inflation.",

          "body": "No. Gold is a commodity that has a price like any other commodity. When oil or cobalt go up in price, it does not mean that fiat currencies are being overall devalued. Part of the goldbug religion is that gold is secretly still the only “true” currency, even post-1971, and so they proclaim rises in gold’s commodity price to be exactly equivalent to inflation in either all fiat currencies, or sometimes just the USD for some reason. That’s the only way that gold rising in value equates directly to other currencies being devalued: if you believe that gold is imbued with sacred economic power by a deity. \n\nTruthfully, gold is bought and sold for numerous reasons, and this activity impacts its price. It’s bought as a hedge against inflation, so its price does rise with inflation. But right now, it’s also thought to be rising in price as Russia is having trouble doing business in rubles, USD, and Euros, and needs something else of value to trade for war materiel. China is stocking up on gold because they trade heavily with Russia and because their USD-denominated holdings and reserves look riskier the closer they get to open trade or military conflict with the USA. There aren’t really any currencies besides euros or USD worth holding as reserves in significant quantities, so gold makes sense for China to hoard. Speaking of global political economy, it wouldn’t shock me at all if India’s stock market boom is filling dowry chests for millions of people, also driving up gold prices. It also has industrial uses and is of course used in a lot of consumer goods like jewelry and stupidly expensive food.\n\nSo tl;dr: no. Gold is just something that a lot of people want for a lot of reasons, so its price goes up and down.",
