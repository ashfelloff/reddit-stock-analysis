      "body": "Let's be clear about something: 100% of rate cut are irrelevant for most investors and big daddies talking about rate cuts are just trying to stir investors into one or another investment strategy. \n\nJust ignore the noise, especially, because it is hostile.\n\nExplanation: do you borrow money to invest in stocks? if not, relax -- rate cuts have 0 influence on your investing lifestyle. If you do: please stop, even if the rates are 0%. Next: even if some money in the stock markets is conditioned on the existence of near rate cuts and the money is removed after the rates hopes will be shattered, there will be enough money still invested and stocks are still going to have the same mechanics as when people believed in over 9000 rate cuts.\n\nClarification: I am not in the \"new normal\" camp. It is possible, as I note, that some companies and even indexes will go down in the near future. But it is always a possibility and if your investing strategy even assumes that \"now is the time to be hungry\", you need to rethink your life choices. So again, reminding us that stocks may go down is a bit irrelevant as we all know that.",

          "body": "Except that during Biden's tenure, Inflation - a lagging indicator - came down from over 8% to just over 3%.  \"All this money he is giving away\" that you think is directly exasperating inflation is spending budget for the next 10-20 years.  It's not like his admin is like, \"oh yea we just shelled out $400billion for infrastructure\"... that's spending over 10-20 years. That's not money immediately entering the economy, and it's not contributing to inflation in a meaningful way... Oh yea, and this money is being pumped into long term investments that benefit our country over the next several decades.\n\nTrump removed oversight of PPP loans resulting in an estimated 25% rate of fraud on over a trillion dollars of direct spend in under a year, while fighting for negative rates, and doing all he could to give massive tax breaks to corporations as quickly as possible... incurring another $350bil in deficit for our country every year from the tax cuts alone.  In his first 3 years, BEFORE the pandemic, Trump was on track to outspend Obama's entire 8 year tenure, which included getting us out of 2008. The only Presidents with higher deficit spending than Trump were Lincoln Bush and Roosevelt who were, you know... fighting the Civil War, Afghanistan, Iraq, and World War fuckin 2. Trump was handed an economy on easy mode and fucked us all, just like he has fucked every single company he has ever led.",
