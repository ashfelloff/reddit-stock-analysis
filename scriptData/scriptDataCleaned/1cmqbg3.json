At the same time admins were recently shadow removing comments about the Harry Potter game.

They have to say something because otherwise people get pissy that they are not being transparent. No one likes when the Fed keeps changing its mind, either. One of the biggest blunders the Fed can do is going back and forth without any sense of stability. Macro-economics are slow, so minor adjustments are needed and it takes time to see if they are working without going full regard and turning the dial to 11 or going in the opposite direction.\n\nIt's the people who take out tiny snippets and extrapolate them that something imminent is about to happen.
