  "selftext": "Considering the main stuff holding their valuation back was they werent working with Nvidia as much as industry leaders like Dell, their actual order flow was spotty for servers and AI sales, and had iffy guidance. \n\nNow they already doubled Q1 profits and they haven’t even started reaping the benefits of their MSFT AI contracts or their US gov Cloud server sales. Plus working directly with Nvidia on most of their new stuff. I know anything can change daily but if the pipeline pans out why would their valuation remain 1/3 of the industry leaders if they are poised to join them on their level?\n\nPosition: x30 contracts $21c @ Aug 16",

(Never mind that Dell has been doing this successfully for 30 years.)\n\nSo they split into HP and HPE. If you look at the stock performance of both socks in the last five years it’s actually the computer guys (HP) who are ahead. The consumer computer guys have actually doubled the performance of the data centre guys.\n\nSo was funny for me to see as an observer in the industry that the dysfunctional part of HP was actually the data centre and server folks. And they just spent billions of dollars on basically a dead company who has been irrelevant for quite a long time. \n\nThey’d be a $50 stock by now if they purchased NTNX and pure storage of the right time.\n\nAlso, anecdotally I worked at Dell for a time around Covid and we had an influx of HPE employees join us because HPE couldn’t manage to pay the commissions on time.",
