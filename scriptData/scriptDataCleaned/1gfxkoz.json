How many times have users on this sub made the correct directional call only to be lucky to break even or even lose tendies because of the IV drop after earnings?\n\nI was fairly confident that RDDT wasn't going to go backwards massively, so was happy to take on the risk of getting shares assigned. If I did get assigned, my strategy was to immediately sell ATM covered calls whilst the IV was still high to minimise losses. \n\nWhat I liked about this play is that if my options expired this week >$78 and <$81, I was going to pocket $150. If the stock had moved only a marginal amount above $81, then I was going to be able to pocket any extra amount over and above the $81.\n\nCompared the above to if I'd just bought straight calls at $4.20, to break even the price had to get above $85.20. Anything less than $81, I would've lost $2,100.",
