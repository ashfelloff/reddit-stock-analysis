  "selftext": "[https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2024/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results/](https://investor.redditinc.com/news-events/news-releases/news-details/2024/Reddit-Announces-Third-Quarter-2024-Results/)\n\nThe company reported a 68% year-over-year increase in revenue to $348.4 million and achieved GAAP profitability with a net income of $29.9 million, representing a net margin of 8.6%. Daily Active Uniques (DAUq) grew by 47% to 97.2 million, marking new levels of user engagement.\n\nAdvertising revenue surged by 56% to $315.1 million, while other revenue streams increased by 547% to $33.2 million. Reddit's gross margin improved to 90.1%, up 280 basis points from the previous year. Adjusted EBITDA reached $94.1 million with a margin of 27.0%.\n\nSteve Huffman, Co-Founder and CEO of Reddit, commented, \"It was another strong quarter for Reddit and our communities as we achieved important milestones, including new levels of user traffic, revenue growth, and profitability. Reddit continues to be one of the most visited and trusted sites in the world with opportunities available to us that aren’t available to most companies.\"\n\nThe company also reported positive operating cash flow of $71.6 million and free cash flow of $70.3 million. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Reddit estimates revenue between $385 million and $400 million, with an Adjusted EBITDA ranging from $110 million to $125 million.\n\nEDIT:\n\nu/JohnnyTheBoneless (me) has posted a lot about Reddit as a stock play over the past quarter. Here's the list. Most are on r/wallstreetbets while a couple others are on r/Burryology (the ones that were WSB auto-modded).\n\n* [Reddit's partnership with Google is worth closer to $50M per quarter rather than the reported $15M](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1f893d8/reddits_partnership_with_google_is_worth_closer/).\n* [\"What's happening is the financials are inflecting and becoming very profitable, very quickly\", said Reddit's Chief Financial Officer to WSJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1fopt8o/whats_happening_is_the_financials_are_inflecting/)\n* [Jefferies initiates coverage of Reddit (RDDT) with a price target of $90 (currently at $70)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Burryology/comments/1fzr2pw/jefferies_initiates_coverage_of_reddit_rddt_with/)\n* [VY Capital buys 4.4% of Reddit (RDDT) in Q3.
