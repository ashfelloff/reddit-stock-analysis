Apply 2x leverage to that and you end up at $182. 5x leverage ends at $272. 10x leverage $144. 20x leverage $0.02. Most index funds rarely decrease more than 1% in a day so even 5x leverage should be a safe bet. For a 2x ETF to be worse than 1x, the stock would need to decrease by more than 5% every other day.\n\nCurrently holding a 5x leveraged Magnificent 7 ETF, the mini crash this April only made it drop like 2% total by the time the underlying recovered. Which is fair considering it outperformed the underlying by about 400% in the weeks afterwards. Of course this same ETF dropped by 99% during Covid so I guess don't trade leveraged stocks in the middle of a global crisis. Otherwise you should be fine, even over a few years or so.",
