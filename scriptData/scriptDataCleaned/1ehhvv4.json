  "selftext": "I've long been a believer in LUMN and their turn around. When Microsoft announced the partnership I wondered how long it would be before the short sellers started exiting. I've been holding LUMN and averaging down since 2021 to get to 1.86. When it hit .90 I went all in on a bunch of contracts. It's happening!! Unlike the video game stop, I haven't seen a single halt on the way up. Congrats to all the believers!\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7wjs91uja2gd1.png?width=1321&format=png&auto=webp&s=32456ae6dc2b2f31ed528ff7cde48acefa863f31\n\n",
