  "selftext": "So I think it's a really awesome feature that every year $3k of capital losses can be claimed to make the tax year more bearable. I figure I will be lucky to live another 70 years, so I was thinking what if I intentionally accrue $210k capital losses in the near future as part of my retirement strategy? Is this legal?",

      "body": "First of all. What do you mean by accrue? Do you have an existing investment that will lose $210,000 if you sell it? Is there no hope that the asset might recover some value? So your first question is if you think it might recover then how much? Think of it this way...if it's worth $10,000 today, and $20,000 next year then your rate of return on current $10,000 value is 100% over one year. Can you do better with your present $10,000 value of your take your losses and reinvest the$10K? If it's hopeless then grab your $10K before you lose it too...\n\nFor tax purposes, in most cases you can't \"write down\" a losing investment if you continue to hold it, so you can't use the losses until you sell. There are exceptions for professional traders and write-downs of certain business assets. \n\nAnd finally, it's not just $3,000 per year you can use. If you have capital gains in future years you can use the loss carryforward to offset those gains until the $210,000 is used up, plus you get $3,000 of capital loss per year. So, if had a gain in 2025 of $20,000 then you use up $20,000 in loss carryforward plus you get $3,000, so your carryforward in 2026 would be $197,000, and your taxes would be computed in 2025 as though you had  $3,000 capital losses to offset income from other sources.",

It's also not very bright IMO, because while you'll save a LITTLE in taxes each year, you'll still be out $210,000 less the tax \"savings\".\n\nDon't intentionally take losses in your retirement account.  Those losses are real and non-deductible.  In your retirement accounts, work towards a goal, and always evaluate your investments in terms of long-term quality.\n\nGetting back to the non-retirement account--When you die, any remaining losses not used on your final tax return are LOST.  Zero tax savings.  Let's say you die with $60,000 in unused losses remaining.  Your heirs can use $3,000 in losses on your final return.  The rest is in Tough Shit Station, the place where no one wins.\n\nOne thing you CAN do is to take end-of-year tax losses to offset your year-to-date gains and up to $3,000 more.  This is a valid strategy IF you have paper losses and want to utilize them.  Many people sell a loser in December, intending to buy it again almost immediately.  DO NOT DO THIS, as buying it again within 30 days is called a \"wash sale\" and is not recognized for tax purposes.  Buy it again in 25 days?  Wash sale.  Buy it again in 32 days?  Valid.\n\nOne last bit of advice, take it as you will--Never let the tax tail wag the dog.",
