  "selftext": "Can someone explain to me how Broadcom is doing so well when the stats don’t back it up? \nIt doesn’t have a high monopoly in its infrastructure server market. \nIt isn’t making a lot of money or net income or revenue. \nIt’s definitely not a huge household name like TSM.\nWhy is the stock price so high and the market cap so high? Is it just inflated and just doing to fall?",

AI capex growth isn’t a near-term oriented decision. I won’t argue about small businesses and startups going all in on some narrow AI play, but that’s not what we’re talking about here when the subject is semiconductor investments. These are mega caps that don’t even have to rely on debt to finance their spend.\n\nThe near term benefits are unexciting, but that was never the primary goal of this spending. That being said, I think you’re fairly delusional about the subject if you think it will take *decades* for AI to bring broader benefits.

                      "body": "Great question, I found this AI generated response from last September and here's what it said.  To be taken with a grain of salt, but I found it interesting.\n\nThis article aims to analyze the financial performance of hypothetical subsidiaries of Broadcom over 10 years, considering their growth rates and net profit margins. By dissecting the company into three separate units—Broadcom Saturated, Broadcom AI, and Broadcom VMware Merger—we can better understand its future financial prospects.\n#### Assumptions and Methodology\n1. **Broadcom Saturated**: A mature business with a quarterly revenue of $6 billion, 40% net profit margin, and an annual decline of 5%.\n2. **Broadcom AI**: An emerging business with a quarterly revenue of $3 billion, 40% net profit margin, and 20% annual growth.\n3. **Broadcom VMware Merger**: A hybrid business model with a quarterly revenue of $3 billion, 40% net profit margin, and 15% annual growth.\nThe analysis focuses on the 3rd, 5th, and 10th years to give a snapshot of the short, mid, and long-term financial performance.\n\n#### Financial Projections\n##### 3rd Year\n- **Broadcom Saturated**: $21.64 billion in annual revenue, $8.65 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom AI**: $17.28 billion in annual revenue, $6.91 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom VMware Merger**: $15.88 billion in annual revenue, $6.35 billion in net profit.\n##### 5th Year\n- **Broadcom Saturated**: $19.37 billion in annual revenue, $7.75 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom AI**: $24.88 billion in annual revenue, $9.95 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom VMware Merger**: $20.54 billion in annual revenue, $8.22 billion in net profit.\n##### 10th Year\n- **Broadcom Saturated**: $14.33 billion in annual revenue, $5.73 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom AI**: $73.76 billion in annual revenue, $29.5 billion in net profit.\n- **Broadcom VMware Merger**: $44.92 billion in annual revenue, $17.97 billion in net profit.\n#### Shareholder Value\nAssuming Broadcom has 412.69 million outstanding shares, the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for each segment in the 10th year would be:\n- **Broadcom Saturated**: $13.89\n- **Broadcom AI**: $71.45\n- **Broadcom VMware Merger**: $43.54\nThe combined EPS would be $128.88.\n#### Valuation Metrics\nWith the current share price at $900, the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio based on the 10th-year projection would be approximately 6.98. This suggests that the market is valuing the future earnings of Broadcom quite conservatively, given the strong growth prospects in AI and the VMware merger.\n#### Conclusion\nThe financial modeling exercise shows that Broadcom's future looks promising, particularly in the AI and VMware merger segments. Although the mature business is in decline, the strong growth in the other segments more than compensates for it. With a projected 10th-year combined EPS of $128.88 and a P/E ratio of 6.98, Broadcom presents an interesting case for long-term investment.\nPlease note that these projections are hypothetical and for educational purposes. They are not to be considered as financial advice and should be supplemented with comprehensive financial analysis.",
