RKLB has a great balance sheet, is profitable without neutron R&D, and keeps signing new contracts.\n\nI know ASTS just signed some big new contracts, but they just started making revenue and still need to get more satellites up there before they can really do much. Their business simply isn’t as mature. Yes they have growth potential, but tomorrow? A lot of things need to happen before they can fully run their business.\n\nAgain, not saying ASTS won’t be something someday, but right now, why favor it over a business that has shown to be functional and working?",

              "body": "Copy and pasted what I sent to my buddy on why I think its a safer bet than NVDA. remember, Nvda is overbought right now, intel is oversold. A stock market moves on supply and demand, once institutions take profits on NVDA it will be a long way down.\n\n“NVDA has a massive monopoly on the GPU market used at datacenters for AI accelaration. They are so high in demand that they can basically charge whatever they want for the chips. There are a few bottlenecks to the operation.\n\n1. The reason they are able to charge so much is because of the software that connects all the chips together called CUDA, this is the software they use to train AI. This software only works with NVDA products. This is the reason everyone wants to uss NVDA because currently there are no better softwares for AI acceleration. \n\n- Intel is partnered with Google, Qualcomm (massive chip maker),Samsung (another massive chip maker). They are all working on making Intel’s software called One API to try to undercut NVDAs CUDA. This software would enable datacenters to use any brand chips they want, (like intel’s Gaudi 3 which is twice as good as NVDA’s H100 flagship GPU for AI acceleration, and also half the cost)\n\n2.they depend entirely on TSMC (which is in Taiwan and the whole reason China wants to take Taiwan) on making their chips. TSMC makes chips for 92% of the world’s semiconductor market(they make chips for NVDA, AMD, Apple, etc). So when NVDA designs a new GPU, they send the design yo Taiwan and then TSMC makes and packages the chips. These factories are called foundries.\n\n- if China decides to strike taiwan, NVDA stock will dump\n\n- the only reason intel as a stock is down right now is because they are investing all their money into building out 5 foundries around the globe with two of them being in the US.  One in Arizona, the other in Oregon. Once these foundries are all online, NVDA, AMD, etc will all come to intel to make their chips so as to not rely on TSMC exclusively as well as to take advantage of Intel’s more competitive prices.\n\nanyway the point is once NVDA cant charge those prices anymore their stock is going to correct very hard. I dont want to be a bag holder when that happens because their stock price is 230x their earnings per share rn. Super overvalued. “",
