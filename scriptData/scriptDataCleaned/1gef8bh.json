I had to borrow some money from my parents. \nIn my darkest moment, cigarettes is what saved me from doing anything stupid. I was smoking close to 3 packs a day on average for that week.\n\n\nJust continue working, and get a second part time job. From 2022 Aug until now, I made back around 250k(from work and trading) now from just trading btc with leverage. (Got into a huge leverage position when btc is at its lowest) \nMy job ain't even that high paying. Just 3k a month and part time job around 1.5k a month (before expenses and taxes)\n\nIf you want to make a come back, you need to work hard. I was working on avg 12h a day for 7 days a week for 2 years (Full time and working delivery gig)\nI spent everyday 3-4hr trading and learning how to trade. \nYou have to give up on your social life. I only meet my friends every 2-3 months. \n\nRight now, I am just staying home and day trading btc. Risking 1-2 % per trade. On average getting 5% profit a month. I am not going to risk as hard as before. I had made a killing when btc was at 18-20k and ride it to 70k\n\nWhat you need to do is ask yourself do you really think you have what it takes to be a trader and whether you are willing to put in the effort. \nLastly your money is long gone. You can never get it back. You just have to write it off in your mind. \n\nIt is definitely not easy in this journey. Be it you give up on trading and become fully focus in your career or you learn and perfect trading, I wish you all the best. \n\nDo pick up a religion if you are free thinker right now. It is what that made me believe and succeed. Religion is really important.",
