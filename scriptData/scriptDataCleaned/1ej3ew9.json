  "selftext": "Everyone is freaking out about recession and also citing buffet selling half his stake in aapl as proof. But the reality is buffet doesn't time the market he holds good companies through recessions. But if you look at a lot of his other moves, sold all his TSM and a large portion of BYD as well. Its clear that buffet has geopolitical risks on the top of his mind, aapl would be obliterated in the case of a taiwan war. \n\nAfterall, why wouldn't he sell his American express position in a material way, wouldn't they get hit hard in a recession as well with delinquencies and decreased consumer spending? \n\nI guess this post doesn't really offer much reassurance as a taiwan war would be worse than a recession. But honestly I think you should trade like it wouldn't happen because if it does it would probably devolve into nuclear war and currency would be irrelevant at that point. Just my 2 cents.",

When he first started investing he would read through all sorts of financial statements to gain an edge. Apple is trading at a relatively high multiple compared to the PE ratios he likes. He‚Äôs also big on companies with huge brand loyalty. That is arguably eroding a bit for Apple. He also invests in what he knows and part of Apple‚Äôs current valuation is from AI hype, and I would imagine he doesn‚Äôt have a solid grasp of AI. It was also such a huge part of his portfolio so he could be selling to diversify more. Lastly, Munger passed away within the last year, and it‚Äôs possible Munger was pushing for an Apple position larger than Warren wanted.",

Over the last 10 years I was always seeing people making the jump to Apple but I feel at this point everyone who was going to make the jump already did. In other countries the import taxes on apple products are high enough that making the jump to Apple doesn‚Äôt make as much sense as domestically. \n\nPair that with the fact that apple products have gotten better at longevity and even those loyal to apple are buying the products slightly less frequently than before. Apple has ramped up its subscription services though which is a growing stream of revenue.",
