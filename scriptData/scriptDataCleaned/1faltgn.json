  "selftext": "I made a little infographic of “lost decades” from just the past 100 years of stock history.  The shortest lasted 15 years.  Two of them lasted 35 years.  One is ongoing with no end in sight.  If I were 30 years old, I’d ask myself “Am I more interested in preserving my life savings or in getting one day of excitement posting loss porn?”\n\nBut alas, I’m sure the non-regarded geniuses will inform me how “this time is different.”\n",

Let's not forget how SPAC-shitters like Chamath could basically sell any PoS bankrupt company that's probably not even worth pennies for \"$10 a share cause it's cheap!\".\n\nNot as insane in valuation upside or upside multiples but certainly as bad if not worse in egregiousness of the val multiples they were selling at or price-to-quality. At least the dotcoms had a period of upside where folks could get out. Most of those SPACs lasted around 12months before being underwater if they were ever above? Most of those SPACs were often money losing, no revenue, cash burning, and/or trash companies with garbage goods/services. SPCE Virgin Galactic was literally a shell for investors to pay Brandson to go to space and likely to go bankrupt. Virgin Orbit went bankrupt already. CLOV was committing fraud against medicare. Astra went from like ~$13 to ~$1 only to get taken private (robbery but legal!). Nikola EVs turned out to be trash, their CEO committed fraud against investors, got sued, and did a reverse 1-30 stock split to reach that whopping >98% loss (over or under on them going bankrupt?). Terran Orbital went from $10 to $0.25 and likely to be taken out by LMT. etcetcetc.",

This is probably also the reason why the German DAX does not have such long \"lost\" years, although it only consisted of 30 companies that are mainly very export-oriented, while the large companies that are less hostile to the global economy (food for example, like Aldi and Lidl) are not listed on the stock exchange, i.e. it should have a higher volatility than other indices which are more diverse. However, the DAX is a performance index that includes dividends. The longest period was 7 years (2000 to 2007), but there it's also theoretical if you had invested all your money at the ATH instead of investing from let's say 1995 to 2010 every month (DCA).",

                  "body": "In 1999 I had a net worth of about $50k.  This was not candy money.  Per the total return calculator at ofdollarsanddata.com (including reinvested dividends), an investment of $50k in SP500 with divs reinvested starting 1/1/1999 would be worth ~$347k today having compounded at slightly less than 8% per year.  Presuming I’d worked, saved and invested along the way then I’m ok to assume my net worth would have grown to perhaps $2 million via buy and hold indexing.  But instead, even after tons of taxes, living expenses and an expensive divorce, it’s instead grown to around $14 mil, ie 280x.  (The SP 500 has grown around 4-5x, nowhere near 280x. Your previous statement is easily disprovable to anyone who spends five minutes researching it.)  So while I’m fine with haters, my original post was aimed at younger investors who actually want to learn from history rather than mindlessly following the crowd and believing they have some sort of special investing acumen. The main lessons I learned along my journey are that there are times when everything is cheap and no one has cash to invest, and that those are great times to generate wealth.  There are also times where everyone is investing with both hands and where the downside risk greatly outweighs the upside potential.  I believe the US is at one of those points currently and that, even if there’s some room left in this bull market, that sometime in the next few years there will be a much lower-risk, higher-reward period for people who still have liquidity.  Feel free to disagree, but anyone calling me a “dipshit bear” better be willing to honestly share their long term results as I have.",

The lost decades are pretty similar to those shown for DJIA and (not as bad, but still super long) compared with NASDAQ.  My main point is that 500 stocks (vs 30 shitty industrials or a very tech focused index) won’t save investors during brutal bears.  For people who are all-in on SP500, they may want to consider diversifying some into bonds and possibly gold.  When stocks tank, it usually happens pretty uniformly.  The amount of hate-spewing I’m getting from the original post reinforces my belief that a lot of younger investors are far too concentrated in the SP 500 (or individual stocks) and literally have no appreciation that when the party ends, it can take half their lifetime to recover.  I don’t know if the party is ending or still has some room, but I do firmly believe the risk/reward is not favorable for US stocks currently.",

In the past I’ve played around with these types of charts and websites.  My conclusion was that reinvesting dividends certainly helps, but that long serious downturns will mess with everyone’s portfolio and often occur simultaneously with them losing their job and not being able to double down on stocks since they need their savings for living expenses.  I suggest anyone who is putting a large part of their net worth into US stocks spend a little time doing searches for these types of charts to gain perspective on stock market history.  People are giving me tons of hate here (no biggie) but I’m serious when I say that studying history has helped me make some really opportunistic investing moves and also to avoid some really big mistakes.  I definitely felt FOMO in 1997-2000 when my friends were all boasting about their stock gains, and I mostly sat out the bull market, but I was able to way more than compensate for it after the crash.",

Its lost decades were similar to the DJIA and NASDAQ in length of time.  Percentagewise it wasn’t nearly as bad as NASDAQ circa 2000, but SP 500 still lost about 50% peak to trough.  The biggest thing I remember from that period is that friends who had always wanted to talk about stocks a few years before suddenly wanted to talk about anything else.\n\nYou’re right that recession, 9/11, etc occurred during the same period as stock drop.  Personally I don’t think it’s a coincidence.  I think the recession was directly tied to the same down economy that roiled stocks.  Regarding 9/11 and the wars that followed, I have to believe that enemies of America would want to kick her when she’s already down.  For instance, around that same time, domestic terrorists were sending envelopes with poison (some sort of white powder) to powerful people.  I have to believe they timed their evil to coincide with the other negative stuff happening at the time.  The parallel to today might be an economic recession that coincides with higher taxes/lower govt services (based on need to reign in deficits).  If Dems win control of POTUS and Congress, I doubt anyone would be surprised at higher cap gains taxes, which would likely hurt stocks immediately.  (If you were a tech billionaire with billions in unrealized gains, wouldn’t you start selling before the new cap gains tax went into effect?)  In 2008, the original bad news trickled in at first, but then compounded quickly.  The bad stuff seems to clump together in my experience.\n\nDCA:  yeah, absolutely a good strategy.  The reason I made the post is bc it feels like many on WSB are all-in on the S&P and many literally believe stocks can’t go down.  DCA works great if you hardly have a nest egg to begin with.  But for people who’ve gotten some big wins and have a notable net worth, I think it makes sense to diversify part of their stock winnings into shorter term bonds, and maybe some gold.  If indeed we are headed into a lost decade, or something analogous, then the diversification should help preserve capital to really load up on equities if they get cheap.\n\nMy own experience:  I was in my 20’s during dotcom boom.  Most investors were just as adamant then, as now, that stocks only go up.  I owned some stocks but mostly held CDs during the bubble period.  The market crash occurred over about a two year period.  During that time I started to DCA, and fortunately had most of my net worth available to do so since I mostly sat out the bubble period.  Had I been all-in at the bubble peak, I wouldn’t have had much to add during the downfall, especially since I (and many people) lost my income.  When stocks tumble, it’s often because most people simply don’t have liquidity to keep buying.",

          "body": "I don’t disagree and I think young folks have gotten a raw deal from previous generations.  IMO, America is barreling towards a debt crisis. Our deficit is something like 7% of GDP (insane for peace time) and major entitlements like social security and Medicare are headed towards crisis.  I don’t see any of the solutions below as good and could easily rock the economy and knock the stock market far off its perch.\n\nI have teenage kids.  The financial advice I’d give them today:\n\n1.  Before college I’d advise them to carefully consider their career and decide if a college degree makes sense.  If so I’d encourage a state school with lower costs and graduating as fast as possible.  Partying is fun, but my college tuition was ~$3k/year.  Today’s prices necessitate taking coursework a bit more seriously. \n2.  In the work world, I’d advise them to always live below their means regardless of income.  If you can’t afford it, don’t buy it.  Pay off credit card in full every month. \n3.  If they’re in a low cost of living area I’d suggest buying a house with 3-4 bedrooms and renting out the extra rooms to roommates.  (Pending a financial analysis.)  To me, that’s one of the few easy wins.  Rents from roommates can largely cover the mortgage and build equity for the owner. But housing is super expensive currently.  I’d hurl in lowball offers and only buy if one was accepted. \n4.  For investing, AT THIS POINT IN TIME, I’d likely encourage dollar cost averaging into roughly 50% stocks and 50% short term bonds.  (At many other points in history I’d likely encourage 100% stocks for young people.)\n5.  I’d advise what worked for me which is:  Not every moment of everyday represents a way to build sustainable wealth, but some periods are exceptional.  When they occur, go decisively all in.  For instance, during the housing bubble I didn’t buy a house, but I made mint selling leads to Realtors.  It was easy, lucrative and low risk.  I just needed a website, some Google ads and a buyer for the leads.  AFTER the 2008/2009 crash, I went deep into stock indexes putting about 95% of my net worth into a total market fund.  (Today I only have about 10% in stocks because obviously I’m worried about a big correction.) I didn’t know in 2009 that the next 15 years would be awesome for stocks, but I did know that stocks were half as expensive as the year before, that there was such pervasive pessimism about stocks that it wouldn’t take much good news to lift them, and that legends like Buffett were enthusiastically buying instead of selling.  \n\nI’d also encourage them to explore non traditional investments and gauge them for risk-adjusted expected returns instead of simply aiming for the highest total return.  For instance, today much of my money is in private real estate loans where I have a first lien on the property and where borrowers pay 10% (on average) in annual interest.  Although this path isn’t available to most, the point is that I discovered it as an asset class by asking myself “Is there an investment with good returns that is safer than stocks?”  and then researching it until I learned enough to feel confident.  For younger folks without much capital, maybe an alternative risk-adjusted good investment would be a small service business or maybe a seller central account selling stuff on Amazon.  Many of the Amazon aggregators have collapsed and are selling off their seller central accounts super cheap.  This is totally different from stocks but I’ve seen a lot of people make really good returns this way.  \n\nOverall, my experience has been that achieving sustainable wealth usually happens by looking somewhere different from the crowd.  \n\nI doubt anything I’m saying is surprising.  The reason for the original post is because there seem to be many in WSB who truly believe stocks can only go up and who seem to revel in posting loss porn.  I enjoy hazing poor Intel guy as much as the rest of you, but I’d rather see young people study stock history a little more, be a bit more cautious (via diversification) when a bull market has gotten long in the tooth and economic indicators are turning negative, and be ready to pounce when low-hanging opportunities present themselves.",

When a crash happens, the \"experts\" may try to explain it away (or the government may step in with a magic wand) but if people lose confidence after being severely burnt they may never return.  It has happened in our history and it almost assuredly will happen again.  \n\nBut the thing to remember, the S&P always makes a comeback.  If I were in my 20s or 30s, I would be in a low cost broad stock market index fund, buying a little every month.  The odds are in my favor I'll be well off by my 50s.  Dips and peaks be damned.",

So the main bet is that we are near a peak and that there will be time (even if timing is less than perfect) to get back in.
