I really believe this rally could fade as soon as tomorrow, but if it doesn’t I will be on the lookout for it losing momentum throughout the week. \n\nIf the rally sustains, I’ll roll (some) my current positions into the following week, and close the others. \n\nIf the rally sustains, I’ll be buying PUTS only if the price hits $28, and will continue to at $29, $30. \n\nThis is just based on the technicals. I’ll be on the lookout for any news that could sway sentiment. \n\nBasically, I’m expecting this to turn around and head downward again. CALLS I’m playing week to week, PUTS I may go further out. \n\nYou can DM me during the week if things get wonky, but I am by no means as skilled as some of the traders here. \n\nCheck out /r/TradingEdge \n\nProbably the most succinct and thorough analyst I’ve ever followed, and he has an amazing Quant that posts daily gamma levels.",

You’d be looking at some other company trying to acquire them. \n\nWhere that San Diego company’s supply chain is located is different than their Corporate HQ. \nTaiwan, Korea, SE Asia. \n\nThere are also agreements between Intel and US government with extremely strict stipulation’s surrounding supply chain. The US defense contracts in place make it extremely complicated from an acquisition perspective. \n\nThe US defense contracts for Intels foundry business is and was specifically given to combat the supply chain dominance in the semiconductor industry. I.e they want chips made in the States, not Taiwan. \n\nQualcomm would have to completely compartmentalize Intel from its core business (which wouldn’t work from a balance sheet standpoint), or completely change their own supply chain structure, which would take years and also wouldn’t work (from a business acquisition perspective). \n\nQualcomm basically floated the idea to see how the US government would respond, and if they’d bite on perhaps some sort of subsidy of the acquisition, forgiveness of debt, and offer to lax the contract stipulations. \n\nI was going to edit my post earlier to add a C, D. \nHeck, I could probably run out of letters in the alphabet. I figured A and B were sufficient. \n\nC. Anti-trust concerns are a major factor \n\nD. There are x86 architecture patents shared with AMD that basically make this a non starter. \n\nI feel like a lot of people are somehow sentimental and it’s an emotional thing. They are rooting for them because they grew up with blue  Intel stickers on their PC’s and Laptops. \n\nThe world has changed. Intel is just… a mess, from just about every angle.\n\nDownvote me all you want. You asked, I answered. \n\nLike I said, the recent surge in their price is driven by FOMO of misinformed investors.\n\nLook at what happened to QCOMs share price the day that rumor was published.
