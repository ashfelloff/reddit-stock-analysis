Try to make your own theories.  Listen to people who actually know what they‚Äôre talking about. Only you will be able to determine if what they‚Äôre talking about is good or bad info. There‚Äôs plenty of voices out there, but you probably know as much as any of them if you actually pay attention and are interested.\n\nBasically, if you are listening or reading to this book, you will realize that every single warning sign that they talk about in this book has actively been happening for the past six months to a year.\n\nEdit: im also going to put this in here for some people. Wall Street bets is basically the definition of something you would NEVER listen to if you want to be successful. I am not saying I am a genius. I am probably a moron. Very good chance of it üòÇüòÇ\n\nBut one thing he constantly says is do not listen to other people who have a stock to ‚Äúsell‚Äù or you know whatever happens here. Point being, there is TONS of different places in the market that are not Nvidia, AMD, ASML, etc. all of those stocks you can still make a shit load of money on. It may just take longer and a little more patience.\n\nAlright I‚Äôm off to gamble my life away on QQQ puts and calls next week.",
