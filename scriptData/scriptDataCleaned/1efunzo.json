Though the number of customers declined, the sales decreases weren't as steep because of the higher prices.\n\nI'm not sure why there is an \"everything is fine here, nothing to see.\" When inflation targets aren't \"let's reduce them.. or let's get inflation to 0\", it's let's get it to 2%.  Well, CPI has skyrocketed, and wages are still flat.  How long does everyone expect this to last?\n\nI've traveled extensively, including to third-world countries. I can tell you that governments are cool with you becoming impoverished. No AI singularity is going to normalize this. As somebody who has been doing machine learning and other digital intelligence since 2007, I can say the \"AI\" that gets talked about in the news is a pipe dream.\n\nHell with it, I guess this means Long calls all around!  Regard until the ship sinks!  Tally ho!\n\nEdit: Price of food staples:\n\nhttps://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-average-price-data.htm",

If the price is the same, and the time to prepare an order is the same, there's no compelling reason to buy the lower quality food.\n\nThis is why I had a laugh when McDonalds and other businesses challenged minimum wage hikes saying they were going to have to take up prices: like, no, you can try, but you're just going to go out of business with your junk food and an over saturated restaurant market.",
