  "selftext": "All right boys, here it is the DD to end all DDs.\n\nIf you pay attention, you might find yourself floating in a green field enjoying the results of your multibagger getting that divorce you've always wanted and in a position for the first time in your life to not have to ask your wife's boyfriend for an allowance.\n\nThe play this week is 100% Celsius. Ticker symbol celh.\n\nGoogle it regards. \n\nWhy do you want to put your entire portfolio into this on Monday? I'll tell you. \n\nFirstly, this stuff is literally liquid cocaine. I know every single one of you have done cocaine and you all loved it. \nImagine cocaine in liquid form. This is it. Sales Bros. Everywhere are crushing these things so they can stay awake and hit 40% of their quota.  Managers are crushing these things so they can ask how many dials their teams are making and why they haven't hit their number 3 days into the month.\n\nBut here's the rub. It's not just the sales Bros that are getting forced back into the office due to regarded RTO policies anymore. I mean don't get me wrong. That's a big reason why you should be going full port on its own offices are stocking the s*** up like crazy and it's flying off the shelves. But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. \n\nSecondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. \n\nI'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.\n\nThirdly, they're going international. \nThey announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. \n\nFinally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.\n\nThat's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. \n\nThat alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.\n\nNow here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. \n\nTuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market. \n\n\nPosition 2 call strats EOW at $85 +\n434 shares.\n\nGood luck regards. I'll see you all in Valhalla. \n\n",
