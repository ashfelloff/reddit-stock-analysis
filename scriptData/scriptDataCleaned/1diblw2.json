AST going crazy. RKLB is also talking of a Satellite constatation all built in house just like SpaceX which has a 180 Billion valuation.  RKLB 2.14B market cap. This will easily 10X in 2 years. \nIF YOU LIKE Paint Chips hop on this Rocket \n\nShares 12059 @4.33",

                  "body": "Vertical integration. The rockets are \"keys to space\" - Peter Becks' words. They believe every successful rocket company must have both rockets and on-orbit applications.\n\nRocket lab already has their own rockets, they build their own software, have their own launch facilities (2 in NZ, 1 in US), they have their own satellites bus, their own solar panels, they make their own satellite components, they want the entire value chain. The only thing they do not have yet is a space application (Satellite Imaging, Internet etc), but have said multiple times they are looking to acquire something in that area and will than launch their own constellation for sweet SAAS like recurring revenue.\n\nNeutron is a fully reusable first-stage rocket (more reusable than Falcon 9 as they keep the fairings). As well as higher launch revenue they will use it to launch their own constellation and eventually people. And they've developed it for less than $300M but that's not the whole story.\n\n  \nPoint is, people talk about their rockets as if that's their only business when in fact the rockets just enable the much larger, more stable, and more profitable space services business.",
