With this increase, all U.S. and Canada Gold Star, Business and Business add-on members will pay an annual fee of $65. Also effective September 1, annual fees for Executive Memberships in the U.S. and Canada will increase from $120 to $130 (Primary membership of $65, plus the Executive upgrade of $65), and the maximum annual 2% Reward associated with the Executive Membership will increase from $1,000 to $1,250. The fee increases will impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive.\n\nWith some basic napkin math, the run-up in stock price is regarded I think.\n\n7.4% annual sales growth.  Membership fee increase may add another $390 million to income ($5x52million/2 + $10x52million/2 = $390 million).  $0.39B is not huge for a \\~$400B market cap company.\n\nMeanwhile the stock price has gone up from \\~$530 to \\~$905 in the span of one year (market cap went from \\~$235B to \\~$400B... P/E ratio went from \\~37 to \\~55+)\n\n**70% stock price growth in one year for a mature business with 7.4% annual sales growth** (which is actually like 4% real sales growth when accounting for inflation).\n\nIt just doesn't add up to me.
