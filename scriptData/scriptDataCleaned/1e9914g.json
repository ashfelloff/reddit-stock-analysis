  "score": 111,
  "selftext": "Tesla is going to announce it's Q3 report earnings on the 23rd of July, right after the market closes. What are your calls? After a magnificent spike and rise, tesla has been slowly dipping. Should we worry that the stock's market price is extremely overvalued at the moment?  \n  \nPersonally, I think it’s going to be a mixed bag. Tesla’s growth story is far from over, but the high valuation and recent dips suggest that investors are getting cautious. I’m particularly interested in seeing how they manage production and delivery amid the ongoing supply chain challenges.\n\nWhat’s your take on this? Are you bullish or bearish going into the earnings report? Let me know your thoughts!",

Your customers aren't looking at valuation metrics, but they do think \"why do I want to invest in a stock that has gone down?\"",
