  "title": "Why Are People Voting Yes on The Musk Compensation Plan?",
  "score": 844,
  "selftext": "After getting smoked in the Delaware court for basically being in bed with his board and failing to properly disclose the feasibility of compensation goals, Musk and Tesla are looking to push the pay +$50 billion package through again. From my understanding the goals were as follows: $20 billion in revenue and achieve a 100 billion dollar market cap. Tesla easily achieved both, and it knew it was going to prior to the compensation package (undisclosed at the time). 300 million stock options (or 10%ish of the company) for these targets seems unreasonable. However, that's technically fine if it was negotiated fairly. It is undeniable that the board of Tesla is under Musk's control.\n\nTaking a broader look at Tesla, It is down 30% YTD. Musk has laid off roughly 10% of its workforce. FSD is still not close to completion. Sales are down YOY. The supercharger team has been largely laid off. Musk has started a company that competes directly with Tesla. So my question is why does anyone want to vote yes on giving 10% of their company to this guy who seems to not even care about Tesla?\n\nAnother question: why would anyone invest in a company run like this?",

Tesla without Elon is just a car company and should be valued at 10x earnings instead of 75x earnings.

Most of my Tesla shares I bought in 2019 and all of them are up 1000%. The media was calling the deal bad for Elon when it was passed.\n\nThe share price don't always reflect what the company is doing. Look at NVDA. People knew they were working on the H100 chips. People who are following the progress of FSD knows it is close to completion and is undeniable for those who follow it. Sales are down, yes, less people buy vehicles when high interest rates and fear of recession.\n\nSupercharger team was largely laid off then then some hired back under reorganized supercharger team. Laying off a big piece of workforce at once is normal for companies. \n\nElon does not have control of the stock price. NVDA was down 67% in 2022, Meta was down for 18 months in 2021-2022. H100 was not developed overnight. Why did META star moving back up in 2023? Margins started improving. Every company goes thru cycles of increasing margins and falling margins.\n\nThat aside, voting no would really hurt Tesla. If the vote is no, the lawfirm that bought the lawsuit on Tesla will get the $6 billion in shares that they demand (share dilution), Tesla will also have to find different way to get Elon his compensation. \n\nWhat do you think happens when Fed start lowering rates and Tesla margins moving back up? Tesla said energy deployed will grow at least 75% this year, FSD soon expands to China and expands to EU in 2025. Optimus still a couple years away from selling, but will start to be used internally late this year.  Compact car and cybercab...\n\nWhy I will happy vote my shares \"yes\" for Elon comp plan, because with Elon Tesla would not be moving this fast. I know a lot of people don't believe this, but there is a TON of growth coming for Tesla but people will refuse to believe it until they see it. (Like with NVDA H100 chips)",
