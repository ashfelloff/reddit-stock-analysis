Trillions and trillions.\n\nWhy don't they do that then instead of selling a course lmao\n\nIt's all bullshit.\n\nThere's only 2 ways of making consistent money in stocks:\n\n1. Insider info, illegal trading\n2. Slowly making 10-15% yearly returns, which is what an index fund pretty much does\n\nEverything else is either pure luck or bullshit. The good thing about stocks is there's no \"cap\" to how lucky you can get unlike traditional gambling where you can at most win in roulette for a huge risk of losing it at all.",
