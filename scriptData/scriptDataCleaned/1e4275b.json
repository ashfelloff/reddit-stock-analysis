The price is not going to change now anyway, so you basically have capital tied up in something that is guaranteed 0% growth that you could be using elsewhere.  \n\n\nI was in a similar but not identical situation recently with ALPN, which wasn't taken private/delisted but rather was bought out by another public company. But in any event, the price shot to just under the $65 after the announcement and was due to sit there for a few months before the deal completed. Since it was not going to grow anymore, I sold for the best I could get (about 64.95) so I could invest elsewhere.  \n\n\nJust sell and move on while it's easy to do so and put your money to use in something else.",

Read what Meridian intends: or just hit the sec site to get the details. \n\n\"Meridiam intends to launch the Offer with the purpose of providing an immediate exit opportunity to all Allego minority shareholders. Allego shareholders are not required to tender their Shares in the Offer, and Meridiam does not intend to pursue a squeeze-out of any minority Allego shareholders.  \nAllego shareholders that do not tender their Shares in the Offer will remain investors in the delisted Company. As a part of the Transaction, Meridiam has committed to provide these shareholders with access to liquidity opportunities at certain points in time post-Delisting, including priority tag along rights upon sales of Shares by Meridiam or its affiliates and commitments by Meridiam and Allego to organize liquidity events for those shareholders within 18 months after the Delisting and again prior to 31 December 2027.\"",
