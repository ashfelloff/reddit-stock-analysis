It seems your jurisdiction doesn't have these taxes yet anyway?\n\nFor me, if the stock dives before tax day I don't pay anything. If I've paid taxes and it dives I can either do the taxes on my own and claim those losses. If I lose more than I'd have to pay, I get a refund.\nI could also not claim those losses and they get put into a \"loss pot\" by broker, that all future taxes are calculated against. If I have gains to be taxes, those come out of the loss pot first.\n\nEasy.",

You took a bit of a pay cut compared to working at XYZ mega corp. but you truly believe in their product and the leadership.\n\nAs that promised payday that has been promised for years approaches you must be employed on that day… it just creeps in your mind. What if HR is looking at the spreadsheet. Why is this engineer getting 200k in stock… you hear your CFO say “we are planning future reductions in stock awards that cause dilution.” \n\nWhat it if I get fired not because I do good work, but because a bean counter said we don’t actually have to make this payout that we have been promising for years.\n\nThen you look in the media and it’s full of these stories. Steve W at Apple gave shares to early employees after Jobs stripped them. Same with Facebook. Tesla which publicly touts its stock plan for employees consistently lays off then rehires their employees.\n\nThen you watch the number just vanish. Or you work your ass off but a few tactical choices made 3+ pay grades above you caused -50% stock dive over the year.",

Your coworker who vested at $50/share two years ago will see much better compensation than you, a newbie, who is soon to vest at ATH of $100/share. \n\nAlso, medium term, because of higher share price you are given fewer shares to vest over time; if your target compensation is $150k, and the mix is $100k salary and $50k shares per year, and the price is $100/share, you get fewer total shares than your coworker who started when the stock was $50/share even if you have the same total comp number. So over the coming years, increased in price will be much better for your coworker than you because they have more shares. \n\nPeople already covered that RSUs aren’t a bonus but are in fact part of your yearly targeted compensation. They’re planned as part of your pay, and a real bonus may be more shares but it is accounted for after your comp. \n\nLastly, depending on the company, your total comp mix may be heavily weighted towards RSUs. Your $150k comp may be $100k cash and $50k RSUs but it could also be 50/50 split, or $50k cash and $100k RSUs. Since you can’t pay rent with unvested RSUs and most firms won’t recognize unvested RSUs as income (for things like loans, mortgage, etc.), then being heavily exposed to share price swings and your vesting schedule mean you really should be budgeting on just cash salary. \n\nIf that cash salary is significantly lower than your total comp, and you live in a HCOL area, yeah it can suck. Again, relatively. You are still making more than minimum wage, but when you compare to broader costs of living that high compensation may not be as high as you think. No one should shed a tear for highly paid FAANG bois but a shit market hits them harder than non-stock-based-comp folks so there’s some additional inherent risk in their job/salary outside of layoff risk.",
