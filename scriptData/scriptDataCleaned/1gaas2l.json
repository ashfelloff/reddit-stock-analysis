You’d still be profitable but you’d be significantly capping your gains with that call you sold and would be looking to buy it back for a loss and hoping you sell the one you bought for more or just closing it as a spread right there. \n\nThe point of writing the 582 is to hedge theta overnight, because if your 581 is gonna lose 30% due to theta or moving against you overnight the 582 is also going down but you profit from that one so they sort of cancel each other out.

In 2022 I essentially only traded credit and debit spreads and increased my win% by a lot. \n\nTrading the spreads much was more forgiving but then also helped me learn a lot because there’s all kinds of different strategies like closing the spread or closing the short leg earlier. \n\nSometimes entering as a spread and if it goes against you you can buy back your short for cheap and if it goes your way after you get more gains on your long since it’s then uncapped. \n\nHowever if you close out your short leg when it’s down but your long continues to go down you’ll do worse than you would have just leaving it as a spread. \n\nTrial and error, and research are your friend here! With options and especially shorter term options theta is extremely important to understand, and trading spreads opposed to just buying options is a way to effectively cancel out theta and help you practice options cheaper.",
