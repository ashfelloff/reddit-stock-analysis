          "body": "No particular strat here. He has two strats are shorter term the in the money(ITM) has intrinsic value and some extrinsic value(time value of the option) and a lot of value due to implied vol(IV) and two that are out of the money(OTM) entirely extrinsic value plus value due to IV.\n\nAll betting that NVDA will go up so no magic here. In fact his heavy bet on shorter term calls says he is ballz deep into his belief that it will go up. Now on the case that it doesn't go up. Well the longer term OTM wont lose it's value much. Yes the valuation that is added due to IV will dissipate but not so much. I am guessing that even if NVDA doesn't crush it he may hold it till NVDA does go past 130 eventually before end of SEP. The shorter terms will lose a lot of tits value if NVDA doesn't deliver. \n\nThis is my analysis so far from his position",
