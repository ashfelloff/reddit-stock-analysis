I'm not kidding. They even plant subliminal messages into trading apps like Webull. That's because they trade against us. There's no other way for them to turn profits. \n\nWhat happened is these guys have been pumping pre-market and unloading shares onto retail during euphoric sentiment for the last two and a half weeks. Why ya think daily candles at tops are red and ones at the bottom are green. It's pretty simple. Loading -> unloading. But everyone just naively buys the story, sure, whatever. 😆 \n\nToday they finished, dropped the bid, cart loaded with short calls and long puts and popped a bottle of champagne.",
