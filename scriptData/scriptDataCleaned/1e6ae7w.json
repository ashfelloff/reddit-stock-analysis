              "body": "Correct.\n\nI would like to exemplify a bit since people don't understand this: almost every single consumer transaction these days is electronic. The 0.01% of people who walk into a Dominos (or Costco or anything else) and plop down $60 in cash on the table is negligible. What this means is every bank and credit card processing knows exactly much consumers have spent on \\[x\\] company. You go buy taco bell, you get a statement saying TACOBELL-SANJOSE-XL323C39232340 $19.83. They can and do collate and use all this information in pricing in revenue.  The quarterly or annual earnings is all known in advance because *they* have the data! Same for operating expenses (and those are generally steady from Q/Q). \n\nWhat this means is the current performance is well defined and understood for most consumer-oriented. The one unknown is guidance.\n\nThere are some holes in this and are other industries that this doesn't apply to, but that's the general gist of it for consumer-types.",
