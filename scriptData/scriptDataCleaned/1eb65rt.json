That's a bigger insult than nothing.  \n\nAt least when Southwest stranded me and thousands of others back on Christmas 2022, they later offered 25,000 miles as a pacifier, which is generally enough for a domestic round trip.  I accepted it, given that the alternative was...nothing.  But it struck me as being like a restaurant offering a gift card after I got food poisoning there.\n\n(For the record, I haven't flown SW since.  Nor have I flown any other airline in the 19 months since.  I intend to use those miles, as I earned them by sleeping on the concourse floor at Midway.)\n\nCrowdstrike really shouldn't have bothered with this \"offer\".
