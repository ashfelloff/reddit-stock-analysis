The business model is pretty out of fashion, because streaming is \"hipper\" these days. So you can read a lot of the time, that only boomers would pay to Siri, because you can stream for free. The catch is, that people who drive a lot in rural areas have a more reliable connection due to satellite. So especially trucker are long distance drivers are the target group for the business model.\n2. The Revenue is declining in the last consecutive quarters. This is really an issue long-term, if it keeps falling especially because:\n3. They have a lot of debt, because the manager is known for aggressively leveraging his businesses. If Revenue keeps falling this might be an issue mid/long-term of reducing the FCF and therefore affecting your TSR.\n4. It is a very CapEx intensive business model and they are actually in a CapEx cycle for the next decade. This can be a positive but also a negative, because I think the CapEx cycle is over next year, the stock price might get depressed because of it.\n\nPositive points:\n\n1. Siri is build in around 70-80% of new sold vehicles as a free trial. So they have a competitive advantage when it comes to this point. Important is however, how many people switch to a paid subscription after their test months.\n2. They have a high FCF yield, which should guarantee Dividends and potential Share Buybacks in the future. Granted, if the Revenue is sharply falling, this is in danger contradicting with the idea of a long-term investment.\n3. They have a high Short Float, which can lead to those short squeezes (that i abused) and we have seen a year before. This is an exit strategy if you dont feel comfortable with your investment, but I wouldnt bet my house on it, because its not guaranteed that we have thos high spike squeezes and is not a value investing appproach.\n4. Berkshire bought a lot of Liberty Tracker stock, which should be converted to 8.4 Siri Shares after the merge. If it isnt an arbitrage play, then Berkshire is long on Siri which is not a bad sign, but not a guarantee to workout either (Paramount example).\n\nI dont suggest anything and encourage you to do your own research and check all my observations before making a decision, because its ultimately your decision that matters here!\n\nI liquidated my position, because\n\na) the squeeze lead to a price above fair value due to my DCF calculations and\n\nb) There is the possibility of a sellout after the merge, because probably not all Liberty tracker holders want their shares of Siri. It could go either way: \n\nA massive sellout because of this circumstance \n\nor a high price increase, because SIRI shorts are gonna liquidate after the merge. \n\nI wanna be honest with you, I was not able to reliably find a solution on what will more likely happen and therefore sold, because it was for my personal taste too risky and too complicated of a situation to really sit this out.\n\nHope it helped!",

      "body": "TL;DR: mechanical effect due to people accumulating synthetic borrow positions for the merger arbitrage play.\n\nIf you pair a short call position on a stock with a long put position of the same strike, you get a short synthetic forward position. If you also buy the stock, you end up with a delta neutral position (the value of your position is not affected by moves in the stock price), while still owning the stock. This is essentially synthetically borrowing shares of the stock until the expiration of the options.\n\nTwo kinds of persons may want to do this here:\n- traders who want to play the SIRI/LSXMK merger arbitrage, in which case they may prefer synthetically borrowing via options to lock in a fixed borrow fee for a given maturity rather than borrowing directly from their broker / prime broker, as the borrow fee changes every day and has been very volatile in the case of SIRI. They can then use this synthetic borrow to short SIRI (and buy LSXMK to eventually pocket the difference when the merger happens). Since there is still some uncertainty around the exact merger date, they synthetically borrow with monthly or weekly options, and roll their position to a further dated maturity when the previous one expires (they take the risk of the fixed borrow fee implied by options changing significantly every time they roll though, but using longer dated options to start with would instead have the risk of over paying if the merger happens early, so there is a trade-off).\n- prime brokers who want to source some stable SIRI inventory to then lend it out directly to either traders doing the arbitrage play or just normal short sellers.\n\nThe persons on the opposite side of the trade are the ones with stable SIRI inventory who want to monetize it by synthetically lending it, either in replacement or in addition to lending the shares directly.\n\nThe reason while this is concentrated on strikes higher than spot (i.e. calls being OTM) is that when the borrow fee on a stock is very high, it can become optimal to exercise an american call early. People synthetically borrowing the stock as previously described do not want the call to be exercised early, as they would otherwise lose the shares, so they only choose strikes that make the call OTM. They still want to keep the strike low enough as they would otherwise have to place more cash upfront to pay for the put that now has more intrinsic value. Hence why you see this being concentrated on the 4-6 strikes rather than e.g. 10+.",
