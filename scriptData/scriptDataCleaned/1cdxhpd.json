I was expecting MSFT and GOOG earnings to bring SPY down plus PCE to tank the market today. I was horribly wrong. Gonna be taking a break from trading. \n\nI still pulled out about $17k in the past 2 weeks. Still one of my best runs ever with trading. It's difficult to continue to trade with money that you have earned from trading. It has less meaning (you didn't work for it) therefore my risk went through the room (0dtes and 1dte trades) ",

Also TSLA, while puts were sound, you had to have seen that the money to be made shorting it was already made, look how far it went down",

It doesn’t take hindsight to say, hey, maybe it’s historically INCREDIBLY rare to even see as many red days in a row like we just did, maybe I should sit back and see what direction the market goes before just throwing everything into puts for two weeks straight lmao. It’s literally completely moronic and degenerate to play like you did, and you said you have posts making a lot on the previous dip, so you not just moronic but also greedy lmao. You making a ton of money in a week then losing it the next isn’t smart at all. I could do better at a roulette table lmao.",
