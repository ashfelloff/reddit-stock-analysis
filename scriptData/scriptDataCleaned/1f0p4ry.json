Its one thing to stack a 50 long x 20 wide block of vehicles and have space in case fire breaks out, but if they dont, and they just park them like an aircraft carrier with Thousands of vehicles lined up next to each other, this could be catastrophic. \n\nThe battery fires alone could burn for days, and not spare any vehicles.
