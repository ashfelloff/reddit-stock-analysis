Pretty much always sucked at it, but decent enough to not like, lose all my money; build up slow; take big risk, wipe out gains, repeat.\n\nYesterday morning I bought NVDA puts at 855, just two. Stock start going up fast. Tried averaging down. Just stared at the market for 3 hours; started coming down. I panic sold to get out. Figured, rather lose $1,700 today than $3k.\n\nI had 9 that averaged at 3.90ish.\n\nIf I had held to close today, I would have made $80k.\n\n\n\n$3,700 to $80k.\n\nInstead... $-1,700.\n\n\n\nThat one broke me, fam.

      "body": "On Fridays, you need to have a different mentality instead. Listen.\n\nInstead of scalping for a couple bucks here and there and then letting your emotions control your paper hands after the market makers hunt your stop loss levels (which appears to be what happened to you today), set aside a fixed amount you're willing to lose (let's say $2K for simplicity). \n\nJust assume you've already lost this amount. Consider it already gone before you execute your trade. No paper hands bullshit. No emotions to conquer. So now just go all in with this predetermined amount with what you've decided (NVDA calls or puts or strangle both)\n\nThere are four possible outcomes:\n\n1. You pick the wrong direction ($2K in NVDA calls) = you lose and try again next Friday\n2. You pick the right direction ($2K in NVDA puts) = pay off your house, new lambo, thicc hookers\n3. You pick a strangle ($1K in NVDA puts, $1K in calls) with today's volatility = bear leg prints, bull leg expires worthless and you win pretty big.\n4. You pick a strangle ($1K in NVDA puts, $1K in calls) and market stays flat = both legs expire worthless, you lose and try again next Friday\n\nYou still have money. Still a good chance you're retiring early bro.\n\nI've tried scalping but the large position size and bid ask spread REALLY fucks your emotions. Citadel sees your large order and they WILL move that shit temporarily against you to scare you into selling even if you're right in the first place (which is what happened to you)\n\nDon't feel too bad, bro. Try a different strategy and in two weeks let's see some gain porn",

My brain deals with it all, particularly after a years messing around for funnies and knowing the risks and such. I'm familiar with the panics, and have learn to cope pretty well; knowing what was an acceptable loss, paying further out in time to remove some of impending dome feeling, lol. That one just hit so much different.\n\nI've been messing with making a bot and testing in Alpaca; once I finally get things working, I would definitely like to start testing my strategies and removing my wimpy little brain from the equation for sure.\n\nI appreciate the encouragement.

I think anyone with any sort of trading plan or rules for taking trades most likely had this happen at least once this week, if not 3 or 4 times. This was not a normal week. While there are a few Yolo gamblers on here that made $80k on silly unlikely plays, it almost motivates me to go ahead and follow my plan for 1 year. It's just detrimental that a single, one fuckin decision to not follow the plan can melt away 30, 60 or 90 days of sticking to the plan. It's a battle, and I think those who are successful at trading are the ones that can win that battle alone, not the ones that have good luck on lotto otm 0dte options. While it would be nice to get a head start or a nice buffer off of one giant trade like that, they say easy come easy go. I'm lowering my risk next week and getting back to the basics. Base hits. This is a marathon not a sprint. I'm also considering deleting Reddit as it inflates red days when you see Bob hitting 40k on a $200 entry. Especially when Bob doesn't show that he lost every single penny of that 40k the very next day. Send me a dm, maybe we could report daily, or even weekly about our trading to help stay on track. Like I said, I'm in the same boat as you. I went on tilt and bought 70 lotto puts, took a 40% sl and they went +1000% 3 hours later. Bob sat thru -40% then -70% and even -90% to finally hit +1000%.
