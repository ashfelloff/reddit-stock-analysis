  "selftext": "Many companies offer product perks to owners of their company shares.  ~~Berkshire owners get discounts on See's Candies~~ and most cruise companies give share owners  on board credits, amount varies by cruise length.\n\nEDIT: Removed BRK share owners getting perks.  Actually, employees of WFC  (I was) would get a discount at See's Candies.  Don't know if this is still offered.  Sorry for the inconvenience.\n\nWhat are some others,  which are the best and which are easiest to use?",
