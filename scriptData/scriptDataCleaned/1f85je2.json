So I think they will configure their medmatch software to filter for clients that actual fit the regulation for “customized” doses of semaglutide.  They have to make it discriminatory in order to avoid lawsuits, and they will.  But by offering it, they get a customer to go to their website, input their data, and go to the end asking for semaglutide.  \n\nThis is where “dark patterns” come into play; now that the client has gone down the rabbit hole they are diagnosed by the telehealth doctor and prescribed “glp1” but “don’t qualify for customized semaglutide.”  \n\nThey will be presented with a choice of branded semaglutide (HIMS doesn’t make profit but it’s $1k+) or their Liraglutide for $200 which is like entirely profit due to being compounded inside their own facility, regulated by the FDA btw.  \n\nSo the GLP1 and semaglutide/tirzepatide exist to bring new customers and then sell them more profitable items via dark patterns.\n\nIt’s genius and why customer acquisition is everything right now.  They can then cross sell all the other products to the males trying to improve their figure/hair/ED, Etc.\n\nI’d bet big money that most customers won’t qualify for customized doses of ozempic and tirzepatide, and it’s by design.\n\nBecause they have medmatch an algorithm will be created to deny customized doses of the patented stuff so it isn’t determined to be predatory by FTC.",

AD pathology differs between people as well. I’m not so sure I would be trusting a (newer) weight loss drug to be as magic as we are making it out to be.

And in the United States the only real bargaining power we have is through Medicare. Everything else is paid for by private insurance where only specific indications get coverage. And while some people have the know-how to dose their GLP-1s using insulin syringes, many patients will still opt to use pens and autoinjectors which drug companies offer. \n\nWe already see innovation and patent-extension through drugs like Tirzepatide vs semaglutide where the addition of GIP agonist reportedly leads to reduced nausea while retaining A1c reduction and weight-loss benefits. I predict we will continue to see innovations in the method of drug delivery where patients will be able to inject every 2 weeks, 1 month, etc.\n\nOr in the case of Rybelsus, oral semaglutide. Needle-averse patients now have a GLP-1 option. Again, this is offered through compounding pharmacies but where insurance coverage becomes much more tricky. There will always be the perception, whether deserved or not, that online pharmacies/compounding pharmacies are second rate or manufacture “bathtub drugs.” \n\nThere’s also the weird factor in the US where branded medication is often preferred over generic, even when they’re identical drugs manufactured in the same facility on the same lines. Prime example is that Novolog and Humalog, two branded insulins, are still prescribed even with the availability of insulin aspart and insulin lispro. And the response by Lilly and Novo has been to slightly modify their formulation, creating Lyumjev and Fiasp, respectively. New insulins with new patents which private insurance will continue to pay for at ridiculous cost. \n\nAll of this to say, the US loves to have expensive private insurance pay for branded medications with convenient delivery-devices, to only then slightly improve their formulation to keep drug costs high. Super profitable for drug companies. This new generation of weight-loss drugs is already and will continue to be a cash cow.",
