  "selftext": "Hello there crayon eater! Your favorite habit likely lead to the decline of sales in your local **Clown Burger** joint.\n\n  \n  On Tuesday, [$LW](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/LW) Lamb Weston's(MCD Potato supplier) released their earnings and it showed a %9.25 loss of sales with around %27.62 loss of profit (EBITDA). They somehow blamed AI for that miss??? They used a new software that helps in managing and connecting all parts of their business, like sales, supply chain, finance, and HR, in one place and they blame it for the decline. Afterwards, the stock dropped %25 on Wednesday. \n\n  McDonald's accounts for approximately %14 of Lamb Weston's total sales. The profit margin of fries for MCD is between 70 and 80 percent. Moreover, fries make up at least 20 percent of the food menu item orders. The combined sales of Big Macs, Chicken McNuggets, and French fries make up about 60% of McDonald's total business.\n\n Another red flag, was them announcing a week ago that they're getting back the $5 meal deals. The need for reintroducing it signals sensitivity to a downturn, and that crayon eaters(like myself) cut back on spending. In other words, they wouldn't have to eroded profit margins significantly, if adequate people were coming through the door.\n\n Finally, while looking through Mcdonald's search impressions in the upcoming reported period, they were below their 5 year average by a mile. Also not to mention the boycott campaigns. \n\nFirst DD, not financial advice.\n\n  \n!banbet $MCD 235 2d",
