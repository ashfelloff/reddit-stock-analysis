Upon observing, I've come to realize that dark pool orders serve as the skeletal system of the market. \n\nDon't believe me? Take a look at this past week on the SPY. I've actually been kicking myself because I only profited off of one side of the move on Wednesday., which was downside where I made 300% playing these orders down to the levels in the screenshot below. \n\n  \nI've blocked out other dark pool orders because they are significantly smaller then these two. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/f4alxziroood1.png?width=1672&format=png&auto=webp&s=745f28937a51b87d509ced28abc2bebf3a80199d\n\n  \n\n\nThese dark pool orders came in on Friday after the Jobs Report. I've been paying attention to dark pool orders for the past year or so, so my strategy is usually to play the orders to their level on the dark pool. Once price reaches that level, that's my Take Profit. For example, If SPY has untapped orders at 545 and the market price is 548, I'll short SPY to 545 and I exit. \n\n  \nOn Wednesday 9-11, SPY opened up at around 549 and instantly sold off to 540. Why? Because these orders from Friday had to be touched. For the QQQ, there was a massive order at 452. So what happens next? QQQ finds support at 452 and SPY finds support at 540. It's not a coincidence, or by accident. These levels are structured throughout stock and everything in between tends to be noise. \n\n  \nI had QQQ puts where I sold QQQ at 452, but I did not have the brain to think to buy calls at the level in this particular instance because I was trying to play it safe. I usually only play to the level because they're not always buy orders. Could have 100X my money playing the other direction, but that's life.\n\n  \nDamn, I went too long. I'll stop here. I'm new to Reddit, but if you guys like this I can analyze some dark pool orders in the coming days. ",

Say out of 100 slots on a black/red roulette, 2 outcomes are neither black or red and always go to the house, of course they will be sure to profit in the long run.\n\nThe whole idea of trading is that you have an edge so that you win more than you lose (you don’t have to be necessarily “right more often than wrong” even, as long as your TP is bigger than your SL). Those who want to be right every time will lose everything while those who know that losing is part of the game and constantly take small losses will keep their downside limited. You can read Mark Douglas’ books on trading psychology to get this.\n\nOf course this is the theory and it can be extremely difficult in practice when your emotion takes over and you chase losses and cut winners early instead of the other way round, and that’s why most people lose money when trading and maybe only 1% are consistent enough that they actually “win more than they lose”, but that’s indeed the whole idea of it!",

Often, for example, large buyers will not want to buy all at once, as it can be such a large purchase that the price increases throughout their entire purchase.  So say they want to buy 10M SPY shares.  They might buy 1M, then put up a huge sell wall 3 dollars above the current price.  What that does for them is hopefully scare people into selling, as they see a large sell order ahead and think they should as well.  Their selling then creates liquidity for the whale to buy shares at below or at the current price.  They can then cancel their sell order once all shares are bought.  Same idea for the other way.  Point is you don’t always know for sure why these sell or buy orders are in place but you can speculate.",

This Friday you could see the pricing action on NVDA as the big boys tried time and time again to start selling offs, but failed. This next week is probably going to look like that again as the price is too high based on the outstanding options. Look at any ex-wall street guy (I personally love “Gary’s economics” on YouTube) and they all admit that the stock market is a zero sum game, and the reason that they get paid so much is that they can siphon even more money from everyone else. It’s a giant poker game and they play together with massive piles of money to fuck over everyone else. You put in a stop loss, they can see it and can move the market to grab it. Great news comes out on a company and everyone starts buying in, they hire somebody to write a hit piece on it after they short it. As long as they don’t have “insider information” from the company they can get around the regulations. \n\nTLDR: market isn’t based on the company/news, it’s based on the best way to siphon money from retail to institutions",

They lose 1,000s-10,000s a year to bookies. Aussies gamble more than anyone else. Every pub has a betting shop inside and a pokie room (slot machine) - where it’s still legal to smoke. BUT they have zero interest in the market. Unless it was that one month where they all lost money in ‘digital’ money. I see it the same for a lot, not all, but a lot with options.
