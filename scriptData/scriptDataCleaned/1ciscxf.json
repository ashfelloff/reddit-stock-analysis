The display has a slight yellowish tint to it which makes it hard for me to see in certain lighting (I tried every setting to fix this but it's just how the display is). There's an issue that will happen at least 3 times a day where the button to close out of the background apps will just stop working. Lately my notification sounds/vibrations aren't working so I'll miss calls. When I connect to my Bluetooth in my car it'll work fine with my music but if I get a call it'll just switch to my phone speaker with no way to change it. I could go on... I never had any of these issues with my Pixel 3 and I considered that a near perfect phone that I would have kept if it wasn't for the declining battery life towards the end. \n\nI'm likely going to switch to an iPhone next, I don't trust Pixel as much anymore.",

It was obviously not designed for mass adaptation from a cost and production availability standpoint. \n\nSometimes a company will release a product like this so that developers and designers can do the rest of the work for them… potentially. I see it as a way of Apple testing the waters. They release this extremely high tech product into the wild, except it’s very bare bones. Cutting edge for what it is, but lacking in “meat on the bones” for lack of a better phrase. \n\nWill developers make cool stuff or figure out things to do with the tech? Maybe, only time will tell. Seems a little suicidal to commit to development costs on a software project for a device which much not see future iteration, but that’s not really Apple’s problem. \n\nI can see Apple taking a more refined crack at it in the future, and releasing a more “for the people” version (I’m sure it’ll still be stupid expensive) sometime down the road. If they do, it’ll be based on feedback and criticism of this first product, which had minimal audience reach, so the experience hasn’t been totally soured or sold for everyone yet. \n\nIf they can make a sleek 2 minute video showing a lighter, feature rich product with the same tech and responsiveness as the current Vision Pro, it’ll sell like hotcakes. \n\nThat shit about social stigma isn’t real.

However, what they failed to take into account, is that even Meta is failing to FORCE their employees to use it for work. You couldn't pay me to use VR for work. The Apple Vision Pro will never succeed because it doesn't have a vision of how the users will use it.

What did you think I downloaded this app to do while biking?\n\nApple, do what you do best and instruct a mandate for these apps to upgrade/require themselves to be phone independent.\n\n2. You can browse safari and even type a keyboard on it now if you wanted. Just give us the easy access safari app already?? I hate having to do a workaround by asking Siri to look something up on the web, and THEN I get access to the elusive internet browsing feature\n\nIt’s like it’s not convinced it’s as capable as the iPhone is and tries not to step in its lane sometimes, but it can pretty much do most of those things now, which is great don’t limit that and I agree.\n\n3. Obviously a lot of GenAI stuff could be implemented to make this better but also GenAI is still in an iffy stage right now so I can see why they’re delaying on that (my genAI api stuff I’ve made works great… around 60% of the time….) give that a year",

The processors can't get much smaller and putting them off the device and connecting via cord introduces lag and latency that kills these devices. The cameras can't get much smaller or be reduced in count without also compromising the user experience heavily.\n\nSo where is the reduction in size going to come from?\n\nThe only way it will happen is if people sharply reduce their expectations for such a device.

Then they release a refined version with more targeted use cases and it becomes the new standard. In a year or two they’ll release an Apple Vision Air or something that does what proper wanted the AVP to do and we’ll start seeing them everywhere.",
