  "score": 43,
  "selftext": "As many of you know the XLK is rebalancing this Friday June 21st. Two major changes is the weighting of NVDA and AAPL. Currently NVDA is around 6% and AAPL is 22% of the XLK. Friday NVDA will be around 21% and AAPL will be around 4.5%. That means around 10 billion purchased shares of NVDA and 11 billion shares of APPL sold. \n\nHistorically, the performance of a stock like NVDA can experience an increase in price movement going into the  ETF rebalancing and see a sell off following, as the rebalancing is digested and profit taking occurs.\n\nFor AAPL the opposite can occur as a short term negative selling pressure takes place going into the rebalancing. However post rebalancing is sometimes viewed as a buying opportunity. \n\nAs this will occur after hours on 6/21 a lot of buying and selling could occur before the market opens on the following Monday. With APPL there is a pivot point at 208 which I consider a buying opportunity. A few months ago I started buying the June 2026 310 calls and they have performed well. If you are buying calls on AAPL I would give it some time and buy leaps in 2025 post earnings in Q1. This would give you time to capture and news from August 2024 earnings the iPhone 16 release, the post election rally and Xmas spend. ",
