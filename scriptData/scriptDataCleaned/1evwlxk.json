It's about the same mass at about the same orbit. So unless they do a amazing job compared to SpaceX (which is a company recognized for their design and manufacture capabilities in rocket and satellite engines), their satellite should have about the same lifespan.\n\n10 years seems to me very optimistic and you should go for 5-7 years.\n\n\nLaunch prices aren't free either. SpaceX are the cheapest but if they saw them as a real competitor for sure they won't blow their own rockets but they may increase their price or not take the launch contract.\n\nSo you should probably go for about 100-130M$ to launch about 12 AST satellites.\n\nSo for their 243 satellite constellation it's about 4 billion dollars for the manufacturing cost (17m$ per satellites) and about 2-2.6 billion dollars for the launching cost.\n\nThey also have to build an operation center to control all the satellites, and they need to operate it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\nThey also certainly need high speed internet connected towers to provide data to the satellites. I don't know how many, but surely more than one, and probably sparse on multiple areas where they want to provide good services.\n\nSo yeah they could make tons of money with enough customers or contract with the Telecom operators. But their operating and manufacturing cost will take a good chunk of it.\n\n\nThere is also more and more concern about the light pollution this kind of satellite produce once in orbit. Some regulations may be taken in the future about it.",

Turns out most people don't like to live fuck-miles apart from each other. Also, 70% of Earth's surface is water.\n\nThe real mobile broadband coverage is **95% of population** and most of it is 4G capable. 5G is \\~30% and rolling out about 10%/year.\n\n42% of the global population doesn't use mobile internet, it's true. However, 38% lives within broadband coverage, but can't afford handsets/service or have no digital literacy. Have you seen Buffett's phone?
