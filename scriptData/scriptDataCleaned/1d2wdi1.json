  "selftext": "What an absolutely incredible day! I don't normally do this but I just wanted to post my gains today as it's my 2nd best trading day of the year. I know it's relatively small since a lot of people made $100k+ but it's a big deal for since I typically aim for $500 a day playing pretty conservative with options.\n\nI had the NVDA $1060 Call from $14 on Friday and sold at $71 today. Also had the $1100 call from $7 on Friday, sold at $27 at open to lock some profit in case the stock sold off. Added $1150 call at $14 today as an end of the day roll up in case it gaps and runs to $1200 tomorrow. And I have a few never sell commons from $440 average.\n\nEven with a relatively small account, I've managed to make $40k YTD on NVDA alone simply by rolling calls every week and buying all dips. I think since January 1st, there's been a total of only 4-5 days where I didn't have any open calls. This has been a fairly successful strategy that has paid off well.",
