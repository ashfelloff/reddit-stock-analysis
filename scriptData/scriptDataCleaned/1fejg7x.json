If SPY is at 543 and you buy a 545 call and it goes to 548 within that day, bigly gains. Also very risky. Theta also eats away at ur money if ur playing ODTE.

You don't always buy 0dtes expecting the stock to reach that price, they can move 100s to 1000s of percent without ever going ITM. Especially if it is a quick move and earlier in the day.
