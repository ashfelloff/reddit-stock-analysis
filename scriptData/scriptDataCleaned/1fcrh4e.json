And that's not even getting into the medical isotopes they're gonna be selling as well as all the REE that they do as a side project for money to position themselves well whenever a U bull run ends.\n\nDumbass vanadium bears shorted the shit out of it and are now stuck in a short position they don't properly understand and will get utterly buttfucked on. Vanadium is like 5% of the company while it's 90+% in on Uranium during a U bull run lmao. Company is worth at least 25-30 a share if not more once full production is completed.",
