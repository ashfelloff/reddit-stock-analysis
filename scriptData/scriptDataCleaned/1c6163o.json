Last I heard she and her boyfriend had blown through basically everything and were living month to month off the alimony, which barely covers rent because they moved into a more expensive place immediately. Meanwhile my portfolio's doing great, almost back to where it was before the divorce.\n\nSome people just can't be trusted to handle money.",

Don’t panic sell it. If it’s volatile, which you should know if it is or not by doing the slightest bit of research before you bought the fucking thing, it could go back up. If it’s not volatile then you won’t be losing a ton in the hour it takes to make an informed decision on it.\n\nDo your research next time. Don’t fall for 99% of the BS on this subreddit. If something sounds interesting research it.\n\nWhen you lose it all, don’t start with 15k again. Start with $100. Make it your goal to grow back all of that 15k with only starting from $100.

The next year I only purchased stocks or options I felt comfortable holding at least a week at a time, had a purpose and things I weren’t chasing. I stopped chasing stocks which were up significantly and acted like an adult. The next year I did just over 400k in profit. The lesson I learned about losing 19k was sucky but paying taxes on that 400k made me wish I only had to pay 19k. My advice. I use to only buy things and risk money that I felt comfortable waking up two weeks later. So I use to tell myself, if I was in a coma for two weeks, would I wake up with fear knowing I had a huge positions before the coma or would I feel comfortable with what I had. The moment I stopped spending money and risking those “oh no” plays and stopped buying things I wouldn’t wanna wake up to a coma with, that was the day I grew up in the market. \n\nSince then, I have DCA my portfolio into the crypto market and my returns since 2018 have been great. I have regularly DCA and never sold a coin yet. When I buy coins, my rules are now simple. I won’t buy a coin I can’t hold for at least 5 years. If I can’t commit to the hold. I don’t buy the coin. Change your perception. Stop risking your hard earned money my dude. \n\nI’m now launching my second business, a cannabis marketing company.
