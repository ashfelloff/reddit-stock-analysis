                              "body": "Fair, the average person probably has never been in this position. I should probably clarify a bit about how this works.\n\n1. You fuck up your taxes. In my case it was because I thought my severance payment was included in my W-2. It was not.\n2. You get audited. IRS finds out you didn't pay enough money. You are immediately assessed some penalties, the IRS sends you a certified letter explaining how much you owe and how to pay.\n3. If you pay the amount owed, you're done. We'll assume you don't, though. I didn't because I didn't get audited for several months, and couldn't pay without liquidating some long positions I *really* didn't want to touch (those positions are up 400% and I'm still holding, I stand by my decision).\n4. Every six months or so you get a letter from the IRS reminding you that you owe them a shitload of money.\n5. You no longer get tax refunds. Anything you would have gotten is applied directly to the debt.\n6. If the IRS sues you within 10 years, you cut them a check for the amount owed, or set up a payment plan. Otherwise, whatever remains of that year's tax debt disappears.\n\nSo I was implying a lot when I said I was hoping not to get sued. I already went through 1-5, am sitting on 6. But there's no way to know all that unless you've fucked your taxes up catastrophically then entered into a semi-regarded standoff with the IRS like I have.\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention they have other collection methods than suing (like wage garnishment), but for some reason they have decided not to use them on me. So I'm really only concerned about them going nuclear at this point. And I'm pretty sure they will, but my rate of return on the market is beating the shit out of the interest rate on that debt, so I'm happy to wait as long as possible before I cut that check.",
