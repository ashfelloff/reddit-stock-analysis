Intel can't do it, a bit, they just can't figure out the right way to produce these extremely complicated chips with the right tooling and the right equipment.\n\nNo one who knows anything about it is betting on Intel. They want Intel to be competitive but they know it's a huge huge long shot.\n\nThey will successfully pressure the US and Europe countries to fund incredibly large TSM facilities for chip production. It really is a matter of national importance, our nation's economy, national security, and AI.\n\nThis should give those countries the leverage they need in order to force TSM into making more offshore plants.\n\nAnd it's going to happen fast.
