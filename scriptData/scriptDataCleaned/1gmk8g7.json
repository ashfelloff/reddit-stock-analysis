  "title": "Archer Q3: Big Steps Forward and $6B+ in Orders - Is This Just the Start?",
  "score": 61,
  "selftext": "**Manufacturing Momentum** üõ†Ô∏è\n\nFacility in Georgia is almost ready to roll. They‚Äôre aiming to start production in early 2025, with a goal of **two aircraft per month** by year-end. Not mass production yet, but big progress in the eVTOL world.\n\n**FAA Certification Milestones** ‚úÖ\n\nThey‚Äôre in **Phase 3** of FAA certification, with the final phase (Phase 4) coming up. Once they cross that, they‚Äôre good to start commercial flights. This isn‚Äôt just vaporware they‚Äôre actually hitting the steps to get this thing approved.\n\n**Big Partnerships and $6B+ in Orders** üí∏\n\nJust signed a **$500M** deal with Japan Airlines & Sumitomo, plus a UAE air taxi partnership with Abu Dhabi Investment backing. Total order book is over $6 billion. Big names are showing up and putting real money on this tech.\n\n**So, What‚Äôs Next?** üìà\n\nAfter a strong move the day before, Archer‚Äôs up another 14% post-earnings‚Äîserious momentum building here. The price action shows solid investor backing for the progress they‚Äôre making. With big partnerships, production on the way, and FAA approval within reach, the fundamentals are aligning for a strong long-term play. Plus, with high short interest still in the mix, there‚Äôs real potential for a squeeze if this momentum keeps rolling.\n\n**TL;DR**: Real moves from Archer manufacturing lined up, partnerships stacking, and certification on track. Long play potential here if they keep this up.\n\n*(Not financial advice, do your own DD before you dive in!*",

Both of these have a strong chance of being deep in the money near expiration. If I am interested in being in these companies long term is it best to exercise now, closer to expiry, or sell the options and then purchase shares? So far I have only been buying and selling the contracts and haven‚Äôt yet exercised any of my calls. Any advice is appreciated.",
