While it’s possible to trade at a positive trajectory over time, I submit you can’t do that till you understand the psychology of fear and greed.\n\nBoth cause you to normally make the wrong decision. Think back, reflect. \n\nUntil you subdue and vanquish that variable and stop treating trading like sport, the statistics are vastly stacked against you. And as a trader, you should value statistics, educated probability, and risk management above entertainment. \n\nThank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\nTL;DRL if you think trading is exciting, you’re in the wrong business and will grow poor.

Only to lose all of it in a short amount of time due to their inexperience. IMO the best time to get into trading is when you don't have a lot of money, and use lets say a paycheck. Which if lost could be made back by working in a month. Vs if you get into trading with 100k+ and lose it, that's a huge loss and will take years of hard work to make back.",
