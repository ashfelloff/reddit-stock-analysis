People started talking about its products and recommending them, but this is not reflected in its stock price. The company has not recovered from the market pullback and is still -20% compared to its price from 2 months ago, while all other companies have not only recovered but also made  +10%. Even Google, which is facing a huge anti-trust lawsuit that might dismantle the company, is doing better. So, what the hell?",

Based on one of the debates, Trump claims Taiwan stealthy sells the information to China. So if the US wants to keep everything in their country, they might need to give more incentives to INTC and revamp their foundry and productions do it cheaper than Taiwan did. Altho I'm kinda skeptical as in the US it's hard to find cheap labor like Taiwan.\n\nQC acquisition of INTC is considered bad because people know it's costly to hire US folks to just do the manufacture. US folks need high pay just for them to live, it's simply a bad outlook for QC, altho might be good if they know something we don't know yet.",

What proportion is cash, what proportion is stock, what will the $INTC price per share be, how will that integrate and increase efficiencies, what will the new management structure look like, how will that behave on a forward looking basis, what segments should be broken off and sold separately… the list literally goes on and on about the possible complicating factors for determining a really good valuation, and especially after already being up nearly 20% this year, there’s just going to be a lid on $QCOM for a few months I think.\n\nThey want to wait until after the election to make a decision, and (slightly) more than likely Harris will win, Khan will keep her job at the FTC, and anticompetitive mergers will continue to be challenged in court. So on that basis, it’s probably worth accumulating.

      "body": "Leaving acquisitions aside, I have two humble opinions:\n\n1. $QCOM has 62% of its revenue from China, which means its stock price is quite positively correlated with China's domestic demand. Fortunately, half of [China’s policy shift on Sep. 24](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-unveils-broad-stimulus-measures-revive-economy-2024-09-24/) was aimed at addressing local government debt, while the other half focused on boosting domestic demand.\n\nYou can think of it as China bringing forward what Japan’s \"[Abenomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics)\" did in year 21 of its \"lost decades\" (2012, which was also a long-term turning point for the Japanese stock market) to today. This gives the Chinese stock market relatively better expectations. However, the repair of balance sheets will most likely continue to weigh on the Chinese stock market in the long run.\n\nUnfortunately, the Chinese government’s current priority seems to remain on local government debt. Once the pressure on local governments is alleviated, large-scale consumption stimulus is likely to follow, which would be a significant boost for Chinese consumers and $QCOM.\n\n2. According to my backtesting, every time after the semi sales cycle peaks, the $SOX index typically peaks no later than one year after this point. Before that, the year-over-year growth of $SOX tends to underperform the $SPX. Based on the [global semi sales (YoY)](https://en.macromicro.me/collections/4345/mm-semiconductor/59247/global-semiconductor-billings-single-month), it's reasonable to believe it will peak within a year at the latest. This may explain why semis have been gradually underperforming the $SPX recently.\n\nThe most likely factor to extend this cycle is big techs' investments in AI chips for training purposes, which could benefit memory chips to some extent, rather than traditional consumer-facing semis like those for phones or cars. Since AI inference chips for consumers are not yet widely adopted, they cannot extend this cycle either.\n\n$QCOM's main business is smartphone chips. Their AIPC chips are inference chips aimed at consumers, not training chips. This makes them more of a traditional semi company rather than a core AI company, making it more susceptible to cyclical trends.",

Their laptop chips have abysmal gpu performance and aren't compatible with enterprise software (vpns), so they can't really be used by gamers or in companies, which are both massive markets. Laptops with their chips make sense if you only use a browser, but by that point you don't need an expensive laptop anyway, so there's not that much money there and they don't have cheap chips for that segment. Laptop NPUs using CPU RAM are a meme. Competitors like MediaTek are beating them in mobile soc performance by just using off the shelf ARM cores. Is 5G living up to the hype? I don't think so. Their competitiveness is slowly evaporating.",
