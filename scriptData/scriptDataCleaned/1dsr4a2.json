  "selftext": "So I know when you evaluate stock, you can’t rely too much on p/e or forward p/e. Sure, now I think Arm’s forward p/e is 100 something, which is too high for any traditional value investor to even consider to buy fractional shares. However, I understand the company’s ambition and its dominant market share in mobile chips. Nice. Forward p/e 100, and people still buying it. Insightful, good for them.\n\nBut how about Snowflake? \nForward p/e 200.\n\nMust be a reason right?\n\nWhat are your reason to buy Snowflake? What do people expect from it?",

      "body": "You’re going to need to understand more than estimates of forward P/E for starters. SNOW isn’t bottom line profitable, so a lot of what you’re seeing as forward P/E is based on projection/estimates from things like fcf yield, you’re probably not going to actually see them realizing even those level of earnings.\n\nWith that said, you’re going to have to build your own model to estimate growth & future margin profile. If you think they can continue to grow at 20-30%+ yoy for the next ~5, and maintain as a 20-30% fcf margin business, then current cost probably isn’t so bad. See NOW as an example of what that could look like.\n\nIf you don’t believe the above things, or more, then SNOW likely still looks overpriced.",

Are they ever really turning a profit? and if so its only been recently and guess what- every single one of their customers is griping about their pricing - so to keep them happy they will have to start reducing costs or give more value - how can they do this when usage is going up and costs of compute is going up, and their competition is very tough with hyperscalers, Databricks and not to mention other major players...  Their model was to capture market share at a loss... sell the ease of adoption and speed to market, after a couple of years when this is gone, customers are griping of costs.   Cloud repatriation for the larger workloads by the enterprise will pull back down to their data centers if they smart.  Why ?  save $$$s in dollars and with a couple of FTEs you actually now have a more customizable and cheaper product.   Snowflake is best for the SMB or Mom and Pop shops when this happens, they wont be in the data center business and as SF has already found out - data volumes are not growing as quickly as they need to keep up with their exorbinent costs.   Roll this into the IPO - having to pay out shareholders, cloud contracts from Hyperscalers going up as they have their own products which can take that market - oh yeah Im sure with SF expensive compute model they will play nice for awhile, until they dont have to- hyperscalers just want to sell infrastructure and SF is doing that well but to the pain of their customer - but the customers wont take it forever, in a saturated market and with the recession will flush them out if it comes and hits hard....   Just my guess but it looks an easy answer to me.   Probably why Slootman got out and is on the 'board'  that guy is smart- he got out while its hot.   The only way is down.
