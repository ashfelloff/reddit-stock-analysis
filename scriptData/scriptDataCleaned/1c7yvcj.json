      "body": "Sometimes it takes the market a very long time to recognize value.\n\nI remember from 2012-2016 APPL was stuck in the 80s, reached an all time high in the 120s then pulled back. It was in 2016 that Warren Buffett bought millions of shares of Apple. This was pre 4:1 split. By 2012 it was already obvious that the iPhone was dominating the smart phone market yet it took over 4 years for the market to begin to recognize it and even a few more years before AAPL really took off.\n\nTSM gives me the same feeling as AAPL did back then.  It is obvious that they are dominating the chip fab business yet the market does not reflect this. I do expect TSM to be a $2T-$3T company in 4-6 years but it is very painful waiting for that to happen. \n\nThe next iPhone coming out in the fall may be a wild success (A18 chip made by TSM) It's not that the phone is so much better but rather there are millions of people with iphone 11s, 12s and 13s that might finally upgrade.\n\nINTC is another company which has even more upside potential if they don't fuck up.  I expect INTC to join the trillion dollar club in 4-6 years.  They actually have a 10x-20x potential.  I am accumulating shares and add more as the price drops.  My goal is to have 7000 shares and hold until INTC hits 700.  But INTC might not succeed and I will not make much money.   I have 9 years left before retirement.\n\nI remember in 2012 an acquaintance bought heavily into TSLA (it was at $150 pre split). We predicted that in 10 years (by 2022) it would be at $2K. He is retired.  I never bought.  We were right but for the completely wrong reasons. We guessed that self driving cars would be mainstream by 2022 which seemed so far away back then. Back then the prediction was always FSD was 5 years away so we doubled it just to be on the safe side.  FSD is still 10 years away but this time we may actually make it.  The technology being used to train self driving is using AI training techniques which seem to work far better than anyone could guess.\n\nThe demand for chips is not even close to being satisfied.  Robotics, AI, automated factories, personal robots, etc. will all become commonplace in the near future (10 years from now as the prediction always goes) \n\nTSM, NVDA, INTC, AMD, TSLA, are not bullshit companies like pets.com.  There is no doubt that the future trillion dollar companies will all be in tech. And it is also really difficult for new companies to break into these markets.  IT costs billions of dollars to build a fab for example. Maybe a company like Groq with the LPU can \"come out of nowhere\" \n\nSMCI is a very different animal.  Their rise from nowhere was the simple fact that last year their PE was 10. I don't know if they can  do anything that DELL or HP can't do as well.  Then there are other really high end super computers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500. Way too much competition.\n\nAll tech uses chips from INTC, AMD, NVDA and ARM and those chips are all made be TSM, Samsung and INTC as an also ran but Intel still has a dominant player in the PC CPU market.",
