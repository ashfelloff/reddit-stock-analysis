Full PDF here: \n\nhttps://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf\n\nProvided by ChatGPT: \n\nThe minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.\n\nKey highlights from the minutes include:\n\n- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.\n\n- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.\n\n- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¼ to 5½ percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.\n\n- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.\n\nIn summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data.",

Just because it’s not falling faster doesn’t mean it won’t fall with higher rates for longer.\n\nI think the fed would rather risk a premature rate cut and see if there really is reinflation than a recession.\n\nOr maybe the fed has no idea what they are doing and the global financial system finally collapses in 2025.\n\nI’m hoping for the second oprion tbh…",
