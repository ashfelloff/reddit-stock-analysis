With a market cap below 100B it feels like a good entry, though. ",

It's on its way to recover.\n\nFTNT is currently beaten down due to its ER, which is a good buying opportunity IMO because I believe that the price will go up again.\n\nCRWD is definitely my favorite one to own, but it's the only one among those three stocks that rallied heavily and I wouldn't chase it at these levels. Emotions and FOMO are dangerous to me. There will be a pull back - I just don't know when. So I'm waiting patiently.",
