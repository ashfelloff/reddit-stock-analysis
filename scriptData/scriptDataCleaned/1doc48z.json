  "title": "$ENVX The Next $NVDA?(Metaphorically) A Journey From Jelly to Chips",
  "score": 36,
  "selftext": "$NVDA revolutionized the semi industry and semi architecture again and again with its chip designs. This has improved all tech x1000. But what hasn't changed in 30 years? Your phone lithium ion battery. This is stopping you from being on Reddit all day at work when your phone dies. What's the solution??? ARCHITECTURE. All battery cells for 30 years are a \"jelly roll\" of cathode and anode layers rolled up into a cell. When you try to put silicon in there to expand the battery capacity the silicon swells up and breaks the battery. There are many shitco battery companies that never do anything and give the space a bad name. They are trying to fix this problem with complicated chemistry solutions. Enovix took the cathode/anode and sliced them into square layers and made a stack (like a sandwich) instead of a roll. This is the same way semi chips are made and stacked or so I'm told. They wrap it in a metal case and this structure can withstand and divert the force of any swelling of silicon. This allows >30% more capacity in a cell depending on its size. They have now replaced the whole leadership team with Qualcomm hardcore chip maker production guys and they are getting this damn factory running and shipping by next year. They are fielding sample orders from large megacap tech and phone OEMs. Today an agreement from a AR headset maker that the customer will pay for retooling to make the chips right for the headset. +30% pop today. These announcements are likely to continue IMO.    AI and LLMs and BLTs are all very power hungry to run. Apple already says they want to run AI on device. This needs better batteries. This is not advice of any kind. But I have to ask myself ... am I hungry? Yes. ... I am.",
