          "body": "Honestly the market volatility helped a lot. In the beginning of August I just focused on smaller profits, averaging about about 3-500 a day in profit, slowly increasing my tolerance about buying into larger positions and pulling in about 1k a day. I did have losing days as I got too brave and lost 10k on the 4th expecting the market to drop. My gains 100% would not have been that large if I played it safe and the market wasn‚Äôt as volatile. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it honestly, but I think following SPY daily betting with the market and taking profits even if you‚Äôre 99% sure it can go higher is the best way, otherwise you‚Äôll try to chase the market back to your previous high as time works against you and you end up with a loss. Example, if SPY is at $561.65 and you buy 15 call options for for SPY 562 at $1.20 per contract that‚Äôll cost 1800, if SPY continues up 50 cent to $562.05 those contracts should be worth about $1.40 each for a $300 profit. There‚Äôs 250 trading days a year, if you can get your position to have a profit of 300 and close out each day that‚Äôs 75k a year. THEORY AND REALITY ARE NOT THE SAME. You will have losing days and you can try to chase your loss or not. I honestly never use a stop loss since I was playing with pure profit most the time and can afford to pay bills if I don‚Äôt hit my profit and lose every I put in for the day. A stop loss may work for you but with trading days where the market can drop $1+ for 1 minute and then bounce back you will lose on your trade. Again I do not claim to be good, but only lucky most the time. But sticking to the basics and taking a small profit when you‚Äôve got it will give you the best odds.",
