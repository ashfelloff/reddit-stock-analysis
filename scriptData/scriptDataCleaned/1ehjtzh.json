These % drops are equivalent to scandals like with companies like Boeing and that doesn’t make sense. It seems the general consensus picks and chooses when guidance is important because I’ve seen companies with bad guidance but good quarterly reports skyrocket. ",

This will continue through 2026 at least but Apple is trying very hard to use a modem of their own design and stop paying Qualcomm.  Apple is also gaining market share vs Android, so if Qualcomm starts losing Apple revenue on new models *and* Android market share is shrinking it wouldn't be good for Qualcomm's revenue.  Of course this all depends on Apple succeeding with their own modem and the project has reportedly gone very badly so far.",

KLAC, NVDA, WDC, I mean those are just three that I trade and it's as volatile as trading crypto. A lot of times when you get these really aggressive corrections they are fairly short-lived. It's also worth pointing out that it would be a benefit not to be at all time highs in September if we want the fed to begin a cutting cycle, in fact it would be preferable if the markets were 10% off the highs\n\nA lot of you guys seem to get wrapped up in these earnings reports or how well the business is doing, like that's important to some degree, a little bit anyway but you're overlooking liquidity zones. You're not looking at the charts like where are the buyers and where are the sellers, what's this business actually worth? That has to factor in. When you run these on speculation it can just as quickly turn to speculation on the downside on what happens if growth begins to slow more rapidly than anticipated. No one wants to hold the bag. In fact that's a big part of what brought down Y2K, you had all these lofty projections, earnings were not there, earnings were supposed to come and then they actually got worse, welcome to the 2-year bear market",
