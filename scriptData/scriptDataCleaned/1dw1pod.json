There is an absolute mountain of irrefutable evidence supporting the use of statins. The effect size shrinks with the health of the patient but as far as high quality evidence shows, you can put statins in the water and life expectancy will go up. Despite that there are still physicians and patients alike who don’t want to use these drugs. \n\nThe effects of GLP-1RA drugs are much wider. They got approval for heart failure in march probably because that was an easy picking. If your patient is fat and sick the reality is losing weight will probably help them in some manner. And there still will be holdouts who wanna do it naturally and yadda yadda whatever they might yap, but at the end of the day this time they’ll take the drug. Because unlike statins this time they’ll look thinner. Statins made you live longer despite being fat, glp agonists will make you thinner and live longer. \n\nAnd to answer your question, yes.

I don't recall exactly, but the current price is like ~$1000 when LLY sells it to PBMs. When an American has health insurance, it decreases the price to ~$25/month so that it IS very affordable for most Americans. However, Biden wants them to cut down the $1000 that they sell it to PBMs, not the overall $25/month cost that Americans are getting.\n\n\nSo if some law is enacted requiring them to, say, sell their drugs to PBMs at $250 each, then they'd be losing a LOT of profit on their drugs. At the same time, Americans probably wouldn't be getting the benefit of the price cut and demand wouldn't go up necessarily.
