And if they suffer enough, they cut costs - ie: employees.\n\nThis is all part of a natural recession that we should experience every now and then. But the Government (Congress, Pres, FED) have been kicking the can down the road since the dotcom collapse.\n\nPeople don't truly understand that the housing bubble was a consequence of the tech boom crumbling.

They always wanted to but couldn't afford it. But when you don't have to put any money down, and you can get an adjustable-rate mortgage that starts at 3%...\n\nMoney seeking a return finds the path of least resistance.

It's not about making everyone broke. It's about creating enough float (unemployed individuals) to shift everything back to balance. The US doesn't need a 15% unemployment rate. Hell, even during the housing bubble the unemployment rate peaked at around \\~10%.\n\nThat's what the FED is trying to do. But their goal is being thwarted by fiscal spending. They can't do anything about that. JPow is definitely hurting things by raising rates, but we can't truly see the effects because the Biden administration announces a new $20 billion corporate welfare program every other day - Whether it's building bridges, semiconductor fabs through the Inflation reduction Act, Infrastructure Act, Chips Act, etc.\n\nThe FED and the Biden Admin are literally working against each other. In the end, the FED will win (unless they quit - and even then, but it will take longer) - because can kicking only works for so long - See: Tech Boom, Housing Boom, Tulip Mania, Houston Oil Boom, Japan Real Estate shock, The South Sea Bubble, the roaring 20s, not to mention countless regional bubbles.\n\nEssentially, the government has been funding the US bubble since approx 2000 - Witness the national debt going from $17 Trillion to over $35 Trillion now.

Big Banks didn't just wake up one day and say let's create collateralized debt obligations! It was created due to demand, and that demand was from the housing boom which was in full swing due to low rates, and banks were doing everything they could to milk it. Well, banks, appraisers, agents, etc.\n\nYou have to realize that before the post-dotcom rate easing, interest rates on homes were around 8% - and that was actually kind of low. In In the 70s, they were around 12% and during the 80s they got as high as 18%. This acted as a natural demand constraint. Before rates were depressed to low levels, people realized a better rate of return could be had on investments, bonds, etc. Why buy a home at a cost of 8%-15%, when the rate of return for decades on a home was 3% to 5%? It simply made more sense to put money into the markets. But in the 00s when the markets collapsed, the money went looking for alternatives and The FED's low interest rates made homes ideal. And the government was glad to juice it along because it was the sole source of economic growth/tax revenues.\n\nBy depressing interest rates, the FED was literally encouraging people -Not- to save. As an example, you might recall that just days after 9-11, President Bush came on TV and told everyone to keep shopping - buy furniture, jewelry, and stuff (not a joke - you can look it up) - Because the last thing you want is for people to shut down and save all their money. That leads to a deflationary spiral that can destroy an economy. Inflation is bad, but true deflation is pure destruction. It's even worse in a 70% consumer spending driven economy like ours.\n\nAnd so, the FED figured the best way to bring us out of recession was punish people for saving. Coincidentally, this is the same thing Japan was trying to do with ZIRP and even NIRP. If you know that your money in the bank is worth less tomorrow than it is today, the smart thing is to take it out and either spend it like a buffoon or allocate it to any vehicle with a greater than zero (or in Japan's case negative) rate of return.\n\nEven seniors that were saving for retirement were obligated to put money into more risky markets, because otherwise their savings would literally be worth less as they neared retirement. For decades the ideal portfolio was 60% stocks/40% bonds. And as you age, the bond portion was supposed to shift to closer to 100%. This would insulate retirees from short term economic shocks. I digress.\n\nThe Bills/Revenue discussion is more complex - To be fair, it's hard to know what the best course is. \n\nTo keep it simple (and semi-short) - Ideally, you want the government to step in and goose spending when people are hesitant (Example: Covid) But at some point, you want private industry to access the capital. Because it all comes down to one thing - who is going to foot the bill? \n\nIf private companies build factories/plants, etc., they pay for it and it either pays off, or their shareholders and capital investors win/lose. But if the government does it, then the effects are distributed to everyone. Unfortunately, governments have never been good at allocating capital. \n\nJust think about it this way - if they were good at it, and considering they can literally borrow a near infinite amount, take as long as they like to pay it back, and there is no middle-man, then why don't they make money?\n\nFrom 1976 to 2000 - this country went from nothing but dirt to the most powerful, industrious, technologically advanced, and richest nation on earth. Skyscrapers, National highways, the Space race, the atomic era, 2 World Wars, etc. and after all that, in the year 2000, our national debt was a whopping $5 Trillion.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2024, we added another $30 Trillion - what do we have to show for it? Nothing much, really. The debt is simply liabilities transferred off the books of banks and failed businesses as a method to keep them propped up.\n\nSorry, I have a habit of rambling.",

At the time the Democrats controlled the House and they demand that taxes be raise in order to balance the budget. \n\nIn the end, the Democrats and Bush Sr. ended up negotiating (yes a bipartisan negotiation, I know it is hard to imagine today) and agreeing to balance the budget half through tax increases and half through spending cuts. \n\nReally, Bush Sr. problem was that he was trying to be responsible. He knew balancing the budget was important, so he negotiated with the opposition to get it. This then backfired massively. And that is why politicians don't negotiate much anymore.
