It's almost a coin flip. People calling you dumb for weekend Theta obviously don't understand that it is all priced in. Like MMs didn't realize there was a weekend coming? You are paying for 2 days of potential unknowns - Geopolitical events, political events, wars, etc. 2/7 days when anything can happen, and no one has a chance to adjust prices. That's why Crypto is so wild - it trades 24/7 and often has crazy swings when world events happen but the rest of the market is closed.",
