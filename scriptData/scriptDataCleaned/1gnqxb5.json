  "selftext": "So I've been doing some research about energy stocks, here are some of my thoughts:\n\nClean energy stocks have been dropping significantly in these few days, but I am optismistic it will go up in the forseeable future, here's why:\n\n1: Solar and Offshore Wind are fundamentally more cost effective than natural gas alternatives, meaning these are profitable business model that businesses will develop regardless of government subsidies.\n\n2: The IRA will unlikely to be fully repealed due to the massive amounts of employment it provides to red states.\n\n3: While tariff will make clean energy projects more expensive on net, it also gradually reduces US clean energy firms' reliance on China which means a stronger future for the companies.\n\n4: With regard to oil stocks, I believe the price of oil will drop significantly since drill baby drill which means Trump will expand oil drilling in the continental shells, so lower priced oil will reduce profit margins for oil companies, making oil stocks perform worst. \n\nAny other thoughts?
