He can continue to hold and pray that the stock goes over the $30 that he paid so he makes money, or he can sell calls against his share for some premiums now. If he sells $30 calls now he will make $0.70 per share (which reduces his cost basis to $29.30), if the price jumps and the calls are exercised he profits $0.70 and is out from under the trade. If the price doesn't cross $30 and the calls expire, he can sell more calls against those shares, say another $0.70 reducing his basis to $28.60.
