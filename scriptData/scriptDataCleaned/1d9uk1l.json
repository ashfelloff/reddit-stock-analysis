      "body": "This is by far the most regarded thing I've ever done in my life. There is no justifiable reason to do this other than I'm chasing my losses from SPY puts during trading today. I belong here. \n\nSo, if employment data runs hot, NVDA sells off before the split, or China attacks Taiwan, or someone else does something stupid on a global scale, then I will wake up a millionaire tomorrow. If not, it's been an honor sharing my stupidity with all of you. Here's hoping we've seen the all-time highs for the week and we're headed for a nice healthy pullback tomorrow.\n\nThanks for your attention and consideration, and may the roasting begin in the comments section!",
