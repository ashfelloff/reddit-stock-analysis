And I say that as a Tesla owner and long time shareholder.\n\nAs a consumer, we've been told that our cars will soon turn into robotaxis and go out and make us $30k a year.... in the next few years. Optimus will be in mass production by 2023, doing your laundry and taking care of your kids. It's coming, just wait. Tesla will connect to Neurolink that will lead to direct communication between human and AI.\n\nAlong the way we've forgotten a lot of the other promises. Hyperloop by 2020's, Roadster 2.0 by 2020, Tesla Semi Truck delivery by 2019. Solar Roof mass production by 2018. A cheap, $35k or less Tesla in 2016. One million model 3 self driving taxis on the road by 2020. None have been achieved, but the CEO keeps making the future dream bigger and bigger, every year.\n\nBut each new investor is there paying off the last investor based on the newest promises, which raises share prices and justifies us to not sell. So now the reason to buy more isn't because the revenue makes sense, but because we expect there to be new waves of investors.\n\nThis is why people keep saying the fundamentals don't make sense. But it doesn't have to, we just need new buyers to buy in.",

I asked shareholders to expel him from Tesla’s board in 2023 and to deny reinstatement of his fraudulently obtained compensation deal this year.  Despite this, Mr. Musk enjoys about 70-75% support from shares represented at votes.  \n\nUnless an activist investor is able to buy up hundreds of Billions worth of shares, I don’t see the situation changing.

And it's coming at the worst times because competitor BEV makers have started making much better electric vehicles with better tech and driving, safety, handling and service, at lower price points. So even for totally apolitical people unaware of Elon's dumb antics, there are just far more options with superior value that make a Tesla not worth it to purchase (or used at best).\n\nMy big extended family isn't too political generally and all over the spectrum for those who are, since 2020 several have been in the market for an EV with Tesla topping most consideration lists early on. But ultimately, *none* of us wound up going Tesla--Hyundai (both Kona and Ioniq) and Kia mostly ruling our roosts, one Polestar, couple VW's (ID.4 a \"sleeper\" high quality EV), my BigLaw attorney cousin finally settled on a BMW (i4--2nd choice was Mercedes EQS and 3rd the Audi Q8, Tesla falling to near bottom after it'd been at top of his list at first), and most recent purchase a Honda (Prologue). Even the one we thought almost sure to get a Tesla (used) is now gravitating towards either a Volvo or Toyota EV (bZ4X) with the new purchase incentives, or even a used Bolt or Leaf. \n\nAnd for all of them as far as I've heard, it wasn't even Musk's Tweets or politics (two of them hard-core Republican, one even a MAGA who somehow also became an EV fan), it's that Musk has gotten so distracted and addle headed (all that ketamine?) he's running the company into the ground so a Tesla isn't a safe purchase and bad investment as a vehicle, and they're worried about servicing or re-sale few years down. There've been horror stories about Tesla's being hard to insure and nightmare to get replacement parts, with multi-months wait and bad servicing (Musk firing much of his service department not helping), issues with brakes and suspension that make them dangerous to drive, [highest accident rate of any car ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2023/12/18/tesla-has-the-highest-accident-rate-of-any-auto-brand/)and many of these severe, minor dents or fender benders totalling a Tesla and FSD and Autopilot being a mess (with all the broken promises). \n\nThese kinds of deficiencies need focussed attention and improvements by the CEO, and instead Musk is basically spending each day putting out dozens of Tweets how much he hates Ukraine and loves Putin? (I mean, WTF in general, is \"pro-fascist imperialist warmonger\" now supposed to be a \"conservative\" value even?) Even for the most apolitical potential customers, Musk going off the rails means his cars aren't a good buy anymore, too risky and nowhere near the cost even of the reduced quotes. And this is all happening just when both the legacies and new EV makers hit the market with ever more appealing models.",
