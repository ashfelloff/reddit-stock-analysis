      "body": "A) yes. With a 0dte, letâ€™s say SPY goes from 519.00 to 520.50, and then back down to 520.10. You will now need SPY to go up to 520.70ish just to match the high that the call was at when it first touched 520.50. Selling on the way up is the better way to do this overall. Waiting for confirmation that the trend is over will always mean youâ€™ve left a lot of money on the table. \n\nWhat I like to do is figure out what my opinion will be worth if it hits my target at close. Ex a 419 call will be worth 1.50 if my target 420.50 is hit at close, and place a take profit at 1.50. Most of the time, if Iâ€™m right, the option will reach 1.50 before SPY gets to 420.50 because of the extra extrinsic value left in it. \n\nAlso, you should always have your strike at least 1-2 ITM from your target. \n\n1DTE works very very different from 0dte. Itâ€™s an entirely different world (27 hours till expiration vs 3 hours till expiration). So this advice doesnâ€™t apply to 1dte",
