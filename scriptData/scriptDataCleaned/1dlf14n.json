  "selftext": "MU dropped from 156 to 138 and now seems to be up in afterhours\n\nBut I wouldnt be surprised if it dropped even more on wednesday to be honest \n\nIs anyone holding MU calls for the earnings call week next week? How are you feeling about it?\n\nI'm holding a 7/19 155 call and it's already lost half its value based on price drop mostly so hopefully itll regain if the stock shoots up next week. But from 139 to 155, its a looooong rise, not sure if it can do it",

The company projects adjusted earnings of approximately $0.45 per share (with a margin of +/- $0.07). The consensus estimate for earnings is $0.48 per share, indicating a significant improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of $1.43. Additionally, Micron estimates revenues of around $6.6 billion (with a margin of +/- $200 million). The consensus revenue estimate is $6.64 billion, reflecting a substantial 76.9% increase compared to the same period last year.***\n\n***Factors contributing to Micron’s potential positive performance include strong demand for its memory chips used in graphics processing unit (GPU)-enabled artificial intelligence (AI) servers. As datacenter operators enhance their capabilities with generative AI and large language models using GPUs, memory becomes crucial for these servers, likely boosting Micron’s revenues. Furthermore, an improving supply-demand environment has supported Micron’s performance in recent quarters, leading to higher prices for DRAM and NAND chips. However, challenges such as soft consumer spending due to inflationary pressures and trade tensions between the United States and China may partially offset these gains.***\n\n***In summary, while there are positive indicators, it’s essential to keep an eye on the actual earnings report to see how Micron performs in Q3 202434.*** 📈\n\ngpt seems to think we have a shot.",

                          "body": "So you’re right in a sense, but the overall point is this: options prices reflect supply and demand, and we calculate theta and IV from that price. When you buy any option, IV is the measure of the implied move *per day*. Similarly, your theta is the measure of the price decline due to time decay *per day*.\n\nIn a longer dated option, a single day with higher IV should be baked into the price - the *average* IV will be lower than a 1-3DTE option bought before the event, because you are also paying for the IV of every other day, which is lower. Similarly, a longer dated option will have lower decay *per day*, because you’re paying up front for so many additional days. But, in both cases, you’re paying more in premium to get the illusion that you’re not paying for the high IV of earnings.\n\nNow, mispricing does happen in options. Maybe you look at the vol smile of the options chain and find out that the longer dated option actually IS cheaper than the shorter option, because retail degenerates are piling into the earnings weekly (or something similar). In that case, it can be a no brainer to buy the option (assuming your thesis isn’t highly regarded). \n\nWhen you choose an expiration, you should always be thinking: “What’s my thesis? Why do I expect the price to move within this specific period of time? What’s the window of time or catalyst I’m looking to capture?” It seems like you’re doing this, expecting a run up in price prior to earnings, but obviously this isn’t happening right now. That’s the risk you take by buying early - you’ve already paid extra for exposure and the trade is now slightly negative. If you were sitting in cash though, you could’ve secured a cheaper entry. (Obviously this is easy in hindsight, so I’m not beating you up for this.)\n\nIf you want to trade options, you’re going to be making a lot of trades. Every little decision that increases or decreases your expected value over time matters - it can make the difference between being a winning and losing trader. You can learn! But take your time and think very carefully.",
