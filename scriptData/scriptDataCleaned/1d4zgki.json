  "selftext": "Adobe's last earnings report, despite achieving record revenue and solid earnings growth, saw some underlying issues that may have led to market concerns. Dropping the stock 7% and 22% YTD \n\nWHAT TO EXPECT ? \n\nSeveral key developments have occurred since the last earnings report that might impact the upcoming one:\n\n1) Generative Al Integration: Adobe has been aggressively integrating generative Al technologies across its product suite, particularly through its Firefly models in Creative Cloud and Al services in Experience Cloud. This is aimed at enhancing user experience and driving customer engagement. \n\n2) Strategic Partnerships: Adobe has formed strategic partnerships to further its Al capabilities, including a notable collaboration with Google's Al language model. This partnership is expected to enhance Adobe's Al-driven offerings an y band its market reach. \n\nThings that made the stock went down last quarter had been the most impressive things they been working on since then. \n\nExpecting ADOBE to Beat ERs and going back to 500. I’ll post my position next week. \n",
