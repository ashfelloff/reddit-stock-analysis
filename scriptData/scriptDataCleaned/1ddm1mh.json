              "body": "I would recommend hedging at key resistance/support levels so that way at the very least you can make a trade that can get back the original premium, so you can insert the coin back in the casino.\n\nOf course their will be a good amount of times where the theta boys fuck you over and you lose double due to hedging, but in the long run I guarantee you especially on  those key resistance/support levels and cpi/fomc , earnings, and other volatile days , the hedging strategy will help you.\n\nAlso market makers might tend to fuck people over with an event driven strategy, where the trade goes in the direction you think after earnings or after cpi/fomc happens. So you can enter like a biweekly trade or 1 month out to avoid the iv crush and event scam when market makers prop up the stocks to not let anything happen for the even traders.\n\n  \nOf course tho sometimes shit goes crazy and you would have been better off entering before.",
