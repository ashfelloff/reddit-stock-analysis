Rookie BS and I am only hating on NVDA because I‚Äôve been mad at myself for trading based on fear or other emotions. It‚Äôs all a learning lesson and I‚Äôve learned so much from this community and I feel like we are all little guys trying to break out of a wagie existence. Holding shares long term will be profitable eventually only the timeline is unclear.",
