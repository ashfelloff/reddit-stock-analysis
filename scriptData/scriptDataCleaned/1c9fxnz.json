A lot of people watch TikTok for hours a day. The Chinese government can literally manipulate the US public with a flick of a switch. No one really knows how the algorithms actually work and with the information they are getting about you it really can be powerful. Imagine Tailor made feeds for every single American TikTok user close to the election about how trump did this , or that, Biden is an alien, your kid is trans, ect. Not to mention all the things they censor about China itself. Yeah Facebook and X sell your information and manipulate you but at least it’s AMERICAN!",
