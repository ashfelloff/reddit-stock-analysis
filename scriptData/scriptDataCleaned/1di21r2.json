  "selftext": "Closed out my NVDA July calls this morning and moved some of the gains into ASTS after doing some DD this weekend. With increasing telecoms partnerships ($100 million commitment from Verizon on top of earlier partnerships), an uptrend in EPS, potential index inclusion (Russell 2000), the possibility of a short squeeze (25% short interest), a small market cap with lots of room for growth ($2B) and launch of their first batch of Bluebird satellites in a few months, I expected that ASTS would start to rocket later this year and bought January calls.\n\nIâ€™m kicking myself for not putting more in/wishing I got an earlier expiration to get higher % gains in retrospect, but you gotta stick with your investment philosophy if you want to want to continually beat the market long-term.
