  "selftext": "I've had my eye on INTC hitting $40 to start building a position, and while we're not quite there yet, the risk/reward seems skewed to the upside from current levels.\n\nEveryone focuses on the foundry business being a money pit, but they're missing the bigger picture. Yes, it's massively capital intensive, but when you see those \"losses\" reported, think depreciation - not actual cash burn. It's accounting games to squeeze more government incentives.  The $7B loss is so overstated.\n\nCould INTC dip a bit further? Maybe. But the downside seems limited, while $48 by summer-end feels very achievable as a first upside target. If it can reclaim and hold above $48, I'll double down on my position. Anything less and I'll probably cut and run.\n\nThe negative foundry narrative is obscuring the underlying progress.  Buy from here.   ",
