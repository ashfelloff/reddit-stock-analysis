There's every reason to believe the band is getting back together. Typically, the notes go up/down to make that sweet music. If they go down 20% and don't rebound 25%+, that's a net loss. If you're the first to pull out at the top, and first back in at the bottom, you're going to make absurd amounts of money.     \n      \nhttps://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Percentage_gain_and_loss#Overview     \n      \nThe flaw in your question is that historically, the market wasn't being played like a fiddle.
