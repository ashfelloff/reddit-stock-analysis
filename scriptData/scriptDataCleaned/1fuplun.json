I actually sold most of my investment to put elsewhere, right before the change in management which led to the stock growing exponentially. More regret üòÇ\n- Wheaton Precious Metals - wanted a \"safe\" investment in minerals, I didn't think it would be top three, but with all the volatility in the market it's been a good bet. \n\nOverall I would say I should have trusted my initial research and intuition.
