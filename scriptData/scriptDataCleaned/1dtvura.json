Comically excessive hiring and badly planned leases didn't help.\n\nLast earnings call produced solid numbers for a mere 3% after hours gain that drifted down in following days. Still - relieved to see an up trend since.\n\n**Headwinds**  \nMicrosoft's Azure continues nippin off of AMZN's profit machine, AWS.  \n*(Interesting Bit : Satcha Nadella worked Azure before becoming CEO / Andrew Jassy worked AWS before becoming CEO).*  \nInternal priorities/conflicts stalled Alexa from becoming AMZN's strong AI play.  \nCosts to cut Inefficiencies - 750,000 costly robots introduced for automation.\n\nAMZN earnings late July - fingers, legs, eyes crossed for big numbers. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4258)",
