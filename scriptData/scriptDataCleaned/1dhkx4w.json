They have the most advanced chips, and because they’re already using AI to help them design next generation chips, no matter what, they will ALWAYS be massively ahead of the competition. \n\nThey own the supply, so even if a competitor started to purchase nvidia Blackwell cluster, nvidia could just control the amount they sell to said competitor. The simple fact is this: they won and scaling laws say they will always win.\n\nhttps://research.nvidia.com/publication/2023-10_chipnemo-domain-adapted-llms-chip-design\n\nhttps://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/tsmc-synopsys-nvidia-culitho#:~:text=NVIDIA%20also%20introduced%20new%20generative,over%20current%20CPU%2Dbased%20methods.\n\nhttps://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/itf-world-2023/\n\nAnyone who thinks or says “competitors will catch up” is a moron, and you should run far, far away from them.\n\nEDIT:\nGains & Position:\nhttps://imgur.com/a/3HefJhK",

Even if the competition caught up, adoption would be slow since all codebases are written in CUDA and translation layers to run CUDA on other hardware platforms are forbidden under Nvidia's terms and conditions (hobbyists may violate this without a care in the world, but enterprise won't).\n\nSo even if competitors caught up, Nvidia has bought themselves a few years to flip the table back around due to the codebase all being written in CUDA, and every AI developer in the world being comfortable programming in C with the CUDA package as their first language. That's their big strength.\n\nWon't last forever though. Someone (AMD, Apple, Amazon, China, whoever, more money is being flowed into chip design by more companies than ever before) will catch up significantly enough and long enough to justify switching dev platforms off of CUDA.\n\nSo OP doesn't know shit about shit but he's probably still going to get rich anyway because the market doesn't know shit about shit either",

              "body": "There's a couple of reasons to think this time is different.  \n\n\nFirstly chip makers are running into the limits of physics.  At a certain point you just can't make a semiconductor smaller, and we're already nearly there.  Once we hit the hard physical limit, the only way to improve performance is for a drastic paradigm shift to a new technology.  \n\n\nWhile that implies competitors can catch up when performance improvement inevitably stalls, it negates the possibility that a competitor can one day leap ahead in performance just by building a better chip.  Physics just won't allow it unless they come up with something radical and revolutionary.  That will probably eventually happen however that radical and revolutionary tech is unlikely to be reliable and ready for deployment when it's first developed.  \n\n\nThat brings me to the other factor which is Nvidia's software and infrastructure support for their AI business.  They're making it as painful as possible for businesses to switch away from them by making the tools and systems everyone uses depend on their proprietary tech.  Competitors would have to not only offer something cheaper but sufficiently easy to use that switching isn't going to result in so much downtime and delays from training and troubleshooting that it's worth it.  That is a herculean task for a company to overcome.  \n\n\nBarring a miracle or an antitrust investigation, it's going to be nearly impossible for a competitor to build a chip that is enough of an improvement that it's worth it for businesses to absorb the expense and inconvenience of switching.  ",

Even google can't convince people outside google to switch to TPUs (i believe it only supports specific AI training workloads and only optimised for JAX/Tensorflow frameworks, but CUDA supports way more than AI training and people are much more familiar with Pytorch)",

One of the promising startups is called PsiQuantum. There are overlaps with quantum computers as well, and for this many large companies are already investing millions (Google, IBM, many more, I won't be surprised if Nvidia is secretly looking into it as well).\n\nThe thing is, that transition isn't going to come suddenly in a span of few days and every customer suddenly switches to said technology in a matter of days or weeks.\n\nThat transition, if it ever happens, will take years. \n\nIt will be painfully obvious when that time comes. As long as you're staying in touch with the market, you wouldn't miss it when this transition happens. You will see it coming. And when that happens, you sell your Nvidia stocks and you buy the stocks of the said new company(s). Or maybe Nvidia is part of that new wave, and then you keep your Nvidia shares.\n \nBut before that happens, I see no reason why you would make up imaginary scare stories and sell Nvidia (or related semiconductor stocks). \n\nThere's 0 evidence to show that Nvidia's dominance is cracking or that there's an emerging competitor. 0 evidence. You are making up wild stories if you think otherwise.",

And won’t be the case for a longtime, if ever. \n\nFeel like AI is overhyped and over inflated; yes, looking at huge data sets to find trends or utilising it to manage huge data - but the conclusions and next steps are still being made by humans. Most AI is still trained to solve a certain problem in a certain set of parameters. Chat-GPT is just a better version of Google Search. And yea, it can automate an email or scrape the internet for a coherent answer to a question, but some of the stuff being said reminds me of how people said in 2017 we would all have a self-driving cars by now. \n\nThings like AI is the next Manhattan Project pffffft no fucking way.",

I did eventually get a 1060, before upgrading to a 2070, eventually swapping out to the 4090 I have right now.\n\nAnd yeah, I definitely remember those days with the scalpers on the 4000 series. I actually waited a few months hoping for prices to come down and they were still elevated. Of course, eventually demand waned and supply was less constrained and I was able to pick one up from my local MicroCenter.\n\nCan’t wait for the 5000 series though. I’m currently running a 49” Ultrawide at 240fps and the 4090 performs fairly well at medium/high settings in some games but I don’t think I can push ultra/max settings in most AAA titles. The next generation monitors are probably going to be 4K 240fps, and a 4090 will not be sufficient enough..\n\nSpeaking of PC builds, I recently decided to swap out my aging 2950X that I bought back in 2016 for an Intel CPU. Never thought I’d be going back to Intel, but their Raptor Lake CPUs seem pretty good for productivity, which is right up my alley. I would’ve love to stay with AMD’s Threadripper CPUs, but unfortunately, there aren’t any motherboard manufacturers that make a form factor suitable for mATX/mITX, so in a way I was forced to go with Intel.\n\nCurrently still in the build phase at this moment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/gls1hxrym17d1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=09ee3d0a240830499ce65c41d5835b20d312f6e8",

Zero ecosystem compared to CUDA. Years before it can even stand a chance to CUDA\n\nI also see 0 reason why you would write something in CUDA and then go though the trouble of converting it to ROCm just to run it on an AMD GPU, taking an uncertain amount of performance hit, coupled with introducing a billion bugs that you have to unit test and fix.\n\nWhen you could have stopped at CUDA and run it full-speed on Nvidia GPUs. Are AMD GPUs cheaper than Nvidia? Maybe, but don't forget the manhours. You need to dedicate your engineers to do the porting and fix their bugs, and you need to do this every single time for every single software you had in CUDA. Those engineers could be working on much better things.\n\nAlso, the ecosystem is just so much better on the green side.",

      "body": "Although NVIDIA has had impressive growth there is no barrier to entry except the fact they dominate deployment in the datacenter. Classic GPU's are now less than 20% of their revenue. Their AI designs are not best in class. Their CUDA software platform is dominant but it really just a variant of a standard math library. Do they make great stuff - yes. Do they push TSMC to the edge - yes but so does every memory/CPU/Flash producer.  AI is significant enough that it is getting its own datacenter solutions. The way NVIDIA builds out AI is very limiting as FB reported - with the arrays 33% underutilized because of design limits. Cerebras destroys NVIDIA in AI.  Intel, having fabs (vs fabless) COULD be a serious competitor as a supplier through a Dell or HP etc. Google rolls their own and has predating NVIDIA's play. Microsoft and Amazon are rolling their own.  Its just not that hard.  This is akin to Ethernet 1998 wherein Cisco ran the board but its now multisourced with Avago (Broadcom) providing silicon to every in-house design.  AMD also has fabs and serious AI development. Tesla (DOJO) has incredible AI development.  \n\nBasically its the Wild West and there are 100's of players. NVIDIA is dominant because they have the slots in the DC's but the number of competitors is enormous. Models are somewhat portable and NOT reliant on NVIDIA to run. There is no secret sauce in NVIDIA hardware. AI is linear algebra. Anyone can do it. Quantum Computing currently does it the best.\n\nFor those interested the benchmarks for performance are called MLPERF.  \n\nThere are many great websites full of reviews but the oldest most read source is \"Microprocessor Report\".",
