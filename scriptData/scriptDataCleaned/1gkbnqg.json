Yet they are by far the best-performing stocks in my portfolio.\n\nAfter both rallied, people were quick to say that both of them would be a pump and dump. But here we are, both of them still hanging on well. Mostly because people have absolutely no idea what they talking about.\n\nE.g. Alibaba has a $25B buyback program. They buy very aggressively in the sub $90, less aggressively in the $90-100 range, and don't buy at all above $100. Essentially creating a floor on the stock price. Sure, you can try to short it, but you can going to dump it right into their buyback program.\n\nAnd Reddit is just so extremely cheap. Just look at Google and Facebook and watch how much they make in ads. There is no reason Reddit can't make a fraction of that. They just need better ad targeting, which is a problem that has been solved before. The closest thing to Reddit is Facebook groups, but have higher engagement due to it's anonymous nature.",
