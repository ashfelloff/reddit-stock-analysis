How hard is Lowes working you?   \nHow long do you think it takes to press 2 buttons and scroll down.. literally took me maybe 8 minutes? Is that a lot of time to you? Working a lot of OT? Covering shifts? The fact that you think this is \"a lot\" of time is honestly sad and kinda pathetic. The fact that you DON'T have time to fuck around on the internet is honestly dystopian. \n\nYour brain just moves slower than most and that's ok. It's because your mom smoked while she was pregnant.\n\nAlso , I can park my BMW wherever I want because it's easy to get out of the lot lol . Takes a few hundred bucks. I know you can't relate but it's really not a big deal to get towed. You literally just go pick it up and pay.\n\nWhy tf would I be driving the X5 for wood anyway? The Raptor has a bigger bed.\n\nNow get back to the register kiddo.",
