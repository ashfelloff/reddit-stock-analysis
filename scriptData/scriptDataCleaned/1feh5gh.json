  "selftext": "Sept 11 (Reuters) - The U.S. government is considering allowing Nvidia to export advanced chips to Saudi Arabia, potentially helping the country train and run the most powerful AI models, Semafor reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe sales of the chips were a main but unofficial topic at GAIN, Saudi Arabia's global AI summit, on Thursday, the report said.\n\nAttendees of the summit, including some who work for the Saudi Data and AI Authority, told Semafor that the country is making efforts to comply with U.S. security requirements to expedite the acquisition of the chips.\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-closer-green-lighting-nvidia-chips-saudi-arabia-semafor-reports-2024-09-11/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-closer-green-lighting-nvidia-chips-saudi-arabia-semafor-reports-2024-09-11/)",
