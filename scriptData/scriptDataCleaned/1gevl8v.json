  "selftext": "Apparently some schools are banning students from wearing Crocs at school cause it \"distracts them\" and are customizable with symbols as well as some safety concerns.\n\n[https://fortune.com/2024/10/28/crocs-school-bans-dress-codes-safety-gen-alpha-gen-z-trend-tripping/](https://fortune.com/2024/10/28/crocs-school-bans-dress-codes-safety-gen-alpha-gen-z-trend-tripping/)\n\nI have Crocs for many years and it is by far the best for being at home, so I am gonna buy this dip and wait for a bounce back.\n\nPrevious earnings were strong and they beat it so I think this is just the perfect \"bad regarded\" new to jump in.\n\nNot financial advise.\n\nEdit: I had an alert set on Crocs at 112 for months. Target 123, 129.\n\nEdit 2: Indeed earnings where today but not bad. I still believe is overreaction.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s4fjokwudpxd1.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=021b26aee8f0f8aac7ad49216f8adea0c5542e36",
