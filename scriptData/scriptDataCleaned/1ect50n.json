This is confirmed by the fact ATT and Verizon have signed on with them before a satellite constellation is even in place. The large telecom companies are already trying to lock up ASTS technology use. Down the road, this company could and most likely will have a borderline monopoly on Satellite cell service. But they will have zero marketing overhead. They will lease their technology to telecom providers for insane fees. This revenue will eventually stabilize out at an astronomical level and they will evolve into a high dividend utility company. \n\nSo you can buy shares now at $15-20. And five years from now it‚Äôs $200-300 with a 7% dividend. \n\nMaybe not, but ASTS has many indicators they are headed in the right direction quickly.
