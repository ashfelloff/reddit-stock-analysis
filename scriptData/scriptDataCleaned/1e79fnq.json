Let’s be realistic here, we’re past due for major corrections in the semi conductor sector especially with rising geopolitical concerns with Taiwan/China. So far the recent slide from 130/140 down to now is institutional rebalancing combined with profit taking and Geopolitical concerns. Who knows when it’ll stop this downtrend but I wouldn’t be taking any bullish positions if I were you. little disclaimer this isn’t investment advice and i’m not a financial advisor as well as I’m long term Bull for NVDA but short term bear till next earnings/news catalyst.

Absolutely brutal. Worst days in 3 years I think?\n\nMarket seems really skittish right now. Wouldnt be shocked if it went down some more, which could certainly pull down NVDA in sympathy. But again, that is macro. In the end, NVDA's price will be based on how much money it makes and how much it predicts making next quarter. I am still very much in the bullish camp there.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying, you could buy half now and wait a week, see if anyone else tanks earnings and we get another sell off. \n\nBut please remember, I am just another imbecile on WSB who has no idea what they are doing! And don't put all your eggs in one basket. Jensen could literally have a heart attack from stress, and then it almost wouldn't matter how much they sold. Obviously, that's not gonna happen. Just making the point that sometimes Shit happens.\n\nPS - IF you get drunk and/or really bored, listen to TSLA earnings call - NVDA comes up. It sounded bullish to me.\n\n[Tesla, Inc.

NVDA is precariously bouncing off of the 50 day. If that doesnt hold then next stop is 110. But the RSI is looking oversold, and if it holds the 50 day then 124 is a major pivot. From there you need a smaller timeframe chart to dial it in more.",
