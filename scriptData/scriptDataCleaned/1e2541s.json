  "selftext": "Hey folks. Among my friend group I'm known as the investor/trader guy.  \nThey've always known this and one or two of them would occasionally approach me to discuss investing or trading. This would happen maybe once every 5 or 6 months.\n\nOver the last couple of weeks I had the most amount of people approaching me asking about trading stocks and options in a very long time. I've been trading for over 12 years and it's never been a good sign when a large number of folks who are normally not at all interested in the stock market, suddenly become interested.\n\nThis is by no means the holy grail of anything. But I've noticed that this kind of behavior usually comes in late in a cycle and I've tended to see markets take a dump on everyone just a few months after a lot of newbies get into the market.\n\nThere was this story about Joe Kennedy, the father of JFK. He was a big investor in the 20s. He was getting his shoes shined sometime in 1929 and when the shoeshine boy gave him stock advice he immediately went and sold everything. Markets crashed that same year.\n\nI remember another anecdote from a WSB degen here sometime in 2021. He said his uber driver had his trading app open throughout the ride and was trading options.\n\nUsually we're closer to the end when you hear a lot of these anecdotes piling up. So I'm interested if anyone else had this same experience lately in maybe the last month or so.",

They were bragging about their retirement portfolio, and I was trying to convince them to take maybe 10% and put it in higher risk assets like BTC.  I showed them all the charts and diagrams I studied and referenced what my friends had told me about price targets.  I told them I owned around 1-2 BTC.\n\nMy aunt listened, but my uncle just shit all over me like no other.  And he decided no go.  If they had, they would've bought about 9-10BTC, worth about 70k at the time.  If they had, they would've had something like 730k at the peak of BTC, which was more than their entire portfolio worth when they first told me.\n\nmy aunt finally made my uncle apologize a few years later once BTC was floating around 60k.",

Gox was the only one trusted back in the day but they were incompetent and everyone since has been equally incompetent and/or corrupt.

Those usually last for a week or two and I got a bit of money every morning to buy lunch.¬†\n\n\nAnyways it was my pizza phase so I went to get some. When I entered the local restaurant the employees where sitting around a laptop talking about stocks. It seemed weird to me then when I just had a simplistic concept of economy and stocks (well I was 11 or 12 or something). Just didn't feel right. A few months later the dot.com bubble burst which hit us europoors quiet hard.\n\n\nI don't think it is one or few persons who know you are trader/investor/gambler that ask you, that should worry you. Everybody is out for an \"easy buck\". It's when you walk anywhere and listen to conversations and everybody talks about stocks, when you maybe should start to worry. On the other hand maybe nowadays with social media maybe different types of warning signals should be considered.",

The thing is, there's a large, increasing number of people that earn a decent salary, enough to buy them the items they want, to dine out, buy groceries, etc. But that's about it, the more life-changing purchases, like a house or condo, are increasingly unattainable, and more and more people that on paper seem like they're getting a good salary can't really make much use of that extra money/savings - or even if they did start to save the market moves away faster than most can save. So that money either just loses value or they have to invest it somewhere. I think more than ever the gaps between \"everyday needs + rent\" <-> \"salary\" <-> \"life changing purchases\" is increasing so much and so fast that even the most risk-averse people eventually get desperate enough to try something.\n\nAlso, goverments are incentivising investing more than ever.
