( Nvidia can not rely on Taiwan for much longer without some consequences )\n\n\n\nthat could come in the form of a minority ownership in one fab facility such as Apollo just completed  \nor simply onshoring chip manufacturing with Intel .\n\n\n\nEither way, it's destined to happen\n\n\n\nIt's news like this that says you want to be in this horse race with Intel",

In it, when asked about defending Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion, the former president and current Republican presidential candidate Trump said:\n\n\n\n\" They did take about 100% of our chip business. I think, Taiwan should pay us for defense... You know, we're no different than an insurance company. Taiwan doesn't give us anything.\"\n\nHowever, Intel is rushing to position itself as a secure alternative, as the only chipmaker besides Korea's **Samsung** that still has leading-edge manufacturing fabs. Under CEO Pat Gelsinger, Intel is investing significantly to build out a leading-edge foundry ecosystem for third parties in a bid to compete with TSMC. \"\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-intel-shares-rallied-today-180000968.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-intel-shares-rallied-today-180000968.html)",
