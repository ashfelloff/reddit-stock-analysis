  "selftext": "CVS awful quarterly earnings:\nCVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  \n\nThe Pennant Group:\nThe Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. \n\nHome health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. \n\nThe main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).\n\nPriced In(?):\nHas this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  \n\nBut CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  \n\nWhile this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.\n\nMy point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.\n\nSenior Living:\nPNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  \n\nPNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

If you have the $, there is no better place to go. Period. We create the most innovative drugs and medical devices on earth. This is not hopium. This is fact. DaVinci devices, CRISPR, 50% of the entire worlds drug patents are in the US, etc. \n\nAnd try to think back to when the whole world thought it was dying from Covid - Who came up with all the vaccines?",

I actually hold a sizable position in some of these equities, however not PNTG. I was considering purchasing PNTG if it reached the $7-8 range last year, however I would not consider it a buy at the current price. I thought at $10 with a PE of 35ish was a bit overpriced, now with the stock doubling in 6 months and with a PE of near 50, definitely overbought on the hype of medical care and rendering services getting that post-covid elective boost. I would say its a better time to actually buy UNH and other insurers, as those right now seem oversold. In any case, I think buying the original parent company before the spin off, ENSG is a better buy currently than PNTG. ENSG is by PE and other valuation metrics cheaper, and seems to have better ratios, it's also much more mature and developed and still has plenty of room for growth, and they are doing consistent acquisitions. PNTG just seems too immature a company to be at the current PE that it's at. I would be a buyer for PNTG below $10.",

I especially like the health companies that have a significant focus on home care like ADUS, PNTG and AMED.  I think insurance companies will try to push patients more and more towards home services to avoid paying for stays in inpatient hospitals and skilled nursing facilities.\n  \nI think the increase in medical service utilization might last longer than expected. Yes, some of it is due to elective procedures put on hold by the pandemic. But I think some of the increase is due to long lasting health conditions brought on by covid, especially dementia.\n\nEven so, I agree that some of these health insurance companies are worth a look at these levels.  HUM is down 40% in 1 year and CVS now has p/e under 10.",
