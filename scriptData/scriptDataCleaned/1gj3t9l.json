If he loses, he'll probably claim it was rigged and direct his supporters to attack polling centers and generally throw a big messy tantrum like last time. \n\nAs for how this is going to effect the markets is anybody's guess. DJT's value is pretty much totally tied to his presidential campaign and is either going to jump or tank depending on how his run turns out. \n\nDue to Elon Musk very vocally inserting himself into said campaign his fortunes are in a similar state, though not quite to the same degree. If DJT wins, the assorted stocks associated with Elon will probably see an increase, if DJT loses, probably a loss. \n\nIt should be noted that if Elon's buddy isn't in office to run interference for him he is likely going to be in a LOT of trouble and long term forecasting for his publicly traded companies becomes volatile and difficult to predict. Especially if his Russia connection gets delved into more deeply by some 3 letter agency and it turns out he's been taking money from a sanctioned enemy of the US on the side.",
