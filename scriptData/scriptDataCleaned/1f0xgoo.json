I don‚Äôt mean that snarky but eventually it will help you become a better trader.\n\nFor me for example, I might close this and take profits most of the times. However if I‚Äôm really high conviction and can stand to lose I‚Äôll ‚Äúroll the dice‚Äù as you say.\n\nEventually you‚Äôll get comfortable with what you‚Äôre comfortable with.  Then you may want to make a game or rule out of it. ‚ÄúIf options increase >= x%, take profit‚Äù or ‚Äúif down -y% or more, cut losses‚Äù, again as a general rule.\n\nI will tell you most of my biggest gains and biggest losses come from not following my own rules, lol \n\nBut, I definitely 100% attribute my long term average growth and gains to following a kind of rule that makes sense for me.\n\nWhen I first started I said I would be okay losing $100‚Ä¶ then it became $250‚Ä¶ then it became $1,000.  That‚Äôs not to say I‚Äôm happy to lose $1,000 but after that point I have a hard decision to make that the market is moving against me and maybe I need to cut losses or I need to stop buying.\n\nObviously options are a little different due to the effective built in end date of the exercise / assignment.  You may hear people say ‚ÄúClose your options at 50% gain and roll them‚Äù which can be effective.  There are some complex ways to think about this using theta, delta and other financial concepts but they aren‚Äôt always necessary if they override what you‚Äôre willing to lose.\n\nLastly, I‚Äôve been known to enter a position and have it gain as little as 3% overnight and just take profits.  Why?  Because of volatility and it being a gift that I can re enter again.  \n\nHope this helps‚Äî \nXoxo\nMaya",
