      "body": "Reminds me of how PLTR was stuck for a while until it printed multiple consecutive quarters of profitability before it broke out from single digits into the teens (and now $21+). Definitely have my eye on the 4/29 GAAP number, although that would only make 2 profitable quarters in a row for SoFi. Might this one need 3 consecutive quarters of profit to get the stock moving?? When do the shorts give up?",
