  "selftext": "Inventory in almost all major areas is extremely high now. Bubble hotspots like Austin, Boise, Phoenix, Asheville, Jacksonville, Las Vegas etc etc haven‚Äôt seen much price reduction even though inventory has returned to pre pandemic levels. Inventory is sitting for months.\n\nWhy? \n\nBecause there is no active suffering. There is no current pain for most people who own homes. Anyone who is holding stocks is doing pretty damn good right now. 401k‚Äôs are nice and fat for most people of homeowner age. The people in pain right now are those who don‚Äôt own assets, aka most consumers. Future home buyers. \n\nThe only thing holding the entire stock market together is AI. AI is in massive hype mode right now. It‚Äôs in the ‚Äúthis time it‚Äôs different‚Äù phase. While it really does produce a massive productivity increase, it‚Äôs not the magic people seem to think it is. It‚Äôs more like Excel or a calculator. Or the original computers. A productivity and efficiency booster in short. Investors seem to think it can replace everything. It won‚Äôt. At least not anywhere in the near term.\n\nWhen the reality of this sets in, and it will, the entire market will start coming down to reality again. \n\nWhy?\n\nEvery single company is reporting that consumers are in a very weak spot right now. Demand for almost everything is coming up less than anyone predicted. Companies are downgrading expectations for the year. People are fed up with inflation and the massive cost of living increases. Salaries are not rising to keep up with the cost of living. Even companies that are historically bulletproof such as McDonalds are surprised by a very weak consumer. Credit card debt is higher than ever right now. Student loans are sky high and aren‚Äôt being forgiven. People are graduating from STEM degrees and Master‚Äôs degrees yet they can‚Äôt find jobs in their field to pay back their loans. People are extremely risk adverse due to layoffs right now. Job openings for anything other than low paying jobs are worse than during the beginnings of COVID. \n\nDirect consumers make up 66% of the entire US GDP. The consumers are at their weakest in a very long time yet many companies and the broader market are near all time highs\n\nWhy? \n\nMarkets are being propped up by AI hype within a few certain companies. \n\nWhen this hype dies, the domino effect of pain and suffering will ensue. The panic selling of housing will ensue. No one will want to buy because no one can time a bottom (but they will try). People will be worth a whole lot less with no way to buy and will seek to off load their houses as quickly as possible to make up for their net worth loss. When retirement accounts and markets are down, this causes severe financial duress on people - mentally and literally. If we had current inventory levels during the crash in 2022, real estate would have crashed as well. Instead, it was propped up by low interest rates and an extremely strong job market. Picture the current weak consumer, with his 401k now cut down severely. \n\nWhen will this happen? I don‚Äôt know. How much more can hype propel the market? I don‚Äôt know. How low will the bottom be? I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs almost impossible to accurately time the market. But this will be the catalyst. ",

      "body": "I think your general gist is somewhat correct. As someone who lived through the dotcom bubble where *nothing can ever go wrong, this is the new future, the new permabull revolution, can only go up up up up! Pets dot com is going to be a $100 trillion company!*  only to have reality come crashing down like Armageddon with the 2000 dotcom bust -- and stay busted for a number of years -- I see a lot of the same rhetoric these days. Same for in the run-up and aftermath of the GFC.  Trends can both be true long-term yet also far too early and be absorbed more slowly; not nearly as potent as the dopamine-running hype is at the moment.\n\nI think where you might be wrong (or there's more uncertainty) is the problem with looking backward to predict future outcomes, because we are largely in unprecedented, unknown, territory. Particularly, we had close to 15 years of ZIRP producing infinite money like never before. Never in contemporary history have we had a long decade of ZIRP printing like it's no tomorrow like this period.\n\nThat means there's still trillions of liquidity sloshing around with no idea what to do itself except speculate on the best returns, further juicing the underlying speculative asset. There's no real comparison at all to past events.\n\nWhat this has also led is to a severely bifurcated (k-shaped) socioeconomic system: there's the 'Premium Consumer' and then there's The Masses. The Premium Consumer is still riding high on the results of years of ZIRP, sitting very pretty, and will be for the foreseeable future even if there's a big market pulldown. The Masses on the other hand? Meh.. As far as plutocrats are concerned at the moment, they're simply unnecessary baggage:  flotsam.\n\nNow what does that mean for system stability if one line is going up and one is pointing into the ground? To be determined I suppose.",

Currently even after the drop in prices it is  worth 550k and if I wanted to buy the same dang home again right now my payments would be like 5-6k a month. Why would I ever sell and buy a new house?

It's not necessarily systemic but I think there's going to be a period where we need to learn how to use it properly.

Your points on consumer weakness and inflated asset prices are on the money, but it seems a bit much of a simplification to ascribe that all to AI. More than just technological overvaluation, housing crashes throughout history have more to do with high interest rates, job loss, and credit crunches.\n\nYes, you may well be right, and stock markets may well take a dip when the AI bubble bursts, but I suppose relating that directly to the housing crash might be bypassing other major factors in the form of government policy responses, international economic pressures, or unforeseen global events like pandemics. Plus, a lot of people buy homes for long-term living, not short-term investment, which may help mitigate the damage a bit. But then again, I think it is not as simple as this; the situation does go beyond just the AI factor in an economy. What are the policy implications we should be considering here?",
