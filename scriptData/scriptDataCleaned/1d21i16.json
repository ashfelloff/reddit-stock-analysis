While 2023 was dry.  Farmers apply residual herbicides around planting time, before the crops emerge.  Excess rain washes away this residual herbicide, making it ineffective.  If this happens, farmers must apply more post emerge herbicide, after the corn starts to grow.  \n\n[Herbicide and Rainfall](https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2017/effect-excessive-rainfall-efficacy-residual-herbicides-applied-corn-and-soybean)\n\nBased on this, there could be a significant jump in herbicide demand this growing season.  I wrote about FMC corporation last week.  That trade has not worked out at all so far.  But, I still believe in this play.  So I am continuing to hold FMC and I added positions in 2 additional crop protection companies at the end of last week: Corteva and Bayer.\n\nPositions:  231 shares of FMC, 388 shares of Corteva, 2,875 shares of Bayer.",

In general, the I-states weather forecasts are not looking promising the next seven days. \n\nI do agree with you that destocking of chemicals is coming to an end based on actual sales April-May‚Ä¶ but the increase in revenues and hitting targets for these companies are based more on their seed and genetics royalties and less on the chem portfolios, especially Corteva‚Ä¶. My guess is everyone will be down YoY on chem sales‚Ä¶. But on target, on the lower end for EBITDA estimates in 2024. \n\nGranted, I‚Äôve been a buy & hold of Corteva for quite a while.

On the topic of Bayer: they're currently priced lower than they were in 1998 and I think that is a steal considering they're still a very good R&D house with a lot of muscle in the traits business; the lawsuits are a financial downside, but the underlying business is still solid IMO.  I've been going long ever since the price dropped below $12/share.",

It's off season, so I didn't think events there will have a big impact on pesticide demand in the coming months.  I plan to hold these companies for the short term. \n\nEurope actually has a similar situation to North America.  They had quite a severe drought in 2022 and I believe 2023 was dry too.  2024 planting season rainfall was above average.  \n\nBayer has won some of its most recent lawsuit cases, so let's hope that trend continues.",
