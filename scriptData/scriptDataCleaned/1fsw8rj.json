      "body": "Psychedelics definitely show psychiatric treatment potential. However, unlike conventional medications, they cannot address mental health issues all by themselves (not reliably, anyhow). They need to be combined with specifically designed therapies administered by professional therapists. This second essential half of the equation is the real challenge, not the drugs. Timing this is still a huge gamble, IMHO. If I understand it correctly, FDA has yet to approve their first such drug/therapy combo (the research organizations have yet to provide convincing and consistent evidence from their trials). Once that happens, I'm sure it's going to print. Until then, it's just burning money.\n\nBesides, there may be significant lobby against this by the traditional psychiatric drug manufacturers (LLY et al.), because their products do not actually cure anything and they need to be taken \"indefinitely\", almost guaranteeing revenue. Psychedelics, on the other hand, promise long-term or permanent improvement in some conditions, meaning that the gravy train would gradually slow down for the traditional industry. Who knows, what kind of political and institutional bribery is going on behind the scenes (atop of the existing revolving door between pharma and FDA, allegiances and favors owed, etc.).",
