But not sure about it now. \n\nAnd these smaller companies like Anthropic and OpenAI will lose out eventually to Google/Meta because they just cannot compete with spending.

They need to be bought out by Amazon/Microsoft or fall behind eventually.\n\nSo Google is going to rise as the dominant cloud provider for AI applications, LLM customers as the other two flounder. Google has end to end offering, own AI/LLM, own cloud service, own hardware to train future AI. And even their own customer channel to deliver the AI to users, through android/pixel phones etc.\n\nGoogle’s cloud service will massively benefit from their AI initiatives. \n\nThis is not even counting other moonshots like Waymo which is the only robotaxi that’s actually running, generating revenue and expanding.",
