I don't have any big objections except that the scale from from trigger to the platue of productivity doesn't seem to take into account that a lot of these systems/technologies will not come into full fruition until some of the other technologies have reached the plateau. So they will drag and pull on each other on the timeline. I mean computer vision is great and all but combine it with plateaud robotics and autonomous vehicles and you get that chase seen with the truck from Terminator 2. Alone it's just Google Lens.\n\nAnd by the way. The title of this post was very misleading and made it harder to read the graph correctly. I wish he had posted a link to original report as well. . .
