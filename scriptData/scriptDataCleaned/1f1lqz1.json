Now is the time so as to not be left out of the so called arms and technology race. Intel is years behind NVDA. NVDA isint playing defense on anything. They are operating ok all four engines. The only reason stock is down is because so many holders are nervous fickle wrecks that don’t even understand the fundamentals of why and how it’s such a dominate company.",

What I mean is, the share price already reflects the multiples of it being dominant. Just to maintain its current share price relative to its rivals, it has to continue to operate as well as it is now, whereas it would have to show opportunity for substantial additional growth to go much higher.  In contrast, Intel is indeed several years behind, which means that signs that it is succeeding in reorganizing itself to close that gap are likely to drive the stock higher whenever they appear. \n\nThat doesn't guarantee that Intel will close the gap, nor that Nvidia will fall behind.  Rather, strictly in terms of share price, a continuing great performance by Nvidia that doesn't show substantial growth is likely to leave the share price relatively flat, whereas for Intel, there is much more potential for large movement in *either* direction.\n\nOr so it seems to me, anyway.",

I believe their earnings will double from last year. The big seven and other companies can’t get enough NVDA chips and they are known to be the best. This is a tech arms race around the world. Not a military arms race but the race for consumer share. It will be a year at least probably two before Intel and AMD can catch up to the quality and qty.",
