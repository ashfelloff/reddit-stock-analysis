Do some research on the ones likely to give some high returns (AI and tech seems to be big right now but again do your dd). Put the other 20% into either a roboadvisor (vanguard, betterment, and wealthfront have good ones - research!) or a decent high yield savings account (Marcus or Amex should be fine). Stay away from stocks and the urge to trade - the time will come once you're out of the red. Hope this helps and feel free to ask anything follow ups",

It will Halle against your earned income,  it much but it’s something. \nRetire from trading options…you took a 50/50 chance and got smoked. \nDon’t feel bad just forget about the amount and go back to work. Save up and in a few years it will have been a worth while lesson. Right now it sucks but you sir are done with options.",
