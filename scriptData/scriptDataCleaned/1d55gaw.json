But i agree with that point, 30-60mins is max you really wanna hold any 0dte, Theta can eat up so much that even if it keeps going your way, you might make LESS off of it losing value. I've seen that before when I sell for some good green, then check later if it kept moving that way, and the contracts will still be less than what I sold for.
