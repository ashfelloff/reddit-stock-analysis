Even assuming he's making 400k, he wouldn't be working until his early 30s because of all the extra required years in residency/fellowship. \n\nIt's hilarious when you people make these calculations as if someone making 400k/yr is not going to have major expenses and just shoving all their cash into their savings. How exactly are you going to save 250k/yr POST tax and post expenses. Medical school debt alone is 300k-400k on 6-7٪ interest. \n\n\nEstimating Savings for a $400,000 Income:\n\nHere’s a rough estimate of the total expenses:\n\nTaxes: $140,000 (average of 30-35%)\n\nStudent Loans: $24,000 (moderate repayment plan)\n\nHousing: $48,000 (mid-range)\n\nInsurance: $20,000\n\nLiving Expenses: $50,000\n\nRetirement Contributions: up to $49,000 assuming profit sharing \n\n\nTotal estimated expenses = $342,000\n\nIf the physician earns $400,000, they would have approximately *$58,000* left for discretionary savings each year.\n\nNow run the numbers again and explain to me how you will have 250k/year saved 😂",

Now most people would think I was wrong, but I'd just say it wasn't the stock for them. The stock was CORZ, bought in late December of 22 (ticker was CORZQ) for about $1370ish. By late January it was already at $4300. I could've sold then for a huge gain, but I felt led to hold the stock. I followed it through bankruptcy, even calling in to the court hearings to participate and follow along. They exited ch11 last January, did a reverse split and gave the existing shareholders a bunch of warrants. So today I own the stock plus two tranches of warrants with a total value of over $80k.

      "body": "A fairly safe play is a call & put position on SPY. With it at new ATH’s it’s probably going to pull back soon but it could also fly higher.\n\nA November 29th $580C and $580P would cost you about $2600 plus fees and if SPY moves 6% between now and then you’ll make $1500 and if it moves 9% you’ll make $2800. Anything more and it’s even bigger money and you got 47 days for it to happen which increases your odds. Especially since it moved over 5% this last month. \n\nOne bonus is you can make money on the call and the put, if SPY drops 9% you make $2800 profit (100% profit) off your position you can still hold your call and if SPY rebounds to $580 you’ll make $1400+ extra since your Put would’ve already doubled what you paid for the entire position",
