This as part of my strategy to concentrate in disparate but high conviction plays, up to a set allocation. I’m currently considering treating the LEAPS as shares, but would really appreciate input, thanks. Much Love and Success to you all!",

I was trying to establish a large leveraged position on it in advance of the news that satellites are transported and then launched, but I don’t have the allocation set aside to add right now. I will, if I can get ahead of the news in time. (And sell into that volatility on shorter dated, but hold LEAPS as if shares, for now. May mean some ugly in the future. But I can’t predict that and if all goes well, this position could serve me really, really well.

Obviously I got quite lucky in the timing of these (all pictured were purchased in May and some others in a different account earlier in the year.) But my reasoning then was in part based on more efficient capital allocation (now I’m pretty squarely focused on greed.) That’s definitely risky on a pre-revenue company. My point is that I was able to control far more shares through the contracts than I could have purchased outright.

That said, I’m still a beginner, so careful with my advice! Right now I’m learning to cut losses and on smaller plays take smaller gains more often. Also using straddles and strangles on other tickers. \n\nFor ASTS, yes, I think that LEAPS are still a good play. I think that when the satellites move to launch site, there will be a pop (sell 1/2 November contracts then.) And again, if the satellites unfurl, another pop (will sell the rest of the November calls then.) After that, the price may stay elevated and then more so as revenue starts coming in and growing. So I think it’s still a buy today. I will likely buy some shares and June2026 LEAPS (if available by then) with profits from the November calls, so I clearly think if things continue to go well that it’s a bargain now. \n\nRight now I am building up my next YOLO/large speculative position. I had wanted to post it now as I see catalysts for the fall, but only have about $5k in…so Idk, too early to share I guess. But that’s on Aurora Innovation, $AUR. I’m building up shares, Jan 2026 LEAPS calls and the very cheap warrants (Nov 2026.)\n\nAlso, my NVDA position is quite large, compared to the rest of my account. Several hundred shares and 125/135/138 strikes with Sept/Oct/Nov expiries. I added more calls on this dip today, and plan to sell them and buy NVDA and TSLA LEAPS and build AUR up (maybe ASTS and more MSTR calls after the split.) Clearly, my largest holdings are extremely speculative, but they’ve all done well and play well together, so fingers crossed, and also, caveat.\n\nWish you the best!",

                  "body": "Since this update, I’ve added calls at 17.5 for November. May not get there, but I like the leverage and that strategy has worked well on this ticker. (Also, it’s better should I exercise instead.) I’m looking for the run up to profit and move into shares. I find the far out LEAPS calls efficient for low cost stocks - “bottom fishing” as someone described it. It’s risky, of course, but on something so speculative (& pre-revenue,) with a <$5 share price (like ASTS before and AUR now,) it’s efficient capital allocation for me. The FAQ only the ASTS sub is great. And there you can find a share price calculator with adjustable variables. If ASTS succeeds with this next satellite launch, the future is very bright indeed. \n\nFor AUR, I skipped ITM and ATM entirely. Pure “bottom fishing” with maximum leverage. I am far less confident that the share price will hit the strike price than I was with ASTS. I think commercialization may be on track for this fall. And that catalyst will lift the share price, I hope, and I will likely sell the calls for profit and buy back in on the dips that I expect. I have great respect for management at AUR, so bought the time in case it keeps taking off. Those calls are all January 2026, farthest out available with a 7.5 strike. Wide spread that far OTM, so I will likely add more closer with profits the rest of the summer, so they have a chance to go ITM this fall. I also hold warrants for November 2026, to again maximize the timeline. Those are very cheap compared to calls (and shares.) I don’t usually trade warrants, but the terms associated with these are comfortable to me. May well have to exercise them though (if they don’t expire worthless.) Will have to see whether they remain thinly traded.)\n\nHahaha, thanks, that’s a kind compliment. AUR is definitely a wild card play, but clearly I like those. I do think they will do well in the next year or two, and going forward with less uncertainty than ASTS, but less excitement, too. It’s crazy to me that my wild ones are holding my accounts up over all. I’m not worried about the NVDA calls as I bought time. Bummed that I couldn’t sell them as soon as I’d like, but. Better than AMZN! Guh. I had a few 200c and sold most up 80%, but foolishly “let one ride” to about $10. And have some others for October that I am losing faith in, but think will break even plus a small gain. I really really like MSTR for the short and medium term (shares in Roth for longterm hold through volatility.) I will definitely add calls after the split, at least six months out, and trade them on the dips and spikes. The volatility is great on that for trading, but I found contracts far too stressful (and expensive) to trade at this price. (Only have shares atm.) Whether one believes in BTC or not, I think it’s likely there will be surges in the coming year to profit from. \n\nI’ve been playing with ACHR and that has been fun. Time is running out as I don’t want to hold through earnings in August, but have done calls/puts/calls and profited. It’s nice because they are cheap compared to the big tech. Also, ENVX, which is similar in that I will sell before catalysts in August. I got *really* lucky on LNTH and decided to play lower stakes with that profit. When I’m messing about with my portfolio tonight, I’ll check for other promising shorter term plays. (My goal with ASTS and AUR is to hold shares for the long term.)\n\nWhat are you trading these days?",
