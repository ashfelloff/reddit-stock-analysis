People knew 2010 was a good time to buy a house. It wasn’t a secret. But people lost their jobs. They took massive pay cuts. Tens of thousands of retired airline pilot pensions vanished into thin air and all they had left was social security. That recession lasted what seemed like an eternity. My first accounting job after college was filled with boomers and gen x who were just thankful they had a job with benefits. My trainer was a partner at a regional accounting firm that went under, she went from 200k to 40k with a smile on her face. \n\nThe reason why prices were so low is because everyone was impacted either directly or indirectly. My parents didn’t lose their home but my dad lost his job and mowed lawns for my uncles landscaping business for $8/hr. \n\n“It’s going to crash and I’m going to buy”. That’s exactly the reason why it’s not going to crash. And if it does you won’t be unscathed. Any cash you have will be used to stay afloat. Asking for a 2008 crash is like asking for April 2020 again because you want another 1,500 stimulus check knowing what the consequences of all that is.",
