People are worried they are overstretching themselves with the fabs and will go bankrupt in the process. Intel is only $21 because of the risk of them going bust if they keep burning cash on the fabs. If they somehow pull it off they will be $100+ easily. For transparency I have invested about $100,000 into Intel and the possible scenarios are: 1. Chip design & fab success = >$100/share, fab fails & is sold off = $30-50/share, fab fails and bankrupts intel = $0. It‚Äôs a risky bet but potential high payout, but also significant risk, so if you are investing ensure you are prepared and happy with all scenarios.",

They're throwing cash at their fabs because they see that as their long-term cash cow.\n\nAs you said, we're in a boom. Nvidia and AMD are riding that boom, but it won't last forever. When it ends, they'll be the same companies they were before. Intel is using all the cash they're getting from the government to fund their hail Mary on fabs. If it works, they'll be set for the long run.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying now is the time to buy Intel. They've got years until the gamble pays off, and they could also falter before then. I own Nvidia. They're a way better short-term play as they're riding this wave of AI hype. But once the hype goes down, their valuation will slide with it. No one should be long 10 years for Nvidia.

He barges into the room questioning every fucking thing on minute and insignificant details and it is nigh to impossible to convince him once he is set on something. He is the epitome of savant oversimplification with the worst possible attitude. I hated the fucking guy, and me being a woman, even worse for details that are not relevant.\n\nBut, you can‚Äôt deny that his approach drives the engineers to rally around his vision for whatever self flagellating reasons, and thus he ends up optimizing production processes.\n\nIf you have an industry set on norms and you need to disrupt the fuck out of it and optimize it, he is your guy. You just need to nail the time to pull him out before he runs it to the ground(cybertruck)\n\nEDIT: twitter is definitely not the right fit for him. Production/manufacturing is where it works for him‚Ä¶ until he builds a cyber truck",

Global foundries, TSM, Samsung stock price doesn‚Äôt move much compared to the ones who design the efficient chips.

Despite what the comments here suggest, Intel has more than double the revenue of AMD, only 10% behind Nvidia. They're just spending their money gearing up to compete with TSMC, not AMD or Nvidia.\n\nTheir plan is to turn the silicone market into a duopoly instead of a monopoly. A much more stable source of income than fighting fabless brands like AMD and Nvidia. But it's a gamble because of the high cost to get in.",
