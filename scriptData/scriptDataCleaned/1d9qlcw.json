  "selftext": "Market opened and I was choosing between NVDA or TSLA calls expiring tomorrow. Followed my heart and went with TSLA. YOLO'd half my account on TSLA 177.5 calls expiring tomorrow and immediately went into the red. Watching NVDA moon at the open was like bleeding from the heart. Anxiety peaked till 9:30, had to hit a yoga session to calm down.\n\nFinished yoga at 11 and totally forgot I was holding TSLA calls. It was peak TSLA price at around 11. Remembered my calls 15 minutes later, saw it was still up big, and cashed out for a profit nearly 3000 right away. I'm done today. Time for some good food. Yoga gave me a calm mind and good luck.\n\nNamaste, my fellow degenerates.üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüìà",
