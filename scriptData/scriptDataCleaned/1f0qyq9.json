  "score": 1313,
  "selftext": "I do research on the darkweb for my day job, and I've found conclusive evidence on a darkweb hacker forum that a publicly-traded pharma R&D company was badly hacked and their IP stolen. No news stories on it yet. Is it legal to short the company's stock and then announce/publicize that they got hacked?\n\nMy understanding is that there are basically \"due diligence\" / activist short-seller firms that publish negative reports on companies all the time, which they've taken a position against, and that's legal, right? But at the same time, I'm just some guy, not someone working for one of those firms. Obviously if there's any chance this counts as insider trading, wouldn't want to do it.",

Lots of people write lots of things that get posted to the Internet. What he finds on the Dark Web could just be a rumor someone is trying to start. Anybody who goes to that forum can find the same information for themselves.

      "body": "Ask a securities lawyer to be sure but in general, it’s insider trading if a position of trust was leveraged to get the info or if you paid cash or good will or favors or ‘psychological debt’ for confidential info otherwise. For example if you paid the hackers for the info or to hack the firm, most likely all kinds of illegal especially if you trade it. If the hacker is an old buddy and you didn’t pay, yes that’s risk too. Publicizing it increases your risk considerably as well. \n\nA lot of the risk profiling is also going to be the amount of money you make. If you make a few million here, you’ll absolutely get a call from the sec, so you better be in the right if you do. If you make 5k, it’s very unlikely anyone cares. In any case, it may make sense to network a bit and get a friend of a friend in securities law to give you their perspective. \n\nAt a glance I think this is okay to trade if you don’t publicize, but I’d definitely ask my securities lawyer before doing a trade and ESPECIALLY before publicizing it were I in your situation, and have a plan for how you’ll respond to an SEC questionnaire or cold call if you end up with one. In that case you need the lawyers talking and need to refer all of it to your lawyer with absolutely no other comment even if you are 100% in the clear - lies get you in trouble too. Best is if you are in the clear, you trade it, you make money, and your lawyers explain all of that to the sec if you get asked. Not everyone has a securities lawyer they can dial though.\n\nFor some situations though you’d not want the sec attention even if you can handle perfectly and did nothing wrong. With your career that might be a consideration too. Would you have a problem if the sec opened a brief inquiry into you even if they found no fault? Would you have a problem if everyone knew you publicized it?\n\nAnother route might be to whistleblow the company for not disclosing the breach and hope for a modest whistleblower award. You’ll also want a lawyer to do that one correctly, some might help on contingency. You won’t have personal criminal legal risk or reputation risk really with that one. \n\nTLDR: ask a lawyer. I think probably okay to trade it but you’ll get a lot of heat if you also publicize and should not do so without legal counsel giving you parameters and the clear. There may be major reputation problems also for you here. Tread very carefully.\n\nLastly, and most critically: this doesn’t mean the stock will tank! It might it might not!
