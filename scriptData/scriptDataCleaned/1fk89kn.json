  "selftext": "1) lower interest rates mean lower discounting of future cash flow -> future growth is worth more in the present \n\n2) lower interest rates -> more debt available to the rich\n\nCombine these two and you get more money piling into VC, looking for growth. We’re still a long way away from ZIRP, but every bp down will move money in this direction \n\nWhere does that money go? Take a look at the recent YC batches and you’ll see that the majority of it is going and will be going into AI startups. \n\nFed -> rich assholes -> VC Funds -> Startups -> companies renting GPUs -> companies selling GPUs",

The idea is to cut steps out of the hiring process, improve first impressions, and not have job seekers constantly repeat themselves.\n\n\n\nStill a lot to do.\n\n\nThe next major features will focus on job seeker products so that people have more they can do with it besides share it with hiring teams or a recruiter who reaches out. For example, generating a \"debiased\" pdf to submit to jobs outside the platform.\n\n\nOn the hiring team side I'm looking for feedback on what we have so far and ideally can find a few roles to do a free pilot with. Since the job seeker gets a job fit report and an overall rating, such as \"fair\", we can block people who are a \"bad\" fit before they apply (and tell them why). Both the job seeker and hiring team see the same thing.",

Since it's a new paradigm, some of it is experimenting to see what works and what doesn't. \n\nThe current vision is that employers, would post a job in their usual places and then link to the Heavy Resume site's posting from their job posting. Candidates would need to create a Heavy Resume if they don't have one yet. When they're ready to interview someone, they can request contact info and use that to set up the next steps.",
