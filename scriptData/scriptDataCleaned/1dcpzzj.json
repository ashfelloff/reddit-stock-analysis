Anyways, follow me for more future DDs. \n\nIdk who but someone started a rumor on fintwit that $AAPL would be replacing Safari with Opera $OPRA and announcing it at their WWDC event in 30 minutes. Twitter has been spamming this all day and the stock is up like 25%. I don't know why they would do this since they own Safari so it makes zero sense. Sure maybe they announce something with Opera but I'm calling bullshit. Anyways it's a good risk reward as 17.5 puts are selling for 1.75 and if they don't announce anything and it goes back to where it closed Friday it's over a 100% gain.\n\nSmall lotto position:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i3h60jskur5d1.png?width=1490&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cdb4cb14c506c0f5b32f9bede51d98404da292f",
