It would damage competition and the ability form them to compete with Tesla. \n\nBYD has floated building a Mexico factory to import into the US. I highly doubt Trump is going to allow Chinese owned EV companies the chance to do that. \n\nAlso imagine if those federal fleet contracts for F150s and other cars started going to Tesla instead. I can see investor logic here but I remain skeptical about how much Trump will help Tesla.",
