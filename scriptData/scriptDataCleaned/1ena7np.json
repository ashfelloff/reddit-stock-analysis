  "selftext": "I’ve been following HIMS for the last few months, have a small position but expanding it today. They released earnings this week and beat eps revenue raised guidance announced buybacks, and the stock is down like 40% over last few weeks. Analysts estimates are in the 20s (not that this means much) and the stock was in the 20s a few weeks ago. They are getting into compounded GLP-1 inhibitors, announced compounding pharmacy acquisitions, and are very bullish for the short and near term. Don’t know what I’m missing here, but this seems like a tremendous buy. The stock has been trying to go up over the last few days, but it seems there is heavy hedge fund control going on causing plummets based on nothing. A few minutes ago stock was heading towards green and decreased 5% on no news within around a minute.\n\nEDIT: Just to show I’m putting my money where my mouth is, here are my positions\n\n[HIMS positions](https://ibb.co/xHHsKYj)\n\nEDIT2: Deleted cross posts, stock appears green for the first time in a few days finally and is up around 6% from low today as of 1:45 EST\n\nEDIT3: Upward trend continues! 7% swing from deep red to green so far today and rising\n\n[HIMS 2:17pm EST](https://ibb.co/P5ZtkQB)",

No idea if it's causal, but it's a concern. As a GLP-1 user, this side effect has given me the most hesitation.\n2. Increasing availability of brand-name GLP-1s. Compounding is only legal because of shortages.  Zepbound is no longer in shortage, and Wegovy is only still in shortage because it came on the scene first and has more active prescriptions.  It won't be for much longer.\n3. New GLP-1s coming on the scene that are not in shortage.  Roche just dropped results, and Lilly has Retatrutide in phase 2 trials.\n4. HIMS is competing with every other less well known compound pharmacy that came on the scene first. Henrymeds is probably the most prominent, but there are literally hundreds.\n\n\nAll of this means it's unclear how long HIMS will be able to be in the GLP-1 compounding game, and how profitable that will end up being.  My guess - mostly sideways, maybe some near term upside, and then a big crash when shortages are ended.",
