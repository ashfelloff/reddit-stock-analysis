  "score": 2006,
  "selftext": "Boeing had another weak month for aircraft sales in May, taking orders for just four new planes\n\nBoeing received orders for only four new planes in May — and for the second straight month, none for its best-selling 737 Max, as fallout continues from the blowout of a side panel on a Max during a flight in January.\n\nThe results released Tuesday compared unfavorably with Europe's Airbus, which reported orders for 27 new planes in May.\n\nBoeing also saw Aerolineas Argentinas cancel an order for a single Max jet, bringing its net sales for the month to three.\n\nThe dismal results followed poor figures for April, when Boeing reported seven sales — none of them for the Max.\n\nBoeing hopes that the slow pace of orders reflects a lull in sales before next month's Farnborough International Airshow, where aircraft deals are often announced.\n\nBut the Federal Aviation Administration is capping Boeing's production of 737s after a door plug blew out from an Alaska Airlines Max, allegations by whistleblowers that Boeing has taken shortcuts to produce planes more quickly, and reports of falsified inspection records on some 787 Dreamliner jets.\n\nBoeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, delivered 24 jetliners in May, including 19 Max jets. Ireland's Ryanair got four and Alaska Airlines took three. Airbus said it delivered 53 planes last month.\n\nDespite the slow pace of recent sales, Boeing still has a huge backlog of more than 5,600 orders.\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/boeing-sales-tumble-company-gets-orders-737-max-111021215",

The biggest difference in comfort comes from which airline you choose, not the model of airplane\n\nIt's mostly the airline's design decisions that determine how much legroom you get, what entertainment systems you have, etc.\n\nIncidentally, Qatar doesn't have showers in first class because... they don't have first class, even on A380s. So again, choice of airline matters more than choice of plane when it comes to comfort\n\nEdit: Just wanna add, screw all of the North American airlines - the absolute worst in terms of comfort.

                  "body": "Truthfully, it is somewhere in between. While it is favorable to hate on Boeing right now, and rightfully so due to the grossly negligent actions we’ve learned about from the leadership in the company - statistically speaking this has had virtually zero visible impact on the end result of safety rates flying on their planes so far.\n\nSo far, about 6 years ago when they had the MCAS crashes, those are the only 2 fatal aircraft failures in the ~400,000,000+ commercial flights their planes have operated in the last 20ish years. Both were caused by the same malfunction, both in third world regions where pilot training and airline regulation, maintenance etc is much, much poorer.\n\nBut again - at the same - they denied any issue with their planes until a second crash happened and made it clear that there is a failure in the aircraft’s software.\n\nSo far, the door plug *is* a one-time thing, *so far*. Fortunately, that plus the whistleblower pressure has led to an audit and hearings for Boeing manufacturing and Boeing leadership. Ideally, this puts things back on track for Boeing and their leadership personnel without any deaths ever needing to be a motivating factor, since none thankfully were involved with the door plug failure initially. \n\nUltimately, these safety rates are still best in the airline industry, and the idea that Boeing planes are unsafe and falling out of the skies is a fantasy created by the reporting spin. Nobody should be afraid, especially in a country with good aircraft regulation (like anywhere first-world). \n\n*yet*, at the same time, it’s very possible that if these things like the door plug and the whistleblower didn’t ever happen, the company’s safety practices would have continued to slip in the name of cost savings until a worse accident happened. \n\nIn the end, this is what I mean by saying it’s “somewhere in between”. As anyone with a good level of familiarity with aerospace and the airline industry will tell you - It’s not nearly as bad as the news reporting spin has made it appear for the sake of grabbing clicks at the expense of people’s’ fears of flight. On the other hand, the company’s eroded mentality towards safety practices and the oversights by their leadership deserve major criticism and potentially criminal trials for the leaders responsible for the safety erosions.\n\nEdit: Case and point - Just did the research and Boeing’s accident rate due to aircraft failure is still significantly lower than even Airbus’s, though both companies maintain ridiculously low fatal aircraft failure rates (like you can count them on one hand per decade).   Both stretches are the two best 20 year stretches of aircraft safety any manufacturer has ever seen with their aircraft. Though, without the intervention we’ve seen, it’s possible that Boeing would have started to get worse and tumble much lower. So that’s another way to illustrate my point.",

They are a part of the commercial aviation industry which encompasses original equipment manufacturers such as Boeing as well as airlines.\n\nBoeing itself currently under very strong regulation by the FAA.\n737 production is capped at 38 frames per month by the FAA.\n\n This production cap is in place as a result of the door plug incident as well as the other quality control and procedural compliance issues.\n\nSo in a sense the door plug incident is hamring sales but the reason for that isn't the event itself but the regulatory action that's occured as a result of it.\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/news.sky.com/story/amp/boeing-blocked-from-increasing-737-max-production-amid-ongoing-safety-concerns-13145911\n\nThe 787 just had a new airworthiness directive issued.\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/17/2024-10299/airworthiness-directives-the-boeing-company-airplanes\n\nThe 777X hasn't received it's type inspection authorisation and cannot begin certification flights because the FAA essentially forced Boeing to restart the certification process.\n\nLack of regulation is not the issue here. Boeing is currently being micromanaged by the FAA and frankly they deserve it. This entire mess is of their own making.",

Two have crashed (or 'disappeared from radar') thus far.\n\n>*Lack of sufficient government regulation was one of the key enablers for the MAX crisis but that’s not the issue right now.*\n\nMaybe for you. For those who fly regularly, it's an enormous issue. There are a ton of those fragile badly built shitboxes flying.\n\n>The airline industry as a whole is still very strongly regulated. \n\nHahahaha. Really? Let;s pivot to discuss the ***endless*** bullshit Southwest has put its passengers through in the last few years. \n\nThen let's talk about how the swine in the 'strongly regulated' airline industry have just filed suit because they're upset that the cash cow which has been, FOR DECADES, hidden fees on tickets has been kicked to the curb. \n\nOnly thieves and charlatans would go to court and say \"We NEED to keep all those hidden fees! It's a pleasant surprise for our customers when they discover after they've bought their ticket that the ticket they just bought does not currently come with a seat assignment.\"\n\nThey can roll the dice and get one assigned at the boarding gate (almost always the center seat), OR they can pay $55 now (each way) to get a seat assignment. And by the way **that seat you just bought can be taken away at any time by any flight attendant for any reason at all,** including to accommodate a whiny couple who want to sit together (for instance), and that seat you were forced to pay for near the front on the aisle is now the middle seat in the last fucking row of the plane, right next to the toilet.\n\nThe totally deregulated industry has ridden roughshod over their clients for a couple of decades now. \n\nThere's also a stink of collusion in the industry - it seems so wildly unlikely that every domestic airline in America suddenly decided in the same week to act like complete arrogant assholes to their customers about every single aspect of a flight. But somehow, magically, that's what happened.\n\nI spent two long years taking at least 8 flights a week for work, I had 'status' on both United and Delta, and still got treated like I was on an old broken down cattle car - seat belts that didn't latch, filthy seats that wouldn't recline or wouldn't lock in the upright position (that was my favorite - the flight attendant looks at me and says \"It's a full flight. If you can't make your seat stay upright, you'll have to get off the plane, sir!\") and somehow the incompetent maintenance on the craft became MY fault. \n\nAnd on and on and on. The American airline industry as a whole (both manufacturers and airlines) is garbage. The governmental indifference they paid lobbyists to make happen works really well for them.\n\nAnd since this is a stocks subreddit, let me add that I suggest Boeing stock needs to be carefully evaluated.",

They just want something to be angry at because people are weak like that. \n\nCase and point: Have you or have not gotten into a less safe car in the last year?
