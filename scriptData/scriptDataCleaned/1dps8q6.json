  "selftext": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) is holding an investor event on Thursday on the heels of the electric vehicle maker's huge announcement of a partnership with Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF).\n\nThe company published some investor slides ahead of the event that indicated it was reaffirming guidance of 57,000 units of production for 2024. For Q2, production of 9.1K to 9.3K units is anticipated, and a deliveries tally of 13.0K to 13.3K units is expected.\n\nLooking ahead, Rivian Automotive said the Gen 2 model introduction, combined with commercial cost downs and commodity tailwinds, is expected to reduce material cost by \\~20%. Rivian also said it is on a path to positive gross profit in Q4 and positive adjusted EBITDA in 2027. A long-term financial target is for \\~25% GAAP gross margin and a \\~10% free cash flow margin.\n\nIn terms of the Volkswagen financial commitment, the company expects to see a $1.0 billion payment at the inception of the joint venture this year and $1.0 billion from a convertible note. Equity investments of $1.0 billion are expected in both 2025 and 2026, as well as a $1.0 billion debit contribution in 2026.\n\nShares of Rivian Automotive  were down 5.56% in on Thursday to $13.90 after rallying more than 23% on Wednesday.",

Different market eras: Tesla pioneered the mass-market EV industry when competition was less intense and EV adoption was in its early stages. Rivian is entering a more mature and competitive market, requiring higher upfront investments.\n2. Scale of operations: Rivian launched with plans for multiple vehicle models (R1T, R1S, EDV) and is building large-scale production facilities from the start. This approach requires more upfront capital than Tesla's gradual scaling.\n3. Cost increases: The automotive industry has seen significant cost increases in recent years, particularly in raw materials and components. Rivian's higher losses partly reflect these increased costs compared to Tesla's early years.\n4. Technological advancements: The level of technology in EVs has advanced significantly since Tesla's early days, requiring more sophisticated (and expensive) R&D and production processes. And I believe this is a point where RIVN could win longterm.\n5. Different business models: Rivian is also targeting the commercial vehicle market with its EDV, which has different capital requirements and potential returns compared to Tesla's initial focus on consumer vehicles.",
