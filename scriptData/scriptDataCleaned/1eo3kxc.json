Trying to figure out call/put options or something, but its getting to a point where I’m hoping it bounces up.\n\nI’ve been seeing around though that they are expecting even less theme park traffic in 2025. Just feels like the company is headed for a 5 year lull until something else incredible happens.",

Your kids? They don't even know a Disney, none of them do. I bet Disney has more single men 35+ streaming the latest white brodude series (star wars? Marvel?) then kids watching anything.

Kids love *Netflix* and YouTube. They watch it 24/7 but don't care at all for old Disney movies and classics, not one bit. Disneys new movies have been so-so and their last true brwksout sucess was Frozen 1 over a decade ago. Disney has tons of IPs that should print money but instead they alienate their fanbase...it's a trinwreck. Star Wars is outright bad, Marvel has lost all appeal and new Disney is Whish-level movies and animations.\n\n\n\nWith new and *actually competent leadership* Disney could once again be a money printer, but that's a major uphill battle. They've *lost generations of kids* who don't care about Disney anymore. Parks are getting less attractive as people everything is more expensive and *today's parents don't enjoy standing in a queue for 90min to ride an attraction once*.

They used tons of shareholders’ money to commission proxy solicitation firms.  \n\nThey all gave a wonderful song and dance of how they alone could fix the incredible damage they themselves had caused.\n\nPeltz’ involvement drove the share price up from $80 to $124.  Maybe there was an intraday of $126 that you bought (?) or maybe you’ve held it for a long time?   Analysts who reviewed Peltz’ strategy had put $140-165 PTs on the street should it be implemented.\n\nWhen it looked like there was a chance for Peltz to win and the stock rose over $120, that would have been your time to sell.  \n\nAt the last minute, moneyed interests won over some large and famous investors to publicly tip the balance against Peltz.  In a fairly classless way, they did a touchdown dance and mocked him on a personal level.\n\nThe stock has gone straight down ever since.  \n\nThey had no actual plan to rescue a stock they have made into one of the worst investments of the last decade.  Sure, it’s probably oversold down here at covid lows.  But the point is that financial media and rich executives participating in obvious groupthink should be avoided not exalted.\n\nSomeone will try to falsely claim I’m somehow Peltz, or in love with him or something.  That’s a lie.  I think he’s an unlikeable a-hole.  The point is he actually had plans to help the shareholders.

Kids today will watch movies from the 90s the same way kids in the 90s watched movies from the 70s... which is not much, especially when they're spoiled for choice with more modern movies than ever, BTW, most of those movies they'll pick are from Disney. Disney \"going woke\" is also out of touch, because non-whites are the global majority and Disney is now making obscene money from the global film market, even at a time when global film markets are increasing in ability to compete with Hollywood.\n\nI simply don't buy that Millenials are going to the park to see a cast actor dressed as Cinderella. They go either for their kids or because it's a place they loved as a child. And its far from in disrepair, theme parks are shifting their models after the creation of galaxies end and hogwarts. The parks forward guidance is sustainable, and that's all it needs to be. They aren't raising prices on a whim, they're raising them because they've realized it's financially prudent to do so. Also higher base prices make deals more enticing to the plebs.\n\nThat being said, I think people were way too rosy about the profitability potential of Disney Plus against such other strong competitors in the streaming space, and the stock price probably never should have risen to 200. They face major headwinds if we do enter a recession, particularly with their parks. If the end of the year remains somewhat red, I could easily see Disney fall below 70 and if it does I will absolutely buy. Disney is not done, kids still love it. The anti-woke crowd is not their target audience and their opinions simply don't matter much when judging Disney's profitability.",
