This non sense about overall weakness is absolutely crazy. Sure their may not be rate drops but that does not play into going on a cruise. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWho has ever said \"well rates are high right now we better not go on vacation.\" NO ONE EVER HAS EVER SAID THAT.\n\nCarnival is absolutly in a massive recovery paying debt off faster then anyone anticipated and packed to the gills with customers spending on board and higher for their tickets. This is 100% oversold and shorted.   Take it for what it is I'be been long for months and not selling anytime soon. See you in on the moon.",

This is the third millennium, where ships are best known for stomach ailments, literal rivers of shit, and drunk tourists being stranded at sea and raped by crew members and/or locals.\n\nI'm just not feeling the vibe I guess I'm saying and how can we trust in the future being less disease ridden and rapey? As the world declines people are gonna want to travel less, especially if some wars break out.\n\nHow secure are cruise ships come to think of it? Planes are nice and tested against terror, but how many people are on one of these and how these shares going to do when inevitably another attack has everyone afraid to travel?\n\nPlus with everyone gambling on their phones why go out to sea to dodge the law? Sounds expensive and tedious. Bonus points if you already have booze at home.",
