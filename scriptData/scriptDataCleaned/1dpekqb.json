Another dividend raise? I don't fucking know - all I see is Jensen feasting on this joke of a spinach dip over the past week. Even the Wall Street regards are dropping price targets north of $170, couple at $200 already.\n\nJensen has said on multiple occasions now - GTC first, and the iNveStoR's meeting (regards) today - \"Blackwell will be the most successful product launch in NVDA's history\". The CoWos advanced packaging tech from TSMC increased production capacity sizably, which is starting to lead to higher than expected revenue projections for Blackwell this year. \n\nThen there's the GB200 set for launch in the fall.\n\n  \nAnyway, not to digress too much - my post history is entirely NVDA due diligence at this point, so see that if you need catching up on other recent NVDA announcements. \n\nOtherwise the read is simple enough even for regards like me after watching GTC. Especially so after he started getting asked for titty signatures. \n  \nPositions: leaps",
