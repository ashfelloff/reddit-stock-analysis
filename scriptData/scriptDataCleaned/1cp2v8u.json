  "selftext": "I did this as a hedge against my bet. I sold ~60% of my calls last night because I wanted to lock in profits. I still believed in the play so I let some of my calls, and all of my stocks ride overnight. I really thought OKLO was going up today but wanted some risk assurance. This saved my life.\n\nTL;DR I inversed myself and got a 4-bagger on puts while my calls and stocks plummeted. Still profited overall\n\n",
