  "selftext": "https://www.cnbc.com/2024/07/14/google-wiz-cybersecurity-deal-largest-ever.html\n\nGoogle is in advanced talks to acquire cybersecurity firm Wiz for $23 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. The people familiar told the Journal that a deal could come soon. Wiz was founded in 2020, and has grown at a rapid clip under CEO Assaf Rappaport. It had been eyeing an IPO as recently as May, when the company achieved a valuation of $12 billion.\n\nWiz‚Äôs cloud security offering gives executives and cybersecurity professionals insight into the company‚Äôs full cloud presence, something appealing to large firms with significant computing resources. It is backed by a roster of blue chip firms, including Israeli VC firm Cyberstarts, Index Ventures, Insight Partners and Sequoia Capital.\n\nIf completed, the deal would be Google‚Äôs largest ever acquisition. It would also underline a clear and continued bet on cybersecurity, at a time when nation state and criminal actors have managed to disrupt governments and large organizations. Google has made large cyber acquisitions before: The company acquired cybersecurity firm Mandiant for $5.4 billion two years ago. But the company now faces unprecedented levels of antitrust scrutiny. The Justice Department has sued Google twice on antitrust grounds. The company‚Äôs acquisition practices were highlighted in the most recent litigation, filed in 2023. But its reported talks with Wiz would suggest that the company has developed a fresh appetite for M&A, competitive concerns notwithstanding.",

The possible gain is finding new regular customers, which did happen but a more common pattern was to always go to restaurants with Groupon deals and never pay full price because there were dozens of listings every day.\n\nSmall businesses are well aware of what their net profits are, they didn't stop using Groupon because they didn't like making more money, they stopped because it was a bad marketing investment.\n\nGroupon still exists, but services and products on it are much higher margin than they used to be so the business can better absorb the discount and fees.",

Wiz is low risk, easy to implement, easy to use cloud security posture management, that serves both as great operational tool, but also very powerful for executive reporting. They are literally ten steps ahead every security company, even cloud native companies. Google buying them is a huge selling point for GCP, while in the recent years the main attack pattern is looking at high privileged identities and misconfigured cloud resources, and these are two things that Wiz solves well. \n\nWe have been struggling adopting Microsoft native tooling, as until very recently Microsoft had every tool as a separate module, you need real effort to configure each module, pay separately for each module, and data would reside in like 3 separate consoles. Finding something trivial like ‚ÄúHow many virtual machines do I have exposed to the internet?‚Äù required you enabling ‚ÄúMicrosoft Defender for Cloud‚Äù, ‚ÄúCloud Security Posture Management‚Äù, ‚ÄúExtended Attack Surface Map‚Äù, ‚ÄúMicrosoft Sentinel‚Äù and then almost manually correlating the data. Also, you would need a skilled cloud engineer to operate and service that setup. On paper Microsoft makes it sound easy, and when you start doing it on request of your CISO, it is not as trivial as Microsoft makes it sound. \n\nWith Wiz.io - you enter your MS Azure tenant id and within the same interface it will find for you Virtual Machines Exposed to the internet, automatically correlate them to vulnerabilities (CVEs), show you if you have misconfigured your estate, report on Azure Security Policies status, displays blast radius, and also show if it has risky identities connected. You need 0 effort to see and fix all this, and any person familiar with IT can do it, you do not need a cloud engineer who knows specific query language.",

Cloud native solutions really are garbage and everyone is getting a solution like Orca, Wiz etc if the org is mature enough, let alone if they use multiple cloud providers.\n\nThey didn't reinvent the wheel, they delivered a product that just works, is easy to implement, and isn't priced through the stratosphere.",
