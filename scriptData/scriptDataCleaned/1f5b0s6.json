The division may be neutral with respect to accounting (formal valuation of assets), but it may not represent future earnings potential accurately.\n\nHowever, as long as one skyrockets by the same market cap as the other one craters, the options won't gain or lose value (not very likely, IMO, see e.g. the somewhat recent WarnerMedia spin-off from AT&T - IIRC Warner cratered and AT&T went down, too).
