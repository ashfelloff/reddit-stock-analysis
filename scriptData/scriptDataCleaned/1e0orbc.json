                      "body": "I already thought it would be possible that travel season would slow down a bit once the \"revenge travel\" fever dies down. On the flip side, there are also folks like myself haven't really travelled but instead been working our asses off for money that we've been throwing into the market. So eventually these folks will travel (most likely my cheap ass will revenge travel once the summer travel season dies down, helping hands at work are cheaper to hire, my own workload lightens, and travel/exp costs stabilize). That doesn't mean everyone else I know isn't travelling and spending on experiences. The tl;dr is that there might be some hiccups, but travel spend trend is still in play so long as recession isn't here.\n\nDon't know much about UAL or even LUV but as an investor who opportunistically trades? I'd wait for earnings and either sell cash covered puts if they tank (assuming I want the stock or believe in the company). Did that with TSLA/UPS/NKE and some others this year. Not worth it to buy options since most expire worthless. Even less reason to on things I stocks I don't really want. I like buying dips so I've been buying: TNA/UWM/TMF/INTC/EWZ/ENR/SNAP/LYFT the 9 months or so",
