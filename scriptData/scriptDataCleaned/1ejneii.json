              "body": "Nice one. Yeah, I can read. Based on what I’ve seen reported, the delay sounds real to me. That’s all I’m saying.\n\n“Nvidia spokesperson John Rizzo, in a statement shared with The Verge, confirmed that production of the Blackwell chip is expected to ramp up in the second half of the year. However, beyond this, Nvidia has refrained from commenting on the rumors. The company’s cautious optimism suggests that while the delay is a setback, they are confident in overcoming the current challenges.\n\nNvidia’s delay comes at a critical time when other tech firms are ramping up efforts to develop their own AI chips. Companies like AMD are making significant strides in this space, aiming to capture market share from Nvidia. The delay of the Blackwell B200 chips could provide these competitors with an opportunity to strengthen their position in the AI chip market.”",
