      "body": "Because the companies are being valued very highly. Eli Lilly is sitting at a P/E of 110(although this is a bit misleading, as they had a big drop in Q3, likely due to some fine or tax implication, a 1 time thing) and NVO is sitting at 46. I'd say NVO is the better investment currently, as they've been more consistent with growth and such, but I would do a lot of research into these companies and their products first. Biotech isn't something you invest in on fundamentals or a whim; it requires in depth knowledge of the risks that come with the industry",

However, if there is any negativity I'd say it's that I kind of feel the ship has sailed on the weight loss drugs. Everybody knows about them and have bought accordingly. Lilly is up 600% over 5 year, and Nova is about 500% for the same time period. In the last 12 months LLY has almost doubled in value and Nova has gained a respectable 60%.\n\nIn addition not being able to keep up with demand has kind of bitten them in the ass because smaller start ups are now selling much cheaper compounded versions under an FDA loophole.\n\nIf you're looking to play weight-loss drugs, but with a company that has more upside I'd recommend researching 'HIMS.' It's a small cap so quite a bit riskier, however it has the potential to be a multi-bagger, the other two, considering their size, not so much.",
