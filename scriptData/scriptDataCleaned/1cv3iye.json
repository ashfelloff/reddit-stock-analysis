  "selftext": "I've always risked it with OTM because, let's be honest, the reward can be sexy. Had a big loss on Microsoft recently - my own fault, could have sold for OTM calls for c.80% gain, but broke my rules and said fuk theta...then theta fuk'd me with a c.80% loss. This has been my only major loss, still up c.150% since July 2023, so don't worry about me :)\n\nHave been researching ITM calls today and omg they seem incredible!!! Yes they are more expensive than ATM and OTM, but that's because of intrinsic value. The more the options are ITM, the higher the intrinsic value and  relatively the lower 'time premium', so therefore theta immaterially impacts the option value.\n\nGoing to buy ITM call options for Adobe next week in prep for earnings - c.25% down from the high, company still performing well (has a great moat). Understand it's down because of guidance saying performance will be weighted to h2, so q2 earnigns might have good q3 guidance (maybe?). Yea AI being a bit uneventful, but I'll take the risk. \n\nWhat has impressed me the most about ITM, is that as long as it stays at / above current share price, then I can sell for only a minor loss vs 100% loss - incredible!!!\n\nOptions calculator below, love that website!!\n\n[Long Call Calculator | Options Profit Calculator](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)\n\np.s. let me know if my understanding is incorrect :)\n\n",

The biggest being risk/reward....\n\nLet's say that SPY is at 530.  You could buy the stock for 530, or a 5/24 515C for about 15.75 (.75 extrinsic).  If SPY goes up 15, you make 15 on both, but with less capital used with the option.  If SPY drops 15, you lose 15 with the stock, but only 11-13 with the option (assuming that you can sell it a bit before expiration).  If SPY drops to 500, you lose 30 with the stock, but only 15.75 with the option.",

Rounding for simplicity. You own 3 shares of SPY and it drops $15, you are down $45. Apparently you only lose $11 on the ITM calls, which translates into $1100.

The guy that founded it, HariSeldon (his Reddit name) is a legit trader, and the wiki shows you everything you need to get into day trading profitably. Start with paper trading and do this until you have a 75% winrate and are profitable, then when you use real money start swing trading, then when day trading only do one share at a time. You'll have three weekly day trades allowed on your account until you get RDT status (25k). Also, use Stops!\n\nWatched Hari Short 10,000 shares of NVDA and make $100,000. And I've seen his Options plays. BUT he knows what he's doing and would tell you, like u/kazkeb , not to mess with Options when learning all this. Good luck! Oh, RealDayTrading also has live trading YouTube videos every Wednesday at 12 EST with Pete Stolcers an OG trader that started in the Bond Pits back in the day. Pete streams on his channel OneOption.

You might want to think about moving to a different expiration and strike.\n\nTo start, the easiest way to gauge the relative price of an option (in relation to the other options of a stock) is the IV of the option.  I don't know what broker you're using, but you might have to change some settings to enable this field.\n\nThe IV of your option is 91%, and is pretty high. Also, the spread/liquidity is pretty bad too.  Right now the spread is 4.90 (bid of 23.10, ask of 28.00).  On the other hand, it's the weekend and it might be better during regular hours.  You're planning on holding it for a while, so it doesn't need to be super liquid. \n\nHowever, there are some decent options on 10/18/24.  Again, there will probably be better choices when the market is open, but right now the $24C has a bid/ask of 13.10/13.90 and extrinsic of 0.80.  You can basically get near the same delta for half of the capital cost.  Although, it's 152 days out, and you'd probably want to roll it out further in a couple of months.\n\nIt looks like there are some decent deals in Jan 25 too.  $20 looks to be a low spread and low extrinsic.\n\nDo you know how to roll an option?  Since you're probably not in a hurry to change things, you could probably put in a GTC order to roll and see if it hits sometime in the next few days.",

Yes you are right that OTM can go to 0 much faster than ITM but the more ITM the more expensive it is and it can also tank and cause you to lose much more than you would if you just bought the stock or placed a smaller bet not around earnings that can destroy a portfolio. Instead try selling a covered putt below price. If you like the stock then you get it at a lower price if it tanks. Then just hold and sell later or sell covered calls at your price. Or the stock moves higher and you keep the premium.",
