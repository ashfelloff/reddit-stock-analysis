  "selftext": "MSTR is probably the biggest overvalued stock in the US at the moment and I would expect the stock to drop by 50% in the coming month. Here is why:\n\n\n- MSTR is trading at almost 250% premium of its bitcoin holding value meaning that when you buy MSTR, it’s equivalent to buy Bitcoin at 3.5x its value or $245k per XBT.\n- MSTR has a 17.8% Bitcoin yield as its issuing new shares at 250% premium to buy Bitcoin at discount, while Bitcoin yield is much lower. This strategy would be attractive only if it was sustainable in the long run but as soon as MSTR drops, this yield will decrease or even go negative if MSTR trades at discount.\n- MSTR announced this week that it will raise $42b to buy Bitcoin in the next 3 months, $21b via equity issuance and $21b via debt. The retail won’t be able to absorb such amount which will push MSTR significantly lower, as we have seen in similar case like AMC and other. Retail will be ruined once again. The additional debt will also levered MSTR massively which will become an issue when the stock/bitcoin drops as it might force MSTR to do emergency equity raise at discount, putting even more pressure on MSTR. https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results-and-announces-42-billion-capital-plan_10-30-2024\n- Chairman Michael Saylor knows that MSTR is overvalued, that’s why he is increasing the pace of its capital increase with 5 equity raises in the last 3 years with much more to come, I don’t think any other company has done that many.\n- MSTR had accounting issues back in 2000 sending the short 90%+ lower\n- All the brokers with a BUY rating on the stock have magically been picked by MSTR to do the $21b equity issuance. https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/G8cJq1F32w\n\n==> By misleading the retail community with its Bitcoin yield, retail prefers to buy MSTR rather than Bitcoin, pushing MSTR at a huge premium and allowing  MSTR to sell even more shares to the retail community, allowing to buy more Bitcoin, increasing its Bitcoin yield. This is exactly the definition of a Ponzi Scheme: \n\n“A Ponzi scheme is an investment fraud that pays existing investors with funds collected from new investors. Ponzi scheme organizers often promise to invest your money and generate high returns with little or no risk.”",

      "body": "From what I understand, MSTR has become a kind of bitcoin security product, meaning, there are many financial entities and parties that cannot actually buy bitcoin directly or even through the etfs and if they want bitcoin exposure, the only way to do it, is through MSTR, hence why the market is okay with paying a hefty premium. The premium is nothing more than the market trying to figure out how much value there is in being the only company having the ability to \"securitize\" bitcoin (or wrap it) in a way where every portfolio holder/manager or financial entity can gain exposure to bitcoins upside (and downside). Because of how low of interest rates they pay to finance the acquisition of bitcoin, even if it goes to 15k again, time and upside is on their side, hence why I think they will be okay. I think the bigger risk is the fact that this is a company (counterparty risk) and not a commodity like btc (no counterparty risk). Meaning, Saylor tomorrow could be involved in a scandal (steal funds, sell bitcoin etc) or whatever, and that would affect the stock price regardless of how much bitcoin is worth or how much they have in the coffers, while bitcoin simply don't care. It will keep decreasing its supply every four years, and its volatility will keep lowering and lowering. MSTR is by far the best stock to swing trade (especially if you also own bitcoin and can sell bitcoin to buy MSTR and sell MSTR to buy bitcoin.. I have been doing this for two years now and it's how I earn a living essentially lol)",

      "body": "Here is (sadly) only a German Video about Microstrategy and why it is special, this is a conclusion on the different markets and points what Microstrategy can do what other cannot do: no other Video could explain better what Microstrategy makes special\n\nhttps://youtu.be/tA6Ru77xU6Q\n\nHere’s a structured English summary of the key points about MicroStrategy’s unique strategy with Bitcoin, including why others can’t replicate it and how different markets benefit from it.\n\nMicroStrategy’s Unique Strategy with Bitcoin\n\n1.\tBitcoin-Focused Balance Sheet\nMicroStrategy has transferred nearly all its available assets into Bitcoin, currently holding over 250,000 BTC. This amount makes MicroStrategy a leveraged proxy for Bitcoin in the stock market, providing investors with a way to gain exposure to Bitcoin indirectly. The high leverage also amplifies both gains and losses in Bitcoin’s price, making MicroStrategy’s stock more volatile than Bitcoin itself.\n2.\tBridge to Traditional Financial Markets\nMicroStrategy acts as a bridge between traditional financial markets (stocks, bonds, convertible bonds) and Bitcoin. This approach allows institutions that are unable or unwilling to directly invest in Bitcoin to gain exposure to it through MicroStrategy’s stock.\n3.\tConvertible Bonds Strategy\nBy issuing convertible bonds, MicroStrategy raises capital to buy more Bitcoin. Convertible bonds offer a low interest rate but include an option to convert to stock, making them attractive due to MicroStrategy’s volatility, which correlates with Bitcoin’s performance.\n4.\tBitcoin “Refinery” Concept\nLike an oil refinery that turns crude oil into usable products, MicroStrategy turns Bitcoin into a financial asset that institutions can more readily interact with. This “refinery” process involves structuring Bitcoin in ways (via bonds, stocks, options) that appeal to different segments of traditional finance.\n5.\tRaising Capital Without Selling Bitcoin\nMicroStrategy can issue new shares or bonds when its stock is overvalued relative to its Bitcoin holdings, raising cash without needing to sell any Bitcoin. This overvaluation gives MicroStrategy a sustainable way to accumulate more Bitcoin per share, unlike ETFs or other companies that can’t leverage this model.\n6.\tSelf-Reinforcing Cycle\nMicroStrategy’s model allows it to use the gains from rising Bitcoin prices to buy even more Bitcoin, thus increasing the stock’s value and furthering its ability to raise capital. This cycle can amplify returns if Bitcoin’s price continues to rise.\n\nWhy Others Can’t Replicate This Strategy\n\n1.\tPermanent Bitcoin Holding Structure\nUnlike an ETF that must sell assets if investors redeem their shares, MicroStrategy has permanent control over its Bitcoin holdings. ETFs and other funds lack this stability and flexibility since they need to maintain liquidity for potential investor withdrawals.\n2.\tCorporate Size and Balance Sheet Structure\nLarge corporations like Apple or Google could technically buy large amounts of Bitcoin, but their market cap and existing assets dilute the impact. For them, Bitcoin would only represent a minor percentage of their balance sheet, and the stock’s performance wouldn’t correlate strongly with Bitcoin’s price. Smaller companies can’t easily reach MicroStrategy’s scale in Bitcoin holdings, giving MicroStrategy a unique advantage in this niche.\n3.\tHigh Volatility and Speculative Demand\nThe volatility in MicroStrategy’s stock due to Bitcoin leverage appeals to certain financial markets (like options markets), which benefit from high volatility. This trait is less attractive for conservative companies or asset classes with more stable, lower-risk profiles (like gold or real estate), making Bitcoin uniquely suited for this strategy.\n\nMarket Beneficiaries\n\n1.\tStock Market Investors\n\n•\tBenefit: High-growth potential due to Bitcoin exposure.\n\n•\tHow: Investors seeking Bitcoin exposure but unable to buy it directly can purchase MicroStrategy shares, getting leveraged exposure to Bitcoin.\n\n2.\tOptions Market\n\n•\tBenefit: High value for options due to stock volatility.\n\n•\tHow: Options traders value volatility as it increases the potential for returns on call or put options. MicroStrategy’s volatility makes it a profitable asset for options trading.\n\n3.\tConvertible Bond Investors\n\n•\tBenefit: Convertible bonds offer exposure to MicroStrategy’s stock growth tied to Bitcoin without directly holding it.\n\n•\tHow: With MicroStrategy’s stock acting as a leveraged Bitcoin proxy, convertible bonds offer the possibility to participate in this upside with lower risk and an attractive option to convert bonds into stock.\n\n4.\tPassive Index Investors (Potential Future Inclusion)\n\n•\tBenefit: Potential passive inflows from index funds if MicroStrategy is included in major indices like the NASDAQ or S&P 500.\n\n•\tHow: If MicroStrategy is added to these indices, index funds would be required to purchase MicroStrategy shares, leading to an increase in the stock’s demand and price.\n\n5.\tInstitutions Restricted from Direct Bitcoin Investment\n\n•\tBenefit: Access to Bitcoin-like exposure in a regulated, traditional stock format.\n\n•\tHow: Institutions that face regulatory or policy restrictions on holding Bitcoin directly can still invest in MicroStrategy as a stock with Bitcoin exposure.\n\n6.\tSpeculators Seeking Volatility\n\n•\tBenefit: Leverage to both up and down movements in Bitcoin price.\n\n•\tHow: Short-sellers or traders looking for Bitcoin derivatives often use MicroStrategy as a proxy due to its strong correlation with Bitcoin prices.\n\nFuture Catalysts\n\n1.\tIndex Inclusion\nInclusion in major indices could drive more institutional and retail money into MicroStrategy as index funds and ETFs are forced to buy MicroStrategy shares.\n2.\tIncreased Institutional Interest in Bitcoin\nIf more institutions decide to invest in Bitcoin but face limitations, MicroStrategy’s stock provides a way to gain Bitcoin exposure.\n3.\tPotential for Structured Cash Flows\nMicroStrategy could eventually use its Bitcoin holdings to provide liquidity or even loan Bitcoin in a structured way, creating a new revenue stream while keeping its core strategy intact.\n\nIn summary, MicroStrategy’s unique position as a “Bitcoin refinery” in the stock market makes it a valuable asset for various types of investors seeking Bitcoin exposure, while the company leverages its structure and strategy in ways that no other company currently can.",

      "body": "First of all, big fan! I love seeing posts like this.  Bring the shorts. Bring ALL the shorts. Dig up dead shorts and give them new hope and show them MSTR and tell them it is a sure thing to short it.\n\nYou might be right, short-term.  It could dump 25% this week. I hope it does.\n\nI first bought it in AUgust of 2020 at a split-adjusted price of $15. I bought it because Saylor was the first company chairman to be willing to commit his entire treasure to bitcoin over anything else.  This seems like a no brainer if you understand bitcoin. So, I bought.\n\nIt went into mania, I bought on the way up and sold ALL on the way down, before buying back lower.\n\nHere's the thing, that premium you are saying will go away? I don't know that it will. In fact, I think it multiplies.\n\nWhy do I think this? Well, it is actually very simple. They sell at the money for a premium and buy bitcoin at bitcoin's spot price.  Think of it as them selling bitcoin for 3x the price and they using that money to buy bitcoin at 1x the price.  The higher that premium gets, the more bitcoin they can buy as yield to their existing share holders.  So, if you are an existing share holder, you want the largest premium possible, and you do NOT want to sell because you know the premium is an asset and incredibly accretive for shareholders.\n\nAdditionally, they sell convertible debt which is also accretive, has minimal to no interest cost, and even if it did, they could cover any interest with the premium from the at-the-money offerings.\n\nSo,  if we assume they maintain just a 2x premium selling at the money, they will get $42 billion in bitcoin for $14 billion of bitcoin.  I would use that as the absolute minimum for the balance sheet accrual over the next 3 years.\n\nSo, if they have $17 billion in bitcoin, today, they will have $17 + $42or $ 59 billion in bitcoin in 3 years - assuming the price of bitcoin doesn't move. It will move, because guess what? Microstrategy is buying $42billion in bitcoin over that time frame.\n\nJust using those very basic numbers, if there is no multiple on their stock in 3 years, it goes up 20% in three years.  If they are just at a 2x multiple, MSTR is a 2.25x from here in those 3 years.\n\nBut here's the real thing. There is a community that sees this, similar to WSB when Gamestop happened.  That community is VERY, VERY long.  There are a lot of options bought for January. A lot. Honestly, even without it, MSTR is the best stock on the market, but given the likely gamma squeeze, the likely bitcoin move in the near future (if nothing else from MSTR buying but the etfs are putting hundreds of millions in per day, too).\n\nSo, what's my position? Currently 20% of my portfolio.  That's honestly enough, because this thing will grow as large as it wants at the fastest rate it can.  What rate is that?  I'd guess an appreciation of 200% per year is very reasonable.\n\nWatch the earnings call.  You can skip to minute 16. It is on youtube.  \n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TasvNr1gBGs&t=2340s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TasvNr1gBGs&t=2340s)\n\nWatch that. Then realize that the entire financial system is changing. All those companies holding cash on their balance sheets are losing money. Microstrategy is single-handedly bringing about the most important change in the financial system in 50 years.\n\nI honestly cannot put a value on it other than to say that I've felt this type of clarity about an investment only a few times in my life and those were all just pure math like this is.\n\nIt IS just math.  Don't get your face ripped off.  This is the most volatile stock on the market. It is also a flywheel for bitcoin. It is a financial perpetual motion machine that will make a lot of people very wealthy.",
