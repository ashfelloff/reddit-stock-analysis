  "selftext": "Update of [The short report for Intel (INTC) - A rabbit hole of CPU failures rate since 2022. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ebr68q/the_short_report_for_intel_intc_a_rabbit_hole_of/)\n\nYes while the main points of the short report were not mentioned and intel continues to hide this infomation from Investors, they cant ignore the impact it has on their bottom line. RMA's are not cheap and the amount of money and time they are spending to fix the issue for existing chips while trying their hardest to deny RMAs for failed CPUs.\n\nCustomers have lost faith in Intel, their chips are constantly beaten by AMD offerings and having a high failure rate really was the last nail in the coffin. Enterprise customers are switching, gamers are switching, datacetners are switching. All switching to AMD (or Arm - Yes Arm is starting to see some enterprise deployments, very little tho.)\n\nIntel will continue to have bad earnings for the forseable future (as they guided), And they also havnt announced (and likly wont) the delay of their next gen CPUs (15000 series) for desktop, they are expected to announce only Mobile chips and act like Desktop and server CPUs dont exist this generation. Delay is expected to be around 6 months (Q1 2025) the same time AMD is expected to announced Zen 5c and EPYC CPUs.\n\nI am still short, excersiced Options for short stock. up 2000% so far.\n\nI am Short 200 Shares at $30\n\nUpdate: S&P has put intel on Negative CreditWatch as business underperforms. This is the first sign of Intel being dropped from the S&P 500.\n\nAlso as many commenters pointed out, Intel dropping their Divi means they would be dropped from Divi only ETFs",

The Federal Government of the United States cannot let this company fail, kind of like Boeing, so it can only go so low.  Ultimately the entire board of directors needs to resign and higher a new C-Suite; the government may need to step in to force the issue, but we aren't there yet.",
