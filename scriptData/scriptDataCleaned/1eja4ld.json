Will history repeat itself, or this time its different? Maybe it won't because before recent market run (in last 4-6 months), market was down by more than 20% from ATH.\n\nThis is such a confusing state. I'm planning to continue with my monthly dollar average of VOO and QQQM.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/2n9dxo1nqhgd1.png?width=2828&format=png&auto=webp&s=99478471f3b2b2d6412cea092dc1306f67801669\n\n",

When the economy is bad the fed cut rates to inject money into the economy. First comes the bad economy then the rate cuts, not the other way around. \nMaybe you’re too young to know that during these two last rate cuts before covid we had something called The Great Recession and The DotCom Bubble that’s the reason the market fell dramatically not because rates were cut. \nIf you think something like those two events I mentioned is happening then the market will tank and fed will keep lowering. Otherwise the Fed will cut, markets will stabilize and then keep climbing and fed will maintain or raise rates back up if inflation accelerates again.",
