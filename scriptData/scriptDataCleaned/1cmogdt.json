      "body": "From what I've seen, if there's a rally before earnings, especially of that caliber, the earnings are priced in. The earnings would have to be exponentially good to trigger another rally, especially on a stock like PLTR. Always sell early if it's up like that the day before. \n\nOn the other end, often times when there is negative sentiment leading up to earnings and a big sell off, even if the earnings aren't the best, the stock will still rally. I.E CRWD, NVDA, and other cyber security stocks from last quarter. High emotional responses lead to drastic changes.\n\nI like to understand this by thinking about how I reacted to these things when I first started my trading journey. Holding something like NVDA last earnings, seeing all the bear sentiment that came out leading up to it and seeing the sell off trigger the day before, I too would think it was a risk to hold. Then, after hearing the report was solid, would FOMO my way back into it at market open. The institutional traders know most smaller trades think this way (at least the good ones do if they're not FOMOing as well) and inverse our actions. Well, idk how many hedgies are yoloing on earnings every quarter, but nevertheless, this is the way.\n\nSorry this lesson cost you 30k. Good luck saving for another year. ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4260)",
