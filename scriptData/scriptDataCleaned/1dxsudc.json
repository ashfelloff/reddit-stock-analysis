The shareholders receive shares of the buyer at some favorable ratio or they get bought out at a higher than market price. Same sort of thing with spinning off. It’s sort of like an IPO, except as an established business you know what you’re getting for the most part, way less uncertainty than a startup company so the price is a lot less crazy.\n\nHeinz and Kraft are another example of mergers and spin-offs.",
