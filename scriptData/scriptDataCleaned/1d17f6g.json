Now, maybe their method (which shows way WAY rosier outlook than GAAP numbers) really are the proper way to look at the company. But you should be aware of both numbers and keenly aware of why they are different if you’re going to be saying they had a “great quarter”. At first glance I wouldn’t touch the stock with a 100 foot pole. \n\nEdit: sorry for the wrong quote. “Very positive earnings” over the years is what you said, not “great quarter”. ",

You’re reading their earnings release, not the financial statements. Please learn how to read a financial statement - there are some legitimate things they are removing to get to adjusted net income, like impairment. There are some very much NOT legitimate things they’re removing to get to adjusted numbers - like share compensation. While share compensation isn’t a cash expense it dilutes shareholders so it should absolutely be included when calculating net income or EBITDA. \n\nThe fact that you are poo-pooing CFO is made even more hilarious by the fact that the adjusted figures you’re accepting/praising from them are basically half-way between GAAP net income and GAAP CFO but with only the stuff removed to make it look good. \n\nLearn.

You can’t make wire transfers. Anyone who does business basically had to get a secondary bank.\n2. SoFi invest does not let you wheel trade (sell puts, sell covered calls).\n3. SoFi invest pricing is extremely inefficient. My wife and I both put $145 limit orders of GOOGL in January. Mine on SoFi, her on Robinhood. My order was submitted first and was 50 shares, hers 10 shares. Her order filled, mine never did.\n4. Besides the interest, they really offer minimal benefits and their other products (insurance, mortgage, loans, etc) have never once been competitive when we looked at market.\n\nWould not invest in SOFI at all.",
