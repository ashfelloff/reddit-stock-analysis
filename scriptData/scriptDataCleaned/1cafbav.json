You don’t think hedge 2, 3, and 4 won’t all have algos (even us retail can place limit buy) sitting there ready to apply buying pressure as soon as it dips 5-10% ?\n\nNow suppose we inverse WSB (I know I’m always wrong). The market crashes and hedge 1 gets a lot of cheap stock. You think that’ll happen every Saturday until the end of time? Market’ll correct somehow idk",
