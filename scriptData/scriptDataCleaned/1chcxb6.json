  "selftext": "It’s all priced in. Dumps happen before impending news. Not after. Once the news materializes, regardless of what it is, the market will stop caring and pump. \n\nIt’s why basically every single time the market expected a dump due to CPI or PPI or some other FOMC meeting that bears love to play with their dongs over, no crash happened. Just take a look at what happened during all of these events this year. The only time we crashed was because of Kashkari but that was because it was **unexpected**. Markets don’t crash on expected information. Instead, once the “negative” information comes out, a mega pump happens. \n\nNo you’re not the first person to have figured out that we might not get rate cuts. The market already did ages go. In fact, the moment a supermarket raises the price of any item, that information is feeded instantaneously and automatically to algorithmic trading bots of hedge funds. It’s always priced in. \n\nThe dump already happened yesterday. In fact, even a rate hike is already priced in by the futures markets. If news articles are talking about a potential rate hike, you think the markets haven’t taken it into account? Good night and see you tomorrow. I expect to wake up to many things rising \n\nSPY 510 C 5/10",
