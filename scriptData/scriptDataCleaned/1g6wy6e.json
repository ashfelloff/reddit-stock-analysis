They don't need to be the best (or at least not all the time) and with all the fuck-ups the others are coming up with (especially Disney and Amazon, can't speak much for Apple) they at least don't really have a reason to lose subscribers, yet even gain more and more. I'm still surprised that they are on their road to gaining nearly 1/7 of their whole net worth within a few days due to great earnings but in terms of their business that seems kind of reasonable.",

The big the spooked me when I looked at them 18 months ago was that their moat was pretty weak in that every man and their dog was launching a streaming service. They don’t had infrastructure so they were vulnerable to players like google, apple, amazon and meta. They don’t own massive back catalogs historical of content I.e. fox, wb, Disney, paramount etc so I honestly thought it was going to turn into a race to the bottom what’s bizarre is that prices were increasing which doesn’t make sense in a market with stiff competition which if you ask me reeks of collusion and price fixing now that I think about it. I don’t think these are tin foil hat crazy points that I’m making here with my crude preliminary assessment of the market and their position in it and the competitive landscape.\n\nI invite anyone to tell me I’m wrong and educate me.

On the one hand I’ve learnt that a long term buy and hold strategy is your best bet to realize gains, time in the market beats timing the market  and traders often bail to early when their on a winner which is why they often fail to beat the market over the long term. On the other hands, I’ve been burnt before for not taking gains like NVida it’s tripled on me and I know I should take gains but everyone on wsb is saying it’s tapped out but there aren’t any really good bets to move the money to your point if there isn’t a good option I’ll leave it where it is but should we really just be closing the position and sitting on the cash like Buffett would waiting for an opportunity to come up",

Thank you for sharing  some counter points to consider, their moderately good counters and I did think of that to a degree, my thinking was sure they can pump out new content but there is 100 year history in terms of content that say Disney for example was sitting on and the market it self more broadly has a shit ton content so their ability to create and amass new content wasnt as impressive when view through that lens when I was looking buying in 18-24 months ago.\n\nEdit: and yes I am salty that I’m missing out on these fat gains :) especially because my logic felt sound when I looked it and passed so hence I’m curious to understand how my logic was flawed",
