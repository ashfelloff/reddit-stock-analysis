  "selftext": "Hertz/Dollar shit the bed because of their horrid decision to replace most of their fleet with electric cars that nobody wants to rent, however that is not the only thing that killed Hertz. Enterprise/Alamo/National (which is, unfortunately, privately held) has undercut the rental market by having the cheapest rates for business customers. I’ve noticed that a lot of my regular customers (usually on business trips) have been renting from Enterprise lately and Avis has lost a significant portion of our portfolio. \n\nNot to mention Enterprise has significantly increased their fleet (at least on the east coast), and have slowly taken over this location’s marketshare, although I can only speak for where I work. \n\nI believe that earnings for CAR do not look good and the premiums on puts seem to agree with me. I would like to hear some counter arguments as to why $CAR won’t fall on its face this earnings. \n\nI currently don’t hold any positions at the moment because I lost all my money following you regards, but if it looks truly bad for $CAR I might work some extra shifts behind the Wendy’s dumpster. \n",
