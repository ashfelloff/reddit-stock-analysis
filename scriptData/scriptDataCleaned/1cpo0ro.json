The politicians don't care at all, even if they are anti-immigration in the elections, they soon keep letting immigrants in. Someone, perhaps China, is paying them off. Europe is crippled by corrupt politicians who don't care at all about the future, and the people opposing this are scared to lose their jobs, reputation etc. if they stand to oppose the open borders. \nDon't patronize us and tell these obvious platitudes, we know how fucked it all is and how our future is ruined.

If you are a european investor, you pay the same taxes, whether you invest in europe or invest overseas. The difference is, that you pay the source tax first, if you invest overseas, depending on the agreement.\n\n2. Family owned businesses are not at the stock market, so that point should make no difference as to where you invest in shares/fonds/ETFs.\n\n3. I¬¥m not sure, if I m getting your point at all. \n\n4. The majority of ETFs should be expected to be issued in the US, because the majority of large investment institutions is seated there. Buying a European ETF is exactly as easy as buying a US ETF. Marketing may be different, but that is, because (at least german) banks tend to peddle their managed funds not ETFs.\n\n5. This is definitely true for those family owned companies. Publicly traded companies don¬¥t act any differently. So except if you have access to invest in private equity, it should not affect your investment decisions.\n\n  \nAgain, I may be missing something, but I while some observations are very much correct, I don¬¥t see any reasonable effect on investment decisions, let alone for leaving Europe in order to be listed in the US.",
