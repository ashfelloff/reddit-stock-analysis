Shareholders are aware of the industry challenges, but the price dropped drastically after an earnings in which leadership seemed to have no idea what to do. If you look up videos about it during that time they‚Äôll be talking about them like they‚Äôre headless chickens. So if the dip was caused by lack of confidence in the leadership it does make sense it‚Äôd get a jump when a CEO seen as capable hops in. This jump is all speculation that he‚Äôll do good at SBUX as he did in CMG. We‚Äôll have to wait and see if the results are there.",
