That's excluding the debate on their growth prospects in the market they are in which I still think is too niche, competitive and expensive compared to traditional telecoms and MNOs will probably run the costs down to the customers like they already do with Starlink.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether they'll make their 16 billion in 2030.

I don't understand. \n\nAlso, *\"competitive and expensive compared to traditional telecoms and MNOs\"* - do you understand what it is that ASTS are offering? Telecoms and MNOs are partners, not competition. This is a supplemental service and they are co-dependant on one anothers' success. Not sure why Starlink is brought up in this context. Their internet offering is an entirely different and non-competing service. As far as Starlink D2C goes - which actually does intend to be competing - they currently have no proven D2C offering which they can take to market.\n\nTo address your statement in another comment saying this is propped up by retail - yes retail own a large portion of shares because this is still a pre-revenue company that institutional investors wouldn't traditionally jump in to yet - that's part of what makes this a millionaire-maker for us getting in early\n\n/u/Ethereumman08 says it best here: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ASTSpaceMobile/comments/1e8doih/daily_discussion_thread/le74c1n/",

You might not realise that the site is hosted and run on AWS (Amazon Web Services), and you don't need to know. You just want to benefit from the ubiquitous and seamless service it provides. It's the same with ASTS, most people will still have never heard of it when it's up and running, even though they might be using it all the time.\n\nThat's a big part of the reason they're so lucrative and have such high projected EBITDA. They have no customer acquisition costs - Their only costs once the satellites are up will be maintaining them and R&D in to their next-generation of satellites.\n\nIt's difficult to say what revenue per customer will be, that's down to each MNO partner. There's long been speculation that ASTS will have a 50/50 revenue split with their MNO partners, but there's nothing solid to currently back that up. It all depends on how the MNOs market the offering, it could be a monthly sub, it could be a part of their more premium packages, it could be a fixed amount per GB of data. \n\nYou also have to look beyond retail and think of the existing commercial use cases that would benefit greatly from this service such as agricultural, maritime, remote research etc. But also think about the new commercial markets that would spring in to existence simply because it was not financially feasible before this network coverage availability.\n\nThen think beyond commercial use and more toward government, quasi-government, military etc.\n\nThere's a lot of room for this to print money and with very little overheads.",
