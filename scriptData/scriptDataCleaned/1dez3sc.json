                  "body": "Your options will lose money for typically one of three reasons:\n\n- Delta: The stock price goes down. For each dollar it goes down, the contract loses the Delta value. If the contract is $1.00 and Delta is 0.5, it becomes $1.5 when the stock goes up $1, or $0.50 if the stock drops $1. This is reversed in the case of puts.\n- Theta: The expiration draws near. This is probably what you're thinking of. For every day you hold the contract, you lose the Theta value. If the contract is $1.00 and Theta is -1.0, it will be $0 tomorrow. Theta gets worse the closer you get to expiration. The only way to counteract Theta is to hope the stock goes up (or down) so the contract gains Delta value.\n- IV: The contract becomes less volatile (somewhat). IV basically tells you the range of prices this contract can reasonably take, based on how volatile the stock is. IV is like momentum, it tells you how sensitive the contract is to stock movements. When you buy out-of-the-money, with a long time from expiration, you generally want this to be high so that even small movements can push your contract value up a lot. However, as you approach expiration, high IV will make your theta worse, which will bleed your contracts faster than the stock can rise (since the more volatile the stock, the higher the chances that your ITM option can become OTM in a single day)\n\nIV is what you need to be careful with especially, as you could have a decent OTM play, but it's so close to expiration that even if it moves in your direction, you lose more money from Theta than you gain in Delta.\n\nIf you take care of these and understand how the stock likes to move, you should never be caught off guard outside of black swans.",
