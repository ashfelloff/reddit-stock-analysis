Lots of office is going vacant as lease terms expire, and keys are being handed back to banks. A large amount of office focused REITs are super cash constrained with no real way out. On top of this, the 10 year almost hit 3.7 today, making it a much better time to try to sell off commercial assets to mitigate losses(Many of these losses will not be realized until that time, as many companies record inflated book values on financials).

In '20 countries QE'ed like it was foolproof, but know we know that is a temporary party and not sure they be so keen to repeat at those levels. Then before for '01 the dotcom bust created a recession, but fundamentally tech and internet was exploding ongoing for the comeback, but AI doesn't have this pull, or other tech.\n\nAlso in all those times we didn't have the global friction we do now and markets were opening, not closing. Nations weren't neck deep in debt and all levels: govt, business and consumer. Not to mention wealth inequality so people likely wont spend on consumer goods in the same way they have during the last few decades as todays money increasingly goes to capital and not goods.\n\nSo what's the engine now? People are getting over immigration so that will restrict domestic growth. China is looking to head backwards. India isnt replacing it as the global growth story. Maybe global friction will help and Western countries can onshore manufacturing and get growth happening that way? The great boomer last hurrah spending what they have? Some movement to redistribute wealth and get spending back? Something else I'm missing?\n\nAnd to be clear I'm not saying it will be going longer, but I do feel good chances that the deeper we go into recession it likely harder to comeback than anything for the last few decades.",
