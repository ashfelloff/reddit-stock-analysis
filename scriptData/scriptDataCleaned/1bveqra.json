It will just backfire like all the AI stuff, where not just training data (thus real world distribution and behaviour) but also some \"clever\" CEO/DEI interests to optimize it for advertisment or political values.\n\nEven without AI, the algorithm got worse and worse in the last years. Optimizing advertisement, search engine optimisation of big players, show you results with strong data mining from you (and give it back to google) and last but not least a ton of arbitrary political rules to put certain results on page 2 or not show them at all.\n\nJust try out a few normal,  political, controversal, culture-debate topics:\n\n1. just the search string\n2. **before:2020** + search string\n\nSee for yourself, the command **before:date** overwrites some of the newer algorithm rules and you will find two completly different search results.\n\nSame applies for Alphabet´s youtube:\n\nfor a few years now you CANT even SEE anymore relevant results to your search, e.g.:\n\n* if you search for \\[small artist - their not widely known song but you know there are hundreds of remixes and covers about it\\] -> youtube will just show you THREE somewhat accurat results followed by thousands over thousands of lose associations based videos from big channels, where advertisers pay google extra to be seen there -  like \"Taylor Swift - new song\" \"4mio subscription Reaction influencer listens to Rammstein first time\"",
