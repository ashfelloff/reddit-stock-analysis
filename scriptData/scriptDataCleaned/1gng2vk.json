  "selftext": "\nI Was wondering if there were any groups or online meetings specifically of people trying to avoid day trading or options. Figured this would be a good place to find some recommendations. Is there just like a way to ban yourself from these financial tools. I think it's better just to walk away. Having trouble doing so. \n\nI see gamblers anonymous as an option and I do believe a good one have reached out and was having trouble kind of relating. I know that's my own fault, but I thought it would be helpful because I think there's a huge group of us that are just getting absolutely destroyed on these options. Contracts and I was wondering if there is a group online that specifically is talking about this and trying to help people stop so if you know of any or have any good links or groups, let me know. Thank you so much! Hope you have a wonderful weekend.\n\n",

You can likely find a lot in common with other types of gamblers, even if you are a trading addict.\n\nThat being said, it would be awesome if there was a niche in the recovery community for options traders specfically, because it is true that every sub-set of gamblers does have their own unique challenges.\n\nFor example, someone addicted to sportsbetting can self-exclude. But what are traders supposed to do? It's not like we can self-exclude from our trading brokerages like you can with Draftkings.\n\nAnd like, while someone does not need Draftkings at all in their life, you likely do need a financial platform in order to just live your live.\n\nThere are a fair amount of problem gambling and recovering gambling subreddits on here where trading addicts do frequent.\n\nCheck it out and you likely can make some connections to DM and chat with.\n\nDefinitely check out Gamblers Anonymous either online or in person too.\n\nEssentially - from a 10,000 foot view, ALL addiction - drugs/alcohol and behavioral addictions such as gambling, follow the same psychological model - so just enter recovery man and apply the basic, high-level concepts to your own unique circumstances.",
