Additionally, many companies force people to sell some RSUs as they vest to pay for taxes owed on the income from the RSU defined at the time of vest. As such, unless you've been a serious, serious bagholder there's little reason that people will be holding onto their RSUs that long. I hold most of mine for a while partly because when a lot of mine were issued they were at such a low strike price there was no way it wouldn't go up significantly beyond S&P 500 gains in comparison.",
