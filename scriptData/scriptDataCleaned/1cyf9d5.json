Samsung, Apple, Huawei, and Garmin are big players nowadays. But that doesn't mean Google's Fitbit has been closed for good.\n\nThe landscape will look different, for sure. But catching up has rarely meant the company fell on the wayside in over 2 decades. My take is - ride the lightning, and look for the competition that will catch up fast, as it'll be the one whose stock will skyrocket until it meets nVidia's share.",
