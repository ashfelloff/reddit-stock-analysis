          "body": "Intel always has so much potential and seems to squander it in key areas.  \n\nOn the negative:\n- they previously sold their ARM-based mobile cpu business to Marvell and refocused on more profitable desktop and server business. ARM continues to eat INTCâ€™s lunch in embedded, mobile, tablet, and now laptop/desktop (Apple M1/2/3 line). \n- Intel has done quite well with integrated graphics but always struggled to make discrete graphics cards. It was obvious with Project Larabee that Intel wasnâ€™t committed to GPU architecture and tried to repurpose their existing architecture. It was a flop (not Teraflop). It turns out the massively parallel small cores of Nvidia and AMD GPUs is also great for AI and HPC.  Intel knows this yet keeps missing the boat\n- Intel long considered tablets as a novelty and focused on enabling the same old OEMs with laptop and desktop chips. MSFT recognized that consumers wanted better and more portable designs and the Surface and Surface Pro were honest attempts to shake this market up and keep Windows relevant.\n- The fab. Oh how the fab culture dominated Intel for years and they were so proud of it. The problem came in 10nm which is when Extreme UV (EUV) became necessary to reduce diffraction and thus improve yields.  Year after year they kept trying to fight physics. They needed EUV. \n\nOn the positive side:\n- intc is focusing on power design. Backside power delivery is awesome and saves as much as 30% of chip power. They were super good at transitioning mfg to this process improvement.  Kudos \n- breaking out the fab as a separate biz is key. They need each business to stop pretending that fab is free and the fab needs to stop hiding behind the super profitable server business. Fabs used to cost $5B, now they are $10B+. You need economy of scale and reusable design only possible by making chips for other customers.  This process is going to be painful but INTC needs to muscle thru it \n- silicon photonics continues to be a promising way of reducing DC power consumption and improving cross board data rates thru multi-wavelength data transmission. Promising but still probably too early for widespread adoption\n- chiplet design is the near future. the design of chips is hard and keeps getting harder and pre-silicon and post-silicon validation is getting exponentially more complex. The next logical step is to break the chips apart and stack them. You get to focus on each chipâ€™s validation and reuse components across various designs. \n\nAnywho just my 2 cents.",

I am curious to see how the Gaudi 3 performs vs the announced NVDA H200 and B200 chips.  AMD comes in way cheaper for their MI300 line ($10-15k) which is relatively competitive, so I imagine the Gaudi 3 will be priced somewhere in between (aka $15-30k).\n\nI also failed to mention other big INTC financial decisions like selling off the NAND business to SK Hynix (+$7-9B), spinning off Mobileye (+$861M raised), as well as buying Altera (-$16.7B) back in 2015.
