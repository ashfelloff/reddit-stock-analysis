That guy is right about most embedded systems running embedded Linux, every switch, router, VPN, firewall, access point, security cameras, things every company small and large use every day.  Cars usually are running real time operating systems but some do run Linux so he gets a half point there.  The biggest companies on the planet heavily utilize Linux for cloud computing. Google, Amazon, even MICROSOFT use Linux (azure Linux) for the entirety of their cloud computing architecture which every single large company is utilizing.  I could go on and on but saying Linux is only used in startups is very misguided.\n\nIf you are in IT, you might want to study up or change roles from desktop support where you only see Windows or an occasional Mac, there’s a lot more out there.  Good luck to you.\n\nAlso, you should be featured on r/confidentlyincorrect",

                  "body": "BSD didn't forked anything. Originally, BSD was a bunch of Unix add-on tools that were not included with commercial Unix. That's why the name was \"Berkley Software Distribution\". Later, in 1979 or so, developers added kernel and boot loader and it became full OS. It was not a \"fork\", which means modification of original source code and that would be serious license violation.\n\nSaying that Darwin is based on BSD is rather misleading, people like to say it  - sure, some utils are maybe from BSD but kernel isn't, filesystem isn't, graphical interface isn't, anything media isn't, so what's there from BSD I don't know.  \nBut you right that Apple is not running Linux.",

As things like product development, and there exceptional customer support cost money. (I heard during the new world killing 3090 incident, that evga was allowing the RMA of cards from other brands because other brands were denying RMA requests. From what I remember the GPU dies themselves were fine so they were harvesting those dies to not have to get new ones from nvidia cause it was cheaper, and it builds good company reputation, so they just took the old die slapped it on a new board with a new cooler and called it a day)\n\nEvga's strategy when walking away is to not do GPUs for any other company either (nvidia has a clause that they will stop doing buisness, or make business harder. If another company is worked with). So by walking away from GPUs in general they are leaving the door open for if nvidia makes margins more reasonable.",
