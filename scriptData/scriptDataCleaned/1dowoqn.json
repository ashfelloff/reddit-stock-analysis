  "title": "Why Intel is the most undervalued tech stock right now.",
  "score": 4127,
  "selftext": "Intel ($INTC) is an insane bargain right now, as it is trading at year 1999 stock price.\n\nEvery other comparable tech stock is up 5000%-20000% since then.\n\nPeople are too focused on Intel consumer and data center products, which by the way are improving at impressive rate. Now they have AI chip comparable to NVIDIA's H100 (Guadi 3). Lunar lake SoC for laptops based on 3nm, upcoming desktop CPUs based on Intel 20 (Arrow Lake in Q3), and they also announced the next gen of Intel Arc GPUs with massive gains and driver improvements to make them very competitive with AMD & NVIDIA offerings.\n\n**But the real deal is Intel Foundry segment.**\n\nCurrently Intel is the only company in the world that has ASML's next gen EUV machines (called High-NA) up and running. They will be able to manufacture sub 2nm silicon at impressive rate. No other company has received such machines. With rumors that TSMC (current leader in foundry business) will only receive them in 2026, and **I doubt the USA will allow much to be sent to Taiwan, for obvious security reasons.**\n\nMicrosoft & Qualcomm already announced they gonna use Intel upcoming 18A node for their future products, and it's only matter of time until we hear others like NVIDIA & Apple jumping in.\n\nIf you are a big tech company and want the best, cutting edge silicon you will have to switch to Intel foundry sooner or later.\n\nInvesting in Intel right now is like buying NVDA stock before the AI boom.

      "body": "I can comment on this one actually. I know semiconductors and the industry better than most but I’m no expert so YMMV etc. disclaimers. \n\nIntel is a very long way from using their ASML Deep EUV machine. Yes they got the first one. But now they have to develop the technology to use it. It’s new territory with all these new lithography machines. They don’t come ready to use out of the box. They are probably 2-5 years from having a process ready that uses it. \n\nFurther- you can’t just take your design and stick it in a new process node. You actually have to design the chip specifically for that node. Especially when you move manufacturers. The silicon made by intel and TSMC is actually quite different. So when they moved their manufacturing to TSMC they didn’t just take their design and hand it over. No, it was a massive investment to redesign the chips for the TSMC process. Things stay generally in the same place and the same superficial arrangement is there but at the gate level things look different. \n\nIntel has really faltered on execution lately. With their 10 nm process they really fell apart. In some ways they bit off more than they can chew. They tried to add 3 new really advanced techniques into the process that would have rocketed them ahead of TSMC had they worked. But they couldn’t get them to work for a few years. TSMC is much better at executing and delivering new processes. They go for small incremental improvements each year. \n\nIntel isn’t even manufacturing their newest generation themselves. That’s critical here. Most the semiconductor companies you talk about are either design houses or foundries or equipment makers. Intel did all three for years. So buying intel you are buying into all three industries. They fell apart on equipment and are buying outside equipment with ASMLs new machine. And they fell down on manufacturing with TSMC actually manufacturing the processor tiles for their new SKUs. \n\nAMD is a much smaller company and much more efficient. They design one chip well and then reuse it in all their parts with different packaging processes and their “chiplet” designs. Intel makes dozens of different masks. And each one takes engineering time. \nAlso, AMD spun off their in house foundry as Global Foundries about 10 years ago. So they don’t have to worry about that. They design their silicon for TSMC’s process and rely on them to innovate and deliver. \n\nAll that said, I do think Intel is oversold. They still have massive market share in the consumer and server markets. They’re losing market share but we’re talking from 95% to 85%. They are pulling much lower margins though because the ferocious competition from AMD forces them to lower their prices. And honestly AMD has the better server and consumer CPU parts IMHO. Intel has much stronger relationships with the system integrators from years and years of partnership and shady business practices so that companies like Dell and Lenovo and server manufacturers like Super Micro all tend to use Intel processors. AMD has struggled in this regard. \n\nThe bigger story though is that AMD has a ton of room to grow by stealing market share. And Intel has little place to go but hold the line or lose more share. Those relationships are really strong though and it’s worth looking into the arrangements they have with the integrators. \n\nIntel has new management with a technical background instead of a sales background and that might help get the company back into the lead technologically but like getting a new head coach on a football team, it takes years to rebuild your bench and get the ball rolling on new research. Also the gains are getting harder and harder. The gates are only a few dozen atoms now. They aren’t really at this point getting smaller - they’re getting more dense which creates an “equivalent shrinkage”. So 5 nm wasn’t 5nm feature size anymore it was a density as if the feature size was 5nm. So the power requirements aren’t going down like they should. But with the density increasing and the number of gates increasing and the amount of leakage in tiny gates means that power consumption and heat production are limiting factors. AMDs new cores are actually the same core. The efficiency cores are just smaller than the power cores. So the “efficiency cores” just have to run slower because they are so dense and the heat gets built up. \n\nThere’s a lot to like with Intel but there are also very significant hurdles and many years of hard work to demonstrate that they can deliver - especially when it’s increasingly hard to make process node advancements. Exponential even.  If they deliver on backside power delivery first they might have a chance. Opening up the foundry might help. Especially with the US govt throwing money around for domestic production. But they won’t be making bleeding edge chips. They’ll be making lower margin more mundane chips with their (relatively) less advanced lithography. Though 14nm and 10 and 7 are pretty solid nodes.",

Currently scheduled for no later than 2027, using High NA EUV and their PowerVia backside power delivery technology. If they manage to pull it off on schedule, they will be the most advanced foundry in the world, and they will be the premier shovel seller in this AI gold rush.",

That will be interesting to watch as they makes them about 6-9 months behind Intel since they took delivery earlier this year. \n\nI think I remember reading that Intel is predicting to have that machine in production in 2 years. Realistically, they will probably be delayed. Tsmc hasn't announced a true timeline, but it's my opinion that they are neck and neck. \n\nThat being said, historically Intel has been more advanced nm to nm, so maybe they design better on the new machines?!

Everything we are reading about Granite Rapids and Intel 3 is very very good. It's a little disingenuous to call out nodes by NM when nobody truly owns the node NM definition. Industry experts agree the measurement is node density. If Intel 3 is comparable to TSMC 3 in terms of HP Node density, it is equivalent. Published density specs of both are equivalent. Point made if you give Samsung and TSMC credit for their nodes and Intel has comparable density, then Intel is calling it right. \n\nGoing a step further you have backside power delivery and Ferveros which are industry leading technologies at Intel. TSMC isn't there and Intel will beat everyone by a year at least.\n\nFinally nobody is saying 18A is not \"more advanced lithography\". In fact the entire industry is saying the opposite. According to most publications we could see 20A products released this year and 18A next year. I believe I read that 18A products were already being manufactured. Specifically, Panther Lake. While you clearly know semiconductors, your facts are old.\n\nThere isn't much published on HD nodes at Intel although we can presume to see something soon. It will be a big deal when we can see Intel building GPU's and GPU tiles. That will be a turning point in the history of the company. Intel has always been able to manufacture exceptional HP nodes.",

They have trouble getting new technology out of the labs and onto the production floor. \n\nThe way you buy semiconductors means that yield means everything. You don’t pay per chip. You pay per wafer. So yield matters a whole lot.

Their fate can be gone in 24 hours, there a reason U.S government is dumping billions into Intel- forcing partnerships with TSMC and UMC, just in March of this year, U.S government gave them $20 Billion in rewards. Nvidia,AMD have not received anything near this. Only other company that received an amount near this Micron at $6.1 Billion. Intel is positioned, for a trillion dollar market cap finally, as U.S pushes them to be a global leader in chip market.

The correction alone is enough to return INTC to its previous level of success.\n\nThe AI/GPU tech is a wildcard, but it's unlikely to hurt & the payoff could be huge. I don't know if it will pop off like NVIDIA---I doubt it will be that big---but I expect it to be better than most alternatives.",

The exposure area for high-NA is smaller than EUV and the amount of double exposure you need for each chip increases. Intel not only has to figure out how to be a foundry, they also have to figure out how to make high-NA outperform EUV. All while bleeding money in their foundry business.
