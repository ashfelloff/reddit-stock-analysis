  "selftext": "For those worrying about SMCI fraud, SEC and DoJ investigations, and possible NASDAQ delisting, the biggest problem is their $1.5 billion convertible notes from February when the stock was at $97.50 and if the holders come calling for their money back. They have been bleeding cash (see below) and they probably no longer have $1.5 billion in their bank accounts anymore.\n\n[https:\\/\\/s204.q4cdn.com\\/707617056\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2024\\/q4\\/Earnings-Deck-Q4FY24-V5-w-2-of-2-at-end.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/m0e0wpire4yd1.png?width=2514&format=png&auto=webp&s=47a2e8faaf9f971a162bbe0e1e716960c738f983)\n\nSupermicro Announces Pricing of Private Offering of $1.5 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) (‚ÄúSupermicro‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù), a Total IT Solution Manufacturer for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the ‚ÄúConvertible Notes‚Äù). The Convertible Notes are being offered and sold to ‚Äúqualified institutional buyers‚Äù pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ‚ÄúSecurities Act‚Äù). The Company also granted a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The Convertible Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. **The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 0.7455 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1,341.38 per share of the Company‚Äôs common stock, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 37.5% above the closing price of $975.52 per share of the Company‚Äôs common stock on February 22, 2024)**. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the Company‚Äôs option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 1, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company‚Äôs common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\n**Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid special and additional interest**, if any, to, but excluding the applicable repurchase date. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company‚Äôs common stock at the Company‚Äôs election. The Company expects to close the offering on February 27, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions.\n\n[https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Pricing-of-Private-Offering-of-1.5-Billion-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2029/default.aspx](https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Pricing-of-Private-Offering-of-1.5-Billion-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2029/default.aspx)\n\n[As of last quarter, SMCI had $1.67B in cash and were cash flow negative in 3 consecutive quarters!](https://preview.redd.it/nm512jp3d4yd1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a43e6580775499be8ddb527fa6a8398e856f44e)",
