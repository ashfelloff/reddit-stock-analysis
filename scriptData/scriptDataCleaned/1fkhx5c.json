Like for most of 2015 the 10 year Treasury notes were going for between 2 and 2.5%. Now the ten year yield is 3.7%. That represents a 40-80% increase in yield as things stand now on the same level of debt. \n\nSo there is all this old debt getting refinanced, so to speak, and then probably $2T in new debt, $5-10t  total in debt getting a new rate next year, the bond yield and therefore the prime rate being as low as possible is crucial. Probably of greater long term importance to the country than if we enter a recession or not.\n\n\n\nThen there are also corporate junk bonds. Even large cap companies don't have the same resources to rack up debt like the US government.

              "body": "It's not about a \"recession.\" It's about whether interest payments on the federal debt become a spiraling and unsustaintably large part of the federal budget, risking either a sovereign debt crisis or austerity or massive tax hikes.  Any of those would cause a recession.  But they will come first.   it's not an instant thing.  It's more of a the longer this goes on (debt turning over at higher rates) the sooner the crisis will come.\n\nTo understand this you need to think about the mechanics of how the US debt is financed.  It's financed through treasury bonds with fixed terms.  So, what happens when a 10-year t-bill comes due?  It's not like we suddenly cut the budget or raise taxes.   (That would be crazy).  Instead, we simply issue a new bond.  So when A's bond is due, treasury issues a new bond at auction, B buys it, and treasury uses the money to pay A.  Life goes on.  But what happens when the old bond was at 2% interest and the new bond is at 4.5% interest?  Suddenly there is a real change.  The total interest on the federal debt being paid out increases.  It keeps increasing so long as old bonds keep turning over into new bonds with higher rates.  The longer higher rates go on, the more bonds turn over every day into the higher rates, the more interest we have to pay, the more fucked we become.\n\nAt a certain point, it will all become impossible to keep up -- interest payments will be so high we'll have to either dramatically raise taxes, dramatically cut spending, or just do nothing and turn into Greece.\n\nAlternatively, a fourth option is to just lower interest rates -- inflation be damned -- and inflate away the debt.  A \"benefit\" of high inflatino is that it makes the weight of past debt comparatively less burdensome.  So a good bout of hyperinflation is also possible, although that would likely be pretty painful.  \n\nI genuinely believe we could be forced into hard choices in about five years.  Party has been going on for a long time -- because rates were near zero and debt didn't matter -- but the bell is starting to toll.",

The Treasury announces an auction, what is to be auctioned, when the auction will take place and the dollar amount. At that time institutions submit bids for how much they will buy at what yield. The Treasury goes through the bids until they have sold the predetermined dollar amount.\n\nThis is  how the auction works. They offer the notes at a certain yield and if they don't sell all bonds they come back a basis point or two higher and take more bids. They keep raising the yield until all bonds are sold and then everyone gets the highest price. So technically, the Fed could buy all the bonds at the lowest price. And maybe they did this or something like this during QE because at the time yield was very low.",

Japanese-style debt problems require Japanese-style solutions. The Fedsury will money-print and specifically target purchases of long bonds from the Treasury, until they get the yields they want.

A large deficit of $1.1 trillion a year in goods is partially offset by the services sector (+$288 bln). The revenue situation continued to deteriorate (-$144 bln y/y). \n\nOne of the problems here in recent years has been the fall in US net investment income to 0.09% of GDP, which had been as high as 1-1.5% of GDP before 2020, but rising interest rates and a relatively strong dollar have brought it to near zero. More and more debt has to be paid, in this sense the dollar is a fundamentally unstable currency that if rates fall too quickly (risk-adjusted of course) will come under pressure due to reduced capital inflows, if rates remain elevated will remain strong in the moment but will continue to face further current account degradation and problems over the long term horizon. \n\nEspecially given that the commodity deficit is only growing so far: the last 4 months have averaged around $100 bln monthly, i.e. approaching ~1.2 trillion annualized levels. And this is despite the fact that over the last 15 years the US has shifted from being a net energy importer to a net energy exporter, but everything it has saved on that has been spent on something else. \n\nTotal external liabilities on the international investment position rose by $7.6 trillion to a record $57.1 trillion last year, while assets only rose by $3.2 trillion to $35.8 trillion, the net international investment position is negative at -$21.3 trillion, or 75% of GDP. At some point, this imbalance will have to be “unloaded” on foreign investors, but what form and when?",
