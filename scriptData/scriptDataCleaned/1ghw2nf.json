As a value investor Mr. Buffett seeks income in order to fund future purchases.  Over 7% in a year?  No but the rate of growth in yield will exceed the growth of stocks as slowing is occurring.  We saw this in the 1970's with stagflation leading to the peak in 1981.  Another factor is the possibility of gains taxes going up, favoring income.  Hard assets off ledger avoid this but earn no income during the second wave of inflation which will be stronger than the first.",

The current environment is very similar to the 70/80s where interest rates are going to be much higher than what had been the past decade with higher inflation. This usually means good returns on debt instruments. I’ve been looking to diversify out of stocks into high yield bonds as I too believe the coming 5-15 years could be a time for weaker equity returns. But I’m not sure how i can approach bond investing as an individual investor.",
