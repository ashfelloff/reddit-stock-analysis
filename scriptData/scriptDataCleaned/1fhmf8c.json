  "selftext": "Say you have a budget of $1000. You buy $100 SPY/QQQ calls every day. Most will go to 0 but if the move is towards the upside (and stocks/options tend to convex to the upside) you would see a huge gain.\n\nThe math comes to you needing a 10x move at least 1/10 times to break even.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\n**UPDATE**\n\nI never said this was some genius strategy but a lot of these comments are truly dumb.\n\n1. there is no theta. It's 0dte.\n2. there is no assignment. you are buying the call\n3. there is no tits up/ lose it all scenario...since you only lose that one small bet at any given time.\n4. strike price blah blah doesnt matter since you are betting on direction - however i guess it ideally has to be close to in the money for it to actually have a chance to make a big jump\n\nHow you actually lose: by bleeding out. by winning less than your starting principal. so the calculus is if you can expect to make more than $1000 over 10 bets on avg or not.",

      "body": "I'm going to try to give what I think is genuine advice, since this is tagged, fairly in my option, as an advice request.\n\nWhat you are describing is simple in principle but very difficult to execute.\n\nTo have a trading edge in this scenario, it's simple: you need to win at least 10% of your trades - which is very low. But your wins need to be at least 9x the size of your loss. (1 win at 9 vs. 9 losses at 1 cancel each other out.)\n\nSo your stats need to be at least this or higher. Sounds very simple and it is. But everyone who is trading on the market knows this. That causes difficulty for you in these two seemingly simple areas.\n\n10% of wins. It sounds so easy - but everyone on the market is competing to get these 10% of wins. So a difference of say, 9.9% - 10.09% is the maximum range you need to hit. Otherwise, the option you buy is priced for you to lose. And the hedge fund algorithms who are trading this market you are participating in know more than you about the right pricing. So, what's your strategy for staying in that narrow band? How are you identifying what separates the 9.8% probability option from the 11% probability? Because if you can't get that right, you're not going to hit the 10% wins target.\n\nBut you say, your 1 win out of 10 will be so big! Yes it's true, but it has to be 9x your losses. What are you doing when you take a bunch of losses in a row? Suddenly, you need more than 9x to make up for it. What do you do when you hit a bunch of solid wins, that are only 8x? Yes, they barely made it, and they are amazing wins, but you are STILL BEHIND. Now you start going for riskier trades because you need more to make up for it, and those are less than 9.9% probability. Uh oh. Do you have a strategy to navigate that?\n\nBecause most of the other participants in the market have strategies. They've tested them with Ph.Ds and high level ai. So you need to grind edge in like tenths of percents against them. And if you can't do that then you lose, and they take money from you, and that's where the fuel for the finance industry comes from --at your level at least.\n\nSo it's not that you can't do these things, but just realize they are hard. Try to understand what it really takes to succeed consistently if you want to trade in this particular area.",
