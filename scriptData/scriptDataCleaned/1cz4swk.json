Said he was going to retire when it hit 5 dollars.\n\nA few months after he made his retirement proclamation he met a woman. He fell in love and started planning for the wedding. Sold all his ETH to pay for the wedding. Almost immediately after he sold it, it started taking off. He watched it go from .75...to 5.00...to 300 and I think it hit over 3,000 within that year. It was actually pretty devastting to watch. He was in it for a few years and if he had waited just a few more months, he could have used just a fraction of his ETH to pay for the wedding and still have 99% of his portfolio to diamond hand. Imagine having over 100,000 ETH at 3,000 dollars each. Thats over 300,000,000 dollars that he lost out on.  I think one or two of the guys that were in his crypto group kept their ETH (but they didnt stay in contact so I dont know what happened to them).",
