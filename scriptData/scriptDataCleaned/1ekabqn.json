The first one is how bad will the slowdown get, everyone has been expecting it? Got me. Crypto always has a major crash before it runs, every single time so that's not unusual, traditional markets. You got me, in my eyes there's nothing different from last week. We were all expecting the unemployment rate to tick up. You had headlines of layoffs for the past few months, of course it's going to show up in the data. Did they just collectively decide to sell? Short enough calls, buy enough puts and then just pull the lever? Maybe but there's really no edge even looking back that was obvious. I mean you had a technical reversal on fed day where the Russell hit the old all-time high and then reversed, that did catch my attention but this free fall, The only thing that I see that's somewhat concrete is The yen is aggressively strengthening against the dollar. These charts pretty much line up exactly with it. When that aggressive move began, markets aggressively sold off. That was a major source of liquidity for a lot of leveraged funds",
