We didn't experience 3.5% inflation in a single month, we experienced 3.5% inflation between March 2023 and March 2024.\n\nRate cuts cause inflation.  Rate increases lower inflation.  I'm trying to say since inflation is high—greater than the 2% target—and has been persistently high—since 2021—the Fed would be mad to cut interest rates.  If we had high unemployment and high inflation—stagflation—the correct move is *still* to raise interest rates, like Volcker did to end the inflation of the 70s and early 80s, the first step toward the huge bull run of the late 80s and 90s.",
