The CEO recently could not get a live stream running for 40 minutes, so I am starting to suspect he isn't as smart as he lets on.\n\nRobots are coming and are going to be big. However, I am not sure if the FSD AI work is going to put them that much ahead. FSD is a single task, training on a massive data set. Robots need to know how to do 1,000 different things that are complex, but not so much deadly if they make a mistake. Folding clothes or flipping pancakes, rinsing and putting away dishes ... for 10,000 different kitchen layouts. Or factory floor tasks. They still haven't proven they can do this, which is the hard part - not the hardware - and there are others who are trying to do the same thing.\n\nEnergy storage is a bright spot, but it is hardware and lead time and scale constrained. This is another place where someone else can come in and compete within a few years. Batteries and electronics are easier to build than electric cars.\n\nMeanwhile, they have delayed the $25,000 vehicle, which I think is a mistake, and gone for the robo-taxis. These aren't ready. I don't think they will be able to roll them out everywhere all at once. But I think Elon is thinking that is EXACTLY what they are going to do, and if so, it is likely to be a disaster initially. \n\nTL;DR - They are being valued as a tech company. But they are currently failing to execute in the core business the company has now, and the tech stuff is a ways off from making up the difference. Elon is too busy playing politics to be CEO of several businesses, and his politics are destroying his brands. \n\nPrepare for some choppy waters.",

I'd suggest not. Well, not compared to Tesla's approach. I'm sceptical about Tesla and FSD as I think there's just too many edge cases - to get it to 99% functionality is extremely difficult but to get it to where they need to be - 99.999%? - seems to me to be just about impossible with today's tech.

That part will only get better, but Ford/Toyota's dealership problem won't. \n\nPeople used to joke about Tesla being worth more than the entire car market. But Tesla doesn't need to capture the entire car market to one day challenge the entire current car market on net profit. \n\nAnd of course, there is still all the other stuff, which may not be likely to be a money maker but still has potential.
