  "selftext": "Nvidia earnings come out post market on Wednesday. They beat their past 4 earnings and past performance always predicts future results. Easy 35% gain for sure. The calls are NOT priced in. My schwab account aka my life savings is almost fully maxed out on margin leverage on nvidia and nvidia 2x etf w about a 3x total leverage on the portfolio. Buying calls in my robinhood too. Jensen Huang will not let us down.\n\nIf you disagree with me you are regard and hate making money. ",
