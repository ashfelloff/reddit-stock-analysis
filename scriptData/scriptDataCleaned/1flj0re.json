If you buy $1,000, your maximum loss is $1,000 because the largest possible loss the symbol can reach is to go to $0.\n\nHowever, when you go short, your losses are unlimited. If you short $1,000, your maximum loss is unlimited because there's no limit on how much the symbol can go up.\n\nAnd on top of that, you're shorting a company with a market cap below $1B and a float of 54M, which is bound to easily move 30%, 40%, 50%, or more outside market hours.\n\nYou're basically juggling grenades, and you're not even aware of it.",
