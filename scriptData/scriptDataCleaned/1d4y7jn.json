  "selftext": "I see a lot of loss porn and crazy stuff on here and so I‚Äôve decided to share my 5 year portfolio since 2019 to now. I hope this will inspire those who have lost a lot or think it‚Äôs impossible to make money. I did it at 18 with 0 experience. And although it is hard to see I‚Äôve been down 30-40-50% at times which felt awful but just like in life you never know when things are going to turn around. You‚Äôve just gotta build a good strategy and constantly keep improving. If you‚Äôre curious of a more in depth walk through of my journey and strategy, I‚Äôll put it under here but the gist of my post is: \n\n- USE MONEY YOU CAN BURN (with 0 pain)üî•‚úçÔ∏è\n-INVEST AS MUCH AS YOU CAN WHEN YOU ARE YOUNGER (18-25)\n-START WITH ETF AND SAFE BETS UNTIL YOU MAKE ‚ÄúRISK‚Äù MONEY (more below)\n-STOP SELLING BLUE CHIP STOCKS MONKE (idc if it‚Äôs down 2% today üòÄ) \n- READ BELOW üëá AND IF THATS TOO MUCH WORK THEN YOU ARE COOKED ALREADY. \n\nSo yeah I turned 18 just before C*ckvid 19 and that sucked because I had just started investing when the market died. I lost 70% of my $100 dollars and almost gave up then. That‚Äôs the dip #1. If I could give someone advice who is starting like I was I‚Äôd say: YouTube, Google, and honestly ChatGPT now. Start simple. Look up what terms are: Stock, ticker, Dow, S&P, Points, Limit buy/sell, Broker, Hedge Fund, Private Equity, EPS. DO NOT FUCKIGN LOOK UP THE WORD OPTION YOU DODO BIRD. ü¶§ I did not trade an option until that third spike. But yeah I lost %70 and sold like a dummy but I came back with $50 more bucks (a lot at the time) and I bought a few of those same stocks that tanked. (Travel stocks, cannabis stocks were hyped, Tesla) I bought stocks with low costs so id see higher gains if they went up. (3-5$) Amazon is great but not early value investing. I made back my $100 and some more. I got up to $250. I felt good so decided to buy some risky penny stocks with the extra. I lost my money lol but the key here is I never went below my line and I never gave up. I researched and found a stock that looked good ‚Äúsundial‚Äù and I put in some extra money I had made. It actually sky rocket and I made $1k. Nice. \n\nTHIS WAS AFTER 1 YEAR OF WAKING UP AT 8am everyday and learning and trying and being patient. I ‚Äúlost‚Äù money and made small amounts a lot before this. Please understand that this takes time. If anyone wants a break down of the rest I can share or questions, but this got too long real quick. Sorry. I hope my little story and tips help you guys recover or build. I started with $25 and a free stock. I ended up with $3,000 a year later. Not typical!!! But the bigger point is I put that money in ETFs and now have 10k in savings and make half my rent each month. I have both my cars and college paid off. Stocks are not a way to be rich ü§ë they are a way to grow money. Please be proud of your $20 gains. That‚Äôs $7,300 a year if you can do it each day. Love you guys. STAY AWAY FROM OPTIONS. Unless you are rich and like making us laugh. ü§£ ",
