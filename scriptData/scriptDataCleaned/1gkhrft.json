The non-GAAP diluted net income per common share expected to be reported for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 includes adjustments for stock-based compensation expenses of $50 million, net of the related tax effects of $17 million.\n\nThe Company expects to report total cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.1 billion and total debt of approximately $2.3 billion with bank debt comprising approximately $0.6 billion and convertible notes of approximately $1.7 billion.\n\nFinancial Information Is Preliminary and May Be Subject to Change\n\nSecond Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance\n\nThe Company expects net sales in a range of $5.5 billion to $6.1 billion, missing consensus of 6.86 billion. \n\nfor the second quarter of the fiscal year 2025 ending December 31, 2024, GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.48 to $0.58 and non-GAAP net income per diluted share of $0.56 to $0.65, missing consensus of 0.83. \n\nThe Company’s projections for GAAP and non-GAAP net income per diluted share assume a tax rate of approximately 14.0% and 15.0%, respectively, and a fully diluted share count of 640 million shares for GAAP and fully diluted share count of 648 million shares for non-GAAP. The outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2025 GAAP net income per diluted share includes approximately $54 million in expected stock-based compensation expense and other expenses, net of related tax effects of $14 million, which are excluded from non-GAAP net income per diluted share.",
