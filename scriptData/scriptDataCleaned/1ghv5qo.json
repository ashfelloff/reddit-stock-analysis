  "selftext": "Berkshires cash on hand hits a record $325 Billion\n\nCurrently owns ~$69.9 Billion worth of Apple $AAPL as of the end of Q3 down from $84.2B worth as of the end of Q2\n\nNo brk.a or brk.b shares repurchase in Q3\n\nPosts Q3 revenue of $92.9B compared to $93.2B YoY\n\nOperating earnings fell 6% from a year earlier to $10.09 billion as insurance underwriting earnings slumped\n\n#\n\n>**It is being widely reported that Berkshire's operating earnings declined 6.2% in the quarter. No. The reported figures include unrealized currency losses in 2024 and gains in 2023 on BRK's debt denominated in foreign currencies, largely yen. Earnings really grew 8.5% in Q3 to $11.2 billion against $10.3 billion and were up 18.0% for the nine months to $33.0 billion from $28.0 billion. Just as short-term movements in equity prices can distort the reporting of operating profits, so to do currency swings on debt outstanding. Both should be excluded from an analysis of operating and economic profit.**\n\nPer Christopher Bloomstran on X ",

He's basically said that in his opinion taxes can only stay at today's historic lows for so long when the deficit is so massive and voters concerns about the government's long term financial health are growing. And that when push comes to shove he thinks that higher taxes will ultimately win out over massive spending cuts (or that we'll get both). Hence why taking some profits now is preferable.\n\nBut Apple's valuation, and very low growth over the last few years definitely have to also be playing a part in this as well. Earnings growth determines a stocks long term performance, and if you don't have much growth but have a very high PE ratio than the room for out performance is definitely much lower.",

I don’t think a new tax code would be detrimental for them considering they have been through it all from 60s to now.\n\nMy two cents are simply insurance coverage is expensive, and no matter how much cost they pass into you, they need better capitalization than ever. And honestly, I rather overpay for insurance that is going to reimburse me than underpay and get screwed.\n\nWhen it comes to cash, TBills pay over 4%, and realistically, there ain’t many cheap opportunities at Berkshire size or even value for them. The S&P is trading at around 30x.\n\nAll and all, Berkshire is in essence insurance company. That Cash belongs to Geico. And other businesses like Energy and railroad are capital intensive especially now. It would be more alarming if Berkshire doesn’t carry a sizable amount of cash. Insurance companies usually carry 60-80% of float in Fixed Income not Equities; Berkshire's portofolio is only normal because it is Berkshire\n\nCapital allocation is art not science, and Berkshire benefits largely from the fuck you attitude towards analysts and funds.
