  "score": 96,
  "selftext": "The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the PCE price index, is anticipated to show slight improvement. Core inflation is expected at 0.2%, down from 0.3% in March. Consumer spending should moderate to a 0.4% gain from 0.8% in March. This data could keep the possibility of rate cuts open later this year, with traders pricing in a 50-50 chance of a cut in September and greater odds in November.\n\n[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-economists-expect-friendly-u-s-inflation-data-this-friday-3807ce89?mod=mw\\_rss\\_topstories](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-economists-expect-friendly-u-s-inflation-data-this-friday-3807ce89?mod=mw_rss_topstories)",
