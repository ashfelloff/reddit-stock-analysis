I know people don‚Äôt trust Abel (for good reason, in some senses.) *But*, I do think dilution is off the table for this year. That‚Äôs not saying much, granted, but with public acknowledgment of partnership and quasi-governmental funding on the table, it‚Äôs something. The hope being that successful launch leads to more investment and so on. All that said, I actually agree. Hence my decision to derisk. Taking a more reasonably sized long position, including LEAPS now. I got carried away with the excitement, but there are too many ‚Äòifs.‚Äô It will be fun if they succeed and it‚Äôs a bumpy ride up from here, but I don‚Äôt need this much skin in the game. If/when they are profitable, or even steadily increasing negative earnings per share, I‚Äôll retake the position. I‚Äôm not in it for the screenshots and buying in when at $10 per share and almost profitable, strikes me as wise. Buying in at a higher share price when profitable, will still be massively rewarding - an order of magnitude. So, a bit of fun, and now some sobriety. (I came into all of this as a value investor, who veered towards tech because growth is intrinsic to value, but still buy and hold through volatility, which requires what you mentioned!)",

Still don‚Äôt know if there will be further delays. And space is hard - no guarantees even now. I actually bought most of these contracts last week, after the previous run up.

Then, as I was figuring out how to proceed, first adjusting risk and then taxes, had this run up. I‚Äôm incredibly happy, but was taken by surprise. I still think this is an all or nothing play, and was lucky as all get out to have a pretty big win on the shares and contracts. I still hold a bunch of both, but was super excited to take profits in my Roth especially. I hope this company truly succeeds and am comfortable with my level of risk now that I was able to take some of those gains. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve understood you correctly?
