I was reading my own comment as if it had been yours! hahaha\n\nTo answer your question...\n\nI see absolutely no reason why MSFT wouldn't get back to $450 within the next month or two.  However I'm doubtful for the stock market as a whole past October.  And I'm also doubtful of how much the option value will return to the price you paid.  This last few weeks have added a lot of volatility to a previously stable stock. \n\nThe bigger question is, how long are you willing to sit around just hoping to get your original money back now that it's lost?  Every minute that you sit on MSFT, hoping to get back to what you paid is a minute that could be spent getting actual gains on something else.\n\nThe money is the same whether it's in these bad options or in other, better options. But the hope and the reality are different for both.\n\nEven if you sold out of your current position, at whatever loss, and bought into a more friendly position in MSFT (like $450) you'd have a better chance of earning back your money. And you'd have a _much_ better chance in another stock.  So at this point, the only reason to keep holding what you have would be if its value has gone so low that there's nothing to get out of it now, or no buyers.",
