Pretty good shit. It's probably bottomed imo, but I stopped doing PYPL puts this year since TSLA puts pay way more. \n\nBut also feel free to short AXP if you guys want. I have like a 400 long position with $108 average price. Sold covered calls on that shit so hoping it at least crabs for a while.

I charge back maybe once every 2-3 years with maybe 50-80k/yr purchases on the card, and only when it's clearly appropriate - vendor not sending item, not just buyer's remorse. My most recent chargeback was from an auto parts vendor that sent me the wrong part number, but refused to take it back because the part was opened. The SKU was correct on the outside of the package, but the part inside was wrong. The vendor told me tough noogies, and refused to honor a return. I charged back via Amex, and they sided with the vendor despite having an email from the vendor admitting they sent the wrong part.",

I am more aware of which card I use for purchases, where before I would use Amex for everything. No card is really good for consumer protection like the good ol' days.
