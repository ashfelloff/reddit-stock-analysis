I bought SPACs (DWAC, CFVI, ALCC) for close to their cash value prior to merger - but I knew their narrative / target company was so good that they wouldn’t  stay at NAV for long.\n\nDWAC literally went from a risk-free financial asset (pre-target SPAC) to 14x its risk free price in 48 hours (after the initial report came out). Insane\n\nEdit2: i would never recommend messing with options in a retirement account to anyone. and yes a lot of this performance is of course due to luck",
