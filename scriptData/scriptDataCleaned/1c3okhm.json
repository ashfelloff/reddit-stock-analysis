Iranians gave a week's notice, used mostly drones that took around 8 hours to reach Israel(almost all drones were shot down), only a few missiles hit Israel airbase (without causing too much damage) and after that they immediately announced \"the matter is concluded\". I mean, it's as if they were forced to put on a show\n\nAll of the escalation and de-escalation happened on a weekend within a matter of a few hours. It's as if the Iranian regime didn't want SPY to tank any further. Lmao",
