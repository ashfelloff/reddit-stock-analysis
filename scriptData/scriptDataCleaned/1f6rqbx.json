Lesson learned, get out fast on weeklies once the catalyst is over, if I had sold the day after that would've been a 1k gain which would still be great.\n\nBut I think something like that, at least to show that the losses are being reduced drastically would lead to a big surprise gain as a momentum starter. After all, I think everyone can agree, Intel's problems right now are money, money, money. They want the kind of attention Nvidia gets, and funding would be secured. Especially now that people are starting to get cold feet about holding Nvidia as the AI play, definitely at next Earnings if Nvidia doesn't swing back to positive upside surprise over the quarter, attention will be going elsewhere. That's Intel's chance to capture it, to say \"yeah we're turning the ship now\".",

Intel's basically been 20-30 for the past... 20-30 years lol. The market's value of intel is that it has a steady stream of revenue as a CPU maker, and Intel rested on that. So Intel never really was priced in for growth outside of the dotcom bubble or Pat taking over. Now that growth pricing in is gone at this point, as Intel has been trading sideways (it was literally at 30-31 for 3 months straight lol), It's going to hover over it's book value price + dividend.\n\nDividend is gone, that's what dropped the value as dividend investors left in droves (and by nature of dividend investing you need many shares, so that's volume leaving). Layoffs are bullish. Downsizing inefficient sections is bullish. Losing dividend after 20+ years is heavily bearish, and at such a surprise too. For Intel to be worth $10 they'd have to lose half of their steady revenue, which is not likely. They are deeply rooted in the PC market and contract with the govnt.\n\nEveryone knew that there were going to be bad quarters. Market priced that in. Market hardly priced in the odds of a dividend cut.",

IFS is burning cash but the other half of Intel actually pulls revenue, so the value is primarily concentrated on the revenue one, since anyone wanting to invest in growth is being directed towards AMD, Nvidia, TSMC etc. I don't see going lower than this point unless their core revenue is threatened, but for that, PC's would no longer have to be a good market, And then and only then would Intel start having to sell off its core business for scraps.\n\nBasically the price of Intel right now is their core revenue, cpu's etc. Foundry being sold off was seen as a positive so the market is not invested in that, and it was also a decent dividend stock but the removal of that took off a lot of share value.",

The equipment they have is both obsolete vis a vis TSMC and very, very specialized for Intel's process, that other manufacturers don't use. \n\nIntel easily has over $20B sunk into their newest fabs, but they couldn't get $20B at auction for them. They could maybe get a quarter of that for the fab plus the bill to gut it.\n\nIt's kind of a similar deal with their patent library. x86 is a very valuable IP to have, but who could they sell it to that wouldn't trigger an anti-trust case?\n\nThose fabs and IP are worth more to Intel than to anyone else. Given that, I think the most likely outcome is that Intel enters Chapter 11 after 18A fails or disappoints, their creditors take their pound of flesh, and then they let the same old fabs keep chugging. Intel may even get bought out by the government GM style.\n\nAnd you know who gets shafted and left with nothing in a Chapter 11 filing? Common-stock shareholders.
