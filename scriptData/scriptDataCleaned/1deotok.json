  "selftext": "Did you know that in addition to investments in public companies like RXRX, ARM, NNOX, TSPH, SOUN, SERV, Nvidia also has been actively investing in many private AI startups?\n\nI did some digging, and with the help of ChatGPT, found some interesting results. Here is a summary of some private venture companies that NVDA has invested in:\n\n[Enfabrica](https://www.reuters.com/technology/ai-chip-startup-enfabrica-raises-125-mln-with-backing-nvidia-2023-09-12/):  [This startup](https://www.enfabrica.net/) makes high performance AI hardware that goes into the data centres.\n\n[Mistral.ai](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-11/mistral-ai-raises-600-million-from-nvidia-samsung-and-vcs):  [This startup](https://mistral.ai) builds LLM's for F500 enterprise businesses.\n\n[Imbue](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/new-ai-unicorn-imbue-astera-nvidia): This Series B [startup](https://imbue.com/) builds GenAI agents \n\n[AI21](https://www.ai21.com/blog/series-c-funding): This Series C startup builds Task specific GenAI products\n\n[Hugging Face](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/24/23844444/google-amazon-nvidia-hugging-face-generative-ai-investment):  This startup provides GitHub-like AI model repository services\n\n[Adept AI](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/nvidia-semiconductor-ai-investment-databricks-ai21/):  This [Series B startup](https://www.adept.ai/) builds AI agents and tools for F500 enterprise businesses\n\n[Cohere](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/nvidia-semiconductor-ai-investment-databricks-ai21/): This is an OpenAi competitor\n\n[Skydio](https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/nvidia-semiconductor-ai-investment-databricks-ai21/):  This is a drone manufacturer\n\n\n\nAll of this to say that NVDA is not relying solely on revenue from selling AI chips and hardware, they are also generating revenue from venture capital investments, similar to Google Ventures, but the main difference being that NVDA's venture capital activities are not spun off into a separate wholly owned subsidiary\n\n",

Invest in AI startups so they have enough money to buy your overpriced products with >90% margins, your products show up with their full value on their balance sheet as property, plant, and equipment, and their shares show up on your balance sheet at their inflated valuation. As a result, a $1 Billion investment results in $1 Billion profit without anything of value being created(unless you seriously think these AI startups are worth what Nvidia is paying for them).\n\nI don't understand how Wall Street is dumb enough to not see through this.",

I did not know that some of these startups already have over Billion dollar valuations, did you know that already?\n\nAlso did you know that all of these investments are held directly by NVidia? There was another Redditor who raised concerns about impropriety and conflict of interest because NVidia doesn't have a separate, independent but wholly owned subsidiary to handle their investments.  That is how other companies like MSFT, GOOGL, AAPL, INTC, AMZN handle their investments, and NVDA should do better by following in their footsteps and create a separate wholly owned independent venture capital subsidiary with its own website so we can easily access information about their portfolio companies and not have to actively hunt for that info.",
