I see small steps in gains, a top, then small losses and after that the losses seem to start being more abrupt. And then again another quick high top and major abrupt losses. That seems to me like a good start marked by equilibrium and after the first top and first streak of losses it seems like a panic or revenge series of trades followed by more of a gambling trades than a strategy based trades. \nI'm saying this because I know. I've been there. My biggest loss was 120k. What I can say is all that truly matters is your mental state. Respect your tested strategy, meditate and base your trades on what you know and not what you feel. When you don't know, just sit on your hands. Don't worry too much. Learn from it and get back on the horse when you fix your mind. There's no other way to learn.",
