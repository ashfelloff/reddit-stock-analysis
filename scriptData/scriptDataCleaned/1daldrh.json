The real tragedy would be making it worse from this point on, where you now have some clarity and are trying to reassess your situation. Put it in a MM account and collect $700 a month right now in interest and wait for a good drop to jump into an index. Gamble on the interest money or let it accumulate. It's slower but you'll at least have guaranteed new money coming in instead of going out. $700 a month for a year is $8400, at today's rates. That's nice.",
