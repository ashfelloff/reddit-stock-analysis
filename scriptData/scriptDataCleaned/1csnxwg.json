I mean didn't we just have someone lose some insane amount of money a few months ago because he kept dumping it all into one stock at a time hoping it would work out and he was in his late twenties?

The other guy also had something like 250k in his twenties and was crying because he YOLO'd it multiple times and lost everything.  \n\nIf it works once, good on you.  If it works twice, you're fucking lucky.  I haven't seen a post on here where they didn't lose all of it on the third round.",

I didn’t do anything too atrocious, primarily thanks to my wife if I’m honest with myself. I spent most of the money on a home. However, I did bleed several hundred thousand over the next few years.  It’s “real” money, an amount that is extremely hard to save and you’ll be wishing you had it back when life expenses present themselves. I live in a HCOL area and while the win was certainly helpful, I didn’t miss a day of work or anything over it.  Additionally, I personally found myself becoming very obsessed with money, greed is ultimately a bottomless pit, it’s never enough and provides very little satisfaction in your day-to-day life. \n\nIf you want to do something aggressive, then do 43% UPRO and 57% EDV. However, with that amount of money, you’ll find 100% VOO will have  huge swings in comparison to your income and it’s a lot more tax/fee friendly.\n\nEdit: Just noticed your age. Literally do not fuck around with that amount of money, you’re rich if you put most of it in index funds and forget about it.  Also, I absolutely double down on the quit trading/gambling sentiment. The absolute best case scenario already occurred, you won. I’m one of the rare persons with a history of problem gambling that ultimately financially benefited. However, I’ll never get back all the years in my 20’s and 30’s I wasted in casinos/card rooms, failed relationships, preoccupation with and/or gambling instead of building healthy hobbies and relationships.
