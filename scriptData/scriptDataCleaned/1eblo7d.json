Only green item on my screen yesterday.  NOTHING else was green.  Amazing considering I thought my investments were relatively diversified.",

Still $30 off for that $230, it's not really worth shit right now since the stock price is at $260 so my plan is just hold and hope that CRWD falls off a cliff tomorrow since it's the last day of the trading week. Got as low as $251 today, I could absolutely see a big drop tomorrow -- but honestly who the fuck knows. We shall see.",

It was more expensive though because I bought it July 23rd, but at least I have some time. \n\nHoping it stays in the news as well. Latest Iâ€™m seeing is backlash over their $10 Uber eats vouchers they offered as compensation lol",
