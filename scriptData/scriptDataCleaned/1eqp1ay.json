I sorta wonder what went on in his brain to justify options once it hit 30$ but not at $16, $20, or even $25, i mean they had a decent earnings but don't know if it justifies that decision.",

If not higher. Pltr is the new stock everyone who made nvda explode in price is going to put their money. Pltr isn't a trillion dollar company, but the way they have been increasing their revenue over the last 5 years, they could certainly be 2 to 3 hundred billion dollar company.
