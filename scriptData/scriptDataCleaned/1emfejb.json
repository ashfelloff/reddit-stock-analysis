Only the Fine Print Can Save It, Experts Say\n\nAfter crashing millions of computers and disrupting businesses across the globe, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike must protect itself against a flurry of legal activity that is already beginning. The devil will be in the details.",

Though it may seem intuitive that CrowdStrike be on the hook for its mistake, the company is likely to be “pretty well-guarded” by the fine print, he adds.\n\n> The reality may ultimately be that, though CrowdStrike has conceded to causing the outage, and billions of dollars’ worth of damage was incurred, the cost will be borne predominantly by its customers and other affected businesses. Especially so if only a fraction of the costs are covered by cyber insurance, as has been reported.\n\nSeriously.\n\n*womp womp*",

But they issued a simple workaround within 30-90 minutes that any proper IT operation could perform.  It was a safe boot to bypass the faulty file.\n\nIf it takes an organization like Delta 9 days to reboot their systems, it means there is something brutally wrong with their system architecture, administration, operations or some combination of all three.  \n\nIt also indicates these organizations were already had a dangerous lack of preparedness.  If reboots caused them this much disruption, imagine if the cause had been serious or malicious or damaging or complex or didn’t have a simple and immediate fix.\n\nFor their part, Crowdstrike is responding to Delta’s lawsuit by asking them to preserve all records about what Delta did with those systems before and after.  They also stated they made numerous offers to send onsite experts to help Delta which were rejected.",

Large companies like Delta normally go through an RFP and Diligence process to assess risk with new vendors. If CrowdStrike told them they tested and staged releases in a certain way, and they didn't do that here, they could be in trouble.\n\nAlso, whether CrowdStrike took reasonable precautions in architecting their software based on what other companies do. Like you can't really blame them for having kernel access, which is necessary for anti-malware to be effective, and kernel level code is inherently risky. And you can't blame them from pushing out releases quickly when the whole point of their product is that everyone is protected against the latest threats.\n\nDisclaimer: IANAL but I've worked on many B2B contracts.",
