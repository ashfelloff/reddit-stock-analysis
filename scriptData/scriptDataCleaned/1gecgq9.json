With extensive subsidies and non-market practices leading to substantial risks of overcapacity, China’s exports of EVs grew by 70% from 2022 to 2023—jeopardizing productive investments elsewhere. A 100% tariff rate on EVs will protect American manufacturers from China’s unfair trade practices.\"*\n\nTesla would be finished if those tariffs were lifted.\n\nBut to be fair....... I wonder how well the Chinese EVs meet US standards of safety in crashes 'n so forth. Are they tested as well as other American, German and Japanese cars? My wife & kids were in an accident that totaled our Toyota, but nobody was hurt so now I've mandated that my wife always drive Toyota SUVs.
