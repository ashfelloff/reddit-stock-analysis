  "selftext": "Bought 0DTE 528P on SPY and was almost immediately up $7000 but soon following that missed exit was the infamous Infinipump that blew past my stop loss and my options didn‚Äôt even get a chance to sell (even with a .10 trail). Suddenly I was down $5K. Like a true regard, I then decided to turn off all stop losses and begin the journey of averaging down all day through the 529-530 chop. I got my average down from 1.06 to .25 through sheer determination and risking almost all of my bananas.\n\nAt 1500 hours, I was visibly sweating and aggressively yelling out prayer as theta was eating up my bag down to .08 per contract and my losses were at nearly 12K. I nearly pulled the trigger and exited with a hell of a tax write off. However, I saw a little hope that SPY would be giving us a nice sour hour selloff into the holiday weekend and MAG7 looked way overbought‚Ä¶ so I held four more minutes.\n\nI immediately fired off the sell button as soon as SPY did a sub-minute dollar drop off from 529.40 to 528.40 and my options were suddenly not only recovered, but decently green. Do you think I learned my lesson? Before you speculate whether I did or not, notice my usage of Robinhood‚Ä¶ my account will probably be zero by the end of the month.",

Whether a long term player or day trader, you need a sniper mindset. You only squeeze the trigger: when ALL of the details are in line. Don‚Äôt take random ‚Äòthis looks good‚Äô shots. Know WHY you are going to place a trade and how it is supposed to work out, PRIOR to execution.  And if it goes sideways on you, be VERY cognizant of your emotions and acceptable loss levels. \n\n3. Know your stop loss, stop limit marks and guard them. \n\n4. NEVER trade money you need, no matter what. \n\n5. Paper trade until you have consistent gains and minimal losses. \n\n6. Paper trade stocks first and build that consistency above, once you‚Äôre there, only then start paper trading options. \n\nThese are the basics. \n\nOr just give me your money, I‚Äôll gladly be the guy that takes the money from people who blow up accounts.",
