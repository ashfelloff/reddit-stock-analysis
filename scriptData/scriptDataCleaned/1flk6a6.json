Qualcomm has always been the best modem designers in the world, that and a bunch of dead guys' cell phone patents are the foundations of their business. But it freaked them out hard when Apple told them they were going to design their own modem and pivot away from them. \n\nThey bought the Apple M1 silicon team for a ton of money, those guys made a new CPU, and it kind of sucked. So they are sinking a lot of money into CPU design, to get not a lot of good results.\n\nIntel's digital design teams were stronger than Qualcomm's, and probably still are after billions of layoffs. My guess is QCOM wants those guys and those patents, and the rest of the business is cheap enough to just sell off.\n\nOwnership of the x86 patent library would be a huge regulatory hurdle, especially because QCOM owns almost all the foundational cellular patents. Regulators would worry about them building a Wintel-type lockin for cell phones.\n\n**ETA:** I'd also like to emphasize that this supposed merger doesn't look very plausible financially. Qualcomm's a $150B company by market cap, making $10B in profit a year. Intel is a $100B company, and it would probably take $60B to buy a controlling stake. The numbers don't pencil out well.",

But high chance even with government intervention, regulators in other countries would try to block it on grounds of antitrust unless White House plays hardball. There's also the problem with x86 license not being transferrable in the event a licensee gets acquired, which is what makes Intel valuable in the first place.\n\nThe better move I could see here is if GlobalFoundries and Micron approached Intel instead, both are US companies with their own fab so it'll jettison them forward if they can acquire Intel's IP. Problem is per agreement with AMD, the x86 license is not transferrable and pretty much why they have a duopoly(3rd licensee VIAcom is practically nonexistent), so there really aren't much value for companies to try and acquire Intel if they can't get their hands on the x86 license too.\n\nIt's either Intel declares Chapter 11 and fix the damn business by offloading assets and old IPs, or let them die so DOJ can immediately sue AMD to force them to revamp the x86 license terms to open up more slots.",
