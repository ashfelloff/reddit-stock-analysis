Besides that, Amtrak in the US operates mostly at a loss since the only profit center is the Northeast Corridor (Boston to DC). Also the reason why the only high speed rail is in that section currently until California gets its act together.\n\nThe problem with American Rail is that America is car centric and rail is an after thought.  Amtrak leases most of the rail traffic from freight companies like Union Pacific and CSX.  Since its government owned they \"could\" forcefully take over a lot of rail routes and lines, but that's not going to happen.  They also would need to get public approval and funding to make their own lines, which also isn't going to happen.  \n\nSo yeah, the best way to profit off of Amtrak is to buy freight rail instead since most of the money that should be going to commuter rail gets funneled off to freight anyway.",

Amtrak has like 30 million.\n\nIt *might* be a good growth stock, if it’s not 100% public, but DB manages a lot more of Germany’s rail.  Amtrak doesn’t cover regional trains which is where Deutsche Bahn has the most ridership.  If Amtrak moves into regional transit, it may be a good investment.  Railroads take forever to build, so growth will be slow.  I live in Northern California.  Bart spent probably ar least a decade working on their current expansion.  I think there are many Americans who would take the train if it was good.  \n\nBut really, the way rail works in the US isn’t gonna turn out a passenger giant like Deutsche Bahn.  Deutsche Bahn has commuter rail to thank for its size.  In the US, my understanding is that commuter rail is locally publically owned, and not part of Amtrak.  \n\nUS public transit is ass.  Anybody who can make it not-ass stands to make a lot of money.
