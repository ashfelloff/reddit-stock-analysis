They have a non-paywalled version for Google Bot, which uses it for SEO and the small excerpts you get in the search results. \n\n\nFor a long time, the only way you could verify that the Google Bot is the Google Bot, is to literally check if it says \"Yes, I am Google Bot\". Obviously *any* other application could simply say the same and get the free version as well. \n\n\nFor a while now though you can also verify the IP address the Google Bot is requesting from, and since Google has their own IP ranges, it cannot be faked either. A lot of websites haven't updated to this yet, though, but many have, which is why stuff like the 12ft ladder get less useful. \n\n\nBtw, I'm thankful I've never had to check IP ranges in my job. By the time your application is actually called, you're usually a few load balancers, caches and what not deep in your infrastructure, and literally all of them have slightly different ways to pass the IP information along. I pulled my hair out once and then simply said \"Well fuck it, let's make it public\"",

Monday will be Monday. \n\nThe best article I read recently suggested we're repeating the March to May cycle meaning there's just extreme volatility until it levels out in fall. In this climate, you need to adapt quickly and adjust your strike prices and expirations dates on the fly. Find you resistance points (whether it's for puts or calls) and play on those, but take profits and run (until volatility settles). Preferably avoid any plays where you're holding long unless you're just buying equities at bargain prices.\n\nI made money on calls last week, others made money on puts. Both are possible. I have a lot of cash on reserve for big dips and have some short term calls in case there's a strong open. If it falls, that's just a new buy in opportunity for me.",

Let's assume you will sell if the stock drops to $280 to preserve capital. Then you could buy $285 puts for a premium of say $5, and not accounting for fees and taxes, you'd end up netting $280 for each share sold when you exercised your put options.",

          "body": "options contract just give you the right to buy or sell 100 shares at a certain strike price. So if you buy a $200 strike nvda put with a breakeven of 198 and the price drops to 190 then you can excercise the option and receive 100 shares at 190 or sell the contract for a gain of the current Share Price X 100 . So in this case your break even is 198 and on expiration the stock price is 190 so your profit would be 100 (shares) x $8 = $800. This is general and doesnt include premium that is attached to these contracts the more in favor your option becomes when you still have a lot of time premium attached to the option(time before exp). The reason your profit is only $8 a share instead of $10/share is because you are paying a premium when you buy the option which will affect the actual breakeven price. In this case you are paying $2/share in premium when you purchase the option. This is why 0dtes are cheaper than weeklies - the value of the time premium on 0Dtes is much lower because the percentage chance of your option expiring itm is lower than the odds your option will expire otm and be worthless. The actual point of options when created and before retail got really involved in the market was to use them to hedge your position with an insurance bet to cover losses. This was done by buying otm puts or selling covered calls using 100 of your shares as collateral if you are bearish or vice versa if bullish. if you own the equity already then its usually a smarter play to sell calls deep otm and slowly accumulate cash via premium. When a option expires out of the money then the seller of the option keeps all of the sales price of the option(which is called premium). If the option were to expire itm on your equity backed covered options then you must provide the 100 shares to the brokerage, who pay you whatever the strike price you sold was on exp - so they can then sell the shares to the other party.",
