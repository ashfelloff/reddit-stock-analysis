  "selftext": "Selected Excerpts:\n\n> “After testing the first beta version of Apple Intelligence myself, I can tell you that the features don’t yet live up to the excitement. In their current state, they’re a far cry from the game-changing technology that fans and investors hope Apple Intelligence will become.”\n\n> “You even see some analysts describing it as **a breakthrough akin to the original iPhone.”**\n\n> “Let me be clear: At this point, Apple Intelligence isn’t that.”\n\n> Now, it’s true that this is just the first beta release and the company will undoubtedly improve it over the next few months. But I suspect that we’re seeing a fairly good picture of what Apple Intelligence will look like when it debuts around October. \n\n> “I found the ability to summarize emails to be useful: It provided an excellent distillation of the message’s content. This is particularly a perk for message previews, which typically just show the first few lines of an email. But the summaries of text message conversations — particularly for fast-moving group chats — were a disappointment and mostly useless. Summaries are also helpful in Safari for articles, but I don’t foresee that being a particularly popular feature. “\n\n> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”\n\n> “The most impressive features so far are Writing Tools, Type to Siri and phone-call recording summaries. The Writing Tools are essentially a well-integrated version of Grammarly-style features. It works nicely, but this is the kind of thing that’s been available on Android phones for a while now.”\n\n> “I was less impressed with the reply suggestions in Messages, which don’t immediately seem like a major upgrade over the existing keyboard suggestions in iOS. They could be a lot more thoughtful, perhaps by better using the context of the chat so far, rather than just the last message in the thread.”\n\n> “The best feature is the ability to record a phone call and get a transcript of the conversation as well as a summary of what took place. In my tests, this has worked almost flawlessly, and the summaries have been excellent. It’s certainly a nice time saver.”\n\n> “Type to Siri is also a nice upgrade, as is the new visual cue that Siri is active on the iPhone, iPad and CarPlay. But neither of those interface improvements has anything to do with AI.”\n\n> “In any case, these are mainly niceties, not necessities.”\n\n> “There is nothing so compelling yet that would make an iPhone 14 Pro user upgrade to an iPhone 16 just for Apple Intelligence.”\n\n> “Some key Apple Intelligence features aren’t in the initial beta. [Such as AI PHOTO APP and OS-INTEGRATED CHATGPT.] These latter capabilities will likely come in November or December. \n\n> “Users will have to wait until 2025 to see the fully revamped Siri.”\n\n> “But even when [these delayed features of] Apple Intelligence [are] available, the company will still be playing catch-up. Alphabet Inc.’s Google is miles ahead of Apple in applying AI to photos.”\n\n> “Apple’s effort still **feels like a response** to the AI revolution being advanced by Google, OpenAI, Meta, and Microsoft Corp.”",

          "body": "The combination of technological improvements in 2018, increased accessibility, heightened public awareness, and affordability has driven the recent popularity of AI models. These models were not as easily accessible or capable in the past, which is why their popularity has surged only recently. With this in mind, I do believe there is significant potential for technological advancements and transformations across many aspects of society, which meets the criteria to be considered a revolution. Here are some reasons to back my opinion.\n\nUbiquity: AI will likely become increasingly integrated into everyday life, from personal assistants to tools that help with education, work, and healthcare. AI could become as commonplace as smartphones are today, providing support across a wide range of tasks.\n\n Automation: Many industries are likely to undergo significant changes as AI automates routine tasks. This could increase efficiency but may also lead to shifts in the job market, requiring new skills and adaptation.\n\nInnovation: AI will drive innovation in fields such as medicine, finance, and engineering by analyzing large datasets, optimizing processes, and even discovering new materials or drugs.\n\nRegulation: Governments and organizations may need to develop new regulations to manage the impact of AI, ensuring it benefits society while mitigating potential risks.\n\n Human-AI Collaboration: AI is likely to evolve as a tool that augments human abilities rather than replacing them. Collaborative AI could enhance creativity, problem-solving, and decision-making across various domains.\n\nEducation and Skills Development: There will be a growing need for education systems to adapt, teaching new skills that allow people to work effectively with AI and harness its potential.\n \nSocietal Changes: The widespread adoption of AI could lead to societal changes, such as shifts in how we work, communicate, and even understand our own identities in relation to intelligent systems..\n\nIn summary, the future of AI holds both exciting possibilities and complex challenges. The ongoing revolution is likely to redefine industries, economies, and nations.",
