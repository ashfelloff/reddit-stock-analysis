  "selftext": "Peloton’s stationary bikes will soon sell at Costco’s stores and on its website as the beleaguered fitness company looks for new ways to reach younger and affluent customers, Peloton is set to announce Tuesday.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, Costco will offer Peloton’s Bike+ in 300 of its U.S. stores for $1,999, and on Costco.com for $2,199 between Nov. 1 and Feb. 15. It is a steep discount from the typical price of the Bike+, which is selling on Peloton’s website for $2,495. It is unclear how the price will compare to any holiday promotions Peloton plans to offer. \n\nThe new partnership comes during a state of transition for Peloton, which is being led by two board members after its former CEO Barry McCarthy stepped down earlier this year.\n\nLong focused on growth at all costs, Peloton has turned its sights to profitability and has had to become more creative as it tries to reach new users.\n\nAs sales fall and losses mount, Peloton is looking for cheaper ways to attract new customers. Costco is one way to get there, Dion Camp Sanders, Peloton’s chief emerging business officer, told CNBC in an interview. \n\n“We’ve been able to architect a deal with Costco that meets our needs with regard to profitable, sustainable unit economics, while at the same time delivering robust and clear value to Costco members,” said Camp Sanders. “We’ve structured this deal with Costco to both meet our needs for profitable, sustainable growth and getting us access to Costco’s very large net incremental audience.” \n\nCamp Sanders said Peloton’s partnership with Costco is only for a limited time because fitness is a seasonal category for the company, but Peloton hopes to keep building on the relationship and perhaps expand it to future locations both in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nThe deal with Costco gets Peloton onto the shelves of a retailer with a strong fan following and wealthier customers. The membership-based club has gained popularity as shoppers across all incomes prioritize value and try to get more for their money with bulk packs and private-label items.\n\nAs of Sept. 1, store traffic at Costco had increased 31% compared with the same period in pre-pandemic 2019, according to Placer.ai, an analytics company that estimates visits to locations based on smartphone data. \n\nCostco’s members are also getting younger. Those consumers prioritize health and wellness — and are willing to invest in it — in ways that older generations do not. \n\nAbout half of Costco’s new membership sign-ups last fiscal year came from people who were under 40 years old, and the average age of its 76 million members has fallen since the Covid-19 pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said on an earnings call in late September. \n\nAccording to Numerator, 36% of Costco’s customers have a household income of more than $125,000. Numerator has a panel of 150,000 U.S. consumers that is balanced to be representative of the country’s population.\n\nCamp Sanders said Costco’s members “have the disposable income to be able to afford our premium products,” and their lifestyles align with what Peloton offers. \n\n“Many of Peloton’s members are affluent, they often have larger homes in the suburbs and they also have life situations where Peloton fits a clear need,” said Camp Sanders. “Many Costco members are juggling families, they maybe have a busy career … and they’ve got the space in their home” to build their own gyms, he continued. \n\nCostco’s Executive Vice President of Merchandising Claudine Adamo declined to comment to CNBC.\n\nPeloton already sells its workout equipment through Amazon and Dick’s Sporting Goods, but has also been working to develop relationships with other companies that cater to similar customer bases. \n\nFor example, hundreds of Hyatt Hotel properties have Peloton equipment on site. As of this month, hotel members can earn points for completing workouts on the Peloton Bike and Row during their stay. \n\nIt also announced a deal with Truemed — the PayPal of the health savings account and flexible spending account world — that allows Peloton members to use pretax earnings to buy certain hardware products, including the Bike, Bike+ and Tread.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/22/peloton-costco-partner-to-sell-bike-for-2024-holiday.html",

For some people, a month of classes with a sub fee that’s the same as one single in person class, that is great deal for them.  And peloton apparently allows 2 users on a sub I think, so it works well for couples.  It doesn’t matter if 98% of the population hates them, they can make bank selling $40 subs to the people that don’t.\n\nI would never pay it, but there are millions of people who like to have a trainer, a coach, an instructor yelling at them.  Peloton fills that niche.\n\nAnyway, for those of us invested our thesis is peloton should get out of building and shipping and selling hardware and focus on the subscription since that’s working well.  We like when we hear things about them lowering their inventory of bikes.\n\nSo my knee jerk read of this announcement is mixed.  Yes, it’s encouraging to have such a prominent distribution partner, but essentially it could be seen as getting back into the danger zone of building and selling hardware again.",

Sometimes (often?) when a stock has giant move like that, all of the buyers of the last several years are solid green and they tend to take profit.  Long term bag holders sometimes take the opportunity to dump their holding too.\n\nI am looking to generate gains in this tax year, so I have been looking to sell it if an opportunity arose, and I didn’t want to gamble with it falling back and have to sell at a lower price in December.  I know full well that it could continue to surge today or next week, but I can live with that.  \n\nSo for me it’s not about whether PTON is worth this price, but that this was my long term target when I was buying it under $3.  \n\nSince then, they’ve apparently gotten more sensible about their overall business plan, established a partnership with COSTCO, affirmed the stable subscription business, lined up the next CEO, and gotten an endorsement from a hedge fund legend who has a hot hand (David Einhorn)\n\nThe CEO choice is tantalizing because Apple has been rumoured as a potential buyer of Peloton.  Apple buys companies this size all the time.  Apple is to increase their seeking subscription business.  Apple is trying to make Health and fitness their thing.  So naming an Apple Fitness guy as CEO just supercharges hopes that Apple could buy it.\n\nIf PTON drops in the near future, I’ll scoop it up again.  It’s a lot less risky than it was, and is looking more viable as a takeover target too.  If it shoots up from here I’d have to do some hard figuring to decide what price is attractive.",

The real business model of peloton is $40 monthly subscriptios, and that part works quite well.  \n\nThe people trying to save the company have been getting out of the hardware/e-tail/inventory because it’s money losing death for them.  \n\nMy guess is this is not about profit margin on the bike at all, but growing the number of subs.  Even without sub growth, the core subscription model has surprisingly healthy numbers.",
