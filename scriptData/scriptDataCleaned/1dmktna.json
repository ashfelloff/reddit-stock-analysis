I'm not saying that there won't be some way to monetize it in the future, but the number of people willing to pay a subscription for any AI service is going to be relatively low for the foreseeable future. It's going to be especially difficult to monetize through subscriptions because there are multiple competitors that all offer their services for free right now, so unless they collude on pricing at some unspecified point in the future consumers will just drop them like a rock for the best free alternative.",

It's no different than a marketing cost or an acquisition cost to these tech companies. Hell META sold their VR headsets at a significant loss.

If someone figures out a way to monetize chat bots when they are giving results for free, then maybe, but until then it just isn't happening. I honestly don't think general purpose large language models are going to ever be profitable on a wide scale in a direct to consumer model.
