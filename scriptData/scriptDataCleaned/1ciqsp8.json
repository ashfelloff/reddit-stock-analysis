There are various reason it can increase value, but the net effect (in a vacuum) is 1:1.\n\nYour dividend example actually proves the point I'm making. When a company pays a dividend, they pay it out of money in their account. They are literally transferring money from them (share value) to you. People get confused because when companies announced dividends, the stock sometimes goes up. But the announcement is irrelevant. It's the dividend date that matters. All things being equal, stocks actually go down when they pay the dividend. This is what you might see on finance pages as the ex-dividend date. \n\nIn fact, some options strategies actually sell covered calls before a company's ex-dividend date to capitalize on the upcoming drop in share price to profit from the covered call sale.\n\n[Ex-Dividend Dates: Understanding Dividend Risk | Charles Schwab](https://www.schwab.com/learn/story/ex-dividend-dates-understanding-dividend-risk#:~:text=With%20dividends%2C%20the%20stock%20price,on%20the%20ex%2Ddividend%20date.&text=Remember%2C%20the%20ex%2Ddividend%20date,day%20before%20the%20record%20date.)",

But it is simple math. \n\nIf a company has a regular profit of $100 and has 100 shares, then each share is worth $1 of profit. If a company takes its profit and then buys back 10 shares, that leaves 90 shares. If next year the company also has $100 in profit, those 90 shares now own $1.11 in profit. Each share gets a larger cut of the profit. \n\nThis isn't about the company, this is about the shareholders. A stock buyback is a company buying out some of the owners of the company. It is essentially like if you started a business with 3 people (4 people total including you), this means everyone has 25% ownership. Then 1 guy wants out. The other 3 people then buy out the 1 guys equity leaving all 3 of the owners with 33% ownership. \n\nAs long as you still believe that the company will cash flow, you now have a higher share of those profits.",

The company is not going to be worth 100 dollars, it will be worth maybe 2000 dollars (assuming a 20 p/e ratio which means investors predict the company will remain profitable for around 20 years). 2000 dollars is the companys current net assets + (future lifetime earnings/interest) - current financial liabilities/debt. A buyback does not change this inherent value per share. Because the entire valuation falls as you have less net assets now.\n\nOr another way of explaining is Apple could have used the buyback money and bought S and P 500 and collected the 10% increase per year to give to shareholders, increasing its profits.",

The headphone industry is highly competitive so I’m not expecting Apple to dominate it since it has no competitive advantage outside of its own ecosystem which other ecosystems can do if you watch a YT vid on how. \n\nIf iPhone 16 flops then it’ll signal a reduction in customer loyalty and thus a hit on Apple’s competitive advantage.",
