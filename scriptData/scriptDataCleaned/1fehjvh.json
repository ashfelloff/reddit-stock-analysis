  "selftext": "Key Quotes From Article:\n\n• \"Nvidia leans heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for production of its most important chips and does so because that company is the best in its field by a large margin, Huang said. But geopolitical tension has raised risks. China sees TSMC’s home island as a rogue province, stoking concerns that it might try to reclaim the territory. That could potentially cut off Nvidia from the key supplier.\"\n\n• \"We're trying to do the best we can.\" - Jensen Huang\n\n• \"the company counts on a small number of customers — data center operators like Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. — for much of its revenue.\"",
