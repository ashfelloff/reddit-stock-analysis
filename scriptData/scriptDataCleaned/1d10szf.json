There's just enough of a tiny moat in certain groups of users that it will at least take quite a while for it to die, assuming they don't do anything to turn it around. The same can be said word for word about Slack but Slack is also doing OK - I guess people can argue they are around now only because of CRM, but the reality is while they don't have the brightest future, they also aren't facing imminent death or anywhere close to it. \n\nI'm away from either of these stocks, but if I HAD to bet on something, I'd take a small long position, not expecting it to ever reach its past peaks again. I expect zoom to have some life to it before dying out, and look to sell opportunistically on any kind of run up with a buy back or some kind of positive  event / news.\n\nAnother comment puts it quite well https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1d10szf/will_zoom_ever_be_okay_again/l5x0tyv/",
