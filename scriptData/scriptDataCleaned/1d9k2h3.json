I wanted to see if I could get your opinion.\n\nFrom what I see for ORCL, there's a lot of hype around their AI initiatives which has been carrying them well. They have beaten their EPS and guidance for the past few quarters. For the one quarter they didn't, the stock tanked hard. But given the current demand and Oracle's deep involvement in AI, I feel like it should be going up rather than down.\n\nAnd Adobe is something I’m also looking at. They've consistently beaten EPS estimates and their AI-powered tools, like Adobe Sensei, are driving growth. Adobe's strong market position in digital media and its recent product updates have been well-received. Given their track record, I feel they have good potential.\n\nWhat do you think?",
