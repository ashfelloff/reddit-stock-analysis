And this is increasing every quarter with a extremely hig rate and makes them profitable. \nThe weight loss drug only made 20M of their whole revenue in the last quarter review.\nI have the opinion that the drug loss should be seen as a \"side hustle\" to make some additional profit but never as their main revenue growth. So don't judge this stock by the news about drug loose medicine.",

If they do then this next part is inaccurate.\n\nHIMS will set you up with someone to make getting the script easier. It probably makes it a lot easier to tell a doctor you don't regularly see \"I need help getting hard\". Or, I want to talk about my hair loss. I think I lot of people don't want to have that conversation in person and at a doctors office they see a lot. \n\nPlus, a lot of people don't see doctors so if you need an actual script from Amazon that requires you to go see someone.\n\nBut maybe Amazon does it virtually too and my whole comment is pointless",
