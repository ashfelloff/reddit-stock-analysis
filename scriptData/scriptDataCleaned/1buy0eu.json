While it is good that the EUV tools are unharmed, this letter does not mention how much scrap the earthquake caused (which won‚Äôt be public anyways, more of a customer conversation). For those unfamiliar, wafers take ~3+ months to completely process through a fab. At certain points in the line, wafers can get scrapped due to excessive waiting (queue time) for the next step from native oxide growth. With 20% of unspecified tools down, I expect a lot of scrap from the tools impacted directly during the quake and in the queue time aftermath. This isn‚Äôt like a normal manufacturing line where shutting a tool down temporarily is manageable. In the semiconductor world, it‚Äôs a lot harder.\n\nThere‚Äôs a lot of other things I could mention about what could be going wrong right now with these fabs because there are SO MANY moving parts, but a 3 paragraph letter doesn‚Äôt cover the extent of it. Yes, TSMC is prepared for earthquakes, but you can only prepare so much. One gas line rupture and the whole fab can get taken out. Quality will take a hit. Production output will take a hit.

Like if the government tells TSMC \"We need to cut your water supply\" then they can shut things down in a controlled manner. When the equipment turns back on it needs to be requalified for things like particles but it's not that bad aside from the lost production time. \n\nFor an earthquake though? Now you are talking about uncontrolled shutdowns, components that have been physically damaged, dangerous chemicals that may or may not find exciting ways to leak etc. Not only that but the problems caused by an earthquake are going to be different from the problems they normally have to troubleshoot. Like for example if a piece of equipment goes down for preventative maintenance and then doesn't pass qual when it comes back up you have a good frame of reference for what needs to be investigated. If it goes down during processing you have lots of logs and historical data you can compare to to isolate the cause and also you can rule out a ton of stuff that wouldn't just suddenly go bad during processing. An earthquake on the other hand is a giant question mark for what is actually broken, and *every* tool hitting problems at the same exact time is a nightmare.",
