The barrier to entry in their industry is near impossible, they have a backlog of 5 years worth of plane orders that matches what Airbus has, meaning they realistically just can’t deliver on already existing demand. It’s also the modern day “too big to fail” equivalent, they will get bailed out by the government if anything goes wrong.\n\nIf WWIII breaks out, this shit is going to the moon also.",

The top preaches safety, open doors, compassion etc, but as that filters its way to middle management, it mutates into 'harder, faster, more, more more.\" If KPIs are not reduced as a response to the toxic workplace, then nothing ever changes.\n\nI used to be in a leadership spot for a top 5 LTL carrier. They always preached the same BS as everyone else, safety, quality, quantity (in that order) but would write sups up for too many late departures. So what do you think happens, safety and quality are ignored for quantity.  Old Dominion was slapped with a $75m judgement in late 2021 for not diagraming and manifesting hazmat on its trailer leading to injury. 3 years later, the same thing is going on. Hazmat still traveling unmanifested. The carrier i used to work for, it was common to open 2-4 trailers each day and find hazmat that made it to us that still showed at the origin point. The solution? Force it over and keep it moving. Do not contact the origin terminal, do not report the miss. \n\nMetrics need to be reduced in order to keep quality up. But when the order of the day is to operate as thinly as possible, keeping your entire staff at a level of task saturation that cannot be sustained, your staff will cut every corner possible because all it takes is one meeting with an employee over how they arent fast enough because they dont care and the work ethic of the entire facility will shift negatively.\n\nCustomers need to re-learn how to wait. This \"I NEED IT 4 MONTHS AGO!\" attitude is why shit breaks all the time.",
