  "selftext": "  \n**Globalstar Q3 Earnings Highlights:**\n\n* **Revenue Beat**: Globalstar exceeded expectations with $72.3M in Q3 revenue, 19.5% above the $60.5M estimate, driven primarily by high-margin wholesale capacity services.\n* **Record EBITDA**: Adjusted EBITDA rose 34% year-over-year, reaching a record high and signaling improved operational efficiency.\n* **FCC Approval**: The FCC granted a 15-year extension, allowing Globalstar to operate up to 26 additional satellites, supporting long-term service capabilities and growth potential.\n* **Emergency Service Resilience**: Maintained reliable service during Hurricanes Helene and Milton, demonstrating the robustness of their satellite network in critical conditions.\n* **Apple Partnership**: On November 1, Globalstar announced an expanded $1.1 billion partnership with Apple to support satellite-to-cellular connectivity for iPhone 14 and newer models. This service, known as Emergency SOS via satellite, allows iPhone users to send text messages to emergency services when outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage by connecting directly to Globalstar's low Earth orbit satellites. This crucial feature provides users access to emergency help even in remote areas. The expanded agreement includes an equity stake for Globalstar and is set to enhance the capacity and reliability of the Emergency SOS service, strengthening Globalstar's presence in the consumer tech and satellite communications space.\n\n**Summary**: With strong financials, strategic partnerships, and regulatory approvals, Globalstar is well-positioned for sustained growth. The expanded Apple partnership and FCC approvals further reinforce their standing in satellite communications and emergency services[.](https://imgur.com/a/E79HX5U)\n\n**Source** \\- [https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results](https://investors.globalstar.com/news-releases/news-release-details/globalstar-announces-third-quarter-2024-financial-results)",
