Loss after loss after loss.\n\nShifted my strategy to options that are ‚Äúsafer,‚Äù also I stopped attempting to earn large returns, I sold after 10% returns on average.\n\nMy main strategy was SPY calls, I would wait for a quick sell off, and buy in. If it went against me, I would buy more. Cut loses at 25%.\n\nI would buy calls depending on how i perceived sentiment. I strongly believe what makes a trader successful, is if he or she can effectively gauge sentiment. Not lines on a chart and dumb shit like ‚Äúbollinger bands.‚Äù\n\nI do not consider myself a successful trading overall, but I can say that sentiment is everything.\n\nMy strategy will work until it doesn‚Äôt.",
