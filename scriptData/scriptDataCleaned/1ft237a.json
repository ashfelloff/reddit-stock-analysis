But we are not on any preset course,” he told the National Association for Business Economics in prepared remarks. “The risks are two-sided, and we will continue to make our decisions meeting by meeting.”*\r  \n\r  \n*The remarks come less than two weeks after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee approved the half percentage point, or 50 basis point, reduction in the Fed’s key overnight borrowing rate.*\r  \n\r  \n*Though markets had been largely expecting the move, it was unusual in that the Fed historically has only moved in such large increments during events such as the Covid pandemic in 2020 and the global financial crisis in 2008.*\r  \n\r  \n*Addressing the decision, Powell said it reflected policymakers’ belief that it was time for a “recalibration” of policy that better reflected current conditions. Beginning in March 2022, the Fed began fighting surging inflation; policymakers of late have shifted their attention to a labor market that Powell characterized as “solid” though it has “clearly cooled over the last year.”*\r  \n\r  \n*“That decision reflects our growing confidence that, with an appropriate recalibration of our policy stance, strength in the labor market can be maintained in an environment of moderate economic growth and inflation moving sustainably down to our objective,” Powell said.*\r  \n\r  \n*“We do not believe that we need to see further cooling in labor market conditions to achieve 2 percent inflation,” added Powell, who gave no outward indication of where he sees the next move going.*\r  \n\r  \n*Powell’s assertion that the Fed has not predetermined policy is in keeping with past statements.*\r  \n\r  \n*Futures market pricing is indicating that the Fed is more likely to move cautiously at its Nov. 6-7 meeting and approve a quarter-point reduction. However, traders see the December move as a more aggressive half-point cut.*\r  \n\r  \n*For his part, Powell expressed confidence in economic strength and sees inflation continuing to cool.*\r  \n\r  \n*Inflation during August was around 2.2% annually, according to the Fed’s preferred consumer price expenditures prices index released Friday. While that is close to the central bank’s 2% goal, core inflation, which excludes gas and groceries, was still running at a 2.7% pace. Policymakers usually consider core inflation as a better guide for longer-run trends being that food and energy prices are more volatile than many other items.*\r  \n\r  \n*Perhaps the most stubborn area of inflation has been housing-related costs, which rose another 0.5% in August. However, Powell said he believes the data eventually will catch up with easing prices for rent renewals.*\r  \n\r  \n*“Housing services inflation continues to decline, but sluggishly,” he said. “The growth rate in rents charged to new tenants remains low. As long as that remains the case, housing services inflation will continue to decline. Broader economic conditions also set the table for further disinflation.”*\r  \n\r  \n*Following the speech, Powell was scheduled to sit for a question-and-answer session with Morgan Stanley economist Ellen Zentner.*",

For instance, on the conservative/libertarian side, you can easily make the argument that \"total benefits\" are a large cause, where large portions of wage increases are simply being swallowed up by larger health insurance premiums employers are covering behind the scenes.  Or that marriage isn't as common, so greater numbers of single person households are weighing down the household income numbers.  Most left-leaning sources I've found never take into account job benefits at all, and also tend to zero in on income classes rather than total dollars.  All-in-all I feel both sides likely have points to be made and the truth likely lies somewhere in the middle (wages haven't been horribly stagnant, but they also haven't fully kept up).",

                      "body": "that's not true at all. Most goods decline in price over time. Televisions, computers, etc. - pretty much all electronics either get cheaper or you get massively more for the same price. It's the process of commidification, where any industry left to competiting forces will drive profit margins down as low as they can go, and hence price should get cheaper (or quality better for the same price). \n\nAnd many goods due to global shipping are cheaper than ever. I bougth a pair of glasses off firmdoo for about 80% less than I could get in Canada, and they are good quality. \n\nAnyway, I'll never understand why inflation is measured annually. Or rather, why a 12-month measure is more relevant than a 6-month or 12 month or 24-month measure. \n\nIn the end, average people know they are being bullshitted when you tell them inflation is 2% but the price of their coffee is up 100%. I get the 12-month very selective basket of goods is at 2%, but that's not the **real inflation** people are paying out there.",

I can agree politicians should explain it better when they talk about it and that Biden seems to be hiding a bit behind the \"technically correct\" terms but Powell? Cmon now",
