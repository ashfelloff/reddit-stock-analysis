  "score": 415,
  "selftext": "Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has kicked off its Advancing AI keynote, with Chief Executive Lisa Su taking the stage to preview the company’s latest innovations.\n\nThis event proved a major catalyst for AMD’s stock last year, with shares [rising 10% in the session following the event](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amds-stock-has-a-big-catalyst-on-the-horizon-can-it-live-up-to-the-hype-1a9e52b5?mod=article_inline) before going on a strong run through the end of the year. Investors may be hopeful that this year’s version will wind up a similar driver of stock momentum, especially since AMD shares have risen just 16% so far this year, ahead of the event, trailing the S&P 500.\n\n[](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/spx?mod=article_chiclet)\n\nAMD is looking to get a bigger piece of the massive budgets being thrown toward artificial-intelligence hardware. Nvidia Corp. is by far the market leader, but analysts see room for multiple companies to win given the size of the opportunity.\n\nSu seemed to hint at that in her keynote presentation. “There’s no one company that has every answer,” she said, noting that AMD hopes to stand out in part through its embrace of open industry standards.\n\nCompanies need “the right compute for the right applications,” she said, adding that AMD has “the best portfolio in the industry to address end-to-end AI,” in her view.\n\nSu opened by showing off the company’s new fifth-generation Epyc server central-processing unit for cloud, enterprise and AI use cases. The product, nicknamed Turin, offers up to four times more throughput performance.\n\nAmin Vahdat, the vice president for machine learning, systems and cloud AI at Google, came onstage to discuss the product and praise the performance per watt with AMD offerings.",

It’s not game changing money but I’m 28 and it’s my Roth IRA so it’ll grow and grow. Though I’m pretty tempted to buy some more for my brokerage account just because it makes so much and never seems to really go down. \n\nIt’s incredible that one company is achieving dividends like that and it looks like they’ve been pretty consistent as well. For a Canadian it definitely seems like potentially the smarter one but actually maybe not cause in 3 months that’s 99 cents to the 66 cents of Endbridge and 15% tax does give you a few cents more with PDI.",

Nvidia has been working at this for close to a decade and AMD is trying to catch up in 2-3 years, - and they definitely trying. While, AMD's Si and Packaging are equal if not ahead of Nvidia, they're behind in system level solutions and a software platform capable of getting the performance out of their GPUs.  Their objective with Mi3XX is to develop both of these while essentially holding on to dear life. Mi4XX will be a step change and more competitive with Nvidia. I expect AMD to continue on their path, with little surprises. They'll hit their numbers and slightly guide upwards repeat Q after Q. End of 2025 through 2026 we might see bigger changes.",

These wall street types fundamentally misunderstand how this tech has been developed around, and optimized for nvidia's architecture.  They think that one day AMD can just plop out a competitive GPU and all of a sudden the big tech companies fighting amongst themselves to buy nvidia products will suddenly become AMD customers.  It's not how it works.  They see the most marginal of growth in their enterprise CPUs and seem to genuinely believe AMD is a viable competitor in this space to Intel.  In the real world no one tasked with ordering new hypervisors specs AMD powered equipment.  Sure, a one-off Datto backup appliance may be AMD powered, but no one's racks are full of AMD powered hypervisors- outside of some niche cloud compute instance types powered by AMD.\n\nI guess there aren't that many ex-sysadmins on Wall Street.  Oh well, their ignorance just bought me a new car so I can't really complain.   :)",
