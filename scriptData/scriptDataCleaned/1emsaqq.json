      "body": "That’s easy to say in hindsight. Draw a line straight across starting around 2000-2001.  The market didn’t really go anywhere for almost 10 years after the .com and 2008 crashes.  That decade was rough and a long slog. That hyperbolic gain after 2011 ish is simply because of the the fed printing fuck tons of money and ZIRP.  That era is over.  The 2010s are bullshit fake wealth created out of thin air from nothing simply because of central bank manipulation.  They only allowed stocks to go up during that era. But they can’t keep doing it now because of record breaking govt debt and inflation. Watch as we bounce around 5300 - 6000 for the sandp500 over the entire next decade with minor gains to be had. The 2010s are an anomaly.  People are going to be in for a rude awakening thinking this chart will continue into the 2030s.  The 2030s are gonna look more like 2000-2010.",
