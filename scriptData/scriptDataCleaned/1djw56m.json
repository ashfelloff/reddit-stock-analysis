If you say I'd buy more NVDA calls then it makes no sense to exit your position now.",

If you want to maintain exposure in this stock, then you could either roll out or roll up, which is where you first sell to close this $80 option, and then buy another call at a later or same strike date and a strike price. You could also exercise this if you have the capital at the strike date or just sell to close your entire position right now and get that little bit of theta value. I would just hold tbh and see where nvda goes. You are in a good spot. You can always stc a couple.",

          "body": "Rolling an option is just putting in a sell order on your option and a buy order on a different option for the same stock at the exact same time. So just exchanging your option for a different, similar one.\n\nYou can roll up, down, in, or out. For calls, rolling up is increasing the strike price on the same date (like $120->$140). Down is decreasing the strike price. Rolling in is moving the expiry date sooner (like 6/28 to 6/21), rolling out is moving the expiry date later. \n\nFor all options, rolling out will cost you money, while rolling in will give you cash. Rolling up will give you cash for a call and down will cost money. Puts give you cash with down and cost money with up.\n\nSo for calls already in the money, it can make sense to roll them up. That gives you money to lock in profits, while keeping the same strike date and usually only slightly lowering potential gains. As an example, I rolled a $124 call for this Friday to a $127 call on the same date sometime last week and got $200 credit to my account for doing so.",
