  "title": "Will Nvidia suffer due to increased tensions with China?",
  "score": 222,
  "selftext": "I want to be clear this is not a political post. Not looking for political opinions.\n\n  \nPost-January, we're likely to be entering a period of increased tensions with China. This seems bad for Nvidia in multiple ways.\n\n1. Beijing has previously expressed desire to urgently switch away from NVDA chips and invest locally. Obviously that's easier said than done, but with China being such a huge market for NVDA, increased tensions over tariffs could push this mandate further. The amount of revenue NVDA gets from China has already decreased, but this further deceleration could be negative. [https://archive.is/v40zX](https://archive.is/v40zX)\n\n  \n2. Trump has accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. He wants to put tariffs on chips from Taiwan. Obviously, everyone is relying on TSMC, so this seems clearly bad news. [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/trump-accuses-taiwan-of-stealing-us-chip-business-on-joe-rogan-podcast.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/trump-accuses-taiwan-of-stealing-us-chip-business-on-joe-rogan-podcast.html)\n\n  \nI'm completely open to being told I'm wrong and being called a moron, but please don't spam downvote if you disagree with my take. This is a popular stock on this subreddit, and others will have similar posts. \n\n\n\nLet's just get this discussion over with now, yeah?",

You may see that happen again on the 20th this month, because some people feel absolutely confident that there's going to be a blowout earnings with Blackwell hardware, but we're being told that it's probably going to be quarter two or quarter three of fiscal 2026 before we see blowout earnings because of Blackwell shipments. That doesn't mean it doesn't meet expectations of everyone, and that doesn't mean the company isn't still growing, and that doesn't mean that the company did not grow for that quarter. It usually means that there are a bunch of greedy people that are invested and they expected 40% of growth but only got 20% for that quarter. It's literally about that dumb.",

                                  "body": ">During his first term, Trump oversaw a substantial increase in H-1B visa denials and Requests for Evidence (RFEs), leading to heightened uncertainty for high-skilled workers. From 2016 to 2020, H-1B denial rates averaged around 18%, compared to only 3.2% under the Biden administration. Similarly, the rate of RFEs nearly tripled under Trump, from around 12% to a peak of 34%.\n\n>H-4 visa holders—spouses of H-1B workers—are also expected to face challenges. The Obama-era rule that allowed H-4 spouses to work was previously targeted for elimination by Trump officials. In 2018, former USCIS Director Francis Cissna confirmed plans to “remove H-4 dependent spouses from the class of aliens eligible for employment authorization.” While this rule wasn’t ultimately rescinded, legal experts anticipate renewed attempts to restrict H-4 work authorization, either by removing it altogether or by making the process more burdensome. For example, the Trump administration previously added redundant steps that extended processing times for H-4 employment authorization documents (EADs), turning a process that typically takes just minutes into one that could last a year.\n\n>Optional Practical Training (OPT), a program that allows international students to work in the U.S. for 12 months (with an additional 24-month extension for STEM graduates), might also face scrutiny. Stephen Miller, a senior advisor in the Trump administration, previously tried to restrict OPT and eliminate the STEM extension. Though he faced resistance from within the administration, Miller’s influence could resurface in a second Trump term, possibly leading to more restrictive OPT policies.\n\nhttps://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-news/trumps-win-impact-on-h-1b-visa-and-legal-immigration-will-he-live-up-to-his-green-card-promise-101730880550564.html\n\nWere you around in 2016 when he was talking about H1B visas?",

You don’t want to buy high and sell low.  Everyone is so pro AI. And I agree AI is great.  But,  it’s not like it’s the invention of the computer,  or the invention of the internet.  Machine learning has been a thing since some of the first computers.  A chip company shouldn’t be worth more than the company that makes the computers the chip is in.  It’s as if good year tires are worth more than Toyota cars.  To me it stinks of fraud.",
