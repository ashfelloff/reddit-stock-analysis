Come on. Google only costs $5 per search. (wait, you guys are searching for free?)\n\n‚Ä¢ Reaction gifs are fucking lame. Put that shit in a comment, no one wants to look at your face in real life anyways so why are you making a thread about it.\n\n‚Ä¢ Don't repost stuff. All of us are terminally online, how dare you try and make us laugh with an image posted somewhere else. Jokes aside, we don't want to beat a joke to death, so give us some fresh OC and we'll be a lot cheerier.",

Shortterm yes we could go to 6000-6200 in the S&P 500 especially since it is an election year but above 6000 the air gets really, really thin.\n\nAlso remember that the S&P 500 made 14.66% every year since the 2008 low.\n\nSince inception it made only 7.6%.\n\nSomething has to give.\n\nWe are an older nation. I saw somewhere that population growth is close to 0%. Our national debt is through the roof and quantitative easing causes inflation.\n\nTimes are different.\n\nWe will all make money but not by blindly calling everybody a gay bear who points out that times are indeed different.",
