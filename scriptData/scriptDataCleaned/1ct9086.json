We were actively watching breakthroughs in real time; Exxon with biofuels, BP with solar, Shell with wind energy, etc (I may not have these exactly right, but every company had some pet tech they were pursuing). Then one by one they came out and said something along the lines of “[this green tech] is not sustainable.” It was wild how quickly the hopes for a better future just got shut down. Right around the time fracking got huge, which opened up vast reserves that had previously been too difficult or expensive to exploit. Weird, really.

It's only a matter of time before the upright citizen cums first instead of last, and drops the upside down one. The only way for the upright to cum first, is to fuck your own hand, that's right. Fuck yourself. Never rely on the upside down, they just want you to keep sucking their crotch forever. They're all teeth and no gums, they won't ever swallow your load. But you can cum first, you will, the solution is in your hands.\nRule 99: never make your moves during business hours.\nRule 100: round up, double down, and zoom out. \nRule 1: always leave the concert while the music is still playing\nRule 2: never double dip\nRule 3: don't be afraid to break a rule, but only after hours\nRule 7: it's all bullshit really, a bubble in a garden hose, bulging here or there when and where, forget the bubble, or even the water. Don't follow the hose back, or worry about who turns it on and off, you're the grass. You know who makes it RAIN.",
