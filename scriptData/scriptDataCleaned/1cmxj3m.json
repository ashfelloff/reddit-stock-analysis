Note that the price is significantly above $10 now, so there's going to be no redemptions.\n\n(\"The following table illustrates varying ownership levels in the Post-Closing Company immediately following the consummation of the business combination\")\n\n    Oklo stockholders 78,996,459 shares = 64.7%\n\n    Sponsor 13,950,000 shares = 11.4%\n\t​ \t​ \t\n    AltC public stockholders 29,150,521 shares = 23.9%\n\nTotal 122,096,980 100.0%\n\t​ \t​ \t​ \t​ \t​ \t\n\n\n​I'm still trying to understand the share lockups. Presumably a majority of the shares listed in the table can't be immediately sold after the ticker change. There's 3 different Lock-Up agreements:\n\n>  “Lock-Up Periods” means the Company Shareholder Lock-Up Period, the Insider Lock-Up Period and the Sponsor Lock-Up Period. \n\nThe Insider Lock-Up Period looks like this:\n\n> “Insiders” means Jacob Dewitte, Caroline Cochran, and Hydrazine Capital II, L.P.\n“Insider Lock-Up Period” means the following lock-up periods:\n> (a)   with respect to 40% of the Lock-Up Shares, the period from the Closing Date to the earlier to occur of (i) the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for twenty (20) Trading Days within any sixty (60) consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing Date;\n> (b)   with respect to 30% of the Lock-Up Shares, the period from the Closing Date to the earlier to occur of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds $14.00 per share for twenty (20) Trading Days within any sixty (60) consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing Date; and\n> (c)   with respect to 30% of the Lock-Up Shares, the period from the Closing Date to the earlier to occur of (i) the thirty-six (36) month anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the closing price of Common Stock equals or exceeds $16.00 per share for twenty (20) trading days within any sixty (60) consecutive Trading Day period following the Closing. \n\nThe Company Shareholder Lock-Up Period (I assume for Oklo shareholders) seems to be a 180 day lockup:\n\n> “Company Shareholder Lock-Up Period” means the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending at 11:59 pm Eastern Time on the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date. \n\nThe lockup agreement seems to be needlessly complex though:\n\n> Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement and the Sponsor Agreement, after the consummation of the business combination and subject to certain exceptions, (i) the holders of shares of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock issued as consideration pursuant to the business combination are restricted from selling or transferring such shares for a period that begins at the Closing and that ends on the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date and (ii) each of the Insiders and certain key pre-Closing holders of Oklo capital stock, including Oklo’s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Hydrazine Capital, have agreed not to transfer (a) 40% of such holder’s shares for a period of 12 months after the Closing, unless the closing share price of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share for 20 trading days within any 60 consecutive trading day period commencing after the Closing Date, (b) 30% of such holder’s shares for a period of 24 months after the Closing, unless the closing share price of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock equals or exceeds $14.00 per share for 20 trading days within any 60 consecutive trading day period commencing after the Closing Date and (c) 30% of such holder’s shares for a period of 36 months after the Closing, unless the closing share price of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock equals or exceeds $16.00 per share for 20 trading days within any 60 consecutive trading day period commencing after the Closing Date. However, following the expiration of such lock-up periods, the Sponsor and the other lock-up parties will not be restricted from selling the Post-Closing Company securities held by them, other than by applicable securities laws. As such, sales of a substantial number of shares of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock in the public market could occur at any time. These sales, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of Post-Closing Company Class A common stock. \n\nThere's the wording \"subject to certain exceptions\" that I don't like, since I have no clue if the exceptions are already outlined in the paragraph or are to be found somewhere else in the document.",
