(investors will normalize yield to their expectations for the industry)\n\nIf benefiting management is the problem then the solution is to decrease stock-based compensation  which opens a different can of worms entirely.\n\npersonally i think the problem is excessive short-term-ism in compensation.  Boeing management wants to pump the stock on 1-5 year timescale  so they outsource, cut QA, and don't invest in new airframes.   but a company like Boeing needs to  manage its R&D investment on a 20-30 year timescale.   its too easy for senior execs cut and run  (with a golden parachute).  Increasing deferred compensation is a hard problem  but would go a long way to creating healthier incentives.",
