Important thing is that California isn't a monolith and neither are Californians. I lean left and I know there's a ton of ways Elon is a shithead, but it doesn't mean I have to hate all parts of him or I can't admire his contributions via his companies. I'm a fan how Elon bought out my TWTR shares at the 2022 bottoms but it doesn't mean I think it's a good idea for him to do it (he overpaid and has weak pullout game). Him donating to Trump really pisses me off so I'm rethinking about buying that model 3/Y but it's his money just like how my money is my money. Also I can dislike Elon pulling companies away from California but also understand WHY he does it: higher taxes, lots of regulation, lots of bureaucracy/redtape, etcetcetc. Problem for me is Tesla makes the best EVs, I don't like how Rivians look, and I don't want another ICE engine war so I'm in limbo right now with my purchase (thinking it's better to gamble my money on small caps than buying a car).\n\nTL;DR UWM/TNA 🚀",
