  "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nMight remember me from back in may (check my last post…not sure how to pin it or do anything like that, i barely use reddit). Posted a big loss for me after a hefty big win. Asked for advice and I got a lot of solid, sound help from you all.\n\nTook some a week to compose myself as I was in a really bad place and needed to step away and breathe. Thank you for all the love….and the hate. Honestly needed all of that to give myself a reality check.\n\nSo much context of my trading experience and general life experience was missed in that post….don’t even still care to delve into the details. Point is, i have not given up. I’ve recouped a few thousand safely placing trades and mitigating my risk the way I knew to do before my quick gambling hurdle. Just wanted to say im doing ok and appreciate anyone who reached out. It’s gonna take me some time to get back what I lost but i’ve got my mental health back in place and am patiently celebrating the small wins along the way! (Also yes i did add funds to my account, but im still net green from may 🙇‍♂️)\n\nCheers all, ama. 😘🙏🏼",
