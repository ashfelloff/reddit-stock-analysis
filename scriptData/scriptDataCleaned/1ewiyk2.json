                  "body": "Dude you are clearly lost. Let me give you the best advice here. Sell now and secure your gains. Don't try to play earnings. The entire world is expecting Nvidia to explode (the good kind) on earnings. With that kind of expectation, even if they blow earnings out of the water, the stock can still go down as people start wanting to secure their gains. If you try to roll to a Aug 30 call IV is gonna crush you because you don't know what you are doing. The time to buy Aug 30 calls was 2-3 weeks ago.\n\nWhile I do think Nvidia is a pretty safe bet, nothing is guaranteed, and you can easily get recked. For context, I didn't even read your second paragraph there when I concluded you didn't know what you were doing. It's just the fact that you asked that question in the first place that exposed you're new.\n\nA great way to try and start learning imo is using robinhood to add options to your watch list and then monitor how stocks with upcoming earnings have their option premiums fluctuate.",
