  "selftext": "The importance of buying young, great companies is something everyone knows, but few people actually do it or really care. The truth is that in the market you earn more by investing in young, transformative and disruptive companies, which offer unique services; they also must be capable of being leaders in what they offer and they must have proven this.\n\n  \nLarge companies take years to build, or decades, and in the meantime the stock is subject to significant fluctuations for various reasons, rates at historic highs that weigh on valuations, wars, uncertainty, etc..\n\nThe key is to let the business grow, year after year, not by focusing on the stock, but on the continuous progress of the company's business, remaining invested for years or even decades.\n\nTo quote Buffet: \"The market is a system of redistribution of wealth, it takes away from those who don't have patience to give to those who have it\"\n\nScreenshot from the last quarter :\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y7q4x5fbufjd1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=26f79461aab7170805299856bfd3922c1101de9e\n\nAs mentioned in the last call, margins will increase in the next year and I will cite some reasons that lead me to be sure of this:\n\n* Constant growth in Elite membership (70% gross margin at current membership price of $3.50/month, expected to return to $5), I estimate they will exceed 100K by the end of the year (100k x5$/mounth = 500k/mounth + CCI + Fastlender technology license, all 3 with > 70% gross margin)\n* Completion of Fastlender installations and license sale (high margin Saas model) expected in Q3\n* The continued increase in market share in Canada and the reduction of competitors will allow HITI to increase prices and therefore gross margins\n* Increase in white label products / elite inventory\n* Recovery in demand for CBD products starting in Q4\n* More favorable regulatory conditions in Canada\n* Profitability achieved\n\nHigh tide offers hundreds of items of different categories, and can boast of the best global brands.\n\n* SMOKE CARTEL – WORLD’S MOST POPULAR ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM1\n* DANKSTOP – ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM (DankStop is one of the foremost online retailers of consumption accessories in the US)\n* GRASSCITY - WORLD’S OLDEST ONLINE CONSUMPTION ACCESSORIES PLATFORM\n* BLESSED CBD – LEADING UK CBD BRAND\n* FAB CBD – LEADING US CBD BRAND\n* NuLeaf Naturals – AMERICA’S PREMIER CANNABINOID COMPANY\n* DAILY HIGH CLUB - The world’s number one stoner subscription box\n\nThe constant addition of high-quality properties will ensure a growing and constant flow of revenue. The fact that a store generates on average 2.3X the revenue of its competitor is a testament to the winning model that Hiti has.\n\nWith only 181 stores, out of over 3600 currently present in Canada (as of June 2024) Hiti holds over 10% of the market share, growing.\n\n$HITI just reached 1.5M members in its Cabana Club loyalty program.\n\nSince launching its discount model in October 2021, membership has increased by over 400%\n\nHigh Tide is capturing market share every single quarter, both from competitors and illicit sellers.\n\nIn less than three years, the company's market share grew from under 4% to 10.9%, and it is well-positioned to reach 20% over the next two years.\n\n**Pr :** [**https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-surpasses-1-5-million-cabana-club-members/**](https://hightideinc.com/high-tide-surpasses-1-5-million-cabana-club-members/)\n\nWith the long-term goal of 300 stores, it is highly likely that the high tide will exceed 30% of the market in the long term, considering the continuous store closures due to margin battles and the constant increase in visibility of Canna cabana.\n\n**latest company presentation :** [https://hightideinc.com/presentation/](https://hightideinc.com/presentation/)",
