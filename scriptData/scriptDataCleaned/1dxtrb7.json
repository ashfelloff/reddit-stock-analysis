I paid back that margin owed over the past few years and I have put this chapter behind me. It really sucked and I sincerely wish no one ever goes through something like this. \n\nBut most of you asked if I had any lessons learned from my trading debacle. These are my personal thoughts and you can agree or disagree, I do not care.\n\nNO there is no TL;DR.\n\n1. Only invest the amount you’re okay losing or the amount you won’t be needing for the next 2-3 years\n\n2. Do not trade options unless you really understand it well, or unless you want to simply gamble. Learn about the Greeks, and IV CRUSH AROUND EARNINGS. Buying both sides of the trade is no guarantee you’ll make money.\n\n3. Always take gains (small consistent gains are better than chasing 10 baggers in the long run)\n\n4. Cut your losers early (do not average down like a regard)\n\n5. Being an options seller is somewhat better in the long run\n\n6. Long term mindset is the way to go\n\n7. There’s always another play\n\n8. No shame in quitting trading if you are not doing well\n\n9. Never enable margin trading. Trade with your own cash (and limit that cash to point 1)\n\n10. You can hunt for value plays, but there are certain value plays that can make or break your portfolio. Mine broke my portfolio \n\n11. Do not chase a hype train, unless you really believe it’s the next best thing in the world\n\n12. NEVER look back and see what a trade you have already exited would’ve been, this one thing will mess with all your future trades. If you’ve exited, just move on, don’t keep tracking it thinking it would’ve netted you another 100% or so\n\nI will edit the post to add more points if I remember them. \n\nHope no one ever loses money.",

I would not take advice from people on Reddit about getting sober, particularly because they’re honed in more on no-God than actual recovery, whether they know it or not, and often have unresolved issues that they do not realize and are not addressing. \n\nAs far as secular recovery goes: there is SMART recovery, LifeRing, Moderation Management, Refuge Recovery, “12 step meetings” not part of AA, Recovery Dharma, etc etc but most importantly: look into medically assisted recovery. The Sinclair method and similar treatments have had a lot of success. I personally think that, some form of therapy, and some kind of meetings to establish community and a place to talk with other people who aren’t therapists is the winning combo.\n\nBut keep in mind AA doesn’t require you to believe in an almighty God. The program can be your higher power, love can be it, anything. It just requires you to believe in something bigger than yourself, which is really the point. Going to AA meetings without guidance and doing it on one’s own often leads to people missing out on a key fact- you don’t have to treat it like religion, just use it as a general guideline and find what works for you. Some people are hardcore into rules and whatnot and that works for them. Others don’t need that, and in fact I think most alcoholics don’t respond well to too many rules and lectures.",

IMO if you want to hold on to position because you have high conviction, just buy the shares outright or get a contract with a long term expiration date. Holding on the Weekly or even Monthly contracts that are ITM in hopes to get more is just asking to lose. Too many traders who were ITM, got greedy, and in short order lost their entire value or significant value of the contract. \n\nThe biggest issue is a ton of people want to hit the “unicorn” options play when majority have not even shown an ability to be consistently profitable in the first place.",

Trading and going over old trades are two different activities, and you don't want to let emotions come into your trading space. Seeing a trade where you were closed out and then it went in your direction is a sickner, and can see one revenge trade or do a \"just fuck it\" trade. \n\nNot wanting to look at the post trade is related to not being able to deal with the emotion of your actions, whether they were right, or to what extent they were wrong. And I get it, I find that too. But I still take time (when I'm not trading) to look over and analyse trades in their entirety.",
