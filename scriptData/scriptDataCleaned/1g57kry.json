              "body": "Is NVDA overvalued? Eventually. You have to look at this as a once in a generation infrastructure deployment cycles. Video game graphics cards are a great and appropriate comparison. Today, every major company uses integrated graphics. They just discovered 3d accelerators like 3dfx, Radeon, and nvda cards. Everyone will spend years upgrading. Eventually, when everyone has a good solution installed, the upgrade cycle will slow.\n\nExactly like video cards. Going from integrated to 3dGPUs was a major leap for gamers. But once you have the GeForce 1000 or w/e,  you don't' immediately upgrade to the 2000 series. Maybe you wait for the 3000 series, or even the 4000. The cost/benefit ratio doesn't make sense. And when we reach that point, NVDA will level off or even drop.\n\nCloud/Hyper-scalers don't upgrade with every new NVDA iteration. That's dumb and financially unsustainable. META can't spend $100 billion a year on NVDA chips.\n\nBut they also can't afford to fall behind. What is more realistic, for example, is they will upgrade 20% of their hardware per year. Essentially, a complete refresh every 5 years. That is the cyclical nature of semi-conductors.\n\nBut in the meantime, essentially only 7 of the 500 largest US companies are getting the cards. The other 493 are sitting on their hands waiting for their chance. Foreign government wants them. The US military wants them, etc.\n\nRight now, we are going through an industrial revolution of sorts. The deployment will probably take 10-20 years and cost trillions. People don't even know what to do with this shit yet. Just think back to the internet: When it started it was all myspace, corporation's shitty websites, eBay, and porn. 30 years later.... Well, I guess there's still a lot of porn...\n\nBut you can also order food, buy a car, buy a house, bank, broadcast a TV show, find a spouse, buy a spouse, create a radio station, attend meetings, send gifts, play games with 1000s of people at the same time, watch every movie or tv show ever made, gamble, take college classes, and so on.\n\nThe true genius of AI is still undiscovered.
