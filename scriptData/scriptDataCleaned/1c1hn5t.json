I can't envision either presidential outcome affecting that prediction either. While I am not copping out and saying vaguely that Boeing will be propped up or bailed out enough to survive this current stock valuation, the larger economy / system is too holistically sclerotic to attempt or try to pull off an effective nationalization and/or privatization. \n\n\nI have no good answer as to what the stock or company's future plausibly is however. Concurrent to Boeing's now much more public but long running issues are the myriad similar quality control and safety issues amongst freight/cargo companies in rail/trucking/naval-shipping. The East Palestine Ohio train crash and the ongoing Baltimore bridge shipping vessel collision story, alongside the Boeing clusterfuck, paint a horryfying scene across transportation widely. (Boeing is also, I know, much larger and doing more varied things than just transportation-related business.*)",
