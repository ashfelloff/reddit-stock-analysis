I looked at NVDA, CHWY, LULU, ULTA for stock investments and options trading and I'm feeling like I could make the greatest return on CHWY with both stocks and options. I'd consider buying puts on CRWD, CRM, BBY, FL, etc but I am wanting to make it easy for myself and invest it all on as few moves as possible (1-2 stock investments, 1-2 options). \n\nI was considering calls 8/30 127 CHWY 250 contracts, the rest in CHWY stock versus 8/30 127 CHWY 200 contracts, NVDA 50k and the rest in CHWY stock. Nvidia is, for good reason, getting all the news, but CHWY's 1/5 of the stock value gives me the hope that I could make relatively the same or more if I just invest in CHWY with stocks and options. I have 4 months experience and honestly have broken even in my personal investing (lost 12k, gained 12k, and have 100k in ETF investments). \n\nWhat would you guys do in this YOLO situation?
