These promotions allowed their bosses to justify their promos and more importantly, create loyal minions. \n\nThere are sadly also some amazing managers there but the promo game is biased to reward politicking and gaming metrics, instead of things like team health, employee satisfaction, researching actual impactful product market fit and improving the customer experience. \n\nFor example, a common trick employed which would always result in a promo: invent a bs metric that you know you can easily crush - regardless if it has any real impact on the business - then spin it to justify how it’s needed and leverage your cronies to also help you sell it making it seem convincing. \n\nThis distasteful practice is not what awesome engineers and great manager want to do.

Terminate on shoddy grounds, get sued (yes, he got sued once).\n* Have HR reject the concept of objective reality when employees complain, saying \"different people can have different views of events\" when presented incontrovertible evidence of wrongdoing, such as possession of confidential information about other employees.\n* Retaliate against the people who reported your extreme misconduct to HR.\n* Get glowing reviews from all your cronies, get promoted *again* after the lawsuit and getting caught sharing confidential information.\n\nHow the fuck I made it six years there is a mystery to me.

That said, what we saw in 2020 and continue to see in homelessness and suffering on the streets, doesn’t invite people to want to live, work, and shop there.  \n\nI travelled to Southern California last week.  I come out as often as possible, but I hadn’t been since summer 2019.  I went from LAX to SilverLake, stopping at a Target for a few items.  That store was pure dystopia, locked down and essentially underground.  I know the reasons why.  \n\nI took off from there and travelled a ways down to Dana Point, CA, where I was staying.  Totally different universe.  \n\nPeople don’t want to exist anywhere near the suffering of our cities.  They want to be away from it.  But, there does exist an infrastructure in those places, that’s propped up by people who spend, not steal.  When no one is left in an urban center but the poor, the addicted, the mentally ill, that doesn’t bode well for business and for municipal revenues.  \n\nMy example is far too nuanced.  I know there are a lot of rich fucking people who live in Los Angeles proper, and they keep the wheels turning.  Problem is, the policies and conditions have now created so many who get trapped under those wheels.  \n\nIt’s a BIG conversation.  Upvoting you for truth.",

Of course that is far easier said than done.
