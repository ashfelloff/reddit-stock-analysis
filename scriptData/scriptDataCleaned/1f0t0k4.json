Yeah you are right, quarterlies do not look great. Also not yet terrible given the relatively solid balance sheet and especially cash reserves but those won't last forever.\n\nThen again, YTD revenues fell only slightly and same is true for COGS. The main cost driver were nearly 1b restructuring costs. But last years Q2 reports had huge tax provision earnings of 2.2b which resulted in a positive income. So given that, it might be that intel didn't look great for over a year already. \n\nWell, I retract my earlier statement now I actually looked into it and not only talked out of my ass :D Pardon me xD",
