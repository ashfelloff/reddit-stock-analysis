Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made further progress toward the Committee's 2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the Committee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate.*\r  \n\r  \n*In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5 percent. In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage‑backed securities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its 2 percent objective.*\r  \n\r  \n*In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.*\r  \n\r  \n*Voting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, Vice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Lisa D. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and Christopher J. Waller. Voting against this action was Michelle W. Bowman, who preferred to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point at this meeting.*",

                      "body": "I think the issue is that the markets wanted cuts sooner and were pressing hard for them to happen meeting after meeting. The parts of the economy that were heavily rate dependent have waited too long plus government debt payments needed relief. \n\nI suspect the 50 basis cut now is tailored to solve several problems at once. First people who lean towards being scared will run out and buy bonds even more. That will help government interest payments substantially. Second the cut will help the rate sensitive parts of the economy that have been on life support for quite some time. Third cutting by 50 over 25 might be just enough to avoid a recession. I know everyone expects a recession with that kind of cut, but I dont think we are getting a recession.\n\nI think we are having a massive rotation from pre pandemic economy to post pandemic economy with a lot of turmoil. Plenty of businesses and people will lose out with this adjustment but a lot of others will come out ahead. Specifically office buildings and businesses along commuter corridors that depend upon that traffic will suffer. Meanwhile small, lean, and local businesses will do well near homes.",

And yes, the alternative to fixing that is to spend less, but to cut that much spending (it would have to be drastic, like a minimum of 25% of the entire budget) would decimate the US economy since federal jobs would be slashed, and anything depending on federal spending (academic research, subsidies for electric vehicles, you name it) would be hit harder than anything we've seen in recent memory.\n\nThis country has a serious spending problem, and making money cheap/free to borrow is exacerbating it.  Basically it's a temporary solution that actually makes the problem worse but just delays it.\n\nWhat ultimately causes a recession is when someone can't pay, and this happens all the time.  But at some point, it turns out that payment causes a cascade of payment failures because the entity owed the money cannot absorb the loss (and ultimately has a cascading effect, part of the reason banks are all consolidating right now), and when everything is built on a mountain of bad debt you realize the house of cards was always going to collapse.\n\nAnd no, this is unique to now, because before 1999 Glass-Steagall existed, and the bailouts from 2008 effectively hampered how bad the fallout was really going to be.  In 2023 when the banks were failing they got a quiet bailout with BTFP, and not all of that money has been paid back yet.  If you value banks by their paper assets, almost all of them are deeply upside-down right now.  And back in 2020 the reserve requirements were set to zero, which means banks aren't required to hold any cash relative to their assets.  I don't know when or even what will happen, I can just say the problem isn't just getting worse - it's accelerating.\n\nAnyway, enjoy the ride while stonks are flying because this next crash really is going to be the worst one of our lifetimes.",

Lower interest rates means its easier for banks to loan money and then loan this money out to consumers and business at a low rate itself.\n\nFor example lets take a FED rate of 5%. No commercial bank will then extend loans to consumers/businesses for lower than 5% because otherwise it will lose money on its loans. So usually its 1-2% higher than the FED rate. Again overly simplified.\n\n\nNow this interest rates affects loans but also rates on a savings account. Higher interest loans means its less appealing to loan money. Higher interest rates on savings accounts means its more appealing to store money than spending.\n\nPurchasing power is probably a poor word on my part because thats more related to inflation rather than what I mean. Higher interest rates just mean people are less likely to spend. Because its more expensive to loan money and more appealing to store money in a savings account. A quick example is. Would you rather have a mortgage with a 2% interest or a 30% interest. At 30% you are less likely to take that loan because its insanely expensive.",

I could see a nuke going off in Ukraine or something similar being the \"FEAR\" catalyst this cutting cycle.\n\nThose raving about CPI ballooning post-cuts do not seem to consider that energy prices are still falling, Brent is down about 10% in the past month. The housing market is also about to start deflating in certain regions and as places like Florida accelerate downwards (FL is particularly vulnerable due to their Surfside induced HOA/condo crisis), that panic should also spread. I do not see a 2008 occurring as we have had much stricter lending standards since then, but deflating costs for buyers and falling rents would be the final hammer on CPI (which has yet to drop), and that falling hammer is partially guided by falling rates which make housing less expensive by virtue of lower mortgage costs.\n\nOnce YoY shelter hits 0, we are likely to see annual CPI hit that mark shortly thereafter, whenever annual CPI has hit 0 in past it has coincided with Fed Funds hitting 0 as well.",
