ETF's are basically force bagholders and are not as reactionary. Looking at SPY holdings, currently they are growing the total shares owned by the ETF at a rate of 2.78%. This is all well and good but, when less money is being invested in the ETF's they must sell shares to provide the liquidity. ETF's do provide retail with a way to get out before it gets really bad, but once the ball is put into motion, it will be hard to stop.\n\nThe SPY tracks the S&P 500, but does so by holding shares of those companies. Effectively taking them out of circulation. It seems odd, that they are buying and holding what they are supposed to track. Hence why the stock market only goes upppp, as long as we feed that beast.",
