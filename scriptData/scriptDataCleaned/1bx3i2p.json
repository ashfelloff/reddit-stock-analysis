  "title": "Why tf did Kashkari talk about interest rate in a random interview if it was not scheduled on fed calendar?",
  "score": 201,
  "selftext": "[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm)\n\nObviously interest rate has very strong effects on the market as we saw and that's why it's embargoed and based on a deliberate release calendar. Instead this random ass interview on 4/4 randomly talks about interest rate policy to crash the market by mentioning possibly of no rate cut which is drastically different than the expected 3 rate cuts this year that the chair Powell confirmed in an official release a couple weeks ago. How is this not market manipulation when even they recognize it needs to be embargoed behind a release calendar.  \n\n\nIs there no enforcement or criminal liability for this?  \n\n\nWhy don't he just tell his friends to buy puts and then crash the market this way?",

First, the market has shrugged off most of noise from the Middle East the past 18 months - so this being any different is odd.  Second, volumes look like they decreased rather dramatically so it wasn’t really a selling frenzy showing people selling any news until the S&P headed towards a loss on the day.\n\nSomeone else mentioned a fund pulling out - I don’t think it was a fund, but a market maker that got out of the way.  The way that the volumes don’t pick up until the drop really sets in shows a lot of hesitation which is odd to say the least.  My guess is that they thought it was a liquidity glitch and then everyone reacted too late.\n\nOn that same note, you see volume slip at the earthquake happened on Friday and the market took a drop then before recovering.

It’s not necessarily a new thing but the market is still confirming it is expected.  If there was any lack of conviction, the spread would be decreasing and the inversion reversing.\n\nBasically the bond market is creating a Mexican standoff with the Fed.  If the Fed decides it does not want to cut, the rate spread would decrease, if not inverse again, which would potentially cause another run at the regional banks (as they would have to take writedowns on existing 10 yr bonds due to the lower yields they would be holding as new bonds would be higher), and mortgage rates would shoot up another 1% which would in turn raise PCE pushing the Fed further away from their goal.\n\nPowell’s best move now is to keep applying rhetoric to control the markets while trying to build consensus.  So Kashkari can say whatever he wants - he’s not even voting this year, Powell has been toeing the line by explicitly repeating now that he expects cuts this year.  The market doesn’t care when, so long as it happens at some point.  If it doesn’t happen in June, the bond market may start to lose its conviction though.  Because the bond market has it priced in, the actual Fed rate doesn’t matter as much as the 10 yr benchmark rate is already down 1%.  Cutting the Fed rate won’t really move that much.  The first cut is purely symbolic from a rate perspective.\n\nThe only thing worse than getting bitched at for making cuts at during the last 90 days of an election year is causing a bank run at that same time.  The Fed is aware of unemployment, they know what the market has priced in, and Powell knows he can’t will the market to think any differently.  Goolsbee is on board, Mester is on board, Bostic I don’t think is far behind, Bowman is a lost cause (she didn’t even mention the second half of the Fed’s mandate - unemployment - when she ran her mouth), and Williams will come around when he gets bitched out by Dimon.  At this point Dimon I doubt wants or needs another gift from the Feds to absorb another bank.  Barkin is aware of the unemployment side though his view is hawkish - he is at least aware.  If his thesis is wrong, he’s an easy flip.  The others that vote fall in line with Powell pretty easily.\n\nTLDR; the bond market has the rate cuts priced in, and if it doesn’t get it, the market is telling Powell you can kiss your soft landing goodbye.",

Mortgages, commercial loans, CDs, etc.. all based on these rates.  There is no cut expected at the next meeting.  June is still on the table and most reasonable to do 25bp still since it won’t really change anything - the market has it priced in the bond market.\n\nIf they don’t cut it in June, they will need to come out and explicitly call out the cut otherwise it could be a bloodbath.  The most logical times then are in Sept and December still.  The market will need some assurance it is actually coming and Powell will have the cajones to do it during an election cycle.\n\nThe problem then becomes the depth of the cut.  If they don’t do June, they could basically destroy the summer home buying season which would mean a 50bp cut right off the bat, which wouldn’t be the best thing in the world.  Instead of small cuts, they’ll be making larger ones to try to keep the market from a complete stumble.  This will probably be the biggest argument for the June cut. 25bp in June is positive but not a news maker - it’s maintenance. 50bp in Sept/December means the Fed fell asleep at the wheel and is trying to prevent a recession (which ironically has a 50/50 chance in 2025 since the Fed tends to be late to the party - so to a point the market does expect them to screw this up).",

That’s the biggest part the Fed is concerned about.  Volatiles like energy hurt the number but those aren’t as big of a concern as the core PCE values and they’ve been targeting housing specially now for months and it’s been a tough nut to crack.\n\nThe other problem is by end of 2024 the CRE loan issue goes in to full swing. They’ll need to trim rates to keep the banks propped up to avoid every Regional from becoming insolvent as the losses stack up.  A run on the stocks is just as bad if not worse than an actual bank run.\n\nThe hot jobs number is not as hot when you look at the data closely. Two things have happened - 1) Older people have left and aren’t coming back so no longer count as they aren’t participating and 2) Full time employment went down while part time employment went up.  These two things make a hot jobs top line number not as hot and the Fed can read the nuance of that pretty well.  Legal immigration has kept jobs filled, but main street is beginning to buckle - the Black unemployment data is somewhat eye catching.\n\nAn increase at this point would be suicide as it would cause a regional bank run with the CRE loan issue right around the corner.  Housing is unaffordable as is and a rate increase actually makes it worse.  The Fed’s mandate is dual - it’s inflation AND employment.  Powell has said he wants to see a downward trend and other Fed Govs have said they could live with inflation above 2%.  That’s really the long term reality.  The other Central Banks are going to start cutting. If the Fed only focuses on the 2% number, they would need 10% unemployment for a full year to get it - and that’s not really possible.",
