You guessed it.\n\nAnd with the market willing to accept that Gyna's crazy stimulus will help their economy, one can only deduce that oil should also run as the economy should be projected for more growth etc.\n\nOXY, Buffet's biggest holding, is lower than his cost average. This should be a layup as market projects more oil demand from china. We also have geopolitical issues, ie, Israel trying to start WWIII. I think oil is a layup\n\nOXY 55 C 10/18 OXY 5C C 10/4\n\nEdit: Shit. This blew up. Last two DD's have been right. Highlighted Chinese stocks and PLTR. Let's see if it's 3/3\n\nYou all can suck it.
