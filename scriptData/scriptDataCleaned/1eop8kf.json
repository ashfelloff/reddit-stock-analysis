LUMN was up ~35% by open the other morning; I saw it and placed a small bet thinking it wouldn't go much higher.  it was up ~100% at close; I saw it and threw in a little more thinking it wouldn't go much higher again.  it was up 220% an hour later.  a fucking sitter.  could have drastically changed my family's future in a couple clicks and I missed it.  driving me fucking insane.  what do you guys do to cope with shit like that?\n",

(NYSE:LUMN) Shares Could Be 50% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate\n* stock stays at around 2.0\n\n**08/05/24 (one day before earning report)**\n\n* Lumen announced $5 billion in AI-related deals, as well as $7 billion in new potential deals\n* stock jumped from 2.6 to 3.5 went above 4 and closed around 3.9\n\nThis is where you went in.  \nNow at this point you could've did what took me 10 min and gather this data, then take a couple of hours to do a deep dive into their finances, find out if there's anything known about recent buyers etc.  \nOr you could've just say \"this is to much work - I know to little about this stock to say because the stock market is going down, this stock will too\".  \nBut in true fashion of this sub you coin flipped, decides this must be a fluke of the marked and put your money into the stock falling again.\n\n**08/06/24**\n\n* Earning Report: Lumen's bottom line missed expectations, the company actually beat expectations for revenue.\n* CEO Kate Johnson's announcement of a $1 billion cost-cutting program by 2027\n* stock goes as high as 9.2 and averages out between 5 - 6 currently sitting at 5.6. \n\n\nEdit: **I'm am NOT a financial advisor and this must NOT be seen as investment advice!**  \n\n\n*I comment once in this sub - ONCE and someone dms me about tips on how to learn about stocks/markets etc. I reply saying it takes time, read up on things, don't buy anything yet and that he shouldn't just blindly follow anyone's advice.  \nWhat does he do?  \nBuy LUMN. A stock that just gained 300% over the last 2 weeks.  \nTo anyone who read this post and then bought LUMN as if it were some kind of dark horse: Good luck on monday. I hope you pay dearly*",

The fact is everyday dozens of companies post double digit gains and it doesn’t bother us that we missed them because we’re unaware of them.  Every single day we are all missing opportunities, and they will always be there, again and again, every day.  Take a month off from the market, and you feel just fine, but when you’re staring at your monitor watching stock price rise, suddenly FOMO hits hard.   Nothing is different in outcome, but with one you’re in ignorant bliss and the other you’re kicking yourself.  Just relax.  There will be chances for solid gains every day.  Slow and steady is better than a high volatile trade that risks ruin.",
